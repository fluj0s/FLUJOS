tax policy debates distributional analysis may address several issues how should the tax burden be distributed or are progressive increasing as share of income as income rises taxes justified what is the estimated distribution of the current system how does particular proposal change that distribution unlike many analyses that study optimal behavior related to allocative issues and economic efficiency economic analysis cannot be used to answer the questions of how the tax burden should be distributed such an answer would depend on social preferences economic analysis can however identify tradeoffs and frame the issue analytically for example number of plausible answers to this question could justify progressive tax structures methodological issues such as the income classifier the unit of analysis and assumptions regarding incidence all affect the estimates of the distribution of the current tax burden yet all show similar qualitative result the federal tax system is progressive throughout its range although it tends to get much flatter at the top this pattern is primarily due to the individual income tax which is quite progressive and actually provides subsidies at lower income levels the other major tax is the payroll tax which is larger burden than the individual income tax for more than 80 of the population this tax is first progressive and then regressive effective tax rates fall with income the corporate income and the estate taxes while much smaller are also progressive while excise taxes are regressive this overall progressive pattern has been in place historically and is expected to continue in the future although effective tax rates are currently low compared to other periods unlike the federal tax system state and local taxes tend to be regressive thus progressive federal tax system would be necessary to prevent overall us taxes from being regressive the combined taxes appear slightly progressive look ing at taxes from lifetime perspective would move the system more towards proportional tax because average lifetime incomes reduces the variability of income studies have suggested that overall lifetime taxes are roughly proportional to income many different measures have been used to characterize the effects of particular tax change on the distribution of income one may obtain very different impression of tax changes depending on the measure used one popular measure the percentage change in tax can be misleading because as taxes become very small even neglig ible absolute change in taxes leads to very large percentage change for measuring the relative distribution of income percentage change in disposable income provides better measures of how resources are distributed by this measure the recent tax cuts made incomes less equal this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32693g6g146g156g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g22g138g161 g561g4g158g155g141g142

tax legislation while economic analysis can be used to estimate the distribution of the tax system or tax change positive or descriptive analysis it cannot be used to provide normative or prescriptive analysis descriptive analyses indicate the expected effects of policies but normative analyses indicate the optimal policy most normative analysis in economics is focused on efficiency even in the case of distribution issues however economic analysis can be used to facilitate the understanding of desirable distributions measure them correctly and determine the implications of different assumptions about social welfare for the optimal distribution of the tax burden the first section of this report which is normative in nature therefore discusses different philosophies about how the tax burden should be distributed and what those philosophies imply for the shape of the tax system in particular it addresses the question of the justifications for progressive tax system one where the share of income collected as tax rises as income rises this section is presented for the interested reader but is not necessary preliminary to examining the analysis in the second section which presents estimates of the distribution of the federal and total us tax burden the third section of the report discusses the measures that can be used to characterize the distributional effects of tax

are two separate albeit related questions about tax burden distribution one of them is how to pay for the goods that the government provides such as national defense or highways the second issue is whether the tax system should be used for direct income redistribution in that case the optimal tax burden depends on the degree to which redistribution is deemed desirable

even if an economy had redistribution it would be necessary to provide public goods such as defense roads etcand to determine how taxes should be collected to pay for these goods public good in its purest form is one that each person can enjoy without detracting from anyone elses consumption and where there is way to exclude person from enjoying it as result of the last effect in most cases such goods would not be provided by the private market or would not be provided efficiently many goods are not pure public goods but have aspects of public goods in that person benefits from person bs expendituresuch quasipublic goods or goods with positive external effects would be provided in the private economy but not in sufficient amounts to supply these and pure public goods it is necessary to raise revenues through taxes and distribute the resultant taxes burden somehow among the societys members the distribution of the tax burden with respect to taxpayers incomes may be characterized as progressive proportional or regressive the behavior of the effective tax ratethe share of income paid in taxesdetermines this classi fication if the share rises with income the distribution is called progressive if it stays constant it is proportional and if the share falls the distribution is called regressive d

for the working population the payroll tax is first proportional then regressive because its rate falls once the ceiling of taxable wages is reached for the population as whole the payroll tax rate rises initially and would therefore be first progressive then essentially proportional and for higher income ranges regressive excise and sales taxes are generally regressive especially those imposed on products primarily consumed by lower income individuals such as cigarettes the income tax is progressive and even provides subsidies negative taxes for lower income working individuals often through the earned income credit the corporate income tax is imposed on corporate profits as proportional tax but its burden on individual s depends on behavioral responses as discussed subsequently in the incidence assumptions subsection of this report most people would judge that taxcollection system is fair if it satisfies two limited criteria horizontal and vertical equity the criteria state respectively that it is desirable i for taxpayers with the same capacity to pay to face the same tax liability in dollar terms and ii for liability to increase with ability to pay the application of both depends critically on definitions of the same capacity to pay which is difficult to determine for the families of different size and other characteristics even under regressive tax system higher income taxpayer may pay higher taxes in dollar terms than lowerincome taxpayer what decreases is the share of the tax paid to the income therefore regressive system could still satisfy the principles of vertical and horizontal equity

traditionally there are two theoretical notions of how tax payments should be assigned one is the benefit principle and another is the ability to pay principle

finance the services the benefit principle seemingly has its roots in marketinspired solutions to paying for public goods it is commonly associated with such taxes as the gasoline tax used to finance highways while such taxes are not voluntary as freemarket purchases are they are directly related to the value individuals receive from public goods the benefit principle has much broader reach if one allows individuals to pay variable prices reflecting their willingness to pay rather than each individual paying the same amount1 higher income individuals have greater willingness to pay for social goods because they have more income they also might find some goods such as defense and police protection more valuable because they have more property to protect under this principle the distribution may be regressive proportional or progressive depending on whether the taxpayers income elasticity is greater than equal to or less than the price 1 in theory one can use model to determine both the quantity of public good and the share paid for by each individual which is called lindahl equilibrium s ee lindahl just taxationa positive solution in classics in the theory of public finance richard

elasticities particularly for national level expenditures where there is crosssectional variation some studies of municipal spending or spending on local education generally indicate that income elasticity exceeds the price elasticity providing some support for progressive taxes using the benefit principle3 there is also some international evidence that tax shares rise as income rises according to the world bank4 high income countries have taxes as share of output that are over twice as high as low income countries and expenditure shares that are almost twice as large g3g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g157g152g561g18g138g162g561 the ability to pay principle suggests that people with higher incomes should pay more than those with lower incomes yet the standard does not answer the question of how much more its policy implications are based on diminishing marginal benefit of dollar assumptionthe widelyaccepted belief that the value of an additional dollar of income falls as income rises ie rich man values an additional dollar less than poor notions of ability to pay have generally appealed to some measure of equal sacrifice potential measures of equal sacrifice include equal absolute sacrifice each persons welfare declines by the same amount equal proportional sacrifice each persons welfare declines by the same proportion and equal marginal sacrifice each persons displeasure from taking away an additional dollar is the same equal absolute sacrifice would suggest proportional taxation if the marginal benefits of dollar of income fell proportionally with income that is fo llowing this principle if person with five times as much income as person b values dollar approximately fifth as much as b then for every dollar one collects from b one collects 5 from in this example the principle implied proportional tax system if the marginal benefit of dollar diminishes but at fairly slow rate regressive tax system could also be consistent with the principle while if it diminishes at faster rate progressive tax would be appropriate an alternative measure of sacrifice is equal proportional sacrifice this method is much more likely to justify progressive tax system but it too depends on how fast the value of an additional dollar declines with income there are many reasonable functional forms that do not support progressivity 5 2 this follows from the fact that the income elasticity is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income and the price elasticity is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price hence the percentage change in price divided by the percentage change in income is the ratio of the income elasticity to the price elasticity 3

progressive taxes that will collect the least valued dollars in the economy the result also uses the assumption that the value of dollar falls as income rises under this principle in contrast with the previous two cases the progressivity does not depend on the rate with which the value declines thus without further information on the nature of welfare and the exact standard to be used the ability to pay criterion does not necessarily justify regressive proportional or progressive taxes the equal marginal sacrifice principle suggests an extreme degree of progression

redistribution itself as public good there is normally natural conflict between equity and efficiency objectives when the equity criterion suggests redistribution or progressive tax rates that conflict occurs because taxes distort behavior and reduce economic efficiency it means that the size of the pie becomes smaller there are however circumstances in which redistribution can enhance rather than reduce efficiencywhen redistribution itself is public good recall that pure public good can be characterized as good where one person can benefit from the good without detracting from anothers benefit redistribution can in fact be characterized as public good6 suppose that higher and middle income individuals care about the poor and their welfarethat is they benefit from knowing that the poor have more income in this case redistribution is public good because s contribution to the poor benefits b such redistribution is undersupplied in an open economy and so there is justification for redistributing to the poorbased not on concern about the welfare of the poor but rather about the welfare of the rich the nonpoor may also benefit in other ways from providing income to the poor such as reduction in crime secondly some redistribution that occurs in the economy may be justified as insurance in circumstances where private insurance markets do not work well social safety net may be regarded as insurance against falling for whatever reason on hard times certain features of our social safety net such as unemployment compensation needbased transfers such as food stamps and medicaid and retirement benefits social security and medicare may be justified in part as an attempt to deal with failure of private insurance markets

just income distribution the endowment approach the utilitarian approach and the egalitarian approach there are also permutations of each approach7

the endowment approach says that people should get what they earn in its simplest form it would imply redistribution at all variations include allowing people to get what they earn in competitive economy so that excess profits arising from market power should be redistributed to keep their labor earnings so that assets and earnings from assets should be redistributed or to keep what they would earn if they started equally in terms of wealth and family status the last would in theory permit differences in income base d on effort and willingness to take risk and innate earning ability in contrast to the firs t approach that would also permit differences in income based on inherited wealth while the endowment philosophy does not support direct redistribution to yield just society the benefit principle is philosophically consistent with endowment notions of income redistribution and may support progressive taxation the endowment approach suggests there should be little or perhaps redistribution which is difficult to argue as case of distributive justice for example it suggests that people with mental and physical disabilities that prevent them from working at normal wage and who have family to rely upon should have little or income given that people do have different innate physical endowments many would argue that there is nothing especially fair about system that allows individuals to have varied earnings based on inherited characteristics at the same time it seems unfair to penalize higher income people who have those incomes because they worked harder or undertook more risk on the whole there may be lot of support in our culture for allowing people to keep most of the fruits of their labor but also distaste for allowing individuals limited by circumstances of birth to suffer poverty the absolute lack of redistribution may also be inefficient because of the presence of public goods in externalities in the real world as discussed above it means that everyone can be made better off or not worse off by allowing some redistribution the utilitarian approach says that society chooses to maximize welfare in the economya greatest good for the greatest number philosophy the simplest utilitarian welfare measure is simply one that adds up all the welfare of the individuals in the economy and tries to make shifts that will make that welfare sum the greatest ch an approach suggests that income should be shifted to those who are able to benefit the most from it at the margin this sort of assumption also implies an extremely progressive tax system in some circumstances if we assume that all individuals are otherwise identical and that the value of each dollar of income declines as income rises ie dollar is more valuable to poor man than to rich one and ignore behavioral responses then total welfare is greatest when all individuals incomes are equal this redistribution would require 100 tax on incomes above certain level to be redistributed until everyone has the same incomea superprogressive tax system with positive taxes at the top and negative taxes at the bottom 7 the discussion in this section can be found in public finance textbooks see

attractive its practical implementation is ambiguous because there is objective measure of welfare and objective method of describing maximum so cial welfare the assumption of identical individuals may be reasonable approximation for policymaking but in reality individuals are not identical the third type of approach is the egalitarian approach which says that everyone should be equally happy in this case the government would make transfers to the poor and also transfer more money to those who enjoy it less so as to raise their level of happiness as with the case of the utilitarian measure if one assumes all people are identical and that the value of an additional dollar of income falls as income rises an aggressive redistribution scheme should be called for to equalize everyones income both utilitarian and egalitarian welfare functions are consistent with the abilitytopay principle variation of the egalitarian approach which takes into account behavioral responses is called the maximin or rawlsian criteria with this appro ach society redistributes so as to maximize the welfare of the poorest individual with behavioral responses and identical enjoyments of income society would again equate income by taxing away all income above the average and giving it to those below the average but with behavioral response 100 marginal tax on the rich would not work because it would cause individuals to reduce their work effort in the rawlesian system one would raise the tax just high enough so that the revenue to be distributed was greatest it has been argued that this approach would reflect the choices riskaverse individuals would make as social contract if they had to decide on the distribution of income before they knew which position they would fill in society one of the problems with using welfare function such as the utilitarian function which might be persuasive to people as practical guide to dealing with income distribution is that it does not take account of the possibility that income varies because people differ in their work effort and risk taking while many people might feel it is appropriate to redistribute income to lower income individuals because they do not have the capabilities to earn higher income they are less likely to favor redistribution to people who earn less because they work less or because they do not work as hard as the average person similarly even if everyone were identical in wealth and innate ability and work effort incomes would vary if some people took more risks than ot hers taxing away the returns to risky projects and providing guaranteed cushion against any risk would make risktaking irrelevant to economic decisions as result individuals might be willing to take more or less risk than appropriate and an optimal level of risktaking is important to the efficient operation of an economy since differences in income that arise from innate capabilities or inherited wealth whether financial and physical wealth or human wealth provided by ones family cannot easily be separated from those that arise from work effort and risktaking it is more difficult to assess the appropriate level of redistribution nevertheless it is clear that appeals to social welfare function do suggest that income redistribution may be appropriate the us tax system including all government layers actually engages in very little meansbased redistribution however

does the benefit principle of charging for public goods the ability to pay criteria for charging for public goods while often invoked to support progressive taxes however provides little guidance

their analyses vary in several ways including how they define income the definition and ordering of tax units and the taxes included the following several sections discuss the rationale behind certain methodological choices and report the results of distributional analyses for different organizations for different time periods and for different kinds of taxes we present these measures as effective tax rates which makes comparison meaningful despite the methodological differences the effective rates are simply the ratio of taxes paid to the income measure they are different from the statutory marginal rates that apply to an extra dollar of taxable income only when effective tax rates rise with income tax system is progressive it is proportional when effective tax rates are relatively

sections operated with concept of income but what is the practical meaning of this word there are several incomes mentioned in instructions to single tax formgross adjusted gross and taxableto mention just three of them most states have statespecific income measures such as wisconsin income usually different from the federal analogs other nontax entities may use their own definitions of income better suited to their objectives economic income encompassing all sources regardless of their taxability would be the best descriptor of the taxpayers access to economic resources but unfortunately none of the accounting or tax concepts of income exactly matches it the discrepancy may happen for many reasons one of them is statutory exclusions of certain items from income for example employees may have an option of purchasing their medical insurance through their employers with pretax dollars pretax dollars clearly represent income in the economic sense of this word because employees can use them to consume in this casemedical coverage yet they do not enter the calculation of gross income for individual income tax purposes because of the special treatment of these transactions by law

income that are expanded from tax measures such as adjusted gross income agi they estimate more comprehensive income using various techniques one of them treasurys office of tax analysis ota used family economic income fei as taxpayers income measure in 1999 paper8 the starting point of the intended income measure was the definition of income as the sum of consumption and the change in networth in given periodcommonly referred to as haigsimons income this measure would include both cash and noncash income such as imputed rent on owneroccupied homes the payments homeowners would have to make if they rented their dwellings instead of owning them ota modified this definition in several ways first under the definition some retirees drawing largely on their savings would appear to have or little income because their consumption would be offset by change in their net worth at the same time this money may be taxable depending on the savings vehicle used their tax burden relative to their comprehensive income would appear extremely high because for several types of retirement accounts income is taxed on withdrawal to correct for this mismatch treasu ry includes pension benefits in fei another departure from the definition of income is exclusion of noncash transfers such as medicare benefits caused primarily by data limitations other analyses use measures of income that may not be as broad as economic income but broader than agi in its distributional table in 2003 9 treasury used slightly narrower measure than in its 1999 study cash income cbo measures income as pretax cash income plus inkind transfers10 jct expanded agi by adding taxexempt interest employer contributions for health plans and life insurance employer share of fica tax workers compensation nontaxable social security benefits insurance value of medicare benefits alternative minimum tax preference items and excluded income of us citizens living abroad 11 the brookings urban tax policy center initially used narrower measure but their current measures use both economic income and cash income the choice of the income measure is influenced by data availability and other technical considerations as well as the types of taxes being distributed using an expanded adjusted gross income agi or cash income measure is simpler and requires fewer assumptions but it can mislead for example individuals may be accruing huge gains in assets such as their houses relative to their ca sh income these problems with measuring income are reduced however when distributions are reported based on population shares such as quintiles rather than dollar amounts on the other hand dollar amounts lend concreteness to distribution table the overall tax burden measured as share of agi or expanded agi would always appear higher than when measured as share of comprehensive income also any change in the distribution would appear to be more pronounc ed when measured as percentage of agi 8

example the comparison between agi and fei measures for 2000 shows that the former is smaller than the latter 5649 billion versus 8419 billion12 this relationship between the two measures is likely to persist across time some distributions may be reported based solely on agi which may be good choice for quick backofanenvelope analysis but it is preferable to use more comprehensive income measures whenever technically feasible none of the organizations engaged in regular distributional analysis rely solely on agi however the measure of income can also affect impressions of tax burden unless distributional tables are presented based on population shares rather than measures of income g23g151g146g157g561g152g143g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 another question facing the researchers is how to measure the unit of analysis and also whether and how to account for differences in tax unit composition especially when ordering data by population share such as lowest quintile second quintile etc the unit may be the family the household or the taxpayer unit in many cases these units would be the same but in others they would not for example an adult working child living in the parents home may be part of the household but would be separate taxfiling unit in addressing unit composition regardless of method of classification issues arise with respect to ordering taxpayers it is obvious that large family may have more income than single person but still have the same ability to pay where is that family to be placed in ordering units for distributional analysiswith the same families by ability to pay or with the same by income but of different size researchers differ in their answers the first approach used by most organizations is not adjusting for the size of the unit at all this approach can be argued to implicitly assume that income necessary to maintain given standard of living for one person is the same as the one for four persons which is certainly not realistic nevertheless this approach is common it is straightforward eliminates some sources of ambiguity and is the easiest to implement from technical standpoint if households positions in the income distribution are to be adjusted by family or household size researchers must determine how to make adjustments one possibility is dividing the burden by the number of persons in other words conducting the analysis on per capita basis this approach fails to recognize the economies of scale larger tax units enjoy buying fourbedroom residence is usually less than twice as expensive as buying twobedroom unit price of bedroom in the first case would be lower than in the second in way the purchasing power of dollar would be higher for large household compared to small one several adjustment methods lie between these extremes cbo orders households by ability to pay using this method it divides income by the square root of the households size 13 in this case 12 cronin us

single taxpayer to be as well off another methodology is to normalize income by expressing it in terms of the applicable poverty level for example if the poverty level for single person is 9000 and for fourperson family19000 then single taxpayer with 27000 of income would be equated to the four person family earning 57000 because both of them would be making three times the poverty level for household of the respective size these ordering procedures and unit measures proba bly do not make great deal of difference in the overall qualitative pattern of the effective tax rates

that tax burden is not necessarily borne by the taxpayers legally responsible for paying the tax for example imposing an excise tax may lead to price increase thus even though the seller would be legally responsible for paying the tax the economic cost would be split between the sellers and the buyers in some way possibly with the buyers bearing all of it researchers have to make reasonable assumptions about incidence because calculating the precise shares in every case is impossible they depend on factors specific to every market segment and may fluctuate across segments and in time

the quantitative results to be different in every case the implications about the tax system are actually quite similar the incidence of the corporate tax in particular has been the subject of considerable economic literature with the distributional effects depending on the responses of investors and workers and the technology of the firm14 the incidence of all taxes even individual income and payroll taxes depends however on behavioral responses if savings and labor supply are relatively insensitive to taxes as much evidence suggests these taxes will fall on the individual who pays them15 note that the same assumptions about incidence are used given the tax is distributed at all for the different taxes except in the case of excise taxes cbo and jct allocate the tax based on the

different sources for 2000 and 2005 ordered by population shares due to the methodological differences described above the data are not precisely comparable in addition there is also timing discrepancy tpc does not have 2000 law distribution table using 2000 incomes so the appropriate column uses 2004 incomes but 2000 law ota does not have the table for 2005 note that the absolute measures of effective tax rates can be affected by the income measure and the composition of included taxes at the same time all sources depict similar qualitative picture about the progressivity of the federal tax burden distribution for example in every case the effective tax rates for the lowest quintile are estimated in the low to middle single digits the highest quintile in 2000 faced an effective rate of close to or above 25 the numbers for other quintiles and the general pattern seem consistent too tax rates rise more slowly however at the top of the distribution 14 see crs report rl32517 distributional effects of taxes on corpor ate profits investment income and estates by jane g gravelle and crs report rl34229 corporate tax reform issues for congress by jane g gravelle and thomas l hungerford 15 ibid and also see crs report rl31949 issues in dynamic revenue estimating by jane g gravelle for survey of the literature 16 the treasury appeared to have adopted this methodology in order to keep the price level constant consistent with their revenue estimating assumptions and have the tax passed back to owners of factors of production wages and capital rather than forward to consumer s but allocating the tax to income is not the same as the actual theoretical incidence howevernamely that the tax falls on wages and on the owners of capital existing at the time the tax is initially imposed through fall in value it is not easy to convert this concept into an annual incidence measure although the closest way to do so would appear to be to allocate it to consumption rather than income because the burden is not realized until the asse t is converted into consumption

the federal tax system contains two major types of taxes payroll and income taxes and two minor ones excise and estate taxes income taxes can be divided into individual taxes which are applied to wage income passive capital income interest dividends and capital gains and profits of unincorporated businesses along with separate flat rate tax on corporate profits each kind of tax has different degree of progressivity or regressivity and therefore the distribution of the burden depends on the mix of taxes within the system tables 6 and 7 show the distribution of the tax burden by type before the 20012003 changes table 6 reports the treasury 1999 estimates and table 7 reports the cbo estimates for all but the estate tax table 8 report the distribution for 2005 the slight differences in the two 2000 distributions reflect differences in the income measures in the taxes covered and in the way in which families are ordered for example cbo places more larger families in the lowest quintile because they order by ability to pay while treasury orders by income since large families are likely to have larger benefits from the earned income credit the tax rates of the individual tax are larger negatives in the cbo analysis than in the treasury analysis this effect also causes the lowest quintile to have higher payroll taxes because larger families are more likely and elderly individuals less likely to be represented in the cbo ordering the updated numbers in table 8 show similar patterns by tax types from the congressional budget office data are not available from treasury but with some changes most significant is the income tax whose burden is smaller at every level but particularly at higher incomes due to the 2001 tax cuts some effects are due to the shifting of income across the brackets as well which reduces income and effective tax rates in the lower incomes and raises them in the higher ones without these incomes shifts the tax cuts would be smaller in the higher brackets and larger in the lower ones this effect due to income redistribution can be seen with the corporate tax whose overall level rose due in part to cyclical factors but

share of retired people and are lower at the top because of the dollar ceiling so the tax is regressive at the higher end of the distribution another important observation is that for the four bottom quintiles the effective rates of payroll taxes are higher than for the income tax conversely the effective rates of the corporate income tax increase with income from 09 to 28 in the treasury analysis and from 05 to 37 in the cbo 2000 analysis and 04 to 49 in the cbo 2005 analysis the rates are even higher for the top10 top 5 and top 1 these rates are well below the statutory rates because relatively small share of taxpayers receive income from the source and their tax payments are dispersed among all taxpayers in the class the progressivity of the corporate tax is due not to the progressive tax structure but to the allocation of capital income to higher income individuals excise taxes effective rates vary markedly between the two research organizations reflecting the allocation of the tax to factor incomes for the treasury and to consumption for cbo the treasury analysis depicts this tax as largely proportional while the cbo analysis shows it to be regressive the cbo approach which is also used by jct is probably the more widely used in distributional analysis the regressivity of consumption taxes under this incidence assumption occurs because consumption tends to decline with income the estate tax is the most progressive of all although it is small since most estates are exempt or largely exempt from the estate tax only relatively high income people pay this tax the estate tax does not appear in tables 7 and 8 because cbo does not include the estate and gift tax in its analysis

the recent tax law changes of 20012003 but even in more stable statutory environment the distribution evolves continually in response to economic and demographic developments table 9 shows the

examines the current and projected burden around the period of the recent tax changes and into the future tax rate cuts are still being phased in as one moves from 2004 to 2008 with 2008 the last year for the lower capital gains taxes and dividend taxes 2010 is the year that the original 2001 tax cut is fully phased in as currently scheduled none of the tax cuts would be effective in 2014 note that effective tax rates are higher in 2014 than in 2000 because of real bracket creepthe failure to adjust the tax system parameters to the real income growth it affects the lower quintiles most while the legislative changes have benefitted the higher income groups the most and that effect would be more pronounced if the cbo burden tables included the estate tax which according to table 6 accounted for 13 of income of the top 1 prior to recent tax changes the estimates in table 10 reflect current federal law the actual pattern of tax changes will depend on whether and to what extent the 2001 and

and even easier to move across local jurisdictions large differences in tax rates would induce taxpayers especially higher income taxpayers to move to states with lower taxes thus one can argue that it is primarily the federal governments role to ensure that the overall burden distribution is progressive if progressivity is desired the combined total us tax system appears to be progressive but not steeply so as regressive state and local taxes are combined with the progressive federal tax g14g146g143g142g157g146g150g142g561g22g138g161g561g4g158g155g141g142g151g561 so far discussion in this report has centered around the analysis of the tax burden at single point in time but there is an alternative view that cumulative lifetime tax burden is better representation of the concept lifetime tax burden is simply the sum of all taxes paid each year during the lifetime in most cases individual income grows with time and then drops after retirement that pattern means that the lowest percentile may include very heterogeneous taxpayer mix younger people still in school retirees and midcareer lowincome earners

and bundling them together makes little practical sense for example policy redistributing the tax burden from the higher to the lower quintiles may have different effect on younger taxpayer and retiree it is conceivable that younger taxpayer may welcome the policy because of the lower tax on an anticipated higher future income in the meantime retiree would be unambiguously worse off because he or she has small chance of benefitting from the lower future burden the issue of lifetime burden distribution is especially important in the analysis of intergenerational fairness and in conjunction with national debt issues the debt incurred today would have to be paid off in the future meaning that the taxes of the future generations could be lower in its absence at the same time the approach does not take into account the fact that marginal unit of money is likely to have higher value to the lower income individuals than to the higher income ones even though younger taxpayer in the previous example may pay lower aggregate lifetime tax bill he or she might still prefer to pay less taxes when income is low rather than when it is high so in order to compensate the taxpayer for the reduction in his or her disposable income today the increase in the disposable income in the fu ture should be more than todays loss each taxpayers rate of intertemporal substitution is different and incorporating it into the analysis would add another hardtoverify assumption another reason that simple addition of tax liabilities throughout lifetime is not an ideal indicator is the time value of money principle under this principle dollar today is worth more than dollar tomorrow while the complication can be circumvented in theoretical analysis it may be another source of contention in the analysis of reallife events nevertheless examining tax burdens from lifetime perspective is likely to reduce the progressivity of the tax system as some of the progressivity observed in single cross section reflects the tendency of individuals to have wer incomes in the early and later years of life17

describe what makes tax system regressive proportional or progressive it is more difficult to characterize changes to an existing tax system indeed it is difficult even to determine the degree of progressivity or regressivity of system so that the old and new tax systems can be compared based on their degree of progressivity while variety of progressivity indices and measures have been proposed none has been entirely satisfactory and they can lead to different conclusions about relative progressivity 18 this report will instead examine the measures that are often used to characterize tax changes 17 lifetime study of the total tax system found close to proportional system see don fullerton and diane rogers who bears the lifetime tax burden washington dc the brookings

appear to depict the same tax change very differently this difference in how the cut is perceived for distributional purposes arises from the choice of distributional measure some of the measures that have been presented include 1 the share of taxpayers benefitted that fall below an income level 2 the percentage reduction in taxes paid 3 the tax cut as percentage of income both pretax and disposable 4 the distribution of the tax cut by income class and 5 the average tax cut the first of these measures is most likely to tend to depict tax change as favoring lower income individuals relative to higher income ones the second measure is next most likely and so forth g3g151g561g11g149g149g158g156g157g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g7g161g138g150g153g149g142g561 to illustrate this point consider 10 acrosstheboard income tax cut all positive net tax liabilities reduced by 10 assuming that the bottom quintile of the distribution does not have tax liability one could describe this tax cut as one in which three quarters of the beneficiaries have cash income below 80000 which might make the cut appear not to be particularly targeted to high income individuals almost any tax cut that is general one will benefit in numbers those outside the high income taxpayers because high income taxpayers are by definition not very numerous but this description of the tax cut does not tell us anything about how much of tax cut different groups receive table 12 illustrates how such quantitative measures of the types described above would look assuming everyone in each quintile and group has the same average income an assumption that allows the calculation of measures in the lower brackets where some individuals have negative tax liability because of the earned income tax credit based on percentage changes reported in the second column the tax cut as percentage of income tax liabilities the tax cut may appear to be fairly equal across income classes except for the lowest group but that measure does not reveal very much about distribution because people in the lower income categories may have extremely small tax liabilities and tiny change in tax could result in very big percentage change expanding the measure to percentage reduction in all taxes shows that proportional cut in income taxes reduces total taxes proportionally more for high income individuals even in this case however measuring the percentage reduction in tax liability has not demonstrated anything about the effect on income equality it merely reveals that individual income taxes are more progressive than total taxes in discussing these measures that do relate to effects on income inequality it is important to distinguish between absolute measures and relative measures for example average tax reductions per unit provide information on the absolute size of tax benefit across the income classes which is straightforward measure and is shown in the last column of table 12 in this example the second quintile has tax cut of 21 per person and the highest quintile cut of 2841 another way of examining this same effect is to compare the distribution of the tax benefit with the distribution of the population in the first column of table 12 if each taxpayer class is getting 20 one fifth of the benefit then the benefits are evenly distributed but the 10 tax cut distributes benefits disproportionally to higher income individuals indicating that incomes are becoming more unequal on an absolute basis both of these measures can inform us about how tax cut is changing income without being misleading although it is important to remember that existing income and tax payments are more concentrated among high income individuals thus there is tendency for absolute measures to show most acrosstheboard tax cuts as favoring higher income individualsbecause these individuals have larger proportion of the income and

individuals would still receive high absolute tax cuts but not higher tax cuts as percentage of income in general the best method for measuring this type of effect on inequality is to examine the percentage change in disposable aftertax inco if the percentage change is equal then the tax change is not making incomes shares more equal or less equal if the percentages are higher among higher

percentage change in aftertax or disposable income the measure suggested above as conceptually the best measure of changes in distribution was derived from data in the jct table as suggested in the previous section the percentage change in federal tax liability shows the largest percentage changes at the lower income and the smaller ones at higher levels except for the very top level these numbers give the appearance of tax cut favoring lower income individuals the numbers showing the percentage change in aftertax income suggest however that the largest benefit was in the highest income

tax cut the jct did not produce distributional table but the treasury department did cbos effective tax rate tables cannot be used because they mix phaseins from 2001 in the data for the treasury data the only measure of distributional change presented and other could be derived from their data was the percentage change in individual income taxes like the jct they present percentage change in taxes but unlike the jct the change is confined to income taxes note that unlike the analysis presented in their 1999 study the income measure is cash income rather than economic income the treasury analysis shown in table 16 confronted problem that illustrates the difficulty of reporting distributional effects through percentage change when the base can approach zero or become negative as in the case with percentage ch ange in income tax liability the lower part of the income distribution actually had negative taxes when refundable items such as the child credit and earned income credit were taken into account therefore what treasury actually reports for that class is percentage increase in negative taxes technically speaking as mathematical issue the percentage increase should have been positive change because negative taxes became larger there is really way to compare this number with the other changes moreover the class of under 30000 probably accounts for almost half about 40 of the population so it is difficult to know what to make of this analysis for the remaining classes however the measure appears to favor the lower income individuals t able 16 comparison of the
