provide an opportunity to demonstrate to the world how democratic open civilized friendly and harmonious china is1 in addition much like the two previous asian hosts for olympic summer games japan in 1964 and korea in 1988 china views the 2008 olympics as showcase for its modern economy and springboard for future economic growth to the chinese government hosting the olympics also signifies turning point in its economic development it provides an opportunity to begin the shift from an economy based on being the assembly platform for global manufacturing to one geared to providing goods and services for chinas growing and prosperous middle class the 2010 world expo in shanghai will be similar opportunity to highlight chinas economic progress 1 lee m sands the 2008 olympics impact on china china business review julyaugust 2008 crs2 in an effort to ensure the success of the 2008 olympics the chinese government has invested billions of dollars in sports facilities housing roads mass transit systems and other infrastructure china hopes that its investments when combined with the goodwill generated by the successful completion of the olympics will attract more tourists businesses and investors to china and foster future economic growth in its wake in addition to counteract possible negative publicity about labor and environmental conditions in china the government passed new labor laws and is promoting the 2008 beijing olympics as the green olympics2 if the postolympic economic records of past host cities and nations are any indication however it is uncertain that beijing and china will see substantial economic benefits from this summers games academic research on megaevents such as the olympics has found that their economic benefits generally fail to meet preevent expectations and sometimes fall short of the costs of staging the event certain aspects of chinas current economic circumstances make it more likely that the economic gains from the 2008 beijing olympics could be smaller than some preevent expectations the economic impact of megaevents httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22936 there is vigorous scholarly debate over the correct method of evaluating the economic impact of megaevents such as the olympics3 it is difficult to disentangle changes in economic growth employment inflation tourism and other possible effects caused by the megaevent from changes caused by other factors currency appreciation fiscal and monetary policy changes etc in addition certain types of investments related to megaevents such as the construction of new stadiums often fail to generate significant economic benefits after the megaevent is over plus it is uncertain if economic activities undertaken as part of the preparation for the megaevent for example the construction of new mass transit lines might not have taken place even if the mega event had not occurred also impact assessments of megaevents frequently ignore the opportunity costs associated with investments made before the event for example assessments often do not consider the possibility that the money spent on the new olympic stadium might have generated greater economic benefits if spent on hospitals or schools finally while the economic gains associated with the construction of new infrastructure are generally calculated the economic costs associated with the displacement of people and business for example in the demolition and construction of new housing for the megaevents often are not besides the methodological questions associated with assessing the economic effects of megaevents there are also serious problems in methodological application in many 2 there is separate web page httpenbeijing2008cn1212greenolympicsshtml for beijings green olympics that includes numerous articles on the various measures taken to reduce the environmental impact of the 2008 olympics 3 for brief discussions of the methodological problems of assessing the economic impact of

jeffrey g owen estimating the cost and benefit of hosting olympic games what can beijing expect from its 2008 games the industrial geographer fall 2005 crs3 cases the companies or individuals conducting the economic impact assessment prior to the megaevent have an incentive to overstate the potential gains and understate the potential costs in some cases the assessors present the costs of the megaevent for example the construction cost of new sports facilities as benefits in other cases the assessors overstate the certainty and size of the investment multiplier the secondary benefits for example increased future tourism associated with the megaevent the olympic record few studies have been done comparing the preevent projections of the economic impact of the olympics to their postevent reality study of the 1994 winter olympics held in lillehammer norway determined that the preevent economic impact studies systematically overstated the potential economic benefits of hosting the event and that actual economic gains were comparatively small and short in duration4 another study of the lillehammer olympics concluded the longterm impacts are marginal and out of proportion compared to the high costs of hosting the olympic games5 bank of china boc study of 12 host countries for olympic games over the last httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22936 60 years reportedly concluded that nine of the economies including japan and south korea experienced declines in their average gdp growth rates in the eight years after the olympics when compared to the eight years prior to the olympics6 the chinese press has run several stories pondering the question will china succumb to the socalled postolympics effect poe7 the cost of the beijing olympics when china originally bid on hosting the 2008 summer olympics it estimated the cost at 1625 billion8 since then several revised budgets have been released raising the official cost to over 2 billion9 included in this figure is the expense of building or renovating 76 stadiums and sport facilities in the seven venues beijing hong kong qingdao qinhuangdao shanghai shenyang and tianjin at which events will take place however these figures only include the direct costs of construction of the olympic sports facilities and related venues according to one estimate the actual total construction cost including the capital spent on nonsport infrastructure is expected 4 teigland op cit 5 or spilling beyond intermezzo on the longterm industrial impacts of megaevents the case of lillehammer 1994 festival management and event

criticized estimates of this sort indicating that investments on transportation 262 billion energy 100 billion water resources 24 billion and the urban environment 25 billion are to be considered part of the budget of the city in which the capital outlay took place and not part of the cost of the olympics the 411 billion on nonsport capital investment went to variety of projects for example in beijing 200 miles of roads were refurbished two additional ring roads completed and more than 90 miles of subway and light rail lines were added to the citys transportation system 9000 room olympic village was also built in beijing to house 16000 athletes it is to be converted into modern apartment complex after the olympics are over similar projects were also completed in the other six olympic venues assessing the possible benefits and costs in 2007 two chinese economists zhang yaxiong and zhao kun published study httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22936 of the projected impact of the beijing olympics on the economic development of beijing its surrounding areas and the rest of china11 according to the authors apart from its significance as grand societal gathering hosting the olympic games will greatly promote investment and consumption their model estimated that olympicsrelated investments in beijing increased the citys economic growth by 202 between 2002 and 2007 raised the surrounding areas growth by 023 and advanced the rest of the nations growth by 009 the paper recounts other studies of the projected impact of the beijing olympics on chinas economy the authors report that study by gu et published in chinese in 2003 predicted that the olympics will increase beijings economic growth by 5 between 2003 and 2009 2005 study by wei and yan also in chinese concluded that the olympics would increase beijings economic growth by 08 from 2005 to 2008 all of these studies appear to suffer from one or more of the methodological problems frequently associated with impact analysis of megaevents in their inputoutput analysis zhang and zhao include both sport and nonsport facility investments as part of the olympicsrelated investments contrary to the stance of the bocog coming up with total investment for the 2008 olympics of 28253 billion yuan or 413 billion according to some analysts the 413 billion in investments should be properly classified as cost not benefit of the olympics the paper also implicitly assumes that all the investment made would not have been made if china was not hosting the olympics nor do zhang and zhao consider the opportunity cost of the olympics related capital outlay for example could the money spent on the new birds nestnational stadium or the water cubethe national aquatic center have been 10 brad r humphreys rings of gold foreign

3 pp 261282 crs5 instead spent in beijing on housing medical facilities or schools in addition the paper does not attempt to estimate the losses of the people displaced from their homes or places of employment so that the new olympic facilities could be built12 another significant drawback of the paper is its apparent lack of consideration of chinas current economic circumstance particularly its twin problems of overinvestment and inflation13 at time when the chinese government is concerned that its economy is overheated and the rate of inflation is rising 71 in june 2008 the expenditures associated with the 2008 summer olympics may be exacerbating the nations economic problems in two ways first the direct demand for raw materials equipment and labor to construct the olympic facilities may be increasing upward pressure on prices second materials and resources used in constructing olympic facilities might have been used on arguably more productive and urgent construction projects given the experiences of past hosts of olympic summer games and the current economic situation in china many analysts believe the 2008 olympics are unlikely to provide much of stimulus or much of deterrent for economic growth in beijing or the rest of china although the olympicsrelated capital outlay is seemingly large it httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22936 is small when compared to the annual value of construction in china and the overall size of chinas economy during the first half of 2008 the gross value of construction in china was 227 trillion yuan or 388 billion14 in addition chinas economy 25 trillion yuan 36 trillion in 2007 is already growing at over 10 per year by comparison the potential economic impact of the olympics is small it is also unclear if the olympics will foster greater tourism in china there are reports that stricter visa policy was implemented in the runup for the olympics and that foreign business travelers have had difficult time obtaining visas or have had their multiple entries visa converted into single entry visas as result chinas trade shows that historically have been crowded with buyers have seen decline in attendance while the visa situation may return to normal after the olympics have ended the shortterm effect on chinas exporters has been considerable15 according to chinas national tourism administration china received nearly 132 million inbound tourists including over 26 million foreigners in 200716 chinas domestic tourism has grown over the last decade from 644 million domestic tourists in 12 there is also class element to the olympic construction according to the centre on housing rights and evictions 15 million people were displaced between 2000 and 2008 for the construction of beijings olympics most of the displaced people were lowincome workers ho will be unable to afford the olympic apartments to be sold when the games are over 13 for more information about chinas current economic problems see crs report rl33524 chinas economic conditions by wayne m morrison 14 the gross output value of construction rose in the first half year national bureau of statistics of china august 1 2008 15 information based on interviews conducted by dick nanto crs specialist in industry and trade during research trip in china july 2124 2008 16 visitors from hong kong macau and taiwan are considered inbound tourists but not foreigners crs6 1997 to 1610 billion in 2007 for beijing it is unlikely that the new olympic facilities including the birds nest and the water cube will dramatically increase tourism to chinas capital city beijings tourism bureau reportedly reduced its projection for augusts foreign visitors from 500000 to between 400000 and 450000 or about the same level as last year17 just like the case of lillehammer beijing hotels built in anticipation of surge in tourism are experiencing unexpectedly high vacancy rates18 there are some possible unexpected economic benefits that might be attributable to the 2008 olympics us companies operating in china report that the new labor laws are being enforced such changes in labor conditions are unlikely to be reversed after the olympics are over similarly while the factories around beijing that were closed down to help reduce air pollution during the olympics will more than likely reopen the increased awareness of the sources of pollution may keep china from reverting to its pre olympics status it would appear that the potential gains that china may hope to acquire from hosting the olympics will be mostly in its public image prestige and soft power in the week prior to the opening ceremonies there were some indications that obtaining these gains httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22936 may prove problematic despite repeated government assurances the air quality in beijing has remained an issue of concern for the athletes there has also been controversy over open access to the internet for journalists covering the olympics in addition there is risk that protests or demonstrations on human rights in china may detract from the image the chinese government wishes to portray in its motto for the 2008 summer games one world one dream if once the closing ceremonies are over and the 2008 beijing olympics are done china has obtained neither the economic nor political gains it sought it can look ahead to the 2010 world expo in shanghai as another opportunity to showcase its achievements alternatively the 2010 world expo could also be chance to build on the successful 2008 beijing olympics in either case china will most likely use the next three years to bolster its global image as an economic and political power 17 loretta chao and jason leow beijings luxury hotels face glut of rooms many new projects are
