would violate the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech the fccs indecency restriction was enacted pursuant to federal statute that insofar as it was found constitu tional requires the fcc to promulgate regulations to prohibit the broadcast of indecent progra mming from 6 am to 10 pm the fcc has found that for material to be indecent it must describe or depict sexual or excretory organs or activities and must be patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standard s for the broadcast medium in 1978 in pacifica the supreme court held that because broadcast radio and television have uniquely pervasive presence and are uniquely accessible to children the government may during certain times of day prohibit patently offensive indecent material on these dia in 1996 however supreme court plurality held that with respect to how pervasive and intrusive television programming is cable and broadcast television differ little if at all then in 2000 the court held that gove rnmental restrictions on speech on cable television are unlike those on broadcast media entitled to strict scrutiny thus whereas in pacifica the court upheld restric tion on indecent material on broadcast media without applying strict scrutiny the court apparently would not uphold comparable restriction on indecent material on cable television unless the restriction served compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means it seems uncertain whether the court would find that denying minors access to indecent material on cable television w ould constitute compelling governmental interest assuming that it would then whether or not there is less restrictive means than 6 amto10 pm ban by which to deny minors access to indecent material on cable television it appears that strong case may be made that applying the fccs indecency restrictions to cable television would violate the first amendment this is because as the supreme court wrote when it struck down the ban on indecent material on the internet the government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children in addition the court in the 2000 case mentioned above struck down sp eech restriction on cable television in part because for twothirds of the da household in those service areas could receive the programming whether or not th household or the viewer wanted to do so

examines whether such an extension would violate the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech introduction the fccs indecency restriction was enacted pursuant to federal statute that insofar as it was found constitu tional requires the fcc to promulgate regulations to prohibit the broadcast of indecent programming from 6 am to 10 pm3 the fcc has found that for material to be indecent it must describe or depict sexual or excretory organs or activities and must be patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standard s for the broadcast medium4 another federal statute makes it crime to utter any obscene indecent or profane language by means of radio communication5 this statute has been applied to pictures as well as words and to broadcast television as well as radio6 in federal communications commission v pacifica foundation the supreme court held thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs2 7 438 us 726 1978 it is appropriate in conclusion to emphasize the narrowness of our holding the time of day was emphasized by the commission the content of the program in which the language is used will also affect the composition of the audience id at 750 federal court of appeals late r declared 24houraday ban unconstitutional action for childrens television v federal communi cations commission 932 f2d 1504 dc cir 1991 cert denied 503 us 913 1992 8 id at 748749the statute does not violat the first amendment when enforced during hours when children are likely to be in the audience7 the court in pacifica explained of all forms of communication it is broadcasting that has received the most limited first amendment protection thus although other speakers cannot be licensed except under laws that carefully define and narrow official discretion broadcaster may be deprived of his license and his forum if the commission decides that such an action would serve the public interest convenience and necessity similarly although the first amendment protects newspaper publishers from being required to print th replies of those whom they criticize miami herald publishing co v tornillo 418 us 241 it affords such protection to broadcasters on the contrary they must give free time to the victims of their criticism red lion broadcasting co v fcc 395 us 367 the reasons for these distinctions are complex but two have relevance to the present case first the broadcast media have established uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans patently offensive indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts th citizen not only in public but in the privacy of the home where the individua ls right to be left alone plainly outweighs the first amendment rights of an intruder to say that one may avoid further offense by turning off the radio when he hears indecent language is like saying that the remedy for an assault is to run away after the first blow second broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children even those too young to read bookstores and motion pi cture theaters for example may be prohibited from making indecent material available to children we held in ginsberg v new york 390 us 629 that the governments interest in the well being of its youth and in supporting par ents claim to authority in their own household justified the regulation of otherwise protected expression 8 in sum the court held that because broadcast radio and television have uniquely pervasive presence and are uniquely accessible to children the government may during certain times of day prohibit patently offensive indecent material on these media as such material threatens the wellbeing of minors and their parents authority in their own household since 1978 however when the court decided pacifica cable television has become more pervasive thereby rendering broadcast media less uniquely pervasive presence in denver area educational telecommunications consor tium inc v federal communications commission supreme court plurality held that with respect to how pervasive andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs3 9 518 us 727 748 1996 the plurality quoting words from pacifica that appear in the indented quotation above added that cable televi sion is as accessible to children as over theair broadcasting if not more so has also established uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans and can also confront the citizen in the privacy of the home with little or prior warning id at 744745 justice souter concurred that todays plurality opinion rightly observes that the characteristics of broadcast radio that rendered indecency particularly threatening in pacifica that is its intrusion into the house and accessibility to children are also present in the case of cable television id at 776 10 reno v american civil liberties

show are being challenged see crs report rl32222 regulation of broadcast indecency background and legal analysis by henry cohen and kathleen ann ruaneintrusive television programming is cable and broadcast television differ little if at all9 if cable and broadcast television differ little if at all then one might argue they should be treated alike with regard to ind ecency restrictions but does this mean if one accepts that argument that cable s hould be treated like broadcast or that broadcast should be treated like cable in other words should cable be made subject to the fccs indecency restriction or shoul d broadcast longer be subject to them this report will consider these questions from constitutional standpoint not from policy standpoint although one might argue that the fact that broadcast media is longer uniquely pervasive should render pacifica invalid court has found that to be the case and the supreme court has cited pacifica with approval in recent years10 the fccs indecency restriction therefore ppears to remain cons titutional as applied to broadcast media11 but would it be constitutional to apply the indecency restriction to cable constitutionality of applying the fccs indecency restriction to cable television in united states v playboy entertainment group inc the supreme court held that contentbased speech restriction on cable television can stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny if statute regulates speech based on its content it must be narrowly tailored to promote compelling government interest if less restrictive alternative would serve the governments purpose the legislature must use that alternative to do otherwise would be to restrict speech without an adequatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs4 12 playboy supra note 10 at 813 818 citations omitted 13 the court in playboy wrote however cable televisi on like broadcast media presents unique problems which inform our assessment of the interests at stake and which may justify restrictions that would be unacceptable in other contexts id nevertheless because the court applied strict scrutiny in playboy this comment apparently means not that the court would apply less than strict scrutiny to restrictions on cable television but that applying strict scrutiny to restrictions on ca ble television might involve considerations not present when applying it to restrictions on other media 14 the lower level of first amendment protection for broadcast media dates back to red lion broadcasting co v fede ral communications commission 395 us 367 369 1969 in which the supreme court upheld the fccs fairness doctrine which imposed on radio and television broadcasters the requirement that discussion of public issues be presented on broadcast stations and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage the reason that the court upheld the imposition of the fairness doctrine on broadcast media though it would not uphold its impos ition on print media is that where there are substantially more individuals who want to br oadcast than there are frequencies to allocate it is idle to posit an unabridgeable first ame ndment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak write or publish id at 388 in turner broadcasting system inc v federa l communications commission 512 us 622 639 1994 the court held that this spectrum scarcity problem does not apply to cable television in denver area supra note 9 518 us at 748 the court noted that spectrum scarcity in any event has little to do with case that involves the effects of television viewing on children those effects are the result of how pervasive and intrusive that programming is 15 id at 806justification course the first amendment doe s not permit it is rare that regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible12 the indecency restriction is contentbased therefore for its application to cable television to be constitutional it must meet strict scrutiny which means that it must promote compelling governmental interest and be the least restrictive means to do so this is the same standard that the supreme court applies to speech in newspapers the internet and every ot her medium except broadcast radio and television13 the court does not apply strict scrutiny to broadcast media because as noted in the above quotation from pacifica the court holds that broadcast media have less first amendment pr otection than other media14 the court therefore did not apply strict scrutiny in pacifica and the fact that in pacifica it upheld the constitutionality of the indecency restricti on as applied to broadcast media does not imply that it would uphold its cons titutionality as applied to cable playboy concerned federal restrictions on type of indecent material on cable television signal bleed which refers to images or sounds that come through to nonsubscribers even though cable operators have used scramb ling in the regular course of business so that only paying customers had access to certain programs15 these restrictions which are found in section 505 of the communications decency act of 1996 require operators of cable cha nnels primarily dedicated to sexually oriented programming to implement more effective scrambling to fully scramble or otherwise fully block programming so that nonsubscribers do not receive it orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs5 16 47 usc 561 17 playboy supra note 10 at 806807 18 id at 812 19 id at 826 20 id at 825 21 id at 815 22 47 usc 560to time channel which under an fcc regulation meant to transmit the programming only from 10 pm to 6 am16 to comply with the statute the court noted the majority of cable operators adopted the second or time ch anneling approach the ffect was to eliminate altogether the transmission of the targeted programming outside the safe harbor period 6 am to 10 pm in affected cable service areas in other words for two thirds of the day household in those rvice areas could receive the programming whether or not the household or the viewer wanted to do so17 the court also noted that the speech in question was not thought by congress to be so harmful that all channels were subject to restriction in stead the statutory disability applies only to channels primarily dedicated to sexuallyoriented programming18 the court then applied strict scrutiny to section 505 it did not explicitly say that shielding children from sexually oriented signal bleed was compelling interest but it would not discount the possibility th at graphic image could have negative impact on young child19 this suggests the possibility that even if shielding young children from seeing graphic image s on cable television is compelling governmental interest the court might not find that shielding older children from such images is compelling governmental interest in addition the court rejected another interest as compe lling even upon the assumption that the government has an interest in substituting itself for informed and empowered parents its interest is not sufficiently compelling to justify this widespread restriction on speech20 in any case it was not necessary for the court to make an explicit finding of compelling governmental interest becau it held the statute unconstitutional for not constituting the least restrictive means to advance any such interest the court noted that there is key difference between cable television and the broadcasting media which is the point on which this case turns cable systems have the capacity to block unwanted channels on householdby household ba sis targeted blocking enables the governme nt to support parental authority without affecting the first amendment interests of speakers and willing listeners 21 furthermore targeted blocking is ready required by section 504 of the communications decency act which requi res cable operators upon request by cable service subscriber to without charge fully scramble or otherwise fully block audio and video programming that the s ubscriber does not wish to receive22 when plausible less restrictive alternative is

scrutiny because indecent material is generally entitled to full firs t amendment protection except on broadcast media one might expect that the court in determining the constitutionality of applying the fccs indecency restriction to cable television would be all the more likely to require the government to demonstrate that harms it recite s are real and that the indecency restriction would alleviate these harms in direct and mate rial way but see the next sentence in the text 25 material that is obscene as to adults is not entitled to first amendment protection whether or not it is harmful to adults miller v california 413 us 15 1973 see crs report 95804 obscenity and indecency constitutional principles and federal statutes by henry cohenachieve its goal the government has not met that burden here23 the court concluded therefore that section 504 with adequate pub licity to parents of their rights under it constituted less rest rictive alternative to section 505 applying strict scrutiny we now consider how court might apply strict scrutiny in determining whether applying the fccs indecency restriction to cable television w ould be constitutional we consider first whether court would fi nd that applying the restriction to cable television would serve compelling governmental interest and then on the assumption that it would we consider whether court would find it the least restrictive means to advance that interest compelling governmental interest when the court considers the constitutionality of restric tion on speech it ordinarily even when the speech that is restricted lacks full first amendment protection and the court applies less than strict scrutiny requires the government to demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way24 with respect to restricti ons designed to deny minors access to sexually explicit mate rial by contrast the courts appear to assume without requiring evidence that such material is harmful to minors or to consider it obscene as to minors even if it is not obscene as to adults25 and therefore not entitled to

development of our youth expresses an accepted scientific fact ginsberg v new york 390 us 629 631 641 to sustain state power to exclude such material from minors the court wrote requires only that we

rational basis standard of review rather than strict scrutiny interactive digital software association supra 329 f3d at 959 in addition before playboy reached the supreme court federal district court wrote we are troubled by the absence of evidence of harm presented both before congress and before us that the viewin g of signal bleed of sexually explicit programming causes harm to children and that the avoidance of this harm can be recognized as compelling state interest we recognize that the supreme courts jurisprudence does not require em pirical evidence only some minimal amount of evidence is required when sexually explicit programming and children are involved playboy entertainment gr oup inc v united states 30 f supp2d 702 716 d 1998 affd 529 us 803 2000 the district court

the interest as noted in the text above the supreme court affirmed on the same ground in another case federal court of appeal s upholding the fccs indecency restrictions as applied to broadcast media noted that the supreme court has recognized that the governments interest in protecting childre n extends beyond shielding them from physical and psychological harm the statute that the court found constitutional in ginsberg sought to protect children from exposure to ma terials that would impair their ethical and moral development congress does not need the stimony of psychiatrists and social

governmental interest in denying minors access to sexually explicit material it might find otherwise with respect to fourletter words in light of the fact that minors generally hear such words elsewhere than on cable television and in light of the fact that such words may be used as adjectives or expletives arguably with sexual or excretory connotation28 the court might also distinguish among minors of different ages even with respect to access to sexually explicit material as noted above in playboy the court seemed to leave open the possibility that it might not find compelling governmental interest in shielding older children from sexually oriented material in addition when the court struck down the portion of the communications decency act of 1996 that prohibited indecent material on the internet the court would neither accept nor reject the governments submission that the first amendment does not forbid blanket prohibition on all indecent and patently offensive messages communicated to 17yearold matter how much value the message may have nd regardless of parental approval it is at least clear that the strength of the governments in terest in protecting minors is not equally strong throughout the coverage of this broad statute29 the supreme court has cited another g overnmental interest that might be asserted to justify applying the fccs indecency restriction to cable but the court has not stated whether it is compelling it is the interest in supporting parents claim to authority in their own household30 dissenting judge has argued that law that effectively bans all indecent programming does not facilitate parental supervision in my view my right as parent has been preem pted not facilitated if i am told that certain programming will be banned from my television congress cannot take away my right to decide what my children watch absent some showing that my children are in fact at risk of harm from exposure to indecent programming31 perhaps however the supreme court would take the approach it did in playboy and focus on the second aspect of strict scrutiny whether the fccs indecency restriction is the least restrictive means available to advance the governments interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs9 32 playboy supra note 10 529 us at 815 33 one commentator referring to the presen t crs report writes the congressional research service misses an important distinction in playboy the court was dealing with new federal statute that would lead to 600 1000 pm ban on indecent material being aired on primarily sexuallyexplicit channels by its very definition this was expected indecency and the lockbox and other technologic solutions would actually work as intended for payperview cable channe l that peddles exclusively in smut blocking technologies are highly effective remedies the problem is that blocks are totally ineffective when dealing with unexpected indecency protecting the children while not compelling enough to warrant draconian block on all sexual programming from adults who explicitly request it is likely still compelling enough to warrant the prohibition of indecency on general cable channels matthew s schwartz decent proposal the constitutionality of indecency regulation on cable and direct broadcast satellite services 13 richmond journal of law and technology 17 27 2007 in fact the sentence of the text above that ends with the present footnote and the ntence has not been revised since the first edition of this report makes the distinction to which the commentator refers this report however explains below why this distinction may be insufficient to make the extension of the fccs indecency rule to cable television constitutional 34 the distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but matter of degree the governments contentbased burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as it contentbased bans playboy supra note 10 at 812 35 see crs report 95815 freedom of speech and press exceptions to the first amendment by henry cohenleast restrictive means assuming for the sake of argument that applying the fccs indecency restriction to cab television would serve compelling governmental interest is there less restrictive means by which that interest could be served if so then applying the fccs indecency restriction to cable television would be

speakers and willing listeners 32 the targeted blocking however that the court in playboy found to be less restrictive means to keep signal bleed from viewers who object to it would not seem as feasible to keep indecent material from viewers who object to it in the case of signal bleed viewer could request blocking of channels that he knows to present pornography by contrast in order for targeted blocking to keep indecent programming from viewers who object to it viewers would have to know what channels would ever between 6 am and 10 pm allow on any program the utterance of fourletter word or the exposure of womans breast among other things33 for viewers to know this would seem to entail that every channel be required to state whether it will refrain from transmitting indecent material on all future programming and if channel stated that it would to be bound by that statement this requirement would appear to burden freedom of speech to the extent that it might well violate the first amendment34 it might even be viewed as prior restraint and prior restraints are almost always unconstitutional35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs10 36 the government could of course reduce the numbers of hours per day that it bans indecent material though the supreme court might be less likely to find compelling governmental interest in shorter ban because shorter ban would be less effective in denying minors access to indecent material 37 american civil liberties union v reno 217 f3d 162 179 3d cir 2000 vacated and remanded on other grounds sub nom ashcroft v american ci vil

block pa rticular programs as opposed to entire channels the same firs t amendment difficultie s would apparently arise for such blocking to be effectiv producers who did not wish to be blocked for transmitting ind ecent programming would have to agree to refrain from ever allowing the utterance of fourletter word on program even if the program ordinarily contained nothing deemed indecent thus there may be less restrictive means that would be constitutional to keep indecent material off cable television dur ing certain hours than to apply the fccs indecency restrictions36 this however would not necessarily mean that to apply them to cable television would be constitutional two federal courts of appeals have written that the state may not regulate at all if it turns out that even the least restrictive means of regulation is still unreasonable when its limitations on freedom of speech are balanced against the benefits gained from those limitations37 the more recent of these cases affirmed preliminary injunc tion against the enforcement of the child online protection act which banned material that is harmful to minors from the internet38 the older case upheld fcc regulations that implemented statute that restricted minors access to obscene dialaporn services it appears that strong case may be made that applying the fccs indecency restriction to cable tele vision would be unreasonabl under the above court of appeals formulation this is b ecause as the supreme court wrote when it struck down the ban on indecent material on the internet the government may not reduce the adult population to onl what is fit for children regardless of the strength of the governments inte rest in protecting children the level of discourse reaching mailbox simply can not be limited to that which would be suitable for sandbox39 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs11 40 playboy supra note 10 at 806807 41 reno supra note 10one might reply that to apply the fccs indecency restriction to cable would limit the adult populations discourse only from 6 am to 10 pm but the fact the supreme court in pacifica upheld such limitation on broadcast media does not mean that it would uphold it on cable television in pacifica as noted the court did not apply strict scrutiny in playboy where the court did apply strict scrutiny to speech restriction on cable television it he ld the speech restriction unconstitutional in part because as quoted above for tw othirds of the day household in those service areas could receive the programming whether or not the household or the viewer wanted to do so40 in addition the court struck down the ban in the communications decency act of 1996 on i ndecent material on the internet notwithstanding that such material is available to adults in other media41 it seems clear that governmental restrictions of fully protected speech including indecent material on cable television are unconstitutiona l unless they pass strict scrutiny even if they do not close all outlets for such speech summary and conclusion in 1978 in pacifica the supreme court held that because broadcast radio and television have uniquely pervasive presence and are uniquely accessible to children the government may during certain times of day prohibit patently offensive indecent material on th media in 1996 however in denver area consortium supreme court plurality held that with respect to how pervasive and intrusive television programming is cable and broadcast television differ little if at all the fact that plurality of the court views cable and broadcast television as differing little with respect to their pervasiveness and intrusiveness might suggest that the court would apply the first amendment to both media in the same way the court however c ontinues to cite pacifica with approval but in playboy it held that governmental restrictions on cable television are unlik those on broadcast media entitled to strict scrutiny thus whereas in pacifica the court upheld restriction on indecent material on broadcast media wit hout applying strict scrutiny the court apparently would not uphold comparable restriction on indecent material on cable television unless the restriction served compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means it seems uncertain whether the court would find that denying minors access to indecent material on cable television w ould constitute compelling governmental interest although the court has held that denying minors access to sexually explicit material constitutes compe lling governmental interest not all indecent material is sexually explicit in addition the cour t has suggested that it may not view minors of all ages identically for first amendment purposes assuming for the sake of argument that the court would find compelling governmental interest in denying minors access to indecent material on cablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33170crs12 television there does not appear to be less restrictive means than the fccs restrictions to advance this interest other than banning indecent material for fewer hours per day the lack of less restri ctive means however would not necessarily mean that to apply the fccs restrictions to cable television would be constitutional this is because as two federal courts of appeals have written the state may not regulate at all if it turns out that even the least restrictive means of regulation is still unreasonable when its limitations on freedom of speech are balanced against the benefits gained from those limitations the supreme court has not spoken on this proposition however it appears that strong case may be made that applying the fccs indecency restriction to cable televi sion would be unreasonable unde r this formulation this is because as the supreme court wrote when it struck down the ban on indecent material in the internet the government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children in playboy the court applying strict scrutiny struck down speech restriction on cable levision in part becau for twothirds of the day household in those servi ce areas could receive the programming whether or not the household or the viewer wanted to do so thus it appears likely that court would find that to apply the fccs indecency restriction to cable television would be unconstitutional
