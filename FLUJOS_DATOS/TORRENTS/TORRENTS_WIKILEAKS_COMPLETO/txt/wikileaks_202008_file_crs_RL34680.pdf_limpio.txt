budget negotiations and choices1 it has been said that conf lict is endemic to budgeting2 if conflict between congress and the president impedes the timely enactment of annual appropriations acts or continuing resolutions the possibility of government shutdown arises during highstakes negotiations over appropriations measures number of options present themselves to congress and the president including coming to agreement on regular appropriations acts before the beginning of new fiscal year using one or more interim continuing resolutions crs to extendtemporary funding until fina l decisions are made or not agreeing on fullyear or inte rim appropriations acts resulting in funding gap and corresponding shutdown of fe deral activities if congress and the president pursue the s econd or third options they may agree on fullyear appropriations afte r the beginning of the fiscal year by using regular appropriations acts eg singly or in omnibus legislation or fullyear cr congress and the president frequently agr ee on fullyear or interim funding without coming to an impasse3 on other occasions however congress and the president may not come to an accommodation in time to prevent funding gap this report discusses the cau ses of funding gaps and shutdowns of the federal government processes that are associated with shutdowns and how agency operations may be affected

appropriations acts congress and the president must enact interim or fullyear appropriations by this date if many governmental activities are to continue operating if interim or fullyear appropriations are not enacted into law the time interval when agency appropriations are not enacted is referred to as funding gap4 funding gap also may occur any time cr expires and another cr or regular appropriations bill is not enacted immediately thereafter when funding gap occurs the federal governme nt begins shutdown of the affected activities including the furlough of non emergency personnel and curtailment of agency activities and services programs th at are funded by laws other than annual appropriations acts eg entitlements like social security also may be affected by funding gap if program execution re lies on activities that receive annually appropriated funding funding gaps and government shutdowns have occurred in the past when congress and the president did not enact regular appropriations bills by the beginning of the fiscal year they also have occurred when congress and the president did not come to an agreement on stopgap funding through cr as noted in another crs report six fairly lengthy funding ga ps occurred from fy1977 to fy1980 ranging from 8 to 17 full days5 subsequently the durations of funding gaps shortened considerably from fy1981 to fy1995 nine funding gaps occurred with durations of up to three full days significant exception to the trend occurred in fy1996 when president william clinton and the 104th congress engaged in extended negotiations over budget policy two f unding gaps and corresponding shutdowns amounting to 5 days and 21 days ensued there have been funding gaps since fy1996 the constitution statutory provisions court opinions nd department of justice doj opinions provide the lega l framework for how funding gaps and shutdowns have occurred in recent decades6 article i section 9 of the constitution states

funds before an appropriations measure has been enacted except as authorized by law8 the act also prohibits acceptance of voluntary services and employment of personal services exceeding what has been authorized by law9 exceptions are made under the act to the latter prohibition for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property therefore the antideficiency act generally prohibits ag encies from continued operation in the absence of appropriations failure to comply with the act may result in criminal sanctions fines and removal for years many federal agencies tinued to operate during funding gap while minimizing all nonesse ntial operations and oblig ations believing that congress did not intend that agencies close down while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or continuing resolutions10 in 1980 and 1981 however attorney general benjamin r civiletti issued two opinions that more strictly interpreted the antid eficiency act in the context of funding gap along with its exceptions11 the opinions stated that with some exceptions the head of an agency could avoid violating the antidefic iency act only by suspending the agencys operations until the enactment of an appropriation in th absence of appropriations exceptions would be allowed only when there is some reasonable and articulable connection between the function to be performed and the sa fety of human life or the protection of property in 1990 in response to the 1981 civiletti opinion congress amended 31 usc 1342 to clarify that the term

reportedly were furloughed without pay34 effects on mandatory spending programs programs that are funded by laws other than annua l appropriations acts for example some entitlement programs may or may not be affected by funding gap specific circumstances appear to be significant for example although the funds needed to make payments to beneficiaries may be available automatically pursuant to permanent appropriations the payments may be pr ocessed by employees who are paid with funds provided in annua l appropriations acts in such situations the question arises whether mandatory program can conti nue to function during funding gap if appropriations were not enacted to pay salaries of administering employees according to the 1981 civiletti opinion at l east some of these employees would not be subject to furlough because authority to continue administration of program could be inferred from congre sss direction that benefit payments continue to be made according to an entitlement formula35 that is obligating funds for the salaries of these personnel would be excepted fro m the antideficiency acts restrictions during funding gap however such determination would depend upon the absence of contrary legislative history in specific circumstances nevertheless the experience of the social security administration ssa during the fy1996 shutdowns illustrates what might happen over period of time in thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34680crs10 36 see ssas history of ssa 1993 2000 ch 5 available at http www ssagov historyssassa2000chapter5html 37 see government

for example may impinge eventually on the processing and payment of new entitlement claims ssas administrative history describes how 4780 em ployees were allowed to be retained during the initial stages of the first shutdown36 the majority of these employees were in direct service positions to ensure the continuance of benefits to currently enrolled social security ssi and black lung beneficiaries avoidance of furloughs was possible because appropriations were available to fund the program costs of paying benefits which implied authority to incur obligations for the costs necessary to administer those benefits ssa furloughed its remaining 61415 employees before long however ssa and omb reconsid ered ssa had not retained staff to among other things respond to telephone calls from customers needing social security card to work or who needed to change the address where their check should be mailed for the following month ssa then advised omb that the agency would need to retain 49715 additional employees for direct service work including the processing of new claims for social secu rity benefits further adjustments were made during the considerably longer second shutdown in response to increasing difficulties in administering the agencys entitlement programs potential issues for congress quality and specificity of agency planning in december 1995 representative john l mica chairman of the subcommittee on civil service of the house committee on government reform nd oversight convened hearing that focused on the first fy1996 shutdown and potential implications for the future37 among other things thenchairman mica raised concerns about the shutdowns planning and execution by agencies and om b saying the execution of the shutdown was in many instances disorganized and illogical at best and oftentimes chaotic experience38 as an example he cited the recall of more than 50000 social security personnel three days into the furlough raising questions about whether they should have been furloughed in the first place39 in addition thenranking member james p moran expressed interest in clarifying the distinction between exempt and nonexempt activities and employees if similar issues were currently of concern congress might consider lawmakin g and oversight options related to the quality and specificity of agency shutdown planning availability of agency shutdown plans m b s circular a11 requires executive agencies to submit to omb plans for an orderly shutdown in the event of the absence of appropriations when the plans are either first prepared or later revised40 omb has required the developm ent and maintenance of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34680crs11 shutdown plans since 1980 it is not clear however the extent to which agency shutdown plans have been made publicly av ailable or systematically shared with congress and agency stakeholders for f eedback scrutiny over agency shutdown plans may provide incentives for agencies to improve the quality of the plans should it become necessary at some point for agen cies to execute the plans and may inform budget policy debates about the potential impacts of shutdowns on the other hand such inquiries may distract agency personnel from other duties and raise sensitive issues regarding what activities and empl oyees should be considered exempt from antideficiency act restrictions
