policy act pl 10958 reauthorized annua l regular liheap funds at 51 billion per year from fy2005 to fy2007 the total liheap appropriation in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 was approximately 257 billion inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21605crs2 2 see section 2604ad of the low income home energy assistance act title xxvi of pl 9735 as amended the section is codified at 42 u sc 8623ad 3 depending on how congress appropriates them contingency funds may remain available for distribution in more than one fisc year or they may expire with the fiscal year for which they were appropriated 4 see division g section 528 of pl 110161 fy2007 congress ppropriated 216 billion for the program pl 1105 and in fy2006 3161 billion was appropriated for li heap pl 109149 and pl 109204 the largest amount ever appr opriated for the program the liheap statute provides for two type s of program funding regular funds and contingency funds this report focuses on the distribution of regular funds sometimes referred to as block grant funds which are allotted to states according to methods prescribed by the liheap statute2 the allotment method may change depending on the amount of funds appropria ted by congress in both fy2007 and fy2008 198 billion was allocated to regular funds and in fy2006 248 billion of the liheap appropriation was distributed as regular funds the second type of liheap fundi ng called contingency funds may be released and allotte d to one or more states at the discretion of the president and the secretary of health and human serv ices hhs the contingency funds may be released at any point in the fiscal year to meet additional home energy assistance needs created by natural disaster or other emergency3 of the total appropriated for liheap in fy2008 approximately 590 million was for contingency funds liheap block grant funding levels in the fy2008 consolidated appropr iations act pl 110161 congress appropriated 198 billion for the liheap regular fund pl 110161 contained an acrosstheboard rescission of 1747 that re duced the stated amounts appropriated for most departments of labor health and human services and education programs4 the 198 billion appropriation for regu lar funds is the amount ava ilable after this rescission the first distribution to the states of th regular funds appropr iated in pl 110161 occurred in december 2007 then on june 26 2008 hhs announced that it would distribute funds that were thought to have been allocated to leveraging incentive and reach grants in the fy2008 appropriations act as part of the regular fund formula grants since the early 1990s leveraging incentive and reach grants have been made to states and tribes on the basis of their ability to obtain nonliheap resources for energy assistance leveraging incentive grants and for increasing energy efficiency of low income households reach grants in r ecent years congress has allocated around 27 million for these two funds however in fy2008 pl 110161 did not appropriate funds for leveraging incentive and reach grants when hhs discovered that language to appropriate the funds was ssing from the law it released the 267 million that would otherwise have been distributed as leveraging incentive and reach grants as part of the liheap formula distribution the addition of nearly 27 million to the formula grants caused the funds to be released under the new liheap formula for more information about how the liheap formula dist ributes funds see crs report rl33275 lowincome home energy assistance allocation rate s

1670213 source department of health and human services hhs final allocations for fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 estimated allotments for fy2009 are crs estimates based on factors provided by hhs note these estimates take into account current progra m practice where hhs sets aside funds out of the regular liheap fund appropriation for the territories training and technical assistance leveraging incentive grants and the residential energy assistance challenge option program reach this has implications for the total amount of funds going directly to the states for example an appropriation of 198 billion is estimated to result in 195 billion in regular liheap funds going directly to the states after the amounts for these setasides are subtract ed from the total appropriation the total regular fund appropriation fo r fy2006 was 248 b illion 198 billion of which was appropriated in pl 109149 and 500 million in pl 109204 initially pl 109149 appropriated 20 billion for regular funds but the amount was subject to 1 acrosstheboard rescission resulting in 198 billion appropriatio n pl 109148 in addition both training and technical assistance and the leveraging incentive and reach funds were reduced by 1 in column b congress approved yearlong continuing resolution for fy2007 pl 1105 which was enacted on february 15 2007 the law provided that liheap receive the same amount of funds for fy2007 that was appropriated for fy2006 in pl 109149 as reduced by 1 rescission pl 109148 c the initial allotments for fy2008 were slightly greater than for fy2007 despite the similar appropriations levels due to 1747 acrosstheboard rescission for most departments of labor health and human services and education programs see pl 110161 division g section 528 this meant that set asides for leveraging incentive and reach grants and for training and technical assistance were slightly reduced from fy2007 levels d on june 26 2008 hhs released an additional 267 million in formula grants to the states these funds had been set aside for leveraging incentive and reach grants until hhs realized that congress had not appropriated these funds in pl 110161 as result distributions were recalculated under the new liheap formula and additional funds were provided to the states for fy2009 the presidents budget would allocate 27225 million for leveraging incentive and reach grants and 297000 for training and technical assistance the estimates at 17 billion assume that these amounts would be set aside out of the regular liheap fund httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21605 crs5 table 2 liheap
