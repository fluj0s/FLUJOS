issue of na tional standards for drivers licenses and personal identification cards by passing the real id act of 2005 real id the act contains number of provisions relating to improved security for drivers licenses and personal identifica tion cards as well as instruc tions for states that do not comply with its provisions in general while real id does not directly impose federal standards with respect to states issuance of drivers licenses and personal identification cards states ne vertheless appear co mpelled to adopt such standards and modify any conflicting laws or regulations to continue to have such documents recognized by federal agencies for official purposes both at the time that real id was debated in congress and during the regulatory comment period stions about the constitutionality of the statute have been raised there have been four main constitutional arguments made against real id first because real id ca nnot be premised on congresss power to regulate interstate commerce it is violation of states rights as protected by the tenth amendment second the requireme nt that real ids be used to board federally regulated aircraft impermissibly encroaches on citizens right to travel third specific requirements such as the digital photograph potentially violate the free exercise clause of the first amendm ent finally real id infringes upon citizens right under the first amendment to freely assemble ssociate and petition the government since its adoption in 2005 real id has been highly contested issue among state legislatures and governors acco rding to some advocacy groups state and federal elected official s including numerous commentators to the proposed regulations and other interested parties real id imposes an unconstitutional unfunded mandate on the states prior to the publication of the proposed rule in 2007 however there was little activity at the statelawmaking level primarily because officials were uncertain as to precisely what the implementation requirements were going to necessitate either in terms of cost or potential changes to state law since the publication of the proposed rule in 2007 there has been dramatic increase in state responses to real id and its requirements the final regulations were promulga ted by the depar tment of homeland security dhs on january 29 2008 and cont ain 280 pages of explanation as well as responses to over 21000 comments this report contains summary description and analysis of several of the major elements of the real id regulations finally this report will address real id

intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 20041 standards with respect to drivers licenses and personal identification cards were determined on statebystate basis w ith national standards in place in fact prior to september 11 2001 legi slation aimed at discourag ing national standards for identification documents had gained bipa rtisan support and was thought likely to pass congressional action regarding national standards for stateissued identification documents before september 11 2001 had proved to be high ly controversial for example 656 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 19962 provided federal standards for state drivers licenses and birth certificates when used as identificationrelated doc uments for federal purposes under this provision state had two choi ces the state could require that each of its licenses include the licensees social security number in machinereadable or visually readable form alternatively state could more minimally require that each applicant submit the applicants social security number and verify the legitimacy of that number with the social security ad ministration the section became subject to widespread public criticism shortly af ter its enactment with opponents most frequently alleging that it could be construed as step toward national identification card system in response congress prohi bited funding to imp lement regulations aimed at assisting the states to adopt th social security num ber requirements and the underlying requirement itself was s ubsequently repealed in 355 of the department of transpor tation and related agenci appropriations act 20003 after the events of september 11 2001 the prevailing view of national standards for socalled breeder documents which includes but is not limited to drivers licenses and personal identification cards changed specifically the final report of the national commission on rrorist attacks upon the united states 911

delegated authority to the secretary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of homeland security empowering them to issue regulations with respect to minimum standards for federal acceptan ce of drivers licenses and personal identification cards5 pursuant to the irtpa the secretary was required to issue regulations within 18 months of enactment requiring that each drivers license or identification card to be accepted for any official purpose by federal agency include the individuals 1 full legal name 2 date of bi rth 3 gender 4 drivers license or identification card number 5 digital photograph 6 address and 7 signature6 in addition the cards were required to contain physical security features designed to prevent tampering counterfeiting or duplication for fra udulent purposes as well as common machinereadable technology w ith defined minimum elements7 moreover states were required pursuant to implementing regulations to confiscate drivers license or personal identification card if any of the above security components were compromised8 the statute also required that the imple menting regulations address how drivers licenses and identification cards were issued by the states specifically the regulations were required to include minimum standards for the documentation required by the applicant the procedures utilized for verifying the documents used and the standards for pro cessing the applications9 the regulations were however prohibited from not only infringing upon the s tates power to t criteria concerning what categories of individuals are eligible to obtain drivers license or personal identification card from that state10 but also from requiring state to take an action that conflicts with or otherwise interferes with the full enforcement of state criteria concerning the categories of individuals that were eligible to obtain drivers license or personal identification card11 in other words it appeared that if state granted certain category of individuals ie aliens legal or illegal permission to obtain license nothing in the implementing regu lations was to infringe upon that states decision or its ability to enforce that deci sion in addition the regulations were nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34430crs3 12 idat 7212b3de 13 see negotiated rulemaking act of 1990 pl 101648 104 stat 4970 1990 codified as amended

rulemaking committee was required to include representatives from 1 state and local offices that issue drivers licenses andor personal identification cards 2 state elected officials 3 department of homeland security and 4 interested parties14 in 2005 congress again addressed the issu of national standards for drivers licenses and personal identif ication cards by passing the real id act of 2005 real id15 real id contains number of provisions relating to improved security for drivers licenses and personal identification cards as well as instructions for states that do not comply with its provisions in addition real id repealed certain overlapping and potentially c onflicting provisions of the irtpa statutory provisions and requirements of real id in general although real id does not directly impose fede ral standards with respect to states issuance of drivers licenses and personal identification cards states nevertheless appear to need to adopt such standards and modify any conflicting laws or regulations to continue to have such documents recognized by federal agencies for official purposes real id contains statutory definiti on of the phrase official purpose for purposes of the act an official purpose is defined as including but not limited to accessing federal facilities boarding federally regula ted commercial aircraft entering nuclear power plants and any other purposes that the secretary of homeland security shall dete rmine in addition real id contains provision that specifically repealed 7212 of the ir tpa which had contained the preexisting law with respect to national standards for drivers licenses and personal identification cards minimum issuance standards section 202c of real id establishes minimum issuance standards for federal recognition requiring that before state can issue drivers license or photo identifica tion card state will have to verify with the issuing agency the issuance validity and completeness of 1 photo identification document or nonphoto docum ent containing both the individuals full legal name and date of birth 2 date of birth 3 proof of social security number ssn or verification of the individuals

they 1 have valid unexpired nonimmigrant visa or nonimmigrant visa status for entry into the united states 2 have pending or approved application for asylum in the united states 3 have entered into the united states in refugee status 4 have pe nding or approved application for temporary protected status in the united states 5 have approved deferred action status or 6 have pending application for adjust ment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states or conditional permanent resident status in the united states 17 in the event that an ssn is already registered to or associated with another person to whom any state has issued drivers license or identification card the state is required to resolve the discrepancy and take appropriate actionname and address of the i ndividuals principal residence to the extent that information verification requi rements previously existe d they were function of state law and varied from state to state this real id provision appears to preempt any state verification standards and replace them with the new federal standards as established by this statutory language evidence of legal status section 202c2b of real id appears to require states to verify an applicants legal status in the united states before issuing drivers license or personal identifi cation card previously the categories of persons eligible for drivers licenses were determined on state bystate basis as indicated above the irtpa sp ecifically prevented the s ecretary of transportation from enacting regulations that would interfere with this authority this section of real id appears to preempt any state law requirements and seems to require the states to verify the legal status of the applicant temporary drivers licenses and identification cards section 202c2c of real id establishes system of temporary licenses and identification cards that can be issued by the states to applicants who can present evidence that they fall into one of six categories16 under real id state may only issue temporary drivers license or identification card with an expiration date equal to the period of time of the applicants author ized stay in the united states if there is an indefinite end to the period of aut horized stay the cards expiration date is one year the temporary card must clearly indicate that it is temporary and state its expiration date renewals of the mporary cards are to be done only upon presentation of valid documentary evidence th at the status had been extended by the secretary of homeland security if such provisions existed prior to the enactment of real id they existed as function of state law and are preempted by the act other requirements pursuant to 202d of real id states are required to adopt procedures and practices to 1 employ technology to capture digital images of identity source documents 2 retain paper copies of source documents for minimum of seven years or images of s ource documents presented for minimum of 10 years 3 subject each applicant to mandatory facial image capture 4 establish an effective procedure to confirm or verify renewing applicants

appropriate security clearance require ments 9 establish fraudulent document recognition training programs for appropriate employ ees engaged in the issuance of drivers licenses and identification cards and 10 limit the length of time drivers license or personal identification card is valid to eight years in addition to these requirements real id contains language requiring that states if they elect to issue drivers license or personal identification card that does not conform to the requirements of this act be required to use unique color identifier or design to alert officials that the document is not to be accepted for any official purpose moreover the states are required to clearly state on the face of the document that it is not to be accepted for federal identification or for any official purpose further the enacted version of real id includes provision requiring the states to maintain motor vehicle database that at minimum contains all data fields printed on the drivers license or identification card and all motor vehicle driver histories including violations suspensions or points finally the act requires the states to provide electronic acce ss to their databases to all other states to the extent that any of these requireme nts previously existed they did so as function of state law thus it appears that the state laws are preempted in favor of the new federal standards trafficking in authentication featur for use in false identification documents section 203 of real id amends 18 usc 1028a8 which makes it federal crime either to actually or with intent transport or transfer identification authentication features18 that are used on document of the type intended or commonly presented for identifi cation purposes by replacing the phrase false identification features with false or actual authentication features this provision appears to broade n the scope of the criminal provision making it crime to traffic in identification features regardless of whether the feature is false in addition section 203 requires th at the secretary of homela nd security enter into the appropriate aviationsc reening database the personal information of anyone convicted of using false drivers license at an airport additional provisions section 204 of real id authorizes the secretary of homeland security to make grants to the states for the purpose of assisting them in conforming to the new nati onal standards the section also contains the necessary language authorizing the ppropriation of fede ral funds for the grant program in addition 205

infringes upon citizens right under the first amendment to freely assemble ssociate and petition the government tenth amendment although congresss power to regulate matters affecting interstate commerce is br oad it is not unlimited and in recent years has been constrained by the courts interp retation of the tenth amendment21 such an interpretation appears to be derived from the tenth ame

prevention act pl 103159 107 stat 1536 1993the political process23 the court appears to be willing to use the tenth amendment to protect the sovereign interests of the states immediately after garcia however it appeared that the only way to show tenth amendment violation was to demonstrate that there had been brea kdown in the national political process that thwarted the ordinary procedural safegu ards inherent in the federal system24 several years later in new york v united states 25 which involved the take title provisions of the lowlevel radioactive wa ste policy amendments act of 198526 the court held that the federal statute at issue effectively commandeered the state lawmaking process because regardless of which option the state chose the act compelled them to enact and enforce federal regulatory program27 in reaching this conclusion the court held that essential to the concept of state sovereignty is control over the states legislative process which was diminished by the imposition of federal mandate28 in addition the court held that the take title provision threatened state sovereignty because it had the potential to cause confusion among citizens as to which government officials state or federal were responsible for particular actions29 finally the court made clear that the states are not mere political subdivisions of the united states and concluded that commandeering their legislative process treats them as such30 building on its holding in new york the court in printz v united states31 extended the anticommandeering principle to include not only states legislative process but also states executive functions including its enforcement of the law at issue in printz were specific requirements of the brady handgun violence prevention act which required state and local officials to inter alia execute federal background checks on potential handgun purchasers32 the court in holding the brady provisions unconstitutional also focused on the importance of state sovereignty stating that it is an essential attribute of the states retained sovereignty that they rema in independent and autonomous within their proper spherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34430crs8 33 printz 521 us at 928 34 see id at 92930 stating that by forcing stat government to absorb the financial burden of implementing federal regulatory pr ogram members of congress can take credit for solving problems without having to ask thei r constituents to pay higher federal taxes and even when the states are not forced to absorb the costs of implementing federal program they are still put in the position of taking the blame for its burdensomeness and for its defects id 35 528 us 141 2000 36 id at 143 citing the drivers privacy protecti on act 18 usc 27212725 1994 37 id 38 id at 151 39 id 40 see idof authority33 additionally the court held that like the statute in new york the brady provisions were unconstitutional becau they potentially confused citizens with respect to which government officials state or federal were to be held accountable in the event of any problems with the requirements34 in 2000 however the supreme court decided reno v condon 35 and upheld as consistent with the federalism principles established in new york and printz provisions of the drivers privacy protection act dppa36 the dppa regulated the ability of the states to disclose and resell information collected from state motor vehicle departments37 the court distinguished the dppa from the statutes in both new york and printz because according to the court the dppa does not require the states in their sovereign capacity to re gulate its own citizen s it does not require the states to enact any laws or regulati ons and it does not require state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals38 in addition to its holding with respect to the constitutionality of the dppa the court also referred to an argument advanced by the challenging state that congress may only regulate the states directly when it does so via generally applicable laws or laws that apply to individuals as well as states39 the court holding that the dppa was generally applicable found that it was not necessary to address this question and thus has left it reserved for future consideration40 whether limiting the standards to federa l acceptance as opposed to direct federal requirements on the states obviates federalism concerns under supreme court jurisprudence remains to be seen as cases have yet been filed challenging the constitutionality of the law it appear s possible to argue however that because the issuance of drivers licenses remain s function of state law the minimum issuance and verification requirements established by the act even if limited to federal agency acceptance constitute an ffective commandeering by congress of the state process or conscription of the state and local officials who issue the licenses right to travel although not expressly fined in the text of the constitution the supreme court s stated that the right to travel is privilege

national citizen ship under the constitution41 as well as part of the liberty of which the citiz ens cannot be deprived wit hout due process of law42 the court has declared that the constitutional right to travel consists of three different components first it protects the right of citizen of one state to enter and to leave another state second it protects the right to be treated as welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second state and third for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents it protects the right to be treated like other citizens of that state43 precedent regarding the right to travel has developed along two primary strands the first addresses burdens imposed by state governments and involves the fourteenth amendment whereas the second strand involve s federally imposed burdens on international trav and appears to involve the fifth amendments due process clause under the fourteenth amendment cases the right to travel from one state to another has been considered fundamental right under the c onstitution44 consistent with its status as fundame ntal right is the requirement that the governments action satisfy the constitutional standard of review often referred to as strict scrutiny or heightened scrutiny45 under strict scrutiny the government must provide compelling state interest for the burden and show that the means utilized are narrowly tailored to the achievement of the goal or phrased another way the least restrictive means available46 in addition to the strict scrutiny cases there have been cases where the state has placed burdens on th act of travel itself in these cases the justification level appears to be much lower47 the court has held that burdenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34430crs10 47 continued confined in good faith to that purpose and that potential passengers may avoid the search by electing not to fly 48 see evansvillewanderburgh

thus for example highway tolls and airport fees have been upheld but general tax imposed on all individuals leaving state may impermissibly restrict travel49 conversely in right to travel cases involving federally imposed burdens on interstate travel which implicate the fifth amendment courts appear to reject the fourteenth amendment fundamental rights analysis and apply less stringent rational basis test the rational basis test simply requires that laws be rationally related to legitimate government interest50 here again the government appears not to be required to show compelling inte rest to justify uniformly applied non discriminatory travelrelated restriction51 given that the airlines are seemingly aut horized to refuse service to anyone who fails to present proper identif ication it appears that st rong argument can be made that real id imposes an additional burden on citizens who wish to travel by federally regulated aircraft thus the inquiry should focu s on the standard of review that should be applied that said it app ears difficult to argue that ensuring the security and validity of identification documents will fail to increase passenger safety and transportation facility security which are likely compelling governmental interests thus it seems that regardless of which standard of re view is applied the government may be in strong position to argue that not only are the identification requirements justifiable but also that their burden on the right to travel is minimal and in light of the present conditions entir ely reasonable moreover it is important to note that not having real id will not prevent individuals from boarding aircraft rather the lack of real id whether by state noncompliance or personal choice will simply mean either that alternative identification will have to be produced such as military id passport or other documents accepted by the transportation security administration tsa or additional security screening

sherbert v verner 53 the court required religi ous exemption from secular regulatory piece of economic legislation ms sherbert had been disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation because as seventh day adventist she would not accept saturday work according to state officials this meant she was not complying with the statutory requirement to stand ready to accept suitable employment the court held that her denial of benefits could be justified under the free exercise clause if her disqualification as beneficiary represents infringement by the state of her constitutional rights of free exercise or if any incidental burden on the free exercise of ppellants religions ma be justified by compelling state interest in the regulation of subject within the states constitutional power to regulate54 after sherbert the court applied the compelling state interest test in several cases finding for example in wisconsin v yoder 55 that state compulsory attendance law as applied to require amish children to attend 9th and 10th grades of public schools in contraventi on of amish religious beliefs violated the free exercise clause conversely however the court he ld that the government had compelling interest with respect to compulsory participation in the social security system56 as well as with regard to the denial of ta x exemptions to churchrun colleges whose racially discriminatory admissions policies derived from religious beliefs57 finally in 1990 the court decided employment division v smith 58 which involved challenge to state statute that denied unemployment

compelling interest test does not apply to require exemptions from generally applicable criminal laws criminal laws held the court are generally applicable when they apply across the board regardless of the religious motivation of the prohibited conduct and are not specifically directed at religious practices60 thus except in the relatively uncommon circumstance when statute calls for i ndividualized consideration th the free exercise clause affords basis for exemption from neutral generally applicable law as the court concluded in smith accommodation for religious practices incompatible with general requirements must ordinarily be found in the political process61 subsequently in 1993 congress sought to supersede smith and substitute statutory rule of decision for free exercise cases the religious freedom restoration act rfra62 provides that laws of general applicability federal state and local may substantially burden the free exerci of religion only if they further compelling governmental interest and constitute the least restrictive means of doing so as congress declared in the act itself the purpose was to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in sherbert v verner and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of re ligion is substa ntially burdened63 in the most recent supreme court case to address these issues

law such that exceptions even on reasonable religious grounds can be afforded given real ids strong basis as both an antiterrorism and fraud prevention statut it appears that the government would have strong argument that compelling interest does exist for not granting any exceptions to the acts require ments conversely it also appears reasonable to argue that although the governments interest is strong reasonable accommodations on religious grounds are still possible and are required by the first amendment right to assemble and petition the government and the right to anonymity finally some have argued that real id is violation of the first amendment because the measur infringes upon citizens right to freely assemble associate and petition the government68 the first amendment states that cong ress shall make law abridging the right of the people peaceably to assemb and to petition the government for redress of grievances69 the argument appears to be that linking states issuance of enhanced identification documents to its citizens ability to board federally regulated aircraft prevents the full exercise of an individuals liberties such as those provided by the first amendment that depend on citizens ability to freely move throughout the country70 by imposing burdensome re quirements on interstate travel the government has arguably prevented pe rsons who wish to refrain from identifying themselves andor submitting to enhanced security screening from exercising their constitutional rights although it appears that neither the supr eme court nor any lower federal court has been presented with an analogous situation the court has indicated that anonymity is concept protected by the first amendment for example in thomas v collins sheriff the court invalidated texas stat ute requiring labor organizers to register and obtain an organizers card befo re making speeches to assembled workers as incompatible with the guarantees of the first amendment71 as recently as 2004 the court has upheld the general notion th at citizens have right to anonymity especially in situations where citizen is not suspected of crime72 in light of these precedents it may be possible to challenge the identification requirement on the grounds that it violates the first amendm ent right of citizens to be anonymous however claims made regarding the rights of association and petition

right of anonymity exists it is difficult to connect the implication of this right to the purpose of real id strong argument exists that the regulations are in way intended to impact persons first amendment rights rather the regulations at issue are aimed at preventing and deterring the use of fraudulent identificati on documents for federal purposes thus these regulations can arguably be said to have at most an incidental or indirect effect on rights protected by the first amendment in cases where the regulation at issue was not specifically directed at first amendment rights the court has held such regulations subject to first amendment scrutiny only when it was conduct with significant expressive element that drew the legal remedy in the first place or where statute based on nonexpressive activity has the inevitable effect of signaling out those engaged in expressive activity73 given the indirect effect that these regulations may have on first amendm ent rights it would appear unlikely that challengers could establish the significant or substantial impact on their right to associate or petition the government that would be required to trigger first amendment scrutiny unfunded mandate issues according to some advocacy groups st ate and federal ected officials including numerous commentators to the proposed regulations74 and others real id imposes an unconstitutional unfunded mandate on the states75 generally speaking the term unfunded mandate re fers to requirements that one unit of government imposes on another without providing funds to pay for costs of compliance in this instance the argument has often been advanced that the federal government has imposed the requirement s of real id on the states without providing adequate funding to c over the implementation costs arguments related to unfunded mandates typically take two forms first is the argument that unfunded ma ndates are unconstitutional as violations of the tenth amendment as indicated above juri sprudence with respect to the tenth amendment is limited and the federal courts have not to date specifically addressed the unfunded mandate issue

the reforms include point oforder procedures by which the requirements can be enfor ced and by which the consideration of measures containing unfunded intergovern mental mandates can be blocked with

economy descriptions of c onsultations with nonfederal government officials and summary of the evalua tion of comments and concerns obtained throughout the promulgation process78 moreover umra

means that compliance may have to be reaffirmed during the states next appropriations cycle or it can be eliminated94 conversely in nevada the legislature adopt ed into law new provisions of the states motor vehicle code that appear to be intended to bring the state into full compliance with real id95 it also appears that an additi onal 12 states have statutory language pending that would

delay implementation unless certain conditions are met101 in addition to the statutes directly prohibiting compliance the legislative chambers in 15 states have adopted nonbinding resolutions or memorials that urge congre ss to either amend or repeal real id andor that indicate the states intent to not comply102 all told 24 states have passed legislation that either prohibits state co mpliance with the act or urges congress to amend or repeal real id in addition to those states that have enacted either statutory commands or non binding resolutions there are number of states that have such matters pending before their state lawmakers currently it appears that 11 states have bills that would prohibit compliance pending be fore their legislatures103 whereas another 20 states and the district of columb ia have nonbinding resoluti ons or memorials awaiting action104 the ramifications of having several states that do not opt to comply with the terms of real id are far from clear as previously discussed the act itself is voluntary binding only on federal agencies not on the states thus the statute contains penalty for noncompliance to the extent that there is penalty for non compliance by state it appears to be borne by the citizens of the noncompliant state for example after may 11 2008 th citizens of state such as montana which has passed law prohibiting compliance and has refused to file for an extension will not be able to use their stateissued drivers licenses or personal identification cards for offi cial purposes therefore after may 11 montana citizens will not be able to show their montana licenses to board federally regulated aircraft or enter federal building although th is does not mean that citizens of the non compliant states cannot engage in intersta travel via airplane as many other forms of identification are acceptable by the transportation security administration tsa ie passport military id other forms of state or federally issued identification or enter federal court house or other federal building it arguably does impose an additional burde n on the citizen because the state has chosen not to comply

sharin g that is an integral part of real id presumably non compliant states will not participate in the database creation or informationsharing system envisioned by the real id regulati ons thus it would appear that potential problems may arise if for example an applicant in compliant state presents document ie birth certificate or other requi red paperwork that requires verification from noncompliant state at this early stage of implementation however it is unclear precisely what ffect this may have moreover the existence of noncompliant states presents the potential for conflicts among the states in addition to those between the noncompliant states and the federal government for example will nonreal idcompliant drivers license or personal identification card issued by montana continue to be valid form if identification in indiana state that has specific compliance law in place the converse question also exists namely w ill montana accept forms of identification that comply with real id as valid within its own jurisdiction currently neither real id itself nor the existing state laws appear to expressly address these questions however they appear likely to arise as implementation advances finally it has been noted that several of the states that have adopted statutes prohibiting compliance with real id have also filed requests for extensions from dhs105 according to dhs georgia nebr aska oklahoma and washington have all requested the extensions106 although it appears possible to distinguish between request for an extension and noncomplia nce as indicated above dhss response to several states suggests that it is not strictly interpreting the statutory language that requires that extensions be granted only to those states evidencing an intent to comply107 selected regulatory requirements of real id the final regulations promulgated by dhs on january 29 2008108 contained over 280 pages and responded to over 21000 co mments this section contains summary description and analysis of several of the major elements of the real id regulations full legal name section 3717 of the new re gulations require that real idcompliant drivers

differently on identity documents due to m arriage adoption court order or other mechanism permitted by st ate law or regulation110 commentators and critics of this approach have regularly pointed out that given the lack of uniform convention with re spect to this listing of names on federal documents this requirement is potentially burdensome to state officials who may be presented with numerous documents each with variations on the same name111 in addition to the myriad of federal documents that utilize different naming conventions there are foreign documents each with th eir own naming rules and conventions that may be presented as well in short the absence of any uniformity with respect to naming requirements makes the real id standard burdensome to implement moreover commentators noted that not all of the potential name variations will be covered by existing state laws or regulations thus it remains possible that an individual could have their real id application rejected because their name variation while reasonable and perhaps practically justifia ble does not fall within states established legal exceptions as result it appears that the burden may fall to the individual applicant to reconcile the names on their various documents before applying for real id dhs has responded to these concerns by per mitting any and all variations to the applicants name that are accepted by the issuing states laws or regulations dhs also asserts that it has modified the language in the final rule so that it more closely adheres to the naming conventions utilized by the social security administration depar tment of state and other documentissuing agencies112 principal residence the final real id regulations contain two provisions relevant to the applicants principal address dhs has defined the phrase principal residence to mean the loca tion where the person is currently domiciled ie presently resides even if at temporary address113 the first provision relates to what the individual is required to show when applying for real id according to 3711f to document the address of pr incipal residence person must present at least two documents of the states choi ce that include the individuals name and principal residence114 the second provision relates to what address is required to appear both on the face of the real id and in the machinereadable portion pursuant to 3717f the principal reside nce must appear on the real id unless one of the following exceptions applies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34430crs22 115 id at 5335 116 id at 5302 117 id 118 id1 state law regulation or dmv procedure permits display of an alternative address or 2 individuals who satisfy an of the following i if the individual is enrolled in state address confidentiality program which allows victims of domestic violence dating violence sexual assault stalking or severe form of trafficking to keep obtain and use alternative addresses and provides that the addresses of such persons must be kept confidential or other similar program ii if the individuals address is entitle d to be suppressed under state or federal law or suppressed by court order incl uding an administrative order issued by state or federal court or iii if th individual is protected from disclosure of information pursuant to section 384 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996115 several concerns continue to be raised about this provision among them are the impact on homeless and lowincome i ndividuals who may not have permanent residences and the effect of the provisi on on those persons who because of personal safety confidentiality or other reasons may have legitimate need to keep their address off of identifying doc uments but reside in stat that does not have formal law regulation or dmv procedure permittin g them to do so with respect to the first concern dhs has indicated that its final rule grants the states wide latitude to address issues concerning an individuals addre ss of principal residence within their statespecific exceptions process116 in other words according to dhs the states will retain sufficient authority to issue real ids to individuals including those who are homeless so long as the exceptions are properly documented in the states issuing system with respect to the second concern personal security and confidentiality issues dhs indicates that under the final rule the states have broad authority to protect the confidentiality of the address of principal residence for certain classes of individuals117 one commentator however not ed that only 24 jurisdictions currently have formal conf identiality programs in place that will satisfy the rules specific exception118 thus in those states where formal programs do not currently exist it is unclear how the confidentiality of those persons who may be placed at risk will be protected moreover how those formal programs may come about should jurisdictions opt to create them will vary depending on existing laws and the required changes for example in some states it may be possible for confidential programs to be created either directly by the governor or by the agency responsible for issuing drivers licenses and personal id entification cards whereas in other states legislative action may be required document verification requirements real id specifically requires states to verify the validity of the suppor ting documents presented by the applicant with the documents issuing agency s ection 3713 of the fina l regulation provides

electronic validation systems as they become available or use alternativ methods approved by dhs120 the regulations proceed to provide for verification requirements for five diffe rent types of documents first with respect to documents presented by applicants that are issued by dhs such as identity documents or documents establishing lawful presence in the united states the regulations state

the fact that birth records are retained by the individual states and not the federal government and the wording of the regula tion it is unclear what other methods of birthcertification verification are available therefore there remains an open question with respect to how the states are going to comply with this requirement fourth with respect to documents issu ed by the department of state dos such as passports the regulations require that the states verify the document with dos or by means approved by dhs specific electronic system or preferred method however is indicated in the final rule

at either the state or federal level that will permit such verification to occur126 dhs concurs with this assessment and responds by noting that t he rule gives states maximum flexibility in determining an individuals ddress of principal residence127 despite the statutory language because the text of the final regulation is silent regarding verification of principal residence it is unclear whether states will actually be required to perform this task to be considered in full compliance machinereadable technology section 3719 of the final regulation requires that to meet th statutory requirement ll real ids use compatible machinereadable technology specifically the regulations state that states must use the isoiec 154382006e information technology automatic

identification card opponents of real id have argued that its implementation will create facto national identification card149 although these arguments have taken many forms they ppear to generally consist of three basic elements first opponents argue that the uniform issuance and ve rification standards imposed by the federal government will result in turning state workers into immigration enforcement officials by forcing them to check the citizenship status of each applicant and will move states away from the purpose of issuing drivers license namely ensuring that operators of motor vehicles meet the minimum state requirements second opponents point to both the machinereadable technology requirements and state datas haring proposals as evidence of substantially increased federal government invol vement in the traditionally staterun issuance of identification documents finally opponents generally note that there appears to be an unlimited number of potential activities for which real idcompliant licenses could be required these could potentially include voting firearm registration employment and receipt of subsidies ndor other federal or state benefits in its discussion of the final rule dhs specifically indicates that it does not intend that real id documents become facto national id and does not support the creation of national id150 in addition dhs notes that it has limited the potential uses of real ids to the purposes defined in the statute accessing federal facilities boarding federally regulated aircraft and entering nuclear power plants thereby limiting

entification card holders151 although uniformly accepted definition of na tional identification card exists it appears reasonable to argue that any such definition should include at minimum that all of the cards be facially identical and that they all be issued by the same federal governmental entity under this standard it appears difficult to argue that real id is or could potentially lead to national identification card moreover as discussed above participation by ither the states or individuals in real id is voluntary not mandatory in addition the act contains specific restrictions on dhss ability to regulate the design andor appearance of the card finally issuance will continue to take place on the state level not by any entity of the federal government issuance of drivers licenses and personal identification cards to noncitizens andor undocumented persons by statute real id establishes system of temporary licenses and identification cards that can be issued by the states to applicants who are not citizens of the united states but can present evidence that they are lawfully present in the united states152 accordingly 3721 of the final regulations implements these requirements153 thus noncitizens in the united states who can demonstrate lawful presence in the united states are eligible to apply for and receive real id s however the cards must be limited in validity commensurate with the time limit on th individuals lawful presence in the united states154 and must clearly indicate both on the face and machinereadable zone that they are temporary or termlimited recently some states oregon wa shington and maryland have had attention drawn to the fact that by stat law they permit the issuance of drivers licenses and personal identif ication cards

drivers licenses or personal identification cards ie new york and california it should be noted that even with the adoption and implement ation of real id the decision to issue drivers licenses or personal identification cards to persons regardless of their immigration status remains entirely with the issuing states in other words this choice of whom to issu nonreal idcompliant drivers licenses and personal identification cards to does not appear to be altered or preempted in fact the statute clearly contemplates the issuance of documents by states that do not comply with real id should states opt to do so the law requires only that the noncompliant documents use unique color iden tifier or design to alert officials that the document is not to be accepted for any official purpose thus it appears that states may opt to issue multiple documents and still be in compliance with the law for example as reported new yorks propos appeared to call for threetiered system with state departments issuing real ids in compliance with the regulations enhanced drivers licenses edls156 to citizens upon reque st and noncompliant drivers licenses and personal identificati on cards to those who either did not want or were not eligible for the other two types of documents157 such scheme while arguably costly and very complicated nevertheless appeared to be in full compliance with real id and ll other federal laws relationship of real id to ot her federal laws and programs western hemisphere travel initiative whti the western hemisphere travel initiative which can be found at 7209 of the irtpa requires that the secretary of homeland security in consultation with the secretary of state expeditiously develop and implement plan requiring that all travelers including citizens of the untied states produce pass port other document or combination of documents deemed by the secretary of homeland security to be sufficient to denote identity and citizenship when entering the united states158 the use of the conjunctive and generally indicates that both elements identity and citizenship must be denoted by the documents presented159 although real id contains increased security requirements for stateissued drivers licenses and personal identificati on cards these requirements appear to be focused on ensuring that the documents accu rately reflect identity real id does not appear to require that the licenses or identification cards in any way denote citizenship in the united states in fact as noted above real id contains specific provisions that permit the

authentic by the issu ing agency can demonstrate lawful presence in the country160 given the absence of requirements relating to citizenship it does not appear that standing alone drivers license or personal id entification card would satisfy the statutory standard establishe d by 7209 for acceptable documents to be shown upon entrance to the united states at this time however it remains unclear whether or not drivers license or pe rsonal identification car d in conjunction with other presented documents may be considered sufficient to denote identity and citizenship as required by th statute it should be not ed however that the use of stateissued drivers licenses or personal identification cards is not included in the final whti landsea rule issued by th state department and dhs on march 27 2008161 enhanced drivers licenses edls to implement whti dhs and the department of state have pursued the development of alternative identification documents that satisfy the standards as required by congress most notably whti requires that the documents shown denote both identity and citizenship to be compliant at the time whti was enacted the only usissued document that satisfied this requirement was pass port since whtis adoption several jurisdictions have expresse d interest in creating and issuing document known as an enhanced drivers license edl edls w ill contain on the face of the license as well as in the electronic components informa tion relating to the holders citizenship therefore making the document whti compliant currently the state of washington has pilot program in place that permits the issuing of edls to persons who provide verifiable proof of citizenship and pay an additional fee when they apply for issuance or renewal of their washingt on drivers license according to dhss final rule for whti landsea entry new york vermont and arizona are also states that have signed memoranda of understanding with dhs for edl pilot programs of their own162 although edls and real id are being imp lemented by the same agency there are two major differences between the programs first unlike real id edls require that the cardholder be us c itizen second edls will implement radio frequency identification rfi d technology whereas real ids are only required tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34430crs32 163 see supra note 124use twodimensional bar code system163 thus although the two programs are related they are not interchangeable it may be possible however for an edl to also qualify as real id provided that the document satisfies the requirements of both programs on the other hand just b ecause individuals have real id it does not automatically follow that they qualify for an edl or can use their real id as part of the whti program one way of thinking about the relationship between these two programs may be that some edls will comply with real id but not all real ids will qualify as whticompliant edls in other words only after careful review of the issuing requirements and document contents will one be able to determine whether specific stateissued drivers license or personal identification card qualifies under neither both or only one of the two programs
