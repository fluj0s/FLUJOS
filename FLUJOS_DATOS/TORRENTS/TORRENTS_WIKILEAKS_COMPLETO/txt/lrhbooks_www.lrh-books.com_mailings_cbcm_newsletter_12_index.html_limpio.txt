was told that i had less than two years to live he sent to two other doctors to verify his diagnosis and they all concurredi had arteriosclerosis and not much life left one doctor told youd better go home and write your will i was in despair i was 25 years old just newly married that year and it suddenly appeared that all my hopes and dreams for the future were now impossibly out of reach i had learned about l ron hubbards detoxification program and decided to do it thinking that perhaps getting the buildup of toxins out of my body would make things easier over the following months it never occurred to that it could help handle the problems completely three weeks later when i finished the program and went back to my doctor for another checkup he was absolutely astounded he said that the results were impossible and that even though two other doctors had verified his diagnosis he must have been wrong in the first place because what had occurred was medically impossible there was trace left whatsoever of the arteriosclerosis it was completely gone i have been healthy ever since i am happily married to the same man 23 years later we have wonderful 18year old daughter and i am achieving all of my hopes and dreams bw exposed to deadly poisonous gases toxins and agent orange this exmarine tells his story of recovery with the detoxification program prior to the program

of my body boy was i ever in for surprise during the program and after completion i had considered my environment dangerousi mean really dangerous as it was in the jungles of south vietnam but would you believe that i was still in south vietnam though i left it in 1969 i was fully brought out of it as well as oriented to my present environment by the program it really undercut everything i mean
