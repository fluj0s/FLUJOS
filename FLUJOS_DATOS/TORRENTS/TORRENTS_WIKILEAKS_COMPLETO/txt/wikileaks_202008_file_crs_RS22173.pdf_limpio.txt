detainees that might be transported to guantanamo bay will go before csrt the tribunals are administrative rather th an adversarial but each detainee has an opportunity to present reasonably available

their enemy combatant designations in march 2002 the pentagon announced plan s to create separate process for periodically reviewing the status of detainees8 the process similar to the csrt process

judge richard j leon agreed with the administration that congress in its authorization to use military force aumf14 granted president bush the authority to detain foreign enemy combatants outside the united states for the duration of the war against qaeda and the taliban and that th courts have virtually power to review the conditions under which such prisoners ar held noting that the prisoners had been captured and detained pursuant to the presidents military order15 judge leon agreed with the government that 1 non resident aliens detained unde r such circumstances have rights under the constitution 2 ex isting federal law renders their custody unlawful 3 legally binding treaty is applicable and 4 international law is not binding under thes circumstances judge leon rejected the petitioners contention that their arrest outside of afghanistan and away from any active battlefield meant that they could not be enemy combatants within the meaning of the law of war finding instead that the aumf contains geographical boundaries16 and authorizes the president to exercise his war power wherever enemy combatants are found the circumstances behind the off battlefield captures did however apparently preclude the petitioners from claiming their detentions violate th geneva conventions17 other treaties put forth by the petitioners were found to be unava iling because of their nonselfexecuting nature18 the court declined to evaluate whether the conditions of detention were unlawful judge leon concluded that while state of war does not give the president blank check and the courts must have some role when individual liberty is at stake any role must be limited when as here there is an ongoing armed c onflict and the individuals challenging their detention are nonre sident aliens19 he dismissed all seven petitions ruling that until congress and the president act further there is viable legal theory under international law by which federal court could issue writ in re guantanamo detainee cases20 us district judge joyce hens green interpreted rasul more broadly finding that the tainees do have rights under the us constitution and international treaties and thus denied the governments motion to dismiss the eleven challenges before the court specifically judge green held that the detainees are entitled to due process of law under the fift h amendment and that the csrt procedures do not meet that standard interpreting the history of supreme courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22173crs5 21 id at 465 citing hamdi v rumsfeld 22 id at 475 internal citations

part of its sovereign territory judge green concluded that the inquiry turns on the fundamental natu re of the constitutional rights being asserted rather than the citizenship of the person sserting them accepting that the right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law is funda mental constitutional right the judge applied balancing test to determine what process is due in light of the governments significant interest in safeguarding national security21 judge green rejected the governments stance that the csrts provide d more than sufficient due process for the detainees instead she identified two categories of defects she objected to the csrts failure to provide the detain ees with access to material evidence upon which the tribunal affirmed their enemy combatant status and the failure to permit the assistance of counsel to compensate for the lack of acce ss these circumstan ces she said deprived detainees of meaningful opportunity to challenge the evidence against them second in particular cases the judge f ound that the csrts handling of accusations of torture and the vague and potentially overb road definition of enemy combatant could violate the due process rights of detainees citing detainees statements and news reports of abuse judge green noted that the possi bility that evidence was obtained involuntarily from the accused or from other witnesses whether by interrogators at guantanamo or by foreign intelligence officials elsewhere could make such evidence unreliable and thus constitutionally inadmissible as basis on which to determine whether detainee is an enemy combatant judge green objected to the definition of enemy combatant because it appears to cover individuals who never committed belligerent act or who never directly supported hostilities against the us or its allies she noted that government counsel had in response to set of hypothetical questions stated that the following could be treated as enemy combatan ts under the aumf little old lady in switzerland who writes checks to what she thinks is charity that helps orphans in afghanistan but what really is front to finance alqaeda activitie s

detention of person solely because of his c ontacts with individuals or organizations tied to terrorism and not due to any direct invol vement in terrorist ac tivities would violate due process even if such detention we re found to be authorized by the aumf23 the dc circuit court of appeals is c onsidering the governments appeal with respect to the holding that the detainees ve enforceable rights

the secretary of defenses plan to try him for alleged war crimes before milita ry commission convened pursuant to the presidents military order hamdans attorney objected to the military commission rules and procedures which he argu ed were inconsistent with the ucmj and hamdans right to be treated as prisoner of war under the geneva conventions us district judge robertson agreed finding that the geneva c onventions apply to the whole of the conflict in afghanistan including under their protecti ons all persons detain ed in connection with the hostilities there25 accordingly he ruled hamdan was entitled to be treated as prisoner of war until his status was determined to be othe rwise by competent tribunal in accordance with article 5 of the third gene va convention prisoners of war the dc circuit court of appeals in an opinion wr itten by judge randolph reversed that finding ruling that the geneva conventions are not judicially enforceable26 and that in any event the military commission would qualify as comp etent tribunal within the meaning of us army regulations implementing the conventions27 judge williams wrote concurring opinion agreeing with the govern ments conception of the conflict with qaida as separate from the conflict with the taliban but construing common article 3 to apply to any conflict with nonstate actor without regard to the geographical confinement of such conflict within the borders of signatory state with respect to the presidents military order establishing military commissions the district court judge had found inherent authority in the president as commanderin chief of the armed forces to create such tr ibunals and that existing statutory authority for military commissions is limited interpreting the statute in light of the geneva conventions which permits the punishment of prisoners of wa r only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the detaining power28 judge robertson found congressional authority for hamdans trial under the dods rules for military commissions he found these rule s to be fatally inconsistent with the ucmj contrary to ucmj art 36 10 usc 836 because they give military author ities the power to exclude the accused from hearings and deny him access to evidence presented against him29 the circuit court reversed opining that congress did not mean that all of the ucmj procedural rules for courtsmartial should apply to military commissions instead the panel interpreted art 36 to mean that military commission rules have only to be consistent with those articles of the ucmj that refer specifically to military commissions however because the procedural rules to be used by the military commissions do not affect their jurisdiction it was unnecessary to resolve the issue at th interlocutory stage of the case the court left open the possibility that hamdan can challenge the procedural rules if he is convicted by the military commission possibly by bringing new habeas corpus petition in federal court
