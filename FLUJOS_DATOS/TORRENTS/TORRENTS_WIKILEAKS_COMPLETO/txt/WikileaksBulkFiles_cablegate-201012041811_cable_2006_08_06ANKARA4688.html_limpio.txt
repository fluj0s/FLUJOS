the pms circle to the fore classified by dcm nancy mceldowney reasons 14 b d 1c the longstanding split between the professional mfa diplomats and the tight circle of advisers around pm erdogan has widened noticeably in recent weeks this gap has existed under erdogans justice and development party akp government largely because of the close links that both pm erdogan and fm gul have with pm adviser davutoglu who has been willing to undertake numerous initiatives until recently however such strains have usually been more effectively papered over this internal debate now affects every step the got takes on the international stage 2c the turkish diplomatic corps is highly educated and well attuned to what will sell in the us or europe less so on the domestic political front pm erdogans core of akp advisers including davutoglu and the akp vice chairs understand what will play well with their constituencies their sense of how policy will play outside of ankara is handicapped however by their turkey and islamcentric vision of how they want the world to operate 3 cnf decoupling mfa from the pms advisers can produce greater willingness to take chances at the same time it can also create greater room for misunderstandings or wrongfooted efforts in the runup to the february 2006 hamas visit to ankara for example mfa was kept in the dark the akpers who dealt with the visit did so in haphazard and uncoordinated manner mfa uninformed was unable to preview it with us the backlash from the us in particular truly took akp aback it took weeks even months before limited understanding dawned on the depth of the displeasure the hamas venture had spawned and why it did not and still does not fit within their frame of reference 4 cnf most startling perhaps to akp were those in the us and elsewhere who in the aftermath of the hamas visit asked how akp would feel if we met with pkk leaders for erdogans circle it is not analogous for them terrorism equals the pkk it is difficult for pm erdogan to believe that his philanthropist islamic friend kadi could be involved in terrorist financing just as it is alien to their frame of reference to view specific islamic groups as terrorists hamas and hizballah are the result of western policies gone awry response from desperate people not truly terrorists allow them to talk reason to these people exert turkish influence and the hamases of the world will change this has been evident in other turkish efforts throughout the region as well with iran fm mottakis visit here erdogans talks with ahmedinejad on the margins of international conferences with syria the turks believe they were instrumental in getting syrias asad to agree to pull troops out of lebanon and to certain aspects of the hariri investigation with the current conflict in lebanon and the gaza strip 5cnf more recent example of the pm circlemfa disconnect involved davutoglus trip to damascus the first week of july where he met not only with asad but mishaal as well the mfa was cut out and furious their ambassador to damascus reportedly cooled his heels outside while davutoglu met with asad 6c as the israellebanon crisis intensified so has this tendency within erdogans small circle akp sees own its back to the public opinion wall instead of exercising leadership erdogan in populist preelection mode has followed he is playing to akps constituency to those within the party who have never been positively inclined toward israel and to the greater regional sunni audience that he is trying to court two early results aimed at these audiences were 1 the pms participation in the august 3 extraordinary oic executive council meetin in kuala lumpur where he again met with irnian president ahmedinejad and uttered strong antiisraeli statements and 2 fm guls august 3 oped piece in the washington post which aired got ire in an unhelpful way and blindsided the professional turkish diplomats in washington 7cnf complicit or not we believe the former gul has had his name sullied by number of these efforts he will have to decide whether to give the mfa renewed weight foreign ministry officials could be key in bridging certain delicate issues particularly cyprus with both the government and the military for example or go with the pms circle visit ankaras classified web site at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurankara wilson
