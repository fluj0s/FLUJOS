2005 the united states supreme court unan imously held that the preclinical use of patented inventions in drug research is exempted from patent infringement claims by the safe harbor provision of the

and lower the cost of some drugs for consumers in 2003 the us court of appeals fo r the federal circuit had narrowly construed the safe harbor provision as protecting only clinical research activities that produce information for submission to th food and drug administration fda in the regulatory process in vacating that decision the us supreme court ruled that the exemption applies to all uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the process of developing any info rmation for fda submission the court explained that under certain conditions the safe harbor provision is even sufficiently broad to protect the use of patented compounds in experiments that are not ultimately submitted to the fda or drug experiments that are not ultimately the subject of an fda submission finally the scope of the exemption is not limited only to preclinical studies pert aining to drugs safety in humans but also includes preclinical data regarding drugs fficacy mechanism of action pharmacokinetics and pharmacology however the court cautioned that the exemption does not reach all experimental activity that at some point however attenuated may lead to an fda approval process for example the sa fe harbor provision does not embrace basic scientific research perform ed on patented compound without the intent to develop particular drug or w ithout reasonable belief that the compound will cause particular physiological effect that the re searcher desires in addition because the matter was not at issue in the case the court expressly declined to decide whether or to what extent the exemption applies to patented research tools that are often used to facilitate general research in developing co mpounds for fda submissions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33114contents

the hatchwaxman act the statutory exception was created by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 19846 commonly known as the hatchwaxman act this legislation modified the patent act by creating new section 35 usc 271e that provide s safe harbor from infringement for pharmaceutical companies using patented inventions in their drug research and development operations the hatchwaxman act is widely credited with encouraging and expediting the creation and availability of generic versions of approved patented drugs prior to its enactment pharmaceutical companies had to wait until all relevant patents expired before undertaking the clinical research necessary to obt ain fda approval of generic equivalents7 thus an established drugs patent term was facto extended beyond its expiration date by the length of the fda regulatory process for approving the generic equivalent which took more than two years8 the hatchwaxman act allows generic drug manufacturers to conduc t safety and effec tiveness tests during the time the brand name drugs patent is still in force often resulting in immediate introduction of generic drug into th market upon the pioneer drugs

appropriate to create similar mechanism in the patent law that is all this bill does15 despite this deceptively simple language of purpose the safe harbor provision has been th subject of confusion

merck asserted that its actions involving the rgd peptides came within the commonlaw research exemption33 and the statutory safe harbor fforded by 271e1 the district courts decision in integra at the conclusion of trial the us district court for the southern district of califor nia dismissed integras claim for declaratory judgment and held that the commonlaw research exemption protected mercks

instructed the jury that for merck to prevail on the safe harbor defense it must prove by preponderance of the evidence that it was objectively reasonable for the company to believe that there was decent prospect that the experiments would contribute relatively directly to the generation of information likely to be re levant to the drug approval regulatory process35 the jury found merck liable

the fda but only ge neral biomedical research to identify new pharmaceutical compounds the fda has interest in the hunt for drugs that may or may not later undergo clinical testing for fda approval39 furthermore the court expre ssed concern that construing the safe harbor provision more expansively would effectively vitiate the exclusive rights of patentees owning biotechnology tool patents si nce patented research tools are often used in general research to identify candidate dr ugs and experiments on those drugs40 on january 7 2005 the us supreme court granted certiorari to review the court of appeals interpretati on of the safe harbor provision41 the us supreme courts decision in integra the question presented to the supreme court was whether uses of patented inventions in preclinical research the results of which are not ultimately included in submission to the food and drug ad ministration fda are exempted from infringement by 35 usc 271e142 in unanimous opinion written by justice scalia the court vacated the judgment of the federal circuit and held that the 271e1 safe harbor protected the preclin ical use of patented compounds as long as there is reasonable basis for believi ng that the experiments will produce the types of information that are relevant to an ind or nda submission to the fda43 the court explained we think it apparent from the statutor text that 271e1s exemption from infringement extends to all uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the development and submission of any information under the fdca this necessarily includes preclinical studi of patented compounds that are appropriate for submission to the fda in th regulatory process there is simply room in the statute for excluding cer tain information from the exemption on the basis of the phase of research in which it is developed or the particular submission in which it could be included44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33114crs8 45 id at 2381 we do not

52 integra 331 f3d at 86566 the court rejected integras argument that the scope of the safe harbor is limited only to preclinical studies pertaining to the safety of drug in humans45 since the fda requires an ind to be filed before human trials can begin ind applications must include summaries of drugs efficacy pharmacokinetics pharmacology and toxicological effects in animals46 this data would necessar ily have to be developed in preclinical studies information that is reasonably related to an fda submission and thus covered by 271e147 the court further disagreed with integras claim that mercks preclinical research is disqualified from safe harbor protection because the experiments were not conducted in conformity w ith the fdas good laboratory practices glp regulations two reasons supported the c ourts reasoning first the fdas glp regulations concerning prec linical studies apply only to experiments on drugs to determine their safety and not to studies of drugs efficacy mechanism of action pharmacology or pharmacokinetics second even nonglp compliant safetyrelated studies are suitable for submission in an ind when such studies are accompanied by reason for the noncompliance48 basic research not protected the court placed an outer limit to the safe harbor provision by endorsing the federa l circuits conclusion that the exemption does not reach all experimental activity that at some point however attenuated may lead to an fda approval process49 for example safe harbor does not embrace basic scientific research perform ed on patented compound without the intent to develop particular drug or without reasona ble belief that the compound will cause particular physiological effect that the researcher desires50 thus the boundary line between unprotected basic research and protected preclinical research is reached when scientist discovers that pa tented compound produces particular physiological effect through particular biological process51 the standard for r easonable relation in denying safe harbor protection for mercks preclin ical activities the federa l circuit had relied upon the fact that the scri ppsmerck experiments did not s upply information for submission to the fda but instead identified the best drug candidate to subject to future clinical testing under the fda processes52 the supreme court dismissed the appellate courts narrow interpretation of the reasonably related requirement in 271e1 such construction the court explained disregards the reality that scientific testing is process of trial and error

research tools research tools are defined as tools that scientists us in the laboratory including cell lines monoclonal antibodies reagents animal m odels growth factors combinatorial chemistry and dna libraries clones and cl oning tools such as pcr methods laboratory equipment and machines56 smaller biotechnology companies and universities that invent research tools are concerned that broader construction of 271e1 encompassing these tools w ill deprive them of licensing fees that they collect from larger pharmaceutical firms57 moreover some companies rely on such fees for their financial existence since many of these research tools have little commercial value beyond usage in drug research58 the federal circuit in integra had specifically identified this potential negative consequence for patented research tools in its support for more limited safe harbor the context of this safe harbor origin ally keyed its use to facilitating expedited approval of patented pioneer drugs alr eady

would swallow the whole benefit of the patent act for some cate gories of biotechnological inventions needless to say the hatchwaxman act was not meant to deprive entire categories of inventions of patent protection59 in its amicus curiae brief submitted to the supreme court the us government suggests that 271e1 does not ap ply to patented research tools60 t h governments brief explains that the safe harbor secti on by its own terms applies only to patented invention the patent act defines the term invention to mean any invention or discovery unless the context otherwise indicates61 the brief asserts that the context of 271e1 indi cates that congress ma not have intended to include patented research tools within the scope of the safe harbor exemption since most research tools are used to study or develop other compounds for submission to the fda regulatory approval process rather than being themselves the subject of fda regulatory review it is plau sible to conclude that research tools are not patented inventions within the meaning of the statute62 in integra the supreme court expressly declined to decide whether or to what extent the exemption applies to patented research tools since the matter was not at issue in the case the court explained that integra had never argued that the rgd peptides were used by merckscripps as re search tools and it is apparent from the record that they were not63 thus without definitive judicial determination from the court the use of patented research tools in drug research and development may or may not fall under the 271e1 exemp tion from infringement such uncertainty over the patent rights of makers of research tools could serve as source of continued confusion and litigation in this area concluding observations the original legislative intent behind the hatchwaxman act that created 271e1 was to facilitate the introduction of generic drug upon the patent expiration of the brand name drug however as the supr eme court explained in the eli lilly case that broadened 271e1 beyond generic drugs to the entire statutory scheme of fda regulationit is not the w that statute can have effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history64 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33114crs11 64 continued 1988 65 brief for united states as amicus curiae at 14 quoting bristolmyers squibb co v rhonepoulenc rorer inc

significant some observers argue that if the federal circuits opinion had not been vacated its narrow interpretation of the patent laws safe harbor potentially would have created chilling effect on the development of i nnovative pioneer drugs and new generic drugs limiting 271e1 to only clini cal research appears contrary to the objectives of the hatchwaxman act if drug manufacturer could not perform the preclinical studies needed to obtain fda approval to c onduct clinical studies the 271e1 exemption would never be reached because the underlying preliminary research and development work could not be undertaken without risking patent infringement liability65 the supreme courts more expansive c onstruction of 271e1 avoids this result since it will not always be clear to parties setting out to seek fda approval for their new product exactly which kinds of information and in what quantities it will take to win that agencys approval the safe harbor provision is needed to immunize certain preclinical studi that use patented compounds66 the court also provided an articulated standa rd for courts scientists drug companies and patent holders to follow concerning the scope of 271e1 coverage sa fe harbor applies if there is reasonable basis to believe that the preclinical experiments will produce information that is relevant to an ind or nda submission with the fda failure to meet this standard would constitute infri nging conduct not exempted by 271e1 by unanimous opinion the integra court has emphatically clarified that preclinical use of patented compounds in pharmaceu tical research is not categorically unprotected and can qualify for the patent laws safe harbor as long as it comes within this enunciate d standard however the integra court left unresolved the issu of whether research tools come within the scope of the safe harbor exemption it is important to note that integra does not affect the validity and value of patented research tools when they are employed in basic research or for pur poses unrelated to an fda submission67 yet the unauthorized use of research tools in the development of information for the fda regulatory process may cons titute
