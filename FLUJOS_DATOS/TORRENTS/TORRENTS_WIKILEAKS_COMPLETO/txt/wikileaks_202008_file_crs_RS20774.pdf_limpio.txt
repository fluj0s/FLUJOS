the existing rates are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential further once such finding is made as to existing rates the commiss ion must have record to support the new rate it establishes as just and reasonable7 in central louisiana electric company the commission identified the factors that it considers in determining whether undue discrimination exists the particular showing that is required to establish undue discrimination will necessarily turn upon the facts of each case including the characteristics of the customer class involved and the service requested as well as myriad other potentially relevant factors8 section 205 of the federal power act requires public utility to file rate schedule with the commission rate changes are not permitted unless public utility has filed new rate schedule with the comm ission the new rate schedule is made available for public inspection9 the commission may suspend the operation of new rate schedule and defer the use of new rates and charges for up to five months beyond the time when the changes would have gone into effect if the commission does not conclude its hearings concerning the proposed changes after this fivemonth period the changes shall go into effect however the commission has the authority to order the public utility to refund that portion of the increased rates or charges that it finds are not justified10 in east tennessee natural gas company v ferc the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit noted the commissions authority to order refunds if the commission has determined that the proposed rates are not justified11 in discussing section 4 of the natural gas act the court stated if the commission ultimately determinesthat the rates are not just and reasonable then 4 authorizes the commission to order that the pipeline pay refunds to any customers who purchased gas at the filed proposed rate thereby retroactively changing that rate allowing these retroactive reductions in filed rates is necessary compromise to accommodate delays in the approval process12 the natural gas act and the federal power act have been described as substantially identical in many aspects and cases brought under either statute are often used interchangeably13 just as section 205 of the federal power act allows the commission to review rates at the time of filing section 206 as discussed above provides for the review of rates already in effect following hearing the commission has the authority to determine thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20774crs4 14 16

properly filed rate or charge has in fact been unreasonably high or lowan existing rate is unjust or unreasonable and set new rate14 the commission may also establish refund effective date and order public utility to refund amounts paid in excess of the rates which would have been just and reasonable for the period subsequent to the refund effective date through fifteen months after this date15 courts have also recognized the commissions ability to order refunds for past periods when the commission has committed legal error for example in tennessee valley municipal gas association v fede ral power commission the commission erroneously dismissed claim brought under section 5 of the natural gas act16 the tennessee valley municipal gas association alleged that the rates charged by its supplier were excessive instead of investigating the matter the commission dismissed the claim on the basis that the record was too stale to form the basis for prospective ruling and that the initiation of section 5 proceeding was probably not in the public interest17 the court found that the commissions failure to reopen the matter for further hearings was legal error thus the court concluded that the tennessee valley municipal gas association must be put in the same position that it would have occupied had the error not been made18 further in office of consumers council v ferc the court found that the commission committed legal error when it failed to remedy violation of section 5 of the natural gas act19 although the commission found that certain clauses in columbia gas transmission corporations contracts violated section 5 it maintained that remedies were not necessary if columbias curren t practices did not violate section 5 the office of cons umers council of ohio and associated gas distributors argued that they were entitled to remedies beginning on the date of the commissions determ ination they contended that these remedies were within the prospective nature of section 5 relief the court agreed with the office of consumers council and associated gas finding that imposing the proper remedy retroactively to the date of the commissions determination would merely put columbias customers in the same position that they would have occupied had the error not been made20 although these two cases indicate that the commission has ordered refunds for past periods outside the periods provided by sections 205 and 206 of the federal power act the emphasis of legal error present in the circumstances of these cases must be considered the plain language of the two statutory provisions and judicial interpretation of them would seem to support the commissions limited ability to order refunds21
