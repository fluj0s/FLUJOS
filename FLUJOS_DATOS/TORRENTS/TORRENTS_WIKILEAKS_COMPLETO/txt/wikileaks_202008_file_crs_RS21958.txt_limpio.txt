wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21958 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs21958 government activities to protect the electric grid amy abel resources science and industry division february 4 2005 abstract the electric utility system is vulnerable to outages caused by range of activities including system operator errors weatherrelated damage and terrorist attacks the main risk from successful terrorist attack against the electric power industry would be widespread power outages lasting for an extended period of time while the electric utility industry has the primary responsibility for protecting its assets federal and state government agencies also have been addressing physical security concerns this report provides description of initiatives within the federal energy regulatory commission and the departments of energy homeland security and defense to protect the physical transmission infrastructure order code rs21958 updated february 4 2005 crs report for congress received through the crs web government activities to protect the electric grid amy abel specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21958 the electric utility system is vulnerable to outages caused by range of activities including system operator errors weatherrelated damage and terrorist attacks the main risk from successful terrorist attack against the electric power industry would be widespread power outages lasting for an extended period of time while the electric utility industry has the primary responsibility for protecting its assets federal and state government agencies also have been addressing physical security concerns this report provides description of initiatives within the federal energy regulatory commission and the departments of energy homeland security and defense to protect the physical transmission infrastructure it will be updated as events warrant the us electric power system has historically operated at such high level of reliability that any major outage caused by either sabotage weather or operational errors makes news headlines the transmission system is extensive consisting mainly of transformers switches transmission towers and lines control centers and computer controls spectrum of threats exists to the electric system ranging from weatherrelated incidents to terrorist attacks including physical attacks as well as attacks on computer systems or cyberattacks the main risk from weatherrelated damage or terrorist attack against the electric power industry is widespread power outage that lasts for an extended period of time of the transmission systems physical infrastructure highvoltage hv transformers are arguably the most critical component utilities rarely experience loss of an individual hv transformer but recovery from such loss takes months if spare is available conversely utilities regularly experience damage to transmission towers due to both weather and malicious activities and are able to recover from this damage fairly rapidly occasional outages resulting from these attacks generally have not been widespread or longlasting congressional research service the library of congress crs2 overview of government initiatives the electric utility industry is evolving to become more competitive at both the wholesale and retail levels the energy policy act of 1992 epact introduced wholesale competition in the electric power industry and subsequent federal energy regulatory commission ferc orders have encouraged the formation of regional transmission organizations to facilitate access to the transmission system1 in addition many states have moved to allow competition on the retail level reliability and infrastructure protection were not addressed in epact and state restructuring laws and there is currently federal regulation of electric network security2 until recently impacts of competition on physical and cybersecurity of the electric power industry were not part of the congressional debate3 the potential for terrorist attacks on the electric system has pushed secure operation of the grid into the federal policy arena from its traditional position as an industry responsibility in 1996 the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection was created to address concerns relating to the vulnerability of critical national infrastructures the commission issued report in october 1997 that described electric httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21958 power vulnerabilities the report stated of particular concern are the bulk power grid consisting of generating stations transmission lines with voltages of 100 kv or higher plus 150 control centers and associated substations and the distribution portion of those electric power systems where interruption could lead to major metropolitan outage4 in response to the commissions report president clinton signed presidential decision directive 63 pdd63 which outlines series of actions designed to defend critical infrastructures from various threats5 on december 17 2003 president bush issued homeland security presidential directive 7 hspd7 which supersedes portions of pdd63 and clarifies that the department of energy is the lead agency with which the energy industry will coordinate responses to energy emergencies however it has limited authority in the infrastructure assurance area the north american electric reliability council nerc an industry organization that promotes the reliable operation of the 1 ferc orders 888 889

coordinator for the private electric utility sector nerc retains responsibility for promulgating and overseeing reliability guidelines for the electric power industry but does not have enforcement authority compliance with these guidelines is voluntary for electric utilities as was seen in the august 14 2003 blackout reliability guidelines were not followed resulting in catastrophic consequences6 as electric utility sector coordinator nerc is responsible for assessing sector vulnerabilities and developing plan for the utility sector to reduce system vulnerabilities proposing system for identifying and averting attacks and developing plan to alert contain and deflect an attack in progress and then to reconstitute minimum essential capabilities in the aftermath of the attack as part of pdd63 information sharing and analysis centers isacs have been created in many critical sectors to facilitate the gathering analyzing and disseminating of information related to infrastructure vulnerabilities threats and best practices among government and privatesector organizations nerc operates the isac for the electric utility industry7 prior to the creation of the department of homeland security dhs coordination httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21958 of electric infrastructure protection activities was the responsibility of the department of energy doe portions of does energy infrastructure security and assurance activities including parts the office of energy assurance and the national infrastructure simulation and analysis center were transferred to dhs on march 1 2003 the department of energy retains responsibility for energy supply and demand issues energy reliability energy emergencies technology training and support coordination and energy policy the critical infrastructure protection functions of the department of homeland security are generally expected to include security issues threats and terrorism and critical infrastructure protection however according to both doe and dhs their responsibilities overlap on some energy security issues including emergencies vulnerability and critical assets8 even though dhs and doe have various responsibilities for infrastructure protection they have regulatory authority to force utilities to implement security initiatives critical electricity infrastructure information many in the industry have expressed concerns that proprietary information relating to infrastructure security could be made public if the information is shared with government agencies9 fercs order 630 allows access to certain critical energy infrastructure information ceii that is submitted to the commission that would otherwise be unavailable under the freedom of 6 uscanada power system outage task force interim report causes of the august 14th blackout in the united states and canada november 2003 7 see httpwwwesiaccom 8 office of energy assurance department of energy presentation to the state heating oil and propane conference august 11 2003 and personal communication with department of homeland security 9 another industry concern is that sharing information among utilities may raise antitrust problems crs4 information act foia10 the rule defines ceii as information that must relate to critical infrastructure be potentially useful to terrorists and be exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act but excludes from release information that identifies the location of infrastructure the rule also establishes procedures for the public to request and obtain such critical information and applies both to proposed and existing infrastructure in issuing its order ferc defined critical infrastructure as existing and proposed systems and assets whether physical or virtual the incapacity or destruction of which would negatively affect security economic security public health or safety or any combination of those matters11 proponents of fercs rules for ceii believe they will provide adequate protection for transmission owners filing security information in future rate cases and other proceedings some utilities remain concerned however that despite the ceii rules security information filed with ferc may still end up in the public domain so they have been reluctant to submit specific security information to the commission on february 20 2004 dhs established the protected critical infrastructure httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21958 information pcii program the pcii program is designed to encourage private industry and others with knowledge about critical infrastructure to share confidential proprietary and businesssensitive information with the us government dhs exempts from public disclosure all information given to the pcii program many government organizations and utilities maintain databases of critical infrastructure of the electric utility industry each containing different assets but none that identifies and locates all of the nations utility infrastructure in addition there is powerflow model for the entire united states that could in real time assess the vulnerabilities of regions to attacks on critical assets at issue in attempting to develop database of critical infrastructure is to define common parameters and purposes to assess the criticality of particular utility infrastructure without consistent criteria for what makes type of infrastructure critical either on regional or national basis database of assets would be of limited value dhs has compiled preliminary list of critical infrastructure in electric power and has circulated that list to certain infrastructure owners for their revisions among utilities there is some confusion as to why certain assets were included in the list since some assets that are listed are not currently being used and others do not support significant load12 in speech on february 23 2004 homeland security secretary ridge announced that by december 2004 dhs will create unified national critical infrastructure database that will enable us to identify our greatest points of vulnerability existing levels of security and then add increased measures of protection

communication with industry official september 29 2003 crs5 where needed13 dhs officials have shared draft list of critical infrastructures with some members of congress but an official database has not been created department of homeland security protective activities dhs has been addressing highvoltage transformer security within its protective security division psd but currently is not addressing transmission towers or control center security psd is developing national emergency energy spare parts program to ensure supply and support system to provide spares for the critical components in our nations infrastructure14 the program is initially focused on hv transformers although it will include other types of electrical equipment in the future as part of this program psd is building upon the electric power research institutes epris transformer activities to develop containerized hv recovery transformer that could fit in conventional international standards organization isocompliant shipping container for easy transport on flatbed trucks the division believes that such containerized hv transformers could not only serve as emergency replacements in wide range of network applications but could also be transported within few days in emergencies15 according to psd officials the division plans to fund the development of these transformers to demonstrate the technology but does not plan to buy stockpile of production units the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21958 divisions emphasis is on attack prevention rather than recovery16 psd expects designs for the containerized transformers to be completed by the end of 2004 according to psd the division intends to develop and implement buffer zone protection plans for critical power facilities including hv transformer substations these plans would seek to enhance security immediately around critical facility with measures such as road barriers and surveillance to deter or delay terrorist attacks according to psd local law enforcement agencies would be eligible for funding from dhs grants to states to support these buffer zone plans psd does not intend to evaluate or enforce transmission owners internal security programs for critical assets dhs is also developing grid monitoring capability17 more detailed information is not available from dhs department of defense the department of defense infrastructure and interdependency solutions branch is developing an extensive modeling capability for many critical infrastructures including for the electric utility industry when complete the model will include map of facility locations power plants power lines and substations this is intended to allow for identification of key links and nodes critical to the delivery of electric power to points or regions of interest according to the branch 13 secretary tom ridge speech on the oneyear anniversary of the department of homeland security george washington university homeland security

energy infrastructure broadly under homeland security presidential directive 7 the oea has expressed concern about system vulnerabilities and has been meeting informally with utility and transformer industry representatives to explore options for enhancing transformer security the office through two national laboratories is funding the development of software models to assist electric utilities in modeling catastrophic outages identifying critical network assets and performing vulnerability assessments of those assets19 it is not clear how or when the oea will transfer these modeling capabilities to industry for practical application state utility commissions state utility officials have begun to generally address critical electric power infrastructure in addition to cost recovery activities by the national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc critical httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21958 infrastructure protection committee few states such as new york have established dedicated offices within utility commissions to address utility security issues several states have developed lists of critical infrastructure to share with state and federal law
