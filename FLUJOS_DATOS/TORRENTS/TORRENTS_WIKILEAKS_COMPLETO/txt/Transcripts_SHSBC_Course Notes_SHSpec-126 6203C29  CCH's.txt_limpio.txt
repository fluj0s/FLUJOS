6203c29 shspec126 cchs the cchs were developed when the hgc in london was finding out that there were pcs that werent gaining and were getting results the cchs dont run things out the cchs familiarize the pc with control communication and havingness the pc does an upgrade on cchs in the teeth of the adage that the pc must be at cause actually there is gradient of causativeness from very slight at cch1 to considerable at cch4 the cchs are way to get the pc to sit there and look at something so he finds out he can confront it the pc becomes aware through familiarization that control communication and havingness are not necessarily horrible as the case goes downscale it gets to level where it is predominantly motivator and wont respond to anything else the person does not have an adequate enough idea of cause to be causative above that point persons cause can be increased easily below that point it can only be increased to the point of getting him to confront something going on someplace else that is where cchs take over instead of letting the pc run up further overts by being accusative and critical we get him to confront communication control and duplication just communication and duplication in itself gives case gain havingness is the concept of not being prevented from reaching or the concept of being able to reach havingness process is continuous duplication of being able to reach havingness wasnt quirk cch1 getting the pc to reach you enables him to communicate with the auditor it establishes the auditor as terminal this should get the pc being at cause he cogs that he can reach and will therefore communicate to you cch2 the pc has had his body running on machine for ages it operates all by itself cch2 lets the pc take over the automaticity of body motion that he has relinquished he does this knowingly cch3 this was developed to get the pc in the same communication time and space span as the auditor some people cant put dispatch on comm line because they cant tolerate distance on the line they always bring body cch3 gets the pc over the necessity to be touching something in order to feel in comm with it this is an effort at gradient how far can the pc be from the auditor and still be in comm for instance some people have to be there in person to deliver message cch3 lets the pc enter space into communication his causedistanceeffect has been one of minimal distance just causeeffect with distance so if the pc were in the auditors head he could be audited the pc gets the idea of communication by duplication cch3 enters space into the communication and some duplication the pc cogs that he can talk to the auditor and understand what the auditor is telling him to do keep it very simple the word contributed introduces the idea of cause you are gradually bringing him around to this idea that is why you ask if he contributed to the motion you dont care what he answers you are just planting the idea cch4 you are actively asking if the pc is satisfied that he duplicated the motion its the pc who should be satisfied not the auditor necessarily if the pc is satisfied when he hasnt really duplicated the motion the auditors only mistake is to contradict or criticize him or invalidate him if the pc is wildly off but says he is doing it find simple motion the pc will duplicate so he doesnt keep making himself into lier every time or get off the misduplicated motion for two or three turns and then come back to it he will eventually improve it he will get better the above is the only reason why cchs actually work it is peculiar fact about cchs that they dont even require the pcs agreement or approval to get gains from them they worked in 1956 then got altered to point where they didnt work because they had stopped being run as combination which is as important as how each is done individually if pc gets run on cchs when they are not producing change he gets the idea that he is being punished so you run it to three times through with change then go on to the next cch it is as important for the pc to not mind doing it as it is for him to do it perfectly the pc will start nut doing them on the auditors determinism running just cch1 for hours with change doesnt offer enough randomity to cause change that is the trouble you get into tackling each one just by itself the pc will run for two hundred hours on cch1 with results an exception is that you can only run cch1 on an unconscious person similarly with touch assist engram running you make that body lie on that bed and others with an unconscious person you should also cycle through three or four processes do the rotation and the case will unsettle go through cchs to get them to bite there should be enough randomity in it so it will bite otherwise it might just go on and on the cchs unflatten each other they are run tone 40 upper indocs are vital training eg put thought in that ashtray helps the auditor get thought into pcs head that is the way they should be run they are tone 40 process ie cchs 1 and 2 you lay the commands into the pcs head not necessarily even verbally just command the pc without reservation the cchs are nonverbal processes they could be run on deaf person they are action processes with common denominator of solids not thoughts so do them when you are not getting ta on thinkingness processes for several sessions if discussion of auditing produces ta motion consistently put the pc on cchs the pc in such case is not familiar enough with control communication and havingness to be willing or able to go into session fairly easily the other pc who should get cchs is one who gets ta on tactile havingness cchs are not only for psychotics though they are the only process you can run on psychotic cchs reach far higher than was previously realized the need to keep doing cchs as long as they produce change and stop doing one when it produces change goes in the teeth of time and the physical universes q and you would think you should change one when there is change and not change when there is change but this isnt so
