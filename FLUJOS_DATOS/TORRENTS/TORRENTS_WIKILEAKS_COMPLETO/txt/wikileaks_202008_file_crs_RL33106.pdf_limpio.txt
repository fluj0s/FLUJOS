discuss legislation in the current and past congresses that have been enactedborder security and the southwest border background legislation and issues introduction border security has emerged as an area of concern for many particularly after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks although recent concerns pertaining to border security may be attributed to the th reat of potential terrorists coming into the country past concerns that centered around drug and human smuggling and the illegal entry of migrants are still important issues as the southwest border increasingly becomes focal point due to its myriad of problems an issue for congress is how to successfully balance competing strategic goals while balancing the tactical policies to achieve these goals the strategic concern rests in complex question how do we balance the need fo r more effective border control with the needs of free trade and economic growth the tactical concerns focus on balancing increased resources such as an everexpanding workforce at the border with the use of technology and intelligence without comp romising the free flow of commerce and travel as congress and administration policymakers seek to achieve balance between the strategic and tactical concer ns the southwest border pose they do so during an unprecedented time of illegal migration across the border in an attempt to normalize the flow of needed workers across the border and address the economic imbalances in mexico and other parts of latin america that drive the push incentive structure of migration to the united states several bills have been introduced that would overhaul the us immigration system and tighten enforcement of us immigration laws in the interior of the country1 traditionally border manageme nt consists of securing the border at ports of entry through the inspections process as we ll as between ports of entry poe through the patrolling of the border by the border patrol increasingly border management particularly along the southwest border also involves enforcing immigration and other laws well into the interior of the c ountry this report disc usses border security related programs and initiatives that have an impact on the southwest border the programs and initiatives discussed are pr esented in twodimensional framework 1 enforcement efforts at the poe between the poe and within the interior of the united states and 2 programs and initiatives that facilitate the flow of people and goods across the border versus those initiativ that are geared towards controlling and

between the southwest and northern borders the us border with mexico is approximately 2000 miles long and is comprised of six mexican and four us states2 it features large tracts of desert land where temperatures average more than 100 degrees for part of the year includes mountain ranges and rugged terrain as well as the waters of the rio grande river the us border with canada on the other nd is more than twice as long as the southwest border and covers seven canadian provinces and 10 us states3 among the northern borders many challenging na tural features are vast mountain ranges such as the rockies the great lakes many different river systems and heavy snow and bitter cold temperatures in the winter although smaller by some 2000 miles th an its northern counterpart the southwest border exceeds the northern border with respect to the volume of travelers crossing it for example there were 173 million inspections conducted at southwest land ports of entry in fy2004 compared to 52 million at northern land ports of entry4 in addition to the volume of traffic at southwest land ports of entry the southwest border has longstanding history of illegal migration and human and drug smuggling activities on average the s outhwest border accounts for over 94 of all illegal alien apprehensions each year5 while efforts have been underway to strengthen both borders the southwest border efforts focus primarily on stemming illegal migration and human smuggling and interdicting illegal drugs while the northern border efforts focus on sharing information and streamlining policies

the countries over us military ac tion in iraq althoug h mexico ordered special troops to secure airports border posts and other access points to the united states when the military action began in ma

failures of the amo itself as well as other foreign and domestic counternarcotic operations according to amo this relationship can be seen for example where interdiction successes in central america

prevention through deterrence the strategys goal was to place border patrol agents and resources directly on the border in order to deter the entry of illegal aliens rather than attempting to arrest liens after they have already tered the country according to cbp achieving optimum deterrence would mean that increasing the number of agents and resources in sector would not necessarily result in an increase in the number of unauthorized migrants apprehended in that sector79 the prevention through deterrence policy was embraced by congress with both the house and senate appropriations committees in 1996 direc ting the ins to hire new agents reallocate border patrol agents stationed in the interior to front line duty and staff the interior offices with investigative staff instead80 as result of the massive buildup in ag ents and resources precipitated by the nsp about 90 of border patrol agents are deployed along the southwest border the majority of these agents are concentrat ed in nine border corridors that encompass the major travel arteries in the region and account for over 80 of the illegal migrant traffic in terms of apprehensions81 this deployment reflects the border patrols goal of rerouting the illegal border tra ffic from traditional urban routes to less populated and geographically harsher areas providing border patrol agents with tactical advantage over illegal border crossers and smugglers82 the former ins had claimed success in improving the quality of life in border communities along the affected areas as result of enforcement efforts83 as the border

ins the movement of illegal immigration away from urban areas and into more open spaces provides an advantage for border patrol agents in apprehending aliens see ins fact sheet ins southwest border strategy 87 for example the san diego border patrol s ector was one of the first sectors targeted by the strategy because it was popular crossing point for illegal immigrants as result of increase resources studies have shown the shift of illegal migration away from the san diego area to the deserts of centrocrime rate in communities bordering with mexico was 30 higher than the national average in 1990 but only 12 higher in 2000 the majority of th is improvement has come in san diego and paso which are the most populous communities along the border san diego and paso aside how ever most border coun ties crime rates did not decline as much as the national average between 1990 and 2000 this means that relative to the rest of the country most border communities were actually more crime ridden in 2000 than in 199084 this reduction in th overall crime rate along the border is seen by some as tangib proof that the prevention through deterrence policy is achieving its goal of reducing illegal immig ration and the crime it engenders others point out that the policy has shifted illegal immigration away from population centers in order to explain why crime rates fell relative to the national average in san diego and paso but increased in communities along the less populated stretches of the border it is unclear however whether illegal migration has declined along the southwest border85 the number of apprehensions typically increased in the areas that were targeted by the border patrol and subsequently decreased as enforcement ramped up some contend however that the increase in apprehension may simply be due to the concentration of manpower in these areas and subsequent decreases in apprehension can be attributed to the technological hardening of the border eg the erection of fences sensors and lighting while this may be the case it is also possible that the policy is indeed working and simply shifting the illegal migration pattern to more severe terrain where more migrants may be getting through despite the arduous nature of the trip as discussed below according to the administration conseque nce of the strategy has been shift in illegal immigration to more open areas86 for example efforts to secure the san diego and tucson areas have led to increased illegal migration in the western arizona area including the tohono oodham nation and several federal land areas as discussed below moreover po ssible unintended consequence of these initiatives is the danger posed by the shift of illegal migration away from urban areas to open more sparsely populated areas th at could be dangerous for the illegal immigrant87 in some cases illegal migrants have lost their lives or suffered injuries in an attempt to avoid being caught by border patrol

to enter through that sector93 while caution should be taken when attempting to draw conclusions about the efficacy of policy measures based solely on apprehensions statistics they remain the only way available at the moment to trace trends in illegal migration along the border while mexican nationals make up the majority of apprehensions at the sout hwest border 94 in fy2004 apprehensions of nationals from other countries have recently began to receive congressional attention figure 3 shows that the total number of unaut horized aliens pprehended by the border patrol along the southwest border increased steadily through the late 1990s reaching peak of 165 million in fy2000 th is increase in apprehensions occurred even as the number of personnel and resour ces deployed along the border more than doubled over that period the increase in pprehensions may have been due to the increased presence of agents and resources along the border or it may have been due to an increase in the number of aliens attempting to enter the united states in order to benefit from the rapidly growing economy during that period si nce fy2000 however apprehensions have been dec lining reaching low of 905065 in fy2003 this reduction could be attributed to number of factors for example the decline could signify that the prevention through deterrence strategy succeeded in placing enough agents and resources directly on th border to effectiv ely deter unauthorized migrants from entering the country howe ver the reduction also occurred during period of economic decline and mounting unemployment within the united states which may have contributed to the decrease in apprehensions during that time by discouraging wouldbe economic migrants httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33106crs27 source crs presentation of cbp data while figure 3 shows that the level of appr ehensions leveled off at around 900000 in fy2002 and fy2003 apprehensions in fy2004 rose by almost 250000 this is the first increase in apprehen sions since fy1999fy2000 this increase may suggest that despite the increase in ma npower and resources along the southwest border unauthorized migrants have not been deterred from attempting to illegally enter the country however analyzing border patrol apprehensions by sector complicates this analysis and sheds so light on the trends along the border figure 4 breaks down the southwest border apprehensions by sector this analysis suggests that the prevention through deterrence strategy has accomplished its goal of rerouting unauthorized migrant traffic from heavily populated areas to more remote areas the data show that in the late 1990s apprehensions decreased significantly along the california and texas sectors instead pushing out into the harsh conditions of th arizona desert along the tucson sector apprehensions in the tucson sector rose in the last years of the 1990s even as they declined in the traditional hotspots of sa n diego paso and mcallen

than they were before the nsp was instituted apprehensions in the yuma sector followed similar pattern they also increased in fy2004 and remain above their prensp levels the data seem to suggest that

overall apprehensi ons have increased by over 240000 or 27 from fy2003 to fy2004 this could suggest that the deterrent effect of focusing resources directly along the borde r has waned somewhat or that as the us economy began to emerge from sluggish pe riod that more aliens than before are attempting to enter the country in order to benefit from the increase in opportunities however this analysis is tempered by the observation that 76 184818 of the overall increase in apprehensions occurred in the tucson and yuma sectors in arizona in 2004 these sectors participated in the arizona border control abc initiative which significantly increased manpower and resources along the arizona border this could suggest that the increase in apprehensions is attributable to the increase in enforcement in those sectors dur ing the same period interestingly the only other sector to exhibit significant increase in apprehensions in fy2004 was the san diego sector in california which after seven years of decreases from fy1995 to fy2002 experienced backtoback incr eases in apprehensions in fy2003 and fy2004 however overall apprehensions in the san diego sector remain far below their

analyze the ratio between migrant d eaths and border patrol apprehensions this ratio shows how many unauthorized immigrant fatalities there are for every apprehension made by border patrol agent along the southwest border figure 6 shows that the mortality rate per appreh ension more than doubled in five years from16 deaths per 10000 apprehensions in fy1999 to 37 deaths per 10000 apprehensions in fy2003 however in fy 2004 the ratio declined to 28 deaths per 10000 apprehensions marking the firs t decrease since fy1998fy1999 the decline may be due to special measures to mitigate deaths emanating from several sources nevertheless it appears that as the pattern of unaut horized migration has shifted away from population centers to remote border regions that the migrant fatality rate has increas ed significantly from 1999 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 200401234figure 6 migrant morta lity rate per apprehensions source crs presentation of usbp data the border patrol has drawn criticism

the border safety initiative bsi in june 1998 the usbp launched bsi in part to address concerns about the increasing number of migrant deaths along the border the bsi is collaborative campaign with the mexican government that focuses on decreasing the lifethreatening dangers involved in crossing the border as part of the bsi the usbp produces television radio and print advertisements warning wouldbe migrants about the da ngers involved in crossing the border additionally the usbp maintains some water stations and rescue beacons in the desert and has increased border patrol agents in the areas that have been greatly impacted128 as part of the collaboration with mexico the usbp has trained over 1320 mexican firefighters and law enfor cement personnel in s ophisticated search and rescue techniques and cooperates with the mexican government to disrupt smuggling routes129 border patrol search trauma nd rescue borstar teams form an important part of the bsi these specialized rescue

to the issue of migrant deaths along th border is inadequate some humanitarian organizations such as humane borders samaritan patrol and the border action network have begun providing services to unauthorized migrants in order to decrease the dangers associated with the border crossing these services include maintaining water stations in the desert and providing medical supplies to aliens humane borders for example maintain s 50 water stations throughout the arizona desert while sister organization main tains 133 water stati ons in californias imperial valley130 additionally network of

through variety of means reportedly including sometimes apprehending unauthorized aliens along the border one such group american border patrol recently gained notoriety by launching an unmanned plane that uses cameras and gps technology to identify unaut horized aliens atte mpting to cross the border133 these groups have increasingly been targeted by human rights organizations for the tactics they allegedl use including threatening border crossers with firearms and wearing uniforms similar to those worn by the border patrol in the summer of 2003 two such groups ranch rescue and citizen border patrol curtailed their activities on the arizona border due to mounting publicity and concern about their practices including allegations that they were dressing like border patrol agents134 more recently the minuteman project in arizona drew national media attention to the problem of unauthorized migrati on the minuteman project drew hundreds of volunteers from across the united states to monitor stretch of the eastern arizona border with mexico near douglas in the tucson sector according to the minuteman organizers the project succeeded in dramatically reducing the flow of illegal immigration in arizona the usbp contests this claim noting that while apprehensions in eastern arizona d eclined from 24842 in april of 2004 to 11128 in april of 2005 apprehensions in we stern arizona increased from 18052 in 2004 to 25475 in 2005135 usbp officials also stated that the volunteers were disrupting their operations by unwittingly tripping sensors deployed along the border forcing

tive impact that these groups have on securing the border some argue that th groups are vigilante organizations that are taking the law into their own hands and that their operations can conflict with those of border patrol agents others c ounter by contending that these groups are harmless and provide va luable assistance to the border patrol by identifying and sometimes capturing unauthorized migrants in congressional testimony some border patrol officials have discounted the overall impact of vigilantes along the border137 it is not clear if or to what extent the operations of these civilian patrolling groups present an obstacle to the border pa trol or danger to unauthorized migrants illegal migration and indian country several indian reservations are located near the usmexican border and few including the tohono oodham reservation in arizona and the kicka poo reservation in xas are directly connected to the border while federal authorities routinely patrol the border in these areas the indian tribes quasisovereign status presents some unique challenges to those guarding the border138 the question of which law enforcement authorities state federal or tribal have adjudicatory jurisdiction in indian c ountry is not easy to answer as the answer can change according to the civilcriminal nature of the offense the seriousness of the offense the tribal status of those i nvolved and the state in which the offense is committed for example the supreme court ruled in the landmark 1978 case oliphant v suquamish indian tribe 139 that indian tribes do not possess criminal jurisdiction over nonindians as the c ourt put it by submitting to the overriding sovereignty of the united states the tribes necessarily give up their power to try nonindian citizens of the

crosscommissions continuedas result of oliphant several federal statutes141 and other supreme court cases reigning in tribal civil jurisdiction142 tribal adjudicatory jurisdiction is very limited in many instances forced to yield to the power of state and federal authorities143 oliphant in particular has led some to question the authority of tribal police to arrest and detain nonindians144 for practical purposes in the border patrol context however tribal law enforcement authorities are not as constrained as they may be in other areas one reason for this is that as part of their limited sovereignty tribes possess the authority to expel non members from reservations for violations of tribal trespassing restrictions145 in addition while trib courts may lack the power to try nonindians tribal poli ce possess the power to detain suspected offenders for pickup by state or federal authorities146 and tribal authorities on reservations on or near the usmexico border routinely deta in undocumented aliens udas with that purpose in mind147 still because they possess only limited aut hority many tribal law enforcement groups also lack the resources funding and training of state nd federal officials148 in addition many reservations particularly those in the southwest are in remote locations far from the nearest police or bor der patrol station one method that has been used sparingly to get around these di fficulties is the crosscommission of tribal officials by state or federal authorities so that these official s may arrest nonindian criminal suspects under state or

ports have less than 25 of required space 40 ports have between 25 and 50 of required space and 13 ports have between 50 nd 75 of the space required221 improving the infrastructure at land ports of entry however may prove to be challenging for example the majority of facilities at the nations land border have limited space in most cases the federa l government cannot immediately expand existing

to the mexican side of the border224 more recently however dhs has piloted two different types of repatria tion programs both aimed at making it more difficult for the illegal alien to return to the united states see discussion below lateral repatriation in an attempt to discourage unauthorized migrants from attempting to recross the border when they are returned to mexico in september 2003 the border patrol instituted pilot program that airlifted aliens from the arizona border to texas the border pa trol originally had attempted to reach an agreement with mexico to re patriate aliens to the inte rior of the country but when the mexican government declined to participate the agency instead began to involuntarily repatriate aliens laterally fro m arizona to texas the texas border poses challenge for wouldbe border cro ssers due to the rio grande river and the number of border patrol agents stationed along it the border patrol chartered two airplanes in tucson for the pilot prog ram with an overall cost of 13 million225 the lateral repatria tion program ran for 24 days in september of 2003 and repatriated over 6200 unauthorized migrants apprehended in arizona to four cities along the texas border paso l rio laredo and mcallen226 according to cbp the pilot program led to an 18 decline in pprehensions in the tucson sector and led to only one migrant death during the period compared with 10 migrant deaths during the same period in 2002227 proponents of the program point to the reduction in apprehensions and the low incidence of migrant deaths in arizona during its operation as proof that the lateral repatriation program is an effective way to discourage unauthorized alie ns from immediately attemptin g to reenter the country while simultaneously saving lives the mexican government objected to the program claiming that the cities on the mexican side of the border in texas were not equipped to handle the influx of returnees228 additionally some us lawmakers

unauthorized mexican aliens to the interior of their country230 eight years later on june 9 2004 the white house announced it had reached agreement with the mexican government to begin implementing the interior repatriation program this agreement grew out of the previously mentioned late ral repatriation pr ogram which was unpopular in mexico and featured the involuntary repatriation of mexicans apprehended along the arizona border to the texas border the interior repatriation program is departure from the current practice of returning aliens to the mexican side of the border and is aimed at reducing the number of aliens who immediately try to cross back into the united states due to constitutional constraints in mexico the apprehended aliens return to the interior must be voluntary231 and the willingness of their participation will be certified by mexican consular officers232 during the pilot phase of the program which ran through septem ber 2004 14058 aliens were re patriated at

program in fy 2006 within the ice appropriation233 ices role in repatriation as discussed above th border patrol has the authority to repatriate certain mexican nationals in its classic form repatriation was usually done by the border patrol by simply turning the mexican national back to the mexican side of the border with the implementation of both the lateral and interior repatriation programs resources were drawn from ice unlike cbp ice has the resources to detain illegal aliens until they can be repatriated to mexico moreover because ice already has removal program in place it

interrelated certainly questions have been raised pertaining to the feasibility of combining these two functions several proposals to restructure ice nd cbp have been advanced and include creating new agency that would contain the immigration enforcement functions236 and consolidating ice nd cbp into one bureau237 critics of the status quo contend that by consolidating cbp and ice coordi nation and sharing of efforts between the two bureaus would be better facilitated moreover the ease of obtaining information from the counterpart bureau would be strengthened238 these organizational concerns

however th data suggest that the vast majority of illegal migrants apprehended at the southwest border are mexican nationals who are either seeking employment in the united states or reunification with their families congress and the nation have begun debate on whether current immigration policy is effective in stemming the flow of illegal migration to the united states several themes emerge in the discussion so believe that the best way to address the flow of illegal migration at the southwest border is to change immigration policy to allow more illegal aliens present in the united states to attain legal status239 proponents of this view contend that the majority of illegal liens who enter the country do so to work240 for several years legislation has been introduced that would provide legal alternative for prospective foreign workers241 supporters argue that such an alternative would he lp reduce unauthorized migration moreover some employers are eager to have lowcost labor critics however contend that such program would likely exacerbate the problem of illegal migration and point to the growth in unauthorized migration following the immigration reform and control act of 1986 that legalized illegal aliens and reformed the guest worker program242 regardless of where one stands on the issue there appears to be consensus that immigration interior enforcement including worksite enforcement should be an integral part of the policy prior to the 2001 terrorist attacks immigration interior enforcement received under 30 of the formerins resources243 since the terrorist attacks ices resources have increased pa rtly due to the counterterrorism emphasis and the consolidation of other agencies such as the us customs service another critical piece to stemming the fl ow of illegal migration to the united states is the mexican economy especially in the sendi ng regions of the country several studies have shown that the majority of the illegal migrants from mexico come from several economically prived regions of the country244 while the united states has entered into partnerships with mexico to strengthen their economic growth see above discussion on usmexic relations many believe that more needs to be done to stabilize these communitie s while the discussion in this section and throughout the report has focused on th problems at the southwest border it is important to note that the same types of issues do not exist at the northern border primarily due to ca and the united states not having the same pushpull factors because of the economie s being somewhat equivalenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33106crs61 in conclusion as the number of illegal liens that are present in the united states continues to grow attention will likely continue to be directed at the border and the enforcement of immigration laws within the interior of the country dhs has launched several initiatives aimed at apprehending illegal aliens and dismantling human and drug smuggling organizations despite these efforts the flow of illegal migration continues issues such as enforcement of immigration laws and organizational issues such as inter and intraagency coopera tion coordination and information sharing continue to be bated in the view of some more comprehensive approach that addresses the push factor s of the sending countries and the pull factors of the united states coupled with more effective enforcement of current laws in the interior of th country may once again merit examinationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33106crs62 245 included in the
