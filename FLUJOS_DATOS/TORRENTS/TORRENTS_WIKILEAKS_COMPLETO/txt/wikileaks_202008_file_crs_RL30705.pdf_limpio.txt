land were provide d under the articles of confederation as early as 1785 there was however little development in the system until the 20th century certain conditions existed during the late 18th and 19th centuries that limited federal aid to states and localities du ring the precivil war era proponents of states rights and minimalist national govern ment prevailed during this period the transmississippi west consisted largely of federally administered territories indeed more than half of the transmississippi west entered the union after the civil war the postcivil war era was one of cor porate dominance and weak government despite these conditions the federal gove rnment did provide aid to states and localities on an ad hoc basis to address natural disasters civil disturbances westward expansion and the need for internal improvements the grantsinaid system began to take its current form in the early 20th century financial grants created during the 1910s included grant mechanisms such as matching requirements and conditions which are now common in grant programs in the 1930s president franklin roosev elts administration prompted by the conditions of the great depression wo rked with congress to accelerate the development of the grantsinaid system as part of the new deal program of social relief financial reform and economic recovery the grantsinaid system again grew significantly during president lyndon johnsons great society in itiative of the 1960s many of these programs were specifically focused on urban areas and disadvantaged populations the nixon administration and congress initiated changes in the system emphasizing block grants as well as estab lishing general revenue sharing program that distributed funds to state and local governments virtually without programmatic requirements the reagan administration also worked with congress on substantial change consolidating dozens of categorical grants into broader block grants and slowing the growth of the grantsinaid system since the reagan initiatives there have been few significant changes in the grantsinaid system one grantrelated issue the 110th congress has considered was the use of block grants for disaster recovery pl 110116 the 110th congress may also wish to consider issues such as consolidation of grant programs methodologies and formulas used to calculate grant

awarded not only to states and localities but in some cases to private corporations just as they are today early grants frequently came in the form of land as well as mone for example the land ordinance of 1785 enacted under the articles of confed eration required every new township incorporated from federal lands to reserve one lot for public schools1 the need to help victims of civil disturbance and disasters prompted the federal government to provide assistance to communities for example following the whiskey rebellion in 1794 the federal government compensate d individuals who could prove they had suffered losses2 when the town of alexandria virginia burned in 1827 congress quickly appropriate d 20000 in assistance3 which equates to approximately 362143 in 2007 dollars after inflation conversion4 in 1790 the newly established govern ment under the constitution set precedent for federal aid by assuming state revolutionary war debts treasury secretary alexander hamilton proposed the id ea suggesting that it would establish sound credit rating for future governmental borrowing5 the antifederalists mostly from southern states hotly contested the idea arguing that it made the new federal government too cen tralized superseded states rights and rewarded speculators6 ultimately the federal government assumed the debt but only after placating the southern

internal improvements in 1819 in which he set forth criteria by which the national government should evaluate improvement projects he stated that federal assistance should be granted for pr ograms immediately beneficial to more than half of the states of the union and which without the aid of the federal government would requi re their cooperation8 calhouns plan also called for using the surveying and planning resources of the army corps of engineers9 one reason congress was partial to awardi ng land grants instead of funds was that land was plentiful in the antebellum period whereas money was not most early land grants were for transportation projects for example congress granted land and surveying services for the intracoastal waterway which was intended to provide means of transporting goods without nece ssitating travel along the hazardous ocean areas off the eastern seaboard the waterw ays original plans called for using canals to link all major rivers east of the mississippi providing yearround travel in the american east10 in addition to canals and waterways land grants were also made for roads and railroads in some instances the fede ral government awar ded land to private corporations building railroads in other instances rightofway grants were used in which the federal government retained ownership but permitted other entities to undertake internal improvements for ex ample the national or cumberland road was surveyed and constructe d at federal and later st ate expense from cumberland maryland to vandalia illi nois between 1811 and 185011 the american migration westward during the 19th century provided many examples of early grantsinaid although grants generally applied to individuals corporations and territories since most of the states of the tran smississippi west did not enter the union until after the civil war the movement west greatly depended on aid from federal troops w ho provided law enforcement protection and constructed

of most national politic ians for example president franklin pierce 1853 1857 vetoed an 1854 act supported by reform er dorothea dix to allocate funds to states to help the indigent insa ne pierce contended that if congress is to make provision for paupers the fountains of charity will be dried up at home and the several states inst ead of bestowing their own means on the social wants of their people will become humble suppliants for the bounty of the federal government reversing their true relation to this union13 in rare instances the national government assisted states and localities with social service projects that were beyond the resources of single localities for example in 1817 congress awarded land grant to the hartford deaf and dumb asylum in connecticut whic h was intended to educate deaf persons the asylum founded by advocate thomas hopkins gallaude t resulted from joint effort by six new england states as well as several c hurches it was eventually renamed the american school for the deaf and it rema ins the nations oldest school for the hearing impaired14 grantsinaid during the late 19th century the outcome of the civil war had significant impact on the future of the grantsinaid system after the war states rights advoc ates lost considerable ground to the view that the constitution and federal law empowered the federal government to take wide range of measures deemed necessary and proper to attain the goals of the constitutions preamble measures that set the stage for the development of the grantsinaid system many years later15 during and immediately following the war congress passed several acts that expanded federal involvement in the states congress supported westward expansion with the pacific railroad act of 1862 whic h enabled the government to charter railroad corporations that constructed transcontinental railroad16 the morrill act of 1862 provided land grants for the estab lishment of landgrant universities focusing on

consider it the prototype for later grantsin aid because of its uniform application and success17 in the latter half of the 19th century congress also authorized the first financial grant for states and localities that targeted specific segment of the population based on need in 1879 congress authorized f unds for the distribution of education materials for blind students in an act to promote the education of the blind18 this act purchased and distributed reading materials to public institutions for the education of the blind using formula based on the institutions number of blind students the practice of targeting gran ts however would not become common until the early 20th century notwithstanding these examples governmental activity at both the state and national levels remained at low levels during the years following the civil war the 14th amendment was adopted in 1868 for the pur pose of protecting the rights of freed slaves but the courts generally interpreted its due process clause to be barrier against state action in social and economic problems this reduced the states abilities to respond to new and burgeoning problems generated by the rapid industrialization of the late 19th century governmental inactivity in this period contributed to the development of philos ophies of governmental intervention and preemption that would be applied early in the 20th century19 early 20th century the presidents in office during the last three decades of the 19th century were generally cautious about exercising ex ecutive authority president theodore roosevelt 19011909 however used the powers of the presidency to greater extent than any of his immediate predecesso rs he believed that strong executive branch was necessary to address the pr oblems of the industrial

president theodore roosevelts extens ive use of power may have inspired changes in the federal system after he left office for example some analysts point to the weeks act of 1911 as the first exampl of modern grantinaid in the act congress authorized the secretary of agri culture to cooperate with any state or group of states when requested to do so in the protection from fire of the forested watersheds of the navigable streams21 despite its appr opriation of only 200000 observers consider it landmark in the development of the grantsinaid system because it contained several mechanisms that became common in future grants including conditioning the receipt of federal f unds on approval of state plans requiring matching state funds and specifying the oversight role of federal officials22 congress established pattern of financial grants to states in 1914 by passing the smithlever act which distributed millions of dollars in agricultural assistance to states23 within 10 years of passage

constitution differently in his 1908 book constitutional government in the united states wilson wrote the question of the relation of the states to the federal government is the cardinal question of our constitutional system it cannot indeed be settled by the opinion of any one generation because it is question of growth and every successive stage of our political and economic development gives

new deal programs still in existence are the tennessee valley authority which pr ovides electric power and formerly administered infrastructure projects and social security which provides income security to american workers the federal emergency relief act of 1933 fera had longlasting impact on the grantsinaid system31 it was the first grant to the states for the express purpose of providing

assistance to individuals concentrated more authority and responsibility at the federal level supreme court decisions that upheld new deal programs cemented this concentrating effect by permanently expanding the federal governments role in policy areas that had previously been within the states domain or were not addresse d by government at any level37 president roosevelt summarized his approach

grants with the exception of two block grants in the fields of health and law enforcement42 some new categorical grants also addressed environmental concerns such as water and air pollution significant number of these programs such as the model cities and demonstration cities program concentrated federal assistance on urban and metropolitan areas as well as minority and disadvantaged

assistance in addition to that now author ized by the urban renewal program and other existing federal grantinaid programs is essential to able cities to plan develop and conduct programs to im prove their physical environment 44 although categorical grants to state and local governments were the dominant form of assistance enacted during th 1960s congress and the president also established other approaches to achievi ng national goals in 1966 for example congress encouraged regional approaches to governmental challenges by requiring all recipient governments to coordina federal progra ms with regional clearinghouses which often took the form of regional planning councils45 this requirement led to the creation of om b circular a95 which was the primary instrument of intergovernmental coordi nation until 1983 congress directed regional clearinghouses which received federal pla nning grants to prevent duplication of services and improve deve lopment planning one ob server of regional

terrible tangle of categorical grants plagued by overlapping programs inefficiency excessive administrative requirements and im position of federal priorities on state and local governments49 his primary goals were to improve program efficiency decentralize decision maki ng to states and calities and restrain program growth president nixon advocated new federalism implemented through general revenue sharing and special re venue sharing general re venue sharing sent funds to state and local governments with virtually programmatic requirements the goal of general revenue sharing was to comb ine the advantages of national revenue collection with the advantages of local discretion over spending50 representative melvin laird of wisconsin was pioneer in the field introducing revenue sharing bill as early as 1958 walter heller chai rman of the council of economic advisers in the kennedy and johnson administrati ons proposed general revenue sharing in 1960 as potential use of federal

special revenue sharing which merged the funding of func tionally related categor ical programs into large allocations distributed to states these programs were intended to give the states broad discretion in ddressing the functional areas53 special revenue sharing was similar to block grants but required application and had fewer programmatic strings congress however favored bloc k grants over special revenue sharing and modified most of nixons special re venue sharing proposals to block grant programs54 one such nixon proposal was dopted as the community development block grant program cdbg which rema ins one of the federal governments primary development programs although president nixon intended to volve greater degree of decision making to states and localities the changes that occurred during his administration have been credited with ultimately expanding federal intervention in state and local governmental activities55 the new block grants and re venue sharing gave the federal government more influence over state and local decision making because the federal government placed conditions on the use of f unds funds could be reduced or withheld if the recipient government failed to meet certain specified conditions some observers believe that since block grants and ge neral revenue sharing brought federal aid into many communities for the first time new federalism enabled the federal government to have more influence over american society than ever before56 the administration of president ronald reagan 19811989 also pushed for grant changes these efforts differed from those of the nixon administration in that they sought not only to decentralize grant administration to state and local governments but also to reduce funding lter priorities in the grantsinaid system and reduce federal governmental regulato ry power that had developed through expansion of the grant system presiden t reagan supported the block grant as means both of disengaging the national g overnment from policy areas he viewed as state and local concerns and of reducing spending57 president reagan was initially successful in his efforts the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1981 consolidated 77 categorical programs into nine block grants obra reduced total grant outlays to state and local governments by 6 billion below the previous fiscal year most of the budget cuts came in the areas of education job training and welfare there was however little change after the first two years of his administration the growth rate of the
