labor such as bonded or sl ave labor certain hazardous conditions or occupations and work by very young children some ilo members are concerned that the proposed ne w convention will be too narrow

nference discussed new child labor convention which addresses the worst forms of child labor convention 138 would remain the basis for protecting underage workers the language and contents of the new

fundamental principles and ri ghts at work this declaration states that all ilo members agree to adhere to the principles of the seven core conventions regardless of their state of development or whether they have formally ratified the conventions although the united states had hoped for agreement by all members by consensus the vote was 273 to 0 thirty countries 8 labor delegates and 5 employer delegates abstained from voting the us employer and worker delegates supported the declaration the ilo members also agreed to establish procedures for annual reports on the seven core conventions by l countries which have not ratified them comment s on these reports by labor and employer groups will be included count ries which have ratified the conventions report to the ilo at time intervals established by the various conventions the annual reports will be used to oversee how well countries are complying with the principles but there is stil l widespread disagreement over how the reports will be reviewed and used by the ilo in his june 1997 report to the member s the ilo director general also proposed the development of soc ial label for goods which are produced by countries found to be in compliance with core standards by independent international inspectors this proposa l was very controversial among members with industrialized countries supporting an d developing countries opposing such social label social labeling is increasingly bein g encouraged by consumer groups and by some governments us contribution shortfalls in fy1998 the united states contribute d the full amount owed to ilo for calendar 1997 the fy1999 appropriation covered nearly th entire assessed amount appropriations short falls during the last 10 years have left th united states about 29 million in arrears to the ilo but the amount fluctuates as the exchange rate changes from day to day the ilo constitution requires that l members pay an agreed portion of the budget the us share is currently set at 25 congres s funds the us contribution to the ilo through the department of state appropriations in the contributions to international organization s cio account part of title iv of the annua l commerce justice state appropriation bill th cio account funds many agencies and non httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97942crs5 agencies such as nato and the organization of american states the ilo contributio n is the fourth largest in this account as part of efforts to reduce the budget defici t congress has cut spending for the cio account the reduction is made more severe becaus contributions to some international agencies such as international atomic energy agency and nato have been protected from the cuts requiring even greater reductions for the remaining agencies in addition contributions to the ilo are set in swiss francs rather than us dollars so changes in the exchange rate also affect the u s assessment even after money has been appropriated the department of state as well as the us labor an d employe r delegates have long been concerned that the us arrears make it much mor difficult for the united s tates to achieve its foreign policy objectives in the ilo including reform of the agency increased emphasis on core labor standards and concentration on child labor agency reform us proposals to reform the il mirror us efforts at the united nations focusing on budget reduction and transparency elimination of waste and effective oversight hr 1757 the fy1998 authorization bill as passed by congress required reform measures befor any arrears payments could be made this included changes in the ilo budget and reductio n of the us assessment to 20 hr 1757 passed both houses but due to disagreement between the house and the administration over abortion language unrelated to the agencies the president vetoed the bill appropriations b ills have included arrears funds but they also require passage of an authorization bill and thus the reform measures before the arrears may be paid in march 1999 new ilo director general juan somavia of chile will take office his election was s upported by the united states as the person most likely to continue the reforms needed in the ilo hr 1757 the bill authorizing contributions to the ilo contained series of reform benchmarks which must be met before any payment of arrears may be made these includ reduction of the us assessment to the ilo from 25 to 22 in 1999 and to 20 in 2000 in addition the ilo must establish an independent inspector general similar to the u n inspector general and heshe must prepare regular reports to the members the ilo must adopt program evaluation procedur to establish the continued effectiveness of programs and terminate programs longer needed the ilo must establish clearer budget procedure s and not exc eed budget levels agreed upon at the beginning of the biennium except b consensus of members finally th ilo must approve 20002001 budget which is lower than the 199 81999 budget another provision of the bill which sets the total us contribution to agencies in this account at 900 million may ultimately require greate r reductions in us contributions or withdrawal from one of the larger agencies us government reform propos als for the ilo focus on clearer budget presentation budget reduction elimination of waste and overlap and effective member oversight in all these reform areas the department of state judges the ilo as one of the more reformminde d organizations according to the department of state the ilo has made changes in budge t format w hich have begun to address the us desire for clearer budget presentation but have long way to go in other areas such as reduced printing costs and meet ing expenses the ilo has made substantial progress according to the department of state efforts to establish program priorities and eliminate internal duplication and low priority programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97942crs6 are being addressed the ilo governing body adopted amendments which tighten financia l oversight and the agency does have internal and external audits in all these areas th administration expects the new director general to continue the progress made under the current one in its february 1997 report on us participation in 5 agencies gaonsiad97 2 the gao estimated that when inflation and the exchange rate are taken into account the ilo budget declined 2 in real terms between the 199495 biennium and the 199697 biennium this resulted partly from action taken by the ilo governing body to reduce expenditure s after the budget was adopted in view of the unlikeliness of full us contributions the united states canada argentina and israel vote d against the 199697 budget the june 1997 international labor conference approved 2year 19981999 budge t of 481 million 375 reduction in constant dollars from the previous biennium accordin g to the department of state under its normal procedures the ilo conference will not addres s assessments again until the june 2000 ilo conference until that time the u s assessment will remain 25 and the ilo is unlikely to qualify for arrears payments under currentl proposed provisions of reform legislation us ratification of ilo conventions the united states has ratified 12 of the 176 ilo conventions of the 12 two have never entered into force because not enough government s ratified them the small number of ilo conventions ratified by the united states has long been matter of diplomatic concer n for many member states particularly us failure to ratify the core human rights labor conventi ons the united states has ratified only one of the core conventions 105 on forced labor ano ther 111 prohibiting discrimination in employment was sent to the senate for consideration on may 181998 lack of ratification has historically been due to concern within congress that ratificatio n would undermine the us legislative process in domes tic matters since treaties become the law of the land concern that the division of authority between states and the federa l government for labor standards would be undermined and opposition from much of the us business community nonetheless lack of ratification inhibits the us ability t encourage wid er observance around the world of the standards set by them according to the department of state when the united states returned to the ilo in 1980 after 2yea r absence one of the changes adopted by the administration was the establishment of tapils the tripartite adviso ry panel on international labor standards this panel composed of labor business and us government members was established to provide more systema tic assessment of ilo conventions by all concerned parties with the goal in mind of increasing us ratification of ilo conventions five convention s have been ratified since the process began including one of the core human rights labor conventions number 105 which prohibit s forced labor number 111 which prohibits discrimination in employment has been cleared for ratification by the presidents advisory committee on the ilo following favorable report by tapils clearance by this committee means that there are legal impediments to implemen ting the treaty under us law in january 1997 then labor secretary reich recommended that the convention be submitted to the senate for approval
