tactical recovery and exploitation tarex the physical act of seizing both documents and media equipment that appear to ve potential intelligence value document exploitation docex the exploitation of capture d enemy documents for potential intelligence value media exploitation medex the exploitation of seized media equipment for potential intelligence value1 background think for moment how you would feel if four of your marines were killed by an ied and you found out that the insurgent who killed them had recently been in us custody we had him and we let him go we let him go and he killed four of your marines what would you give to be able to go back in time to the day the insurg ent was first captured and gather the evidence necessary to keep the killer detained train now for sensitive site exploitation and on the day the insurgent is first detained you will gather the evidence necessary to keep him locked away and you will bring those four marines home alive2 exploiting captured enemy ma terial is vital to the us war effo rt in any conflict this process provides actionable intelligence fo r frontline units and tangentia lly can provide information to use in an information operation io campaign to mold public opinion another use of captured enemy material has evolved that of providing evid ence to keep enemy combatants incarcerated properly exploiting captured enemy material requir two essential tasks proper search and seizure techniques at the target and timely exploi tation of the captured material at headquarters during the invasion of iraq in 2003 and the march toward baghdad innumerable potential sensitive sites were uncovered not being experts at identifying sites mari ne units identified and reported those sites that struck them as being dangerous or of interest to the sensitive site exploitation teams sst however due to the overwhelming volume of sites uncovered during the attack ssts were over extended and layed in arriving at the designated areas for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 7therefore attacking units were tasked to provide security on the sites until the ssts could arrive this resulted in multiple detachments from being left behind until appropriately relieved as their parent battalions continued to attack forward3 ssts remain high demand low density asset and maneuver units can be key in the captu re of enemy documents and other material the issue marine corps tactical operations in iraq must wo rk in concert with the iraqi legal system as detainees captured by marine units are turned over to the iraq i courts the exploitation of captured enemy material by marine units is vital pa rt of the detainee proce ss if marines are to keep insurgents detained they must provide ev idence to the iraqi courts from these exploitation efforts marine corps operational forces are not able to properly detain potential enemy because units do not have the capability to process captured personnel and ma terial the vast majority of detainees captured by marines ar released soon afte r capture since they do not have the evidence to justify their continued detention th is topical report will address captured enemy material and its role in the tainee process it will also make recommendations in training processes and equipment to enhance ma rine corps war fighting capability enemy detainee processing detainee process during the conduct of modern military operations members of the armed forces of the united states must be prepared to detain wi array of individuals who fall into one of several different categories including enemy prisone r of war epw terrorists and civilians regardless of the category or stat us of detainee us forces must be prepared to properly control maintain protect and account for all categories of detainees in accordance with applicable domestic law international law and policy4 the process of controlling maintaining protec ting and accounting for detainees is complex and most marines have only limited visibility of other th an that portion of the process that pertains to their daily duties marines assigned to infant ry battalions to regiona l detention facilities rdf to the mef staff and to multinationa l force iraq mnfi each see portion of the process but they may not be awar of how their actions during capture of detainee can impact on the eventual confinement or release of an indi vidual unless evidence is collected at time of capture and evidentiary and accountability requireme nts are met insurgents can be set free to return to fight again af ter temporary detention detention requirements us military leaders require significant amount of evidence to keep suspected insurgent in custody such policy is intended to protect innocent civilians who get caught up in security sweeps from being detained for prolonged pe riods however processing and evidence requirements can also make it difficult to substant iate charges against captured insurgents as result significant numbers of insurgents are freed from incarceration ac cording to the national detainee reporting center in the past year there have been over three hundred confirmed cases for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 8of former detainees being recaptured in iraq in th past year some of these former detainees were recaptured after attacking us forces and killing marines many of these former detainees would likely have remained in custody if documen ts captured with them had been exploited in timely manner5 enemy material processing since confidential sources of information leading to capture of insurgents often will not testify and interrogations in iraq have seldom led to co nfessions physical evidence gathered at the time of capture is key to ensuring insurgents remain in detention this physical evidence must be carefully collected by maneuver units conducting sse during raids and the captured material must be processed through an exploitation center at headquarters to identify what items can be used as evidence as previously noted the detainee process is complex and it takes significant amount of evidence to keep suspected insurgent behind bars when captured emy material is not exploited insurgents can be rel eased soon after capture the first steps of the detainee process are executed by maneuver elements although marine s are not expected to be police detectives servicing crime scene they can be trained to conduct proper search nd seizure techniques units conducting raids and other offensive actio ns must capture enemy documents computers pocket litter and other material enemy material is of potential evidentiary or intelligence value within each battalion sensitive site exploitation team sst can be trained and equipped to properly exploit raid site captured enemy material that is transferred to the mef is usually sent to multina tional force iraq mnfi headquarters in baghdad and then it is sent to defense intelligence agency dia document exploitation docex facility in qatar and there is seldom any feedback to maneuver units on whether the material was used or re viewed or whether ma terial contained any actionable intelligence additionally some former detainees are proven to be insurgents by documents that are exploited af ter the detainee has been released according to the national detainee reporting center there have been over 300 confirmed cases of former detainees being recaptured in iraq in the past year 2005 three of these detainees have been recaptured third time some of these former detainees were reca ptured after attacking us forces with roadside bombs many former detainees would likely ve remained in custody if documents captured with them had been exploited in timely manne r the documents were not exploited because there was exploitation center and hence detainees were released for lack of evidence6 operation fajr november 2004 one exception to this inefficient process of hand ling captured material occu rred in november of 2004 when marines augmented by mnfi set up temporary exploitation center during operation fajr the temporary exploitation center was located at camp fallujah iraq in 2004 this exploitation center was organized into four sections including an evidence locker document exploitation section media explo itation section and production section this organization proved to be very effective the cg of i mef considered the exploitation center successful endeavor as it resu lted in actionable intelligence for maneuver units and in the for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 9continued detention of hundreds of insurgents i mef could not sustain the effort however and the exploitation center was closed upon co mpletion of kinetic ope rations in fallujah7 iraqi court system requirements meeting iraqi judicial requirements for proof that crime has been committed has been challenge for coalition forces judges in iraq have great latitude in deciding the guilt or innocence of detainees and may choose to implemen t standards laid out in any of three often conflicting sources the 1971 iraqi law on criminal proceedings religious texts or precedents established by prior cases the iraqi lega l system does not recognize many western legal concepts and is based not on the more familia r western adversarial system but upon judge directed investigatory system8 the bottom line is that iraqi judges tend to demand overwhelming physical evidence before deciding to keep suspected insurgent detained at the same time even some cases backed by str ong evidence have been thrown out by judges exercising their judicial discreti on the rules assume functioni ng iraqi legal system which is almost nonexistent in some areas th is results in little more than catch and release program marines are risking their lives c onducting raids only to have detainees released in matter of weeks with captured documents that might have served as evidence sitting in boxes not being read by anyone9 aftermath of abu ghraib the abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib pris on in november of 2003 resulted in policy memorandum from headquarters combined join t task force seven cjtf7 on 13 may 2004 regarding interrogation and detain ee handling on 9 june 2004 1s t marine division clarified the cjtf7 policy by publishing fragmentar order 13904 which addressed detention operations detainee handling and interrogations marines in ira q must move detainees they have captured from forward operating bases to regional detention facilities rdf within 18 hours from there detainee is either moved to the central facility at abu ghraib within two weeks for his case to begin moving through the iraqi justice system or he must be released detainees moved to abu ghraib be gin the judicial review process current guidelines require that the evidence coalition forces assemble against captured insurgent include two sworn st atements describing the crime photographs of the target diagram of the site of capture and any contraband discovered along with completed apprehension form and evidence voucher meeting the time limit imposed on us forces for assembling case against each suspected insurgent in custody is difficult and s ometimes does not allow time for adequate in terrogation or investigation10 witnesses can longer include confidential sources that have pr ovided crucial tips and tactical intelligence to us forces witnesses must be publicly identif ied and their credibility must be established before an iraqi court demanding that confidential tipsters be exposed and their backgr ounds scrutinized is bad idea in fighting the counterinsurgency campaign acknowledging these changes one officer in iraq asserted we will never get th support of the population when they risk their lives to give us information and when the ssion is over 14 days later the insurgents are released we are now putting the in formants life and family at risk11 for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 10timelines and changes in evidentiary requirement s require prompt exploitation and processing of captured enemy material as poten tial evidence to support continued detainment of insurgents raid unit operations during rct7s movement north to baghdad many elements happened upon ammo caches suspicious substances and storage sites that were subsequently classified as sensitive sites by higher headquarters units recei ved guidance or training on th appropriate actions to take if sensitive site was uncovered the 5 cs c onfirm clear cordon control check were published by division well after the rcts movem ent north the 5 cs while appropriate for use in downtown urban america they are not ap propriate for combat units in an everchanging combat environment12 the first critical task in sse is executed by maneuver units units must be manned trained and equipped to conduct sse sse teams in the infant ry battalions search ra id targets and capture enemy documents computers and other material with proper training marines will recognize what enemy material is potentially valuab even without the aid of linguist process for handling captured enemy pers onnel and material in iraq actual step 1 infantry battalion raids target nd detains suspected insurgents humint exploitation team het conducts sse to gath er enemy documents computers and other material step 2 within 18 hours of capture infantry battali on sends detainees and captured material to regional detention facility rdf at either asad qaim fallujah or ramadi for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 11 step 3 the rdf has 14 days from the date of capture to either release the detainees or send them to central detention facility currently abu ghraib prison where the case enters the iraqi court system the interrogators and linguists at the rdf generally dont have time to read the captured documents so the documents sit in boxes and aw ait disposition step 4 the combined review and release boar d crrb located at the central detention facility reviews the case and makes recommendati on to the central criminal court of iraq if there is enough evidence to warrant sending the tainee to trial the case is forwarded to the iraqi court system in cases where there is t enough evidence for trial the detainee can be held as security detainee for up to 18 months unless the crrb releases the detainee before the 18 month time limit hundreds of these former detainees have proven to be insurgents and are subsequently recaptured after attacking marines step 5 if the case is forwarded to trial the case is tried by an iraqi court the central criminal court of iraq has convicted half of the detainees sent to tr ial the rest are released13 infantry battalion ttps some infantry battalions have not been trained or equipped to conduct proper sse thereby leaving holes in the intelligen ce gathering process due to lack of sse training marines often do not maintain proper accountabil ity of captured enemy material captured material is often lost and potentially valuable informa tion is lost along with the material sse teams one lesson from oif recommends that each infant ry battalion designated to conduct search and seizure raids be augmented with an sse team sst the sst should be designated in writing and the sst leader will coordi nate with the tactical comma nder to plan the sst mission prioritize rooms for search with in the site maintain accounta bility and custody of captured material and if intelligencereportable information is discovered inside the site to ensure the sst writes and disseminates spot size position observation time report the sst members video tape photograph and draw sketches of the site additionally the sst members will conduct the search bag and seize items as re quired the sst will ensure that captured enemy for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 12material is maintained with proper chain of custody procedures the sst must have the necessary equipment to follow established procedures including ziplock bags marking material and videotaping equipment14 tunnel teams conducting sse in tunnels involves considerations not typically encountered when searching building the tunnel team carries pistols as larg er weapons may collapse sections of tunnel and damage eardrums after the team has exited the tunnel they may choose to throw colored smoke grenades into the tunnel in order to identify any additional tunnel entrances or air vents tunnelcave exploitation can be very timeconsumi ng plan to spend lot of time exploiting this kind of target15 ssts have developed solid techniques of prioritiz ing and conducting room searches the more significant lesson may well be how to recognize what is of value as result of the room search having an interpreter accompany the search team is recommended but when one is not available collect all documents technical drawin gs financial documents currency and fire arms and material that may be used in making xplosive devices gloves doorbells cell phones remote controls and othe r electronic devices are16 magtfgce headquarters ttps the second step to addressing ficiencies in the current proc ess must be executed at the regimentaldivisionmef headquarters level at least one of the headquarters should have dedicated exploitation center to process captured material th mef in iraq currently does not have resources to man an exploitation center as in terpreters and intelligence analysts are in high demand with low numbers to support the myriad missions in iraq marine air ground task force magtf and regimental headquarters s hould establish collection points where their maneuver units deliver captured enemy material personnel at these ce ntral collection points must then conduct document exploitation docex and media exploitation medex to gather intelligence and to find material evidence that might keep insurgents detaine d exploitation center because the mef in iraq is currently unable to man complete exploitation center large volumes of captured material remain unproce ssed lacking an exploitation center maneuver units have central collection point to deli ver captured enemy mate rial and boxes of enemy documents often go unread processing this material is critical requirement if the intent is to break the catch and release cycle an xploitation center can be established at the headquarters level and manned by marines or ctors the exploitation center will help to maintain proper chain of custody procedures to include tagging all captured material maintaining proper accountability and establishing an evidence locker with an assigne d custodian items taken from the evidence cker are signed out through the custodian17 for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 13recommendations marines will continue to conduct offensive operations that present the likelihood of disclosing enemy material that could serve as evidence to support prolonged detention of enemy personnel in order to enhance the marine corps ability to identify apprehend and detain enemy personnel the following recommendations are offered establish an exploitation center in the mef area of operations in ir aq if marines are not available man the exploitation center with contract ling uists and contract intelligence analysts train iraqi security forces isf to conduc t sensitive site exploitation and document exploitation prepare isf personnel to ma n the exploitation center as necessary18 process further recommendation is to follow the process depicted below recommended process for handling captured enemy personnel and material in iraq step 1 infantry battalion raids ta rget and detains suspected insu rgents an sst made up of marines from cihumint radi battalion cid eod and the combat camera unit gathers enemy documents computers and other material step 2 within 18 hours of capture the infantry batta lion sends detainees nd captured material to the rdf step 3 captured material is passed to the mef divisionregiment exploitation center for processing information resulting from the exploi tation of captured enemy documents is provided to interrogators at rdf to aid in interrogations as evidence is gathered reports on any actionable intelligence are provided to infantry ba ttalions to develop new targeting data step 4 detainees are moved to the central detention facility crrb reviews the case and determines whether there is suffi cient physical evidence to justify sending the case to court the case is forwarded to the central criminal court of iraq where the physical ev idence collected at the exploitation center can be used to convict and jail the detainee19 for official use only mccllkddv7_1 for official use only 14equipment the last element in
