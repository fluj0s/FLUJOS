proscribed weapons programmes there can be doubtthat the prompt action taken by the council to call in the permanent representative of iraq to authorize press briefing by the councils president and to agree to meetagain within matter of hours if satis factory solution was not found was decisive in obtaining iraqs decision to permit full inspection of the facility to proceed under circumstances

right of immediate unconditional and unrestricted access forpurposes of inspection to any and all areas facilities equipment records and meansof transportation has resulted in the resolution of situation which if prolongedcould have given rise to much more rious confrontation iraq by refusing access to the facility concerned was in violation of its obligations under the ceasefire and related resolutions of the council in si milar circumstances in the past the council has characterized such refusal as material and unacceptable breach ofresolution 687 1991 unless the commission s rights in respect of access are fully respected it will be unable to discharge its mandate to ensure that iraqs proscribed weapons and facilities have been disposed of in the manner required by the council it

like to clarify to you and to th members of the security council the facts concerning the inspections carri ed out by unscom 143 during the period 7 to 17 march 1996 and the information relating thereto conveyed to the council bythe executive chairman of the special commission in his letter dated 9 march 1996 document s1996182 copy of which you made available to our permanentrepresentative first 1 inspection operations commenced in accordance with the provisions of resolution 687 1991 in may 1991 and have continued until the present timeduring that period inspection teams reque sted access to the headquarters of any ministry on only two occasions the fi rst was in 1992 when an inspection team requested access to the headquarters of the nistry of agriculture leading to long controversy between the iraqi author ities and the special commission that controversy was settled by an agreement between and the executive chairmanof the special commission on an appropriate arrangement for entering the ministryheadquarters upon entering the represen tatives of the special commission did not find any of the items they alleged to be there the second incident was the one which took place on 8 march 1996 when the chief inspector of unscom 143 requested access to the ministry of irrigationafter discussion lasting several hours between our representatives and thevicechairman of the special commissi on who was in baghdad at the time i telephoned the executive chairman of the special commission mr rolf ekeus and we reached agreement on an appropriate arrangement for entering the buildingonce again the team did not find what it d alleged to have been in the building missiles missile components and large boxes of documents 2 on 11 march 1996 the same inspection team requested access to the headquarters of an institute for training th republican guards in this case i also telephoned mr ekeus who was then in london and agreed with him on anappropriate arrangement for entering the bu ilding the inspection team entered the building and did not find any of the materials alleged to be there 3 on 14 march 1996 the same inspection team asked to visit one of the headquarters of the special guards an appropriate arrangement for entering thebuilding was agreed upon between the iraqi officials concerned and the chiefinspector the same thing happened on 15 march 1996 when the chief inspectorrequested entry to site belonging to the republic guards after entering these two sites the team did not find any of the materials it alleged to be therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs41 4 during the said period the inspection t eam in addition to the aforementioned headquarters visited nine other sites without any problem second it is clear from what is indicated bove that the delays which occurred before the aforementioned four inspection operations took place were due to the fact thatthe headquarters which the inspection team as ked to inspect were of special nature such as ministry and the headquarters of establishments that have specialcharacteristics relating to national security it is worth mentioning that since the inci dent at the ministry of agriculture in 1992 104 inspection teams have discharged their tasks without requesting access toany headquarters or establishment of natu re similar to that of the headquarters which the last chief inspector requested to enter matter which caused us both surprise and concern in july 1993 during mr ekeus visit to baghdad we reached an agreement under which the inspection teams should while discharging their tasks under theprovisions of resolution 687 1991 respect iraqs sovereignty dignity and national security this was confirmed in paragraph 16 of the joint report of the two sidesdated 30 november 1993 document s26825 which stated as follows as regards iraqs concerns relating to respect for the sovereignty internal security and dignity of the pe ople and the state of iraq and iraqs right to industrial scientific and technological progress and development in allfields not covered by the prohibitions contained in resolution 687 1991 the commission and iaea stressed that it wa s their intention to implement the plans in the least intrusive manner cons istent with effective monitoring and verification in the circumstances prevailing with all due regard to thelegitimate concerns of iraq noted above in accordance with the charter of the united nations third the other reasons for the delay in permitting access to the four sites were 1 the iraqi side was surprised by the request to inspect the sites which has for many years been without precedent this required contacts among the concernedofficials to study these requests with view to taking the appropriate positionthereon 2 the request to enter the headquarters of the ministry of irrigation was made at 9 pm on friday 8 march 1996 which wa s weekend similarly the request to enter the headquarters of the republi can guards was presented on friday 15 march 1996 to conduct inspections on w eekend would certainly lead to delay in contacting the officials concerned as mentioned in paragraph 1 for them to returnto their offices to study the situation in order to deal with ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs42 3 entry into any site which an inspecti on team requests requires the presence of the official in charge of the site nd suitable number of personnel in order to answer the questions of the inspection team to provide the keys of rooms lockers and stores and to meet other requirement s which would enable the inspection team to carry out the inspection all this requi res time particularly when the inspection activities are carried out during weekends or after working hours 4 discussion between the iraqi side nd the chief inspector with view to reaching an appropriate arrangement for entering building and carrying out theinspection operation without touching upon matters that do not relate to the dutiesand tasks of the special commission takes time particularly when some sites arevery large and contain many facilities of di fferent kinds the chief inspector also needs time to contact his principals in order to secure their approval of thearrangement reached with the iraqi side 5 taking into consideration all these pract ical factors relating to ensuring the efficiency of the inspection the delays wh ich occurred and which have been referred to in the letter of the executive chairman of the special commission were longer than the time necessitated by these practical factors in addition i twice contactedmr ekeus by telephone on one occasio n in london in order to reach an understanding on the basis of the special commissions undertakings with respect to iraqs sovereignty dignity and national security and of iraqs obligations underthe relevant resolutions fourth the allegation that the delay in granti ng access to the said headquarters raises doubts as to whether materials alleged to ve been therein might have been removed or disposed of is refuted by the following facts 1 normally the requests of the inspecti on teams are as in the aforementioned cases for nonotice inspection ie the team reaches the site it seeks to inspectwithout advance notice 2 once the inspection team arrives at the designated site the inspectors surround the site from all directions 3 the inspection team which carried out the recent inspections consisted of more than 50 members with 16 vehicles numbe r quite sufficient to surround the building from all directions and to control its entrances and exits 4 at the same time that the inspection t eam arrives at site the helicopters of the special commission start flying over the s ite to ensure that nothing is moved out of the site 5 the helicopters photograph the site befo re during and after the inspection it is possible by comparing the photographs to ascertain whether any large equipment may have been moved by trucks corresponding to the size and weight of suchequipment this was particularly so in the case of the last inspection team whichwas searching as it informed us for missiles missile components missile launchershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs43 and large boxes of documents during th recent inspections helicopter overflight of the site was interrupted briefly on tw occasions for 2030 minutes for reasons of fuel shortage which logically does not llow any major change in the status of the site 6 it is very easy for the inspection teams to verify whether some documents were burned for these practical and technical reas ons the allegations that there was probability of change in the status of the site or of the removal of some equipment from it and the burning of some documents are not realistic fifth jumping to the conclusion that what ppened in the last few days constitutes pattern of impeding the work of the special commission is quite wrong andbaseless in the name of the government of iraq i reaffirm that the iraqi authorities have intention of impeding the tasks of the special commission in iraq on the contrary we have affirmed on the highest vels that we are keen to continue the relations of understanding and joint work w ith view to fulfilli ng the tasks of the special commission as soon as possible th is has been confirmed by all the recent reports of the special commission as i reiterate this affirmation i expect theexecutive chairman of the special commission and its representatives whiledischarging their duties in iraq to adhere to their undertakings towards iraq byrespecting iraqs sovereignty dignity and national security i also expect thesecurity council to deal with this issue in an objective manner which would balanceiraqs obligations towards the security council and the councils obligationstowards iraq in accordance with the principl of the united nations charter and the provisions of the relevant

2 the original team was composed of staffan mistura team coordinator peter fodor austria surveyorengineer and wolfgang eichel austriasurveyor 3 upon arrival after meeting with the government of iraq the team was joined by two additional fullfledged members jaakko ylitalo deputy director united nations special commission unscom and gerard essertel specialist in photoanalysis unscom 4 at the same meeting the team asked and obtained from the government of iraq that it would have access to the government of iraqs relevant maps and have the government of iraq clearly define the perimeters for each presidential sitedefined and identified as such by the government b it could use helicopters to overfly any presidential site as required by the team c it could take aerial and ground photographs of each site and each building as wished by the team 5 the team concluded its physical surveys at 230 pm on 18 february 1998 and worked daily from 630 am to 1100 pm ii implementation of the terms of reference 6 the timetable available to the mission was extremely short for such distant and different sites the mission was able to accomplish the following tasks listed inthe second paragraph of its terms of reference definition on largescale maps of the perimeter of all eight presidential sites as identified by the government of iraq b determination of the approximate number size character and purpose of structures existing within each site 7 for purely timerelated reasons the mission was unable to elaborate on the maps the exact location of the buildings within each site since it gave priority totasks and b and also because some main buildings were already identified onthe original maps 8 on the other hand the mission went beyond its terms of reference by actually physically

visited internally 11 the same procedure applied for sites 7 and 8 except that they were not overflown for two reasons the use of helicopters in the extreme north orsouth was considered by the united

and verification issues established pursuant to the note issued by the presidentof the security council on 30 january 1999 s1999100 is submitting itsreport to the security council in accordance with paragraphs 1 2 3 and 4 ofthe aforementioned note i mandate composition working methods and plans of work 2 the panel was constituted in the context of increasing concern among security council members with the interruption of united nations activitiesin iraq in the area of disarmamentongoing monitoring and verification inparticular since middecember during the discussions in the month ofjanuary security council members felt that it was urgent to consider theparallel objectives of reestablishing an effective presence of the unitednations and the international atomic energy agency iaea in iraq in the areaof disarmamentprevention of development of proscribed weapons and addressingthe humanitarian needs of the iraqi people in parallel the issues ofprisoners of war and kuwaiti property were also brought to the fore 3 on 30 january 1999 the security council decided that it would be useful to establish three separate panels on iraq and to receive recommendations fromthem later than 15 april 1999 in paragraph 2 of document s1999100 thesecurity council invited ambassador celso l n amorim of brazil to chair eachof the panels 4 the constitution of the panel on disarmament and current and future ongoing monitoring and verification was defined in paragraph 4 of documents1999100 which reads as follows the first panel on disarmament andcurrent and future ongoing monitoring and verification issues would involvethe participation and expertise from the united nations special commissionthe international atomic energy agency the united nations secretariat andany other relevant expertise the panel would assess all the existing andrelevant information available including data from ongoing monitoring andverification relating to the state of disarmament in iraq 5 as announced by the chairman on 12 february 1999 the first panel was composed as follows ichiro akiyama jacques baute kaluba chitumbo roncleminson rachel davies jayantha dhan apala charles duelfer roberto garcia moritan gennady gatilov gabriele kraatzwadsack hideyo kurata liu jieyijohan molander jack ooms daniel parfait gianpiero perrone horst reepspaul schulte tom shea and nikita smidovichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs113 6 the panel met from 23 to 27 february and from 22 to 27 march taking into account paragraph 3 of document s1999100 the chairman heldconsultations with panel participants and members of the security council onappropriate working methods and plans of work the panel decided that itshould assess from technical point of view and broad perspective thework of the united nations and iaea in iraq in the area of disarmamentongoing monitoring and verification of proscribed weapons to this end thepanel considered information from variety of sources and heard shortbriefings on different aspects 1 the ongoing monitoring and verificationregime ii the exportimport monitoring mechanism iii the nuclearmissile chemical weapons and biological weapons areas and iv overheadimagery 7 in accordance with the note by the president of the security council the main objective of the panel was to make recommendations to the securitycouncil on how taking into account relevant security council resolutions toreestablish an effective disarmamentongoing monitoring and verificationregime in iraq this mandate reflects the security council assessment that aneffective presence of inspectors on the ground remains the most effective wayto provide assurance that iraq does not retain acquire or rebuild itsproscribed weapons programmes ii introductory questions 8 the phrasing of the mandate how to reestablish etc carries with it an implicit recognition that the task of getting inspectors back to iraqis not selfevident in effect the panel has been asked to contribute tosuch an objective by devising technically feasible options which the securitycouncil may choose to implement the panel recognized that the scope of itsmandate implied that it would devise its recommendations from technical andnot political point of view while conceding that it could not ignore thepolitical and indeed the legal context in which those deliberations weretaking place the panel deliberated against the background of discussions inthe council where number of proposals on how to address the presentsituation are still under consideration on the one hand clear line had tobe drawn between what is technical and therefore germane to the panels workand what is political in its content which is the exclusive province of thesecurity council on the other hand the panel had to be conscious that someof the technical options may propitiate political consequences if the securitycouncil so decides 9 in the context of the debate on the above mentioned proposals the president of the security council for the month of january presented thefollowing question to council members while recognizing that there may bedisarmament tasks to be carried out wouldnt it be possible to perform thosetasks with renewed approach under reinforced ongoing monitoring andverification omv system with disarmament elements factored into it thisquestion helped to focus the discussions on ways to move forward in the shortterm and may be viewed as being at the origin of the establishment of thepanel on disarmamentongoing monitoring and verification the same questionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs114 was presented to panel members 10 always bearing in mind the mandate conferred upon it by the security council the panel decided that it should first achieve an understanding ofthe current status of disarmamentongoing monitoring and verification in thatcountry such discussion could neither be exhaustive nor excessivelydetailed but broad overview of the work undertaken by the united nationsand iaea in iraq to date including their cooperative arrangements wasconsidered useful 11 further step was to evaluate bearing in mind the basic elements of the omv regime as conceived in the plans approved by resolution 715 as wellas the need of ensuring the full implementation of all relevant securitycouncil resolutions regarding iraq in particular resolutions 687 707 715and 1051 the possibility of addressing remaining disarmament issuesareas ofuncertainty through their integration into reinforced omv regime byproviding satisfactory answer to the fundamental question of whether it isfeasible to factor those outstanding issues into an omv developed to its fullpotentiality while avoiding policy judgements the panel might be enlargingthe scope of options for the security council iii disarmament 12 panel members had it clear that it was not their objective to evaluate in its minute detail every single aspect of each particular proscribedweapons area such an assessment had been made on number of occasions bythe competent institutions in charge of the disarmamentongoing monitoringverification work in iraq and is included in various reports to the securitycouncil which were presented to the panel as part of the existing andrelevant information available therefore what follows is not an attempt tosummarize such assessments much less to substitute for existing papers butan indication of subjects discussed in relation to which different shades ofopinion were expressed 13 the panel heard briefings by experts from the united nations special commission unscom and the iaea on the current status ofdisarmamentongoing monitoring and verification in the four proscribed weaponsareas nuclear missiles chemical biological these briefings were concentratedon specific priority disarmament issues in the case of unscom this reflectedits understanding of the desire of the council to focus on selected importantparts of the requirements of its resolutions unscom has decided to work onthe basis of priority issues setting aside other aspects such as proscribedweapons research and development activities procurement etc thesatisfactory resolution of these priority questions would considerablyincrease the level of confidence of unscoms overall verification if the priority issues are not satisfactorily resolved then it is likely that thesettlement of other outstanding disarmament issues will assume greaterimportance the iraqi government provided the chairman with somedocumentation with its views on the disarmamentongoing monitoring andverification process this documentation was also considered by the panelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs115 nuclear weapons achievements 14 the iaea has been able in the course of its eight years of extensive inspection activities to develop technically coherent picture of iraqsclandestine nuclear programme covering the stages from the production andprocurement of natural uranium compounds through iraqs development ofenrichment processes to the design and experimental work for the eventualweaponization of highly enriched uranium iraqs programme had been very wellfunded and was aimed at the development and production of small arsenal ofnuclear weapons but there were indications that iraq had achieved itsprogrammes objective most of the iaea activities involving the destructionremoval and rendering harmless of the components of iraqs nuclear weaponsprogramme which to date have been revealed and destroyed were completed bythe end of 1992 in february 1994 the iaea completed the removal from iraq ofall weaponusable nuclear material essentially research reactor fuel on thebasis of its findings the agency is able to state that there is indicationthat iraq possesses nuclear weapons or any meaningful amounts of weaponusablenuclear material or that iraq has retained any practical capabilityfacilities or hardware for the production of such material current statusremaining questions 15 in the nuclear weapons area questions remain with regard to the lack of certain technical documentation external assistance to iraqs clandestinenuclear weapons programme and iraqs abandonment of its nuclear weaponsprogramme however the uncertainty deriving from those few remainingconcerns does not present any technical impediment to the full implementationof the iaeas omv plan iraq has yet to adopt the necessary measures toimplement its obligations under relevant security council resolutions andenact penal laws to secure their enforcement this issue applies to the otherproscribed weapons areas as well proscribed missiles achievements 16 with regard to items selected as key for the purpose of the verification of the material balance of proscribed missiles and related operational assetsunscom was able to destroy or otherwise account for 817 out of 819imported operational missiles of proscribed range b all declared mobilelaunchers for proscribed hussein class missiles including 14 operationallaunchers the disposition of 9 of the 10 imported trailers used for theindigenous production of mobile launchers and the destruction of 56 fixedmissile launch sites c 73 to 75 chemical and biological warheads of thedeclared 75 operational special warheads for hussein class missiles 83 ofthe 107 imported and some 80 of the 103 indigenously produced conventionalwarheads declared by iraq to be in its possession at the time of the adoptionof resolution 687httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs116 17 as means to compensate for iraqs failure to present required evidence for the establishment of material balance of the critical components for theindigenous production of proscribed missiles unscom has established roughcorrelation between the total estimated weight of engine components and thetotal weight of ingots and other remnants presented by iraq as result of itsunilateral destruction unscom has also concluded that iraq does not possessa capability to indigenously produce either badr2000 missiles or assets knownas the supergun unscom has obtained broad understanding of iraqsefforts to develop missile delivery system for nuclear weapons and adetailed picture of iraqs procurement effort for its proscribed missileprogrammes current statusremaining questions 18 in the missiles area the main concerns mentioned during the briefing related to the determination whether or not the current assessment of thequantity of special warheads identified among the remnants excavated accountsfor all special warheads declared to have been produced by iraq or if thedeclaration is indeed correct satisfactory resolution of the followingissues was considered essential for the achievement of satisfactory materialbalance the reasons why remnants of 50 conventional warheads declaredas unilaterally destroyed were recovered b accounting for proscribedpropellants claimed to have been unilaterally destroyed c accounting for theunilateral destruction of seven indigenously produced missiles d accountingfor the unilateral destruction of combustion chambernozzle assemblies forindigenously produced missiles chemical weapons achievements 19 unscom has supervised or been able to certify the destruction removal or rendering harmless of large quantities of chemical weapons cw theircomponents and major chemical weapons production equipment as follows aover 88000 filled and unfilled chemical munitions b over 600 tonnes ofweaponized and bulk cw agents c some 4000 tonnes of precursor chemicalsd some 980 pieces of key production equipment some 300 pieces ofanalytical instruments the prime cw development and production complex iniraq was dismantled and closed under unscom supervision and other identifiedfacilities have been put under monitoring it was pointed out that unscom hasbeen able to establish material balances of major weaponrelated elements ofiraqs cw programme only on the basis of parameters as declared by iraq but notfully verified by unscom 20 unscom has been able to make considerable progress in the verification of other cwrelated activities in iraq among them the uncovering of iraqs vxproject cw research and development projects iraqs procurement network andefforts for its cw programme on the basis of all these findings unscomobtained good understanding of the major parameters of iraqs cw programmehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs117 current statusremaining questions 21 in the chemical weapons area it was noted during the briefing that satisfactory resolution is required especially with regard to discrepancieswith iraqs declarations on the expenditure of cw munitions inthe 80s as indicated by figures contained in document detailing consumptionof special munitions by iraq b evidence of 550 artillery shells filled withmustard declared to have been lost shortly after the gulf war c accountingfor five hundred r400 bombs which could be done through the verification ofthe disposition of the parachute tail sections of those bombs d iraqideclarations on the production and weaponization of the chemical agent vx inparticular with regard to the military plans for the use of vx during variousperiods the different precursors available and the synthetic routes pursuedand the material balance of cw production equipment biological weapons achievements 22 unscom uncovered the proscribed biological weapons programme of iraq whose complete existence had been concealed by iraq until 1995 this andsubsequent work has permitted it to obtain significant insights into iraqsbiological warfare capabilities including broad understanding of the maindelivery systems unscom has also gained detailed albeit incompletepicture of iraqs procurement activities for its biological warfare programme 23 unscom ordered and supervised the destruction of iraqs main declared bw production and development facility hakam some 60 pieces of equipmentfrom three other facilities involved in proscribed bw activities as well assome 22 tonnes of growth media for bw production collected from four otherfacilities were also destroyed as result the declared facilities ofiraqs bw programme have been destroyed and rendered harmless current statusremaining questions 24 in the biological area iraqs full final and complete disclosure ffcd has not been accepted by unscom as full account of iraqs bw programme afull disclosure of the scope and nature of the programme was consideredoutstanding by unscom the briefing i ndicated that this evaluation was corroborated by technical evaluation meetings called by unscom including atthe request of iraq the briefing also indicated that critical gaps need tobe filled to arrive at reasonably complete picture it has also beenrecognized that due to the fact that bw agents can be produced using lowtechnology and simple equipment generally dualuse iraq possesses thecapability and knowledge base through which biological warfare agents could beproduced quickly and in volume 25 the elements presented above indicate that in spite of wellknownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs118 difficult circumstances unscom and iaea have been effective in uncovering and destroying many elements of iraqs proscribed weapons programmes inaccordance with the mandate provided by the security council it is the panelsunderstanding that iaea has been able to devise technically coherent pictureof iraqs nuclear weapons programme unscom has achieved considerableprogress in establishing material balances of iraqs proscribed weapons althoughimportant elements still have to be resolved the bulk of iraqs proscribedweapons programmes has been eliminated in this connection reference wasmade to possible point of impasse in the further investigation of theseissues under the current procedures which might correspond to an apparentdiminishing return in recent years 26 although there were differences in the panel members perception and understanding of remaining issues including as regards their relevance to theoverall verification process it is evident that satisfactory resolution ofcertain areas in particular those identified as priority would contribute tothe overall assurance that any disarmament andor monitoring and verificationmechanism could provide or in other words there seems to be an inversecorrelation between resolution of those issues by iraq and the overall degreeof intrusiveness of the regime to be implemented 27 it has been indicated on various occasions that some uncertainty is inevitable in any countrywide technical verification process which aims toprove the absence of readily concealable objects or activities the extent towhich such uncertainty is acceptable is policy judgement both unscom andiaea have therefore been adopting pragmatic approach which assumes that100 of verification may be an unattainable goal iv ongoing monitoring and verification 28 the omv system was conceived to provide assurance that iraq is not undertaking proscribed activities the plans approved by resolution 715docs s22871rev1 and 22872rev1 establish the mechanisms for themonitoring and verification of iraq the dynamic nature of these mandatesimplies that procedures and practices under the plans may be continuouslyadjusted key among the tools given by the security council to both iaea andunscom under the plans are full and free access at any time to all sitesfacilities areas locations activities materials and other items includingdocumentation and to all persons and all information that in the judgementof iaea and unscom may be necessary for their monitoring activities adopted procedures and practices to date 29 the iaeas monitoring plan has been operational since august 1994 since that time work has continued in order to increase the scope andtechnology of omv measures although it is recognized that any omvmechanism will always encompass component of disarmament of varyingdegrees the agencys omv plan is designed to give assurances as to theabsence of prohibited equipment materials and activities the plan takes fullyintohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs119 account the extensive technological expertise developed by iraq in the course of its clandestine nuclear programme the plan also takes into account theuncertainties referred to in paragraph 15 above and is predicated on theassumption that iraq retains the capability to exploit for nuclear weaponspurposes any relevant material or technology to which it may gain access inthe future 30 the design and operation since 1994 of unscoms monitoring system have been based on number of assumptions regarding the conditions under which theplan for omv would be implemented it was believed that before proceedingexclusively to monitoring and verification activities the commission wouldreceive from iraq full and complete disclosures of all its proscribedactivities and capabilities and that the identification and disposal of allproscribed weapons materials and programmes would have been achieved basedon this expectation the way unscom had been pursuing the monitoring andverification system was not designed to search for proscribed weapons andmaterials this task has been carried out by unscom separately throughdisarmament activities and investigations in view of this atwotrackapproach unscom was able to conduct its monitoring activities in the leastintrusive manner consistent with the objectives for ongoing monitoring andverification set forth by the security council current status 31 inspectors from both the agency and the special commission departed from iraq on 16 december 1998 as consequence the omv plans are not operationalat this moment v relationship between disarmament and ongoing monitoring and verification integration including legal aspects 32 the briefings referred to above demonstrated clearly that although disarmament and monitoring and verification address different dimensions ofthe broader problematic of disarmamentreacquisition of proscribed weaponsboth can be implemented through the use of the same or similar toolsdisarmament assumes the existence of proscribed weapons andor capabilitieswhich must be located accounted for and eventually disposed of themonitoring and verification systems immediate goal is to attempt to determinethat proscribed activities are not being carried out experience has shownhowever that actions in disarmamentongoing monitoring and verification canbe mutually supportive and that there are many similarities andcomplementarities between them both can be achieved in an integratedfashion through the use of onsite inspections with full access includingnonotice inspections sample analysis aerial surveillance evaluation ofdocumentation interviews installed monitoring equipment or mosteffectively combination of them 33 discussions in the panel have also revealed that from technicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs120 standpoint the ongoing monitoring and verification is not incompatible with the continuing search for satisfactory resolution of outstanding elements fromproscribed weapons programmes it was made clear that unscoms decision toseparate aspects related to monitoring from those related to disarmament hadbeen taken at the executive level based on certain assumptions that seemed tobe warranted at the time it was recognized however that it is technicallypossible to carry out further the resolution of remaining issues mentionedabove under the framework of omv provided adequate arrangements areestablished to ensure the full exercise of the rights contemplated by theplans the panel recognized that due to different degrees of confidencemore effort should be placed in areas which have caused greater concern asseems to be the case in the biological and some chemical weapons areas inorder to be effective the reinforced omv system should be able not only tocertify that present activities are in accordance with security council resolutions but also to address unresolved issues whenever necessaryindeed the retention of the right to investigate any aspect of proscribedweapons programmes would be fundamental element of the integrated systemas in the case of disarmament cooperation by iraq is essential legal framework 34 the reinforced omv system should be based on the full implementation of the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification approved by security councilresolution 715 1991 provided the rights enshrined therein and inresolutions 687 707 and 1051 are fully exercised the plans establish thatthe iaea and unscom should through inspections and aerial overflights aswell as through the provision of information by iraq monitor and verify thatactivities sites facilities material and other items both military andcivilian are not used by iraq in contravention of its obligations underrelevant security council resolutions it is understood that for operationalreasons the full potential of unscoms plan has never been explored theexisting plans provide an adequate legal framework for implementing rigorousand effective system of monitoring and verification and thus for integratinginto it the investigation of unresolved issues regarding proscribed weaponsprogrammes 35 the possibility of continuing the investigation of proscribed weapons programmes under the reinforced monitoring regime is explicitly provided forin the plans paragraphs 22 and 23 of the plan presented by unscom and 36 and37 of the iaeas plan refer to the discovery of any item includingdocumentation or activity in contravention of resolutions 687 707 or of theplan paragraph 24 of unscoms plan and 38 of the iaeas plan referred toabove instruct unscom and iaea to bring to the attention of the securitycouncil any findings that indicate that iraq is not in compliance with itsobligations under resolutions 687 and 707 from legal perspective theability to carry out specific operations aimed at clarifying certain questionsand detecting if there is an attempt to retain proscribed items which escapedthe destructionremoval rendering harmless process is fully guaranteedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs121 technical feasibility and necessary arrangements 36 the iaeas omv activities have been using essentially the same procedures and techniques initially employed to detect the presence ofprohibited equipment materials and activities these procedures must notonly credibly ensure such absence at routinely inspected locations but alsoprovide significant probability of detection at other locations furtherclarification of remaining questions can therefore be integrated into theiaeas plan provided the agency is able to fully exercise the rights ofaccess enshrined in the plan 37 in the case of the other proscribed weapons areas satisfactory resolution of remaining issues under the omv plan would require modificationsin some assumptions for the operation of the omv plan procedures andpractices that were being used to date more specifically changes in thebasic assumptions of the omv plan would require the strengthening of themonitoring and verification system to maintain its effectiveness so that thesecurity council mandate can be carried out as stated earlier the omv planas it was being implemented before the interruption of inspections was basedon the assumption that fairly complete knowledge of the past would havebeen obtained not having been designed to explicitly resolve remainingdisarmament issues the positive resolution of priority issues related toproscribed activities before the starting of the monitoring and verificationsystem would surely contribute to an increase in the degree of confidence thatthe system would otherwise provide such uncertainties however could beoffset through reinforced omv based on the assumption that iraq has theknowledge and technical expertise to exploit for proscribed purposes anyrelevant materials or technologies which it may retain or gain access to inthe future 38 iaea and unscom have both contemplated the possibility of integrating remaining disarmament issues into their omv plans in paragraph 34 of itslatest report doc s1999127 the agency states that provided that it isable to exercise its right to full and free access in iraq the iaea is in aposition to proceed with the full implementation of its omv plan and as partof that plan to investigate further the remaining questions and concerns andany other aspect of iraqs clandestine nuclear programme arising out of newinformation acquired by the iaea 39 unscom in turn points out in its latest reports that the present review of the omv system takes into account the possibility that the mandatedobjective of the full accounting of iraqs proscribed weapons and verificationof iraqs prohibited programmes will not be achieved but the commission maynevertheless be required to operate its omv system under the shadow of iraqpossibly retaining prohibited materialsparagraph 23 of s199994 40 panel members agreed that the adoption of reinforced omv might represent refocusing and evolution of patterns of work as pursued by unscomthe reinforced omv system should make maximum use of synergies crosschecks and cross fertilizations between the activities of the four

activities as well as clarification and progressive resolution ofdisarmament issues it was pointed out that the benefit of the integratedapproach would be that all information gathered from these concurrentactivities would be analyzed systematically considered against other data andexamined in multidisciplinary context the net effect could be to enablerapid and effective work towards confirmation of iraqs disarmament statusprovided the rights set forth in security council resolutions 687 707 715and 1051 are fully respected 41 changes on the ground resulting from the adoption of reinforced omv would be related rather to the intensity frequency intrusiveness and methodsthan to rights which would remain unaltered since all actions required arealready permitted under relevant security council resolutions 42 panel members acknowledge that this evolution of unscoms work will have implications for its organizational structure and resourcing which it mightbe premature to address in detail at this stage however it was considereduseful to present some of the parameters under which unresolved or notsufficiently resolved disarmament issues can be integrated into omv full

confirm the rights and privileges of unscom and iaea inspectors and support staff and consistent with pastexperience confirm that the health and safety of said personnel will beprotected at all times when these individuals are within the territory ofiraq 44 discussions on the specific question of techniques and tools were held although it was recognized that this debate was of preliminary charactersome time was devoted to issues related to efficiency costeffectiveness andthe degree of intrusiveness of the different techniques in this regard itwas noted that although not substitute for onsite inspections overheadimagery may play for instance very powerful role in providing indicationsof the presence of prohibited activities the role of such means inproviding timely and accurate reference data to support supplement andorenhance inspection activities had already been proven in iraq the panelconcluded that overhead imagery has already played an important role in theeffective implementation of the omv plans and that it should be exploited tothe limit of its technical capabilities there would be advantages in theunited nations and the iaea being able to derive independent conclusionstherefrom 45 the exportimport monitoring mechanism would remain critical component of the reinforced omv this system of informationnotification would have tobe reinforced and greater reliance would have to be placed in the provision ofinformation by suppliers particularly if conditions related to the volume ofcommercial transactions into iraq are changed in any case the lists ofdualuse equipment the last version of which dates back to 1995 should berevised it has been noted that due to particularities in iraqs programmesof weapons of mass destruction these lists are already more comprehensivethan those of the chemical weapons convention and other nonproliferationarrangements such as the missile technology control regime and the australiagroup 46 for the reinforced omv system to achieve its objectives iraqi cooperation will be necessary in particular in the sense of providingimmediate unobstructed access to all locations by united nations and

ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs124 the system vi organization and methods general observations 47 the panel had in mind in making its suggestions in this and other areas that it should work within the existing legal framework for theimplementation of security council resolutions related to proscribed weaponsin iraq the panel also notes that there are proposals before the securitycouncil which have also been mentioned during the panel meetings that mayimply changes in security council resolutions it will be matter for thesecurity council to judge upon the desirability of their adoptionnevertheless the panel thought it worth examining adjustments in currentpractices and procedures within the present legal framework the nomenclaturein the following paragraphs was used in the discussions without prejudice toany future security council decision 48 the panel held its discussions an this subject bearing in mind the experience accumulated during the past eight years of inspections but also thepossibility of reinforced omv system as delineated above in the course ofdebates on how to improve the operation of the system reference was made tothe desirability of reinforcing overall coordination including within the unsystem without prejudice to close relationship between the executive bodyand the security council this implies the possibility of the executivechairman bringing any urgent matter to the attention of the security councilas subordinate organ of the security council the executive body derives itseffectiveness and authority from this close relationship both in terms ofpolitical supervision and of providing support for its activities49 ln this context suggestions were made interalia with regard to thepossibility of restructuring the commission as collegiate body withoutprejudice of the close relationship referred to in paragraph 48 thecommission could provide for independent advice guidance and generaloversight both at expert and diplomatic levels on carrying out activitiesunder the monitoring and verification plan and any problems referred to itthat might arise in that connection it would carry out functions entrustedto it by the security council possibly including consideration of anymatter relating to the execution of the monitoring plan referred to it by thesecurity council for advice b consideration of regular reports from theexecutive chairman on the conduct of operations c consideration ofparticular issues referred to it by the executive chairman with view totheir resolution or to recommendation to the security council dconsideration of complaints by iraq regarding the conduct of inspections eestablishment of rosters of experts for possible selection to serve onmonitoring operations and f advice on personnel policy 50 recognizing the role of the secretarygeneral in this regard the commissions composition would also be reviewed by the security council sothat it possibly includes core of technical experts representatives fromamong security council members the undersecretarygeneral for disarmamenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs125 affairs and possibly other representatives of the secretariat it is thought that among the technical experts representative of the iaea and of theorganization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw might beincluded in order to ensure proper liaison of the collegiate body with thesecuritycouncil the meetings of the commission might be presided over by arepresentative of nonpermanent member of the security council thecommission should meet at least every three months apart from emergencymeetings 51 some suggestions were made that at the operational level the implementation of the reinforced omv should be entrusted to renovatedunscom consistent with the provisions of such system this may havestaffing implications that were not considered at length by the panel it isunderstood that the baghdad monitoring nd verification centre bmvc would continue to play pivotal role and may have to be further reinforced therenovated unscom should ensure clear united nations identity and be guidedby the principles of full independence rigour and transparency in order toensure the effectiveness of its work and credibility of its results it wasfelt that at this stage due to the amount of knowledge acquired by unscomas well as to the intrinsic interrelationship between the missile biologicaland chemical weapons fields these tasks should remain concentrated on thisrenovated united nations body nevertheless it was noted that organizationssuch as opcw might contribute under appropriate arrangements includingthrough participation in the commission in the future if iraq becomes aparty to the cwc as urged in security council resolutions cooperationarrangements similar to those currently associated with the work of iaea in iraq might be considered provided they are consistent with mandates set forthin relevant security council resolutions if the security council so decides recruitment 52 central component in ensuring an effective and credible system is the recruiting of staff who are technically competent committed to the objectivesof the security council resolutions impartial and if possible have someexperience of inspections personnel management strategy should ensure theoptimum mix of qualifications background and of longterm and shorttermstaff without prejudice to these requi rements staff selection should also reflect the desirability of establishing broad national representation to theextent possible cost efficiency and technical effectiveness could be promoted by complementing permanent staff with temporary staff selected tothe extent possible within roster of specialists see paragraph 49 above 53 appointments for one year or more should continue to be made in terms of article 1013 of the charter of the united nations all appointeeswould be regarded as international civil servants subject to article 100 ofthe charter taking into account united nations policy recourse to costfreepersonnel should be limited efforts should be made to increasing whereveroperationally possible personnel employed directly by the united nationsall employees should be subject to an enforceable special service agreementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs126 this will require full cooperation from member states training 54 considerable weight should be given to training needs with the objective of developing and reinforcing core inspection skills and competencestraining programmes should encompass both technical and cultural issues aswell as relevant safety procedures particular emphasis should be placed onthe importance of understanding national sensitivities in the course ofinspections emphasis should be given to structural preinspection training for shortterm appointments onthejob training would be the regularpractice inspection planning and st affing should reflect those training needs continuity in the field is essential equipmenttechnology 55 appropriate specifications should be established for all monitoring equipment including power units to be installed in iraq and on arrangementsfor its maintenance by suitably qualified personnel systematic and rapidselection and independent procurement of adequate emerging monitoringtechnologies should be promoted as appropriate information 56 information has been recognized as an essential component of reinforced ongoing monitoring and verification regime whether provided byiraq or generated by inspections or from any other source including memberstates internal handling of information should reflect the absolute need toprotect the confidentiality of operations planning and to give assurances toproviders that the sources and methods are being properly protected thisrequires clear procedures for receipt handling storage and access tosensitive information evaluation and assessment of information collectedshould be rigorous and impartial this can be facilitated by adopting clearanalysis concepts and methodologies and by using modem database andcomputerbased analysis tools the greater the confidence in the securityculture of the organization the more information member states are likely toprovide 57 any information should be assessed strictly on the basis of its credibility and relevance to the mandate the substantive relationship withintelligence providers should be oneway only even if it is recognized thatdialogue with providers may be necessary for clarifications and refinement ofassessments the omv mechanism should not be used for purposes other than theones set forth in security council resolutions other practices and procedures 58 in conducting inspections or monitoring operations effectiveness should be the primary consideration rigorous and comprehensive approach should beadopted to planning and infield activities and should take into account thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs127 difficulties encountered in the past in iraq including instances of obstruction andor deception at the same time unnecessary confrontation ordisproportionate reactions should be avoided 59 cooperative arrangements among different disciplines should be promoted through the development of structures to improve linkages and informationflows across disciplines and activities the composition ofinspectionmonitoring teams should reflect mission requirementsconfidentiality should be maintained during all stages of the planning andexecution phases within the limits dictated by that requirement inspectorsshould be appropriately briefed on the broader objectives of the project inwhich their activities are inserted and should be given access to the reportsof the missions to which they have contributed 60 the issue of relations with the media was raised the panel found that ideally there should be single point of contact with the press which couldbenefit from the expertise of the existing andor iaea public relationsmachinery public comment by the verification entity and its personnel shouldbe limited and restricted to the factual political evaluations or commentsthat carry obvious political implications should be left to the securitycouncil vii conclusionsrecommendations 61 the panel carried out its work bearing in mind the objective of presenting meaningful contribution to the security council on how toreestablish presence in iraq in the area of disarmamentongoing monitoringand verification the panel considered that refocusing or relensing theapproach towards disarmamentongoing monitoring and verification withoutdeparting from the existing framework of rights and obligations laid down insecurity council resolutions adopted under chapter vii of the charter mightoffer the opportunity to enlarge the scope of policy options for the securitycouncil to this end the panel concentrated great part of its work ondiscussing the technical feasibility of reinforced omv system capable ofaddressing through integration remaining unresolved disarmament issues thepanel concluded that such reinforced omv system which should includeintrusive inspections and investigation of relevant elements of pastactivities is viable 62 the framework for this system is wellknown encompassing security council resolutions 687 707 715 and 1051 in fact what is being called areinforced omv is the omv system itself as conceived in the plans approved byresolution 715 developed to its full potentiality the panel points out thatthere is need to change resolution 715 to that effect 63 several suggestions were made in relation to questions pertaining to organization and methods of work including institutional arrangementsbearing in mind the reinforced omv system they are outlined in chapter vi ofthis report the panel recommends that the security council devotesappropriate attention to these ideashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs128 64 the panel notes that the longer inspection and monitoring activities remain suspended the more difficult the comprehensive implementation ofsecurity council resolutions becomes increasing the risk that iraq mightreconstitute its proscribed weapons programmes or retain proscribed items amaterialization of such risk that is attributable to the absence ofinspections would have extremely negative consequences for the credibility ofinternational nonproliferation efforts in general and for the credibility ofthe united nations and iaea in particular 65 it has been repeatedly pointed out that unscoms and iaeas current inability to implement their mandates in iraq renders them unable to provideany assurance that iraq is in compliance with its obligations under securitycouncil resolutions and that it is essential that inspection teams return toiraq as soon as possible the current absence of inspectors has exponentiallyincreased the risk of compromising the level of assurance already achievedsince it is widely recognized that the reestablishment of the baseline willbe difficult task the loss of technical confidence in the system couldbecome irretrievable the panel considers that the status quo is not apractical alternative and recommends that efforts be made with view torestoring an international inspection regime in iraq that is effectiverigorous and credible 66 the effectiveness of the monitoring and verification system depends on its being comprehensive and intrusive rigorous implementation is criticallydependent upon the full exercise of the rights of full and free access setforth in relevant security council resolutions the monitoring andverification system is an integral whole that can be meaningfully implementedonly in its entirety at the same time mandates should be carried outobjectively in technically competent and thorough manner with due regard toiraqi sovereignty dignity and sensitivities including religious and culturalones as well as those related to commercial confidentiality 67 given the difficulties experienced in the past this will require firm and active support by the security council for the implementation of thereinforced omv system implementation of the omv system is predicated oniraqi cooperation ensuring appropriate cooperation by iraq means that inone way or another iraq will have to be engaged by the security councilsooner rather than later of course the omv system cannot be conceived as anenticement for iraq to invite it into its territory indeed the reinforcedomv would be if anything more intrusive than the one so far practiced itis in the hands of the security council to devise ways of ensuring that iraqaccepts such monitoring and verification 68 in summary the panel agreed on the possibility of an integrated system that is reinforced omv within the existing legal framework of resolutions687 707 715 and 1051 as well as the memorandum of understanding of 23february 1998 which would be capable of addressing the outstandingdisarmament issues some of the parameters necessary for the implementationof such system were outlined in relevant chapters of this report theywill surely need further elaboration once the suggested approach is acceptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs129 by the security council however even the best system would be useless if it were to remain blueprint on paper only to be effective any system has tobe deployed on the ground which is impossible without iraqi acceptance howthis acceptance will be obtained is the fundamental question before thesecurity

with gentle words so that hopefully he will pay heed or show some fear almighty god has spoken the truthhis excellency mr kofi annan secretarygeneral of the united nationsnew york ny sir you may recall the enormous uproar created by the president of the united states of america in the greatest and most wicked slander against iraqin which he was followed in his malicious intent and preceded in word andinfliction of harm by his lackey tony blair when they spread the rumour thatiraq might have produced or might have been on the way to producing nuclearweapons during the period since 1998 in which the international inspectorswere absent they later asserted that iraq had indeed produced chemical andbiological weapons though they know as well as we do and other states arein position to know that this is an utterly unfounded fabrication but doesknowledge of the truth even enter into the vocabulary of political interaction in our time after evil has been unleashed to the fullest within the americanadministration and any hope of good has been dashed indeed is there anygood to be expected or hoped for from american administrations now thatthey have been transformed by their greed by zionism and by other wellknown factors into the false god of our time after some states and the public were taken in by this lie while others remained silent iraq confronted them with its consent to the return of theinternational inspectors after agreeing with you as representative of theunited nations in new york on 16 september 2002 and in press statementissued jointly in vienna on 30 september1 october 2002 by an iraqi technicaldelegation headed by amer alsaadi chief inspector hans blix andmohamed elbaradei director general of the international atomic energyagency iaea yet few hours after iraqs consent to the return of theinspectors became an established fact including agreement on 19 october2002 as the date of their arrival colin powell the american secretary ofstate declared that he would refuse to have the inspectors go to iraq thegang of evil began once again to talk of the need to adopt new resolution inorder to entertain the people of the world with something new ratherthan following the teams of inspectors and witnessing the facts stated by iraqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs182 namely that it neither had produced nor possessed any nuclear chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction during the absence of the inspectorsthe officials in the international organization and its agencies however andespecially those from the permanent members of the security council ratherthan engaging in such monitoring so as to expose those responsible for theirlies and false accusations busied themselves with discussions of the natureand wording of the new resolution they would strike or add letter here andletter there word here and word there until they reached agreement onthe argument that it was better to take the kicks of raging bull in small ringthan to face its horns in an open space this took place under the pressure ofthe american administration and its threats to withdraw from the internationalorganization unless it agreed to what america wanted which was at best evilin the extreme and reason for embarrassment for every honest and freemember of the international organization who recalls the provisions of thecharter and sees that there are some who feel shame on behalf ofthose members who are shameless we have told members of the security council whom we have contacted or who have contacted us when they spoke to us of the pretexts of theamericans and their threats of aggression against our country either bythemselves or with whomever might st and with them if the security council did not agree to what they wanted that we preferred if it was inevitable tohave america alone attack us and to confront it placing our trust in godrather than having it obtain international cover with which to camouflage itslies in whole or in part bringing falsehood closer to the truth so that it mightstab the truth with the dagger of evil and perfidy indeed we have confrontedit before at time when it could be characterized the same way and that wasone of the reasons for its isolation in the human environment all over theglobe americas aggressiveness and singlehanded infliction of injustice and destruction on its victims chief among them muslim and arab believersconstitute the main reason for its withdrawing its ambassadors and other staffclosing its embassies and limiting its interests in many parts of the world inaddition to the hatred of the peoples of the world for its aggressive policiesand objectives this is situation which other country in the world hasexperienced before not even the fathers of colonialism in earlier times yetthe security council or more exactly those who basically run it instead ofleaving the american administration and its lackey behind whom standshateful zionism to reap the consequences of the evil they have sown havesaved iniquity rather than curbing it we shall see and then remorse will notbe of any avail as they bite their fingers the influence of any international organization is based on the conviction and trust of the community in which it exists once the organization declaresthat it has been established to serve goals important to that community wefear that the united nations will lose the trust and interest of peoples if thathas not already taken place once it has been exhausted by powerful interestswherever those interests converge at the expense of other peoples or flattereach other and haggle over what is false at the expense of what is true thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs183 the united nations and its agencies will collapse just as the league of nations did before it the responsibility for this will not rest on the americanadministration alone but on all those who in their weakness workfor its interests yielding to its threats enticements or promises he who fails to speak out the truth is voiceless demon nothing is more distressing than the silence of the representatives of states in the securitycouncil during their discussion of the american draft in the face of thequestion raised by the representative of mexico regarding the possibility of lifting the sanctions imposed on iraq during the consultations in the securitycouncil concerning resolution 1441 on 7 november 2002 the mexicanrepresentative said that he was not satisfied with the explanations provided bythe american ambassador concerning the absence of any reference to thelifting of the sanctions and the establishment in the middle east of zone freefrom weapons of mass destruction adding that he would convey this to hisgovernment in order to receive instructions the british representative repliedthat he had listened to the statements of the delegations of syria and mexicoregarding the inclusion in the resolution of paragraph on the lifting of thesanctions he said that iraq had previously been afforded an opportunity to riditself of weapons of mass destruction but had ignored it and made decisionto keep them consequently any reference to the lifting of the sanctions whileiraq still had such weapons was improper nevertheless an indirect referenceto that effect was being included we should add that none of therepresentatives asked him when how or where such an alleged decision hadbeen taken by iraq to keep weapons of mass destruction the delegates treatedthe statement of the british representative as though it related to matter thatdid not concern them or rather as though telling the truth was of concernto them do not this and other things together with the decline in the prestigeof international organizations of this nature point to the possibility of thecollapse of this international organization which was founded to maintaininternational peace and security but has turned into kitchen for hagglingover the interests of the big powers and for providing cover for wardestruction blockades and the starvation of peoples the future will be determined in the light of the potential for reform or the inability to achieve reform as will the future of the united nations allthose who show their concern in deed and not merely in word to foster thisinternational organization and its work on the basis of its charter so thatstability justice and fairness prevail throughout the world as route to peacefreedom and cooperation among peoples are called upon to exercise cautionand act in accordance with international law and the charter of the unitednations and not at whim in accordance with the unrestrained tendencies ofthose who threaten the world with their weapons and evil endeavours andthose who narrowmindedly look to their own interests which they seek toachieve by bargaining at the expense of truth justice and fairness we know that those who pressed the case in the security council for the adoption of security council resolution 1441 2002 have objectives otherthan to ascertain that iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction inthe absence of the inspectors from ira q since 1998 you are aware of how theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs184 left iraq and who was the cause of their departure although we are aware that following the widely known understanding between the representativesof iraq and the secretarygeneral and the press statement issued by blix elbaradei and the representatives of iraq there are facts or principles ofjustice and fairness to necessitate the adoption of that resolution in the nameof the security council we hereby inform you that we will deal withresolution 1441 2002 despite its iniquitous contents even though it is to beimplemented against the background of the intentions harboured by those ofbad faith based as this is in an attempt to spare our people harm we shall notforget just as others should not forget that the preservation of our peoples dignity and of their security and independence within their homeland is asacred and honourable national duty on the agenda of our leadership and ourgovernment the same is true of the protection of the homeland and itssovereignty together with that of the people and their security interests andhigh values from antagonists and oppressors hence as we said in theaforementioned agreement and press statement we are ready to receive theinspectors so that they can perform their duties and ascertain that iraq hasproduced weapons of mass destruction in their absence from iraq since1998 under the circumstances known both to you and to the securitycouncil we request you to inform the security council that we are ready toreceive the inspectors in accordance with the established dates all concernedparties should remember that we are in our holy month of ramadan and thatthe people are fasting and that after this month is feast the concernedbodies and officials however will cooperate with the inspectors against thisentire background and that of the tripartite statement of france the russianfederation and china the government of iraq will also take all of this intoconsideration when dealing with the inspectors and with all matters relating totheir demeanour and the intentions of any one of them who demonstrates badfaith or an inappropriate approach to preserving the national dignityindependence and security of the people and the security independence andsovereignty of the homeland we are eager for them to accomplish their taskinaccordance with international law as soon as possible if they do so in aprofessional and lawful manner and without previously planned goals thefabrications of the liars will be revealed to the public and the declared aim ofthe security council will be achieved at that point the security council will become legally obligated to lift the embargo from iraq failing which allpersons of goodwill throughout the world in addition to iraq will tell it to lift the embargo and all the other unjust sanctions from iraq before the publicand the law the council will be under obligation to apply paragraph 14 of itsresolution 687 1991 to the zionist entity israel and thereafter to the entireregion of the middle east so that it is free of weapons of mass destructionthe worldwide number of fairminded persons will increase together withiraqs potential to drive from its environment the cawing of the crows of evilwho daily raid its lands demolish its property and take the lives of those hitby their bombs if not already claimed by the evildoers themselves when thishappens it will help to stabilize the region and the world if accompanied by asolution not based on double standards to end the zionist occupation ofpalestine and if the aggressors desist from their attacks against muslims andthe world httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs185 we therefore reiterate through you the same statement to the security council send the inspectors to iraq to ascertain as much and if their conductis thoroughly supervised to ensure that it is lawful and professional everyonewill be assured that iraq has produced nuclear chemical or biologicalweapons of mass destruction whatever allegations to the contrary are made bythe evil pretenders the fabrications of the liars and the deceit of thecharlatans in the american and british administrations will be revealed beforethe world in contrast to the truthfulness of the proud iraqis and the correctnessof what they say and do if however the opportunity is left for the whim ofthe american administration and the desires of zionism coupled with thefollowers intelligence services threats and foul inducements of each tomanipulate and play with the inspection teams and among their ranks thepicture will be muddled and the ensuing confusion will distort the facts andpush matters in dangerous direction to the edge of the precipice situationwanted neither by the fairminded nor by those including my governmentwho seek to uncover the facts as they stand the fieldwork and theimplementation will be the deciding factors as to whether the true intent wasfor the security council to ascertain that iraq is free of those alleged weaponsor whether the entire matter is nothing more than an evil cover for the authorsof the resolution with their vile slander and their shamelessness in lying tothe public including their own peoples so let the inspectors come to baghdad to perform their duty in accordance with the law whereupon we shall hear and see together withthose who hear see and act each in accordance with his obligations and rightsas established in the charter of the united nations and international law thefinal frame of reference continues to be resolution 687 1991 which imposesobligations on the security council and iraq as well as the code of conductcontained in the agreement signed with the secretarygeneral in new york on16 september 2002 and the press statement issued jointly with hans blix andel baradei in vienna on 30 september1 october 2002 we hope that you will exercise your responsibilities by speaking to the oppressors and advising them that their unjust treatment of muslims faithfularabs and all people has disastrous consequences and that god is omnipotentand capable of all things tell them that the people of iraq are proud faithfuland militant having fought and waged war against the former colonialismimperialism and aggression including that of the false god for years andyears the price paid for the preservation of their independence dignity andthe high principles in which they believed was rivers of blood together with agreat deal of deprivation and damage to their wealth alongside the immortalachievements and record in which they take pride we hope that you willadvise those who are ignorant not to push the situation to the edge of theprecipice at the time of implementation because the people of iraq will notchoose to live if the price is their dignity their homeland their freedomor the things sacrosanct to them on the contrary the price will be their livesif that is the only way forward to preserve what must be preserved before concluding this letter of mine i should like to inform you that i shall address further detailed letter to you in due course stating

further to my letter dated 13 november 2002 in which i informed you of the decision of the government of the republic of iraq to comply with security council resolution 1441 2002 despite its iniquitous contents i wishto place on record our observations on the provisions allegations andmeasures contained in the resolution that are inconsistent with internationallaw the charter of the united nations the relevant resolutions of the securitycouncil and the relevant constitutive instruments of organizations of theunited nations system concerning the inspection and monitoring regime iniraq 1 before reviewing the paragraphs of the resolution it is essential to refer to the background to the resolution and the circumstances under which it wasissued the united states of america submitted the draft resolution that wasadopted on 8 november 2002 as resolution 1441 2002 after the entireinternational community had expressed its rejection and condemnation of thedesire of the united states to launch military attack against iraq in order toattain its openly declared colonial objectives of occupying the country byforce and imposing colonial domination over the entire middle east region the united states accordingly changed its tactics and rather than trying to attain its purposes on its own took the security council as cover for itscolonialist and aggressive objectives the more so as it had long history ofusing the council as cover for its hostile intentions against iraq since 1990it therefore submitted the draft resolution under the false guise of workingthrough the united nations while its real purpose of creating pretexts foraggression against iraq were concealed under an international cover as thefollowing review of the paragraphs of the resolution makes clear 2 the third preambular paragraph referred to what it called the threat iraqs noncompliance with council resolu tions and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses to international peace and security this was anattempt to impose forced interpretation of the concept of threat tointernational peace and security as referred to in article 39 of the charter ofthe united nations in order to justify united states aggression against iraq the starting point of the paragraph is the baseless assumption of iraqs noncompliance with council resolutions nd proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and longrange missiles that is the basis for further groundlessassumption namely that iraq is threat to international peace and securitythis assumption is baseless and unsupported by any evidence it is iraq thathas been subjected to aggression ever since 1991 and there is not singlenation in the world that shares the biased view of the matter taken by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs189 united states and the united kingdom whatever is based on nullity is itself nullity 3 the fourth preambular paragraph refers to security council resolution 678 1990 which authorized member states to use all necessary means toimplement resolution 660 1990 and subsequent resolutions in order torestore international peace and security in the area this reference creates the fallacious impression that the authorization to use force in resolution 678 1990 is still current however that authorizationceased to be current from the legal and practical points of view when iraqwithdrew from kuwait towards the end of february 1991 thereby fullyimplementing resolution 660 1990 the authorization has also ceased to belegally in force because of the provisions of paragraph 33 of resolution 6871991 which declared that upon official notification by iraq to thesecretarygeneral and to the security council of its acceptance of the aboveprovisions formal ceasefire is effective between iraq and kuwait and themember states cooperating with kuwait in accordance with resolution 6781990 the required official notification was provided on behalf ofiraq by the minister for foreign affairs in letter dated 6 april 1991addressed to the secretarygeneral of the united nations and to the presidentof the security council in paragraph 34 which was the final paragraph ofresolution 687 1991 the security council affirmed that any measures for thefuture use of force against iraq would require further authorization by thesecurity council that paragraph provided as follows decides to remain seized of the matter and to take such further steps as may be required for theimplementation of the present resolution and to secure peace and security inthe region it follows that there is legal basis that can be invoked asauthorizing the use of force against iraq after the formal ceasefirethat was declared by the council and in the absence of any new authorizationthere is therefore legal justification for reopening discussion of resolution678 1990 which has been implemented and has been superseded byresolution 687 1991 4 the sixth preambular paragraph deplores what it refers to as iraqs failure to provide final and complete disclosure of all aspects of its earlierproscribed programmes that paragraph contradicts the facts set forth in official united nations documents in paragraph 79 of document s1997779 the internationalatomicenergy agency iaea stated there are indications of significantdiscrepancies between the technically coherent picture that has evolved ofiraqs past programme and the information contained in iraqs ffcdf thedefinitive version of the full final and complete declaration issued on 7september 1996 in its report issued as document s1997301 the special commission stated the following the accumulated effect of the work that has beenaccomplished over six years since the ceasefire went into effect between iraqhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs190 and the coalition is such that not much is unknown about iraqs retained proscribed weapons capabilities 5 the seventh preambular paragraph alleges that iraq has not cooperated fully and unconditionally with the weapons inspectors and ultimately ceasedall such cooperation this paragraph totally distorts the facts concerning iraqs cooperation as consequence of its cooperation with the united nations special commissionand iaea those two bodies concluded their missions with respect todisarmament the iaea report of 27 july 1998 s1998694 stated inparagraph 35 there are indications of iraq having retained any physical capability for the indigenous production of weaponusable nuclearmaterial in amounts of any practical significance nor any indication thatiraq has acquired or produced weaponusable nuclear material other thanthe nuclear material verified by iaea and removed from iraq inaccordance with paragraph 13 of resolution 687 1991 the special commission noted in numerous reports that it had completed the main part of its work its report issued as document s1995494 stated inparagraph 29 in the ballistic missile and chemical weapon areas thecommission is now confident that it has good overall picture of the extent ofiraqs past programmes and that the essential elements of its proscribedcapabilities have been disposed of the former executive chairman of the special commission ambassador rolf ekÃ©us in statement made on 13 january 1993 affirmed that iraq hadimplemented 95 per cent of the obligations imposed on it mr ekÃ©usreaffirmed that statement in an interview with the swedish broadcastingcorporation on 7 september 2002 furthermore the report of ambassadorcelso l n amorim to the security council s1999356 stated that theremaining disarmament issues could be addressed within reinforced ongoingmonitoring and verification system in other words the disarmament phasehad in practical terms been concluded 6 the eighth preambular paragraph deplored the absence since december 1998 of inspection activities in iraq and placed responsibility for that on iraqconsidering that it was reason for the prolongation of the crisis in the regionand the suffering of the iraqi people this paragraph misrepresents the history of events what caused the withdrawal of the inspectors from iraq on 15 december 1998 therebybringing the inspection activities to an end for practical purposes was theunited states of america on the day after the inspectors departure theunited states and the united kingdom carried out largescale military attackagainst iraq which among other things targeted the sites that had beensubject to the ongoing monitoring regime and contained the sensors camerasand their attachments used in the monitoring operations the security councilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs191 failed to take any action in the face of this unilateral use of aggressive force against iraq and has so far failed to assert that countrys legitimate rightsmoreover the united states used the former united nations specialcommission as an instrument of its hostile policy towards iraq it used theactivities of the special commission to undermine iraqs national security toprovide cover for aggression against it and to prolong the unjust blockade ofitspeople this led ultimately to the loss of the credibility of the specialcommission its dissolution and the dismissal of its executive chairmanrichard butler the united nations has yet to take any action to call toaccount those who used united nations bodies for purposes incompatible withinternational law the charter of the united nations and the relevantresolutions of the security council by spying on iraq and instigating crisesthereby flagrantly violating article 100 of the charter iraq has not beencompensated for the damage caused to it by the misuse of united nationsbodies to harm it 7 the ninth preambular paragraph accuses iraq of terrorism and human rights abuses and of failing to cooperate in respect of missing persons andproperty in this connection we wish to place on record the followingobservations the minister for foreign affairs of the republic of iraq sent letter dated 11 june 1991 to the secretarygeneral of the united nations s22687in which he fully explained iraqs position on that matter in fact it was iraqthat had been subjected for over 30 years to terrorism by international andregional forces led by the united states and the united kingdom whichspurred them on and financed them just as other peoples and states weresubjected and continue to be subjected to the terrorism and hostility of thosetwo countries iraq has been subjected to constant hostility on daily basis inthe form of terrorism by the united states and the united kingdom throughthe imposition of the illegal noflight zones to the north and south of iraqthis aggression has also taken the form of the new strategy of the unitedstates of america through its adoption of what is known as preemptive warwhich violates the purposes and principles of the united nations and isanother form of international terrorism moreover the security council isincapable of putting an end to the zionist terrorism against our heroicpalestinian people and the valiant freedom fighters to say nothing of theencouragement given by permanent member of the security council to thezionist entity enabling it to practise terrorism assassination and destructionwe are referring to the united states of america and its policy that is detestedthroughout the world b as far as kuwaiti property is concerned this has been returned to kuwait by iraq ending with the kuwaiti archive which was handed over bythe iraqi authorities to kuwait during the period from 19 to 29 october 2002as for the other allegations iraqs treasury is being plundered continuouslythrough what is termed compensationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs192 c iraq has cooperated fully with the states concerned ascertaining the fate of missing kuwaiti nationals and nationals of third countries and it hasexpressed its full willingness to cooperate directly with kuwait to resolve thishumanitarian issue which involves 1137 missing iraqis 582 missing kuwaitisand members of other nationalities and removing this issue from thetendentious politicization perpetrated by the united states administrationwhich is detrimental to both sides iraq has been cooperating and continues tocooperate with the international committee of the red cross on the groundsthat it is neutral international party and with the states that have files ofmissing persons thereby complying with the obligations specified in thegeneva convention of 1949 8 the tenth preambular paragraph indicates that ceasefire under security council resolution 687 1991 would be based on iraqs acceptance of theprovisions of that resolution this clause is premature and illintentioned it should have referred to the fact that iraq accepted resolution 687 1991 by means of letter from theminister for foreign affairs dated 6 april 1991 and has fulfilled itsobligations under the resolution the security council however has notfulfilled its own corresponding obligations similarly two permanentmembers of the security council have not fulfilled their obligations and since1991 have persisted among other things in their military aggression againstiraq in the two illegal noflight zones 9 the eleventh preambular paragraph states that the council is determined to ensure iraqs compliance with resolution 687 1991 this negates iraqs compliance with its obligations under the resolution and ignores the fact that the security council has fulfilled none of itscorresponding obligations including the obligations in paragraph 14 to freethe middle east region from weapons of mass destruction and in paragraphs21 and 22 concerning the lifting of the comprehensive blockade imposed oniraq which is collective punishment imposed on an entire people in violationof the principles of the united nations charter the universal declaration ofhuman rights as well as of the provisions of the charter and of the relevantresolutions of the security council concerning the need to respect thesovereignty territorial integrity and political independence of iraq and to stopthe daily aggression by the united states and the united kingdom against iraqin the two illegal noflight zones this means that the security council has given in either willingly or because it was forced to do so to the unitedstates tactic whereby whenever the world called for discussion of the liftingof the blockade on iraq and the application of paragraph 14 of securitycouncil resolution 687 1991 to the zionist entity preparatory to making themiddleeast region zone free from weapons of mass destruction and the securitycouncil seemed likely to respond positively the united states resorted toattack as means of defence raising issues that diverted the security councilfrom its duties and confusing public opinion in an attempt to have the hatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs193 executioner declared guiltless and to cast the great fighter for the humanitarian cause iraq as the accused party 10 the thirteenth preambular paragraph indicates that the letter dated 16 september 2002 from the minister for foreign affairs of the republic of iraqaddressed to the secretarygeneral is necessary first step towards rectifyingiraqs continued failure to comply with relevant security council resolutions the purpose of that paragraph is to contradict the letter from the secretarygeneral addressed to the security council s20021034 whichregarded iraqs acceptance of the return of the inspectors as first steptowards comprehensive solution which would include the lifting of thesanctions and the implementation of other provisions of the relevant securitycouncil resolutions 11 in the fourteenth preambular paragraph the council takes note of the letter dated 8 october 2002 from mr blix and mr elbaradei and expressesconcern at the continued failure of the government of iraq to provideconfirmation of the arrangements as laid out in that letter in fact iraq has concluded an agreement with unmovic and iaea regarding the practical arrangements that are prerequisites for the return of theinspectors and this agreement was incorporated in the joint press releaseissued in vienna on 1 october 2002 both parties agreed in principle that theinspectors should return to iraq on 19 october the letter from mr blix andmr elbaradei contained things that mr blix had not asked for during themeetings in vienna because such things did not fall within his mandate butmust be the subject of agreements with the secretarygeneral of the unitednations and decided by the security council nevertheless iraq addressedthese points in its two replies to the aforementioned letter dated 8 and 10october 2002 in which it affirmed that it was not opposed to the contents ofthat letter 12 it must be noted that the preambular paragraphs focus on the imaginary threats to regional and international peace and security allegedly posed byiraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction whereas they make mentionwhatsoever of the real dangers posed to security in the region and the rest ofthe world by the considerable arsenal of nuclear chemical and biologicalweapons of mass destruction that is in the possession of the zionist entityeven though the establishment in the middle east of zone free from weaponsof mass destruction is one of the main objectives of security councilresolution 687 1991 as noted in paragraph 14 of that resolution thisparadox is reflection of the odious policy of double standards which theunited states of america imposes on the council insofar as its positionsand resolutions are concerned 13 in paragraph 1 of resolution 1441 2002 the council claims that iraq has been and remains in breach of its obligations under relevant councilresolutionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs194 without offering shred of evidence this paragraph dismisses out of hand the cooperation iraq displayed over eight years to secure theimplementation of the councils resolutions yet this cooperation is clearand established fact as can be seen from the reports of the former specialcommission and iaea the special commission speaking through itschairman from 1993 onward stated that it had accomplished 95 per cent of itswork iaea meanwhile has maintained since 1992 and continues to say in itsreports that it has completed its disarmament missions and that there are noissues pending in the area of disarmament one may well ask whether thesetwo bodies could have completed the tasks entrusted to them by securitycouncil resolution 687 1991 without iraqs full cooperation what doesthis mean and further what does it mean that the security council is failingto fulfil its obligations to iraq and to other states it means that the council isin sorry state and that because it is bowing to the will of the united statesand british governments it is pursuing policy based on expediency andpower that is far removed from the spirit of the charter of the united nationsthe results are the same regardless of whether iraq or other states fulfil theirobligations the zionist entity is exempted from any legal measures so long asit participates along with the united states of america in the odiousimperialist alliance that seeks to dominate the world moreover it is theunited states that has been and remains in violation of security councilresolutions by using the former special commission as tool for spying oniraq and fomenting crises and by undermining iraqs sovereignty andterritorial integrity by joining with the united kingdom to impose illegal noflight zones on the country during the past 11 years the united states and theunited kingdom have continually launched largescale military attacks oniraq undermining its sovereignty and independence and publicly encouraginga number of mercenary terrorists whom they train arm and finance toperpetrate terrorist acts on iraq and its people thereby contravening thecharter of the united nations and the relevant resolutions of the securitycouncil all of which call for respect for iraqs sovereignty politicalindependence and territorial integrity 14 in paragraph 2 of the resolution the council decides to afford iraq final opportunity to comply with its obligations this paragraph gives the erroneous impression that the security council has begun to take steps against iraq in fact the opposite is true indeed whenthe inspectors left iraq it was discovered that some of them had been spyingon iraq and its vital national interests while stirring up crises the final reportof the chairman of the now defunct special commission was also used by theunited states of america and the united kingdom to disguise their perfidiousattack of 16 december 1998 yet despite all that iraq has been engaging indialogue with the secretarygeneral since february 2000 with view toreaching comprehensive settlement that will ensure the balanced and lawfulimplementation of security council resolutions including the fulfilment bythe council of its own obligations to ira q the lifting of the embargo and the ensuring of respect for iraqs sovereignty and to the region theimplementation of paragraph 14 of resolution 687 1991 as well as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs195 restoration of the inspection regime aimed at ensuring that iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction on 16 september 2002 iraq agreed to theinspectors unconditional return but it was the united states that preventedtheir return exerted all kinds of pressure on the members of the securitycouncil and haggled with them to ensu re that security council resolution 1441 2002 was adopted in order to mislead the international community andpublic opinion and make them forget the great lie put forward by the unitedstates government and its vassal in order to provide pretexts and obscure theaggression being carried out in accordance with its plans 15 in paragraph 3 of the resolution the council calls upon iraq to provide to unmovic iaea and the council currently accurate full and completedeclaration of all aspects of its programmes to develop weapons of massdestruction as well as other chemical biological and nuclear programmes this paragraph is based on the entirely unrealistic assumption that programmes for the development of weapons of mass destruction exist in iraqiraq however has vehemently rejected this allegation and the united statesof america and the united kingdom cannot offer single piece of credibleevidence the council further calls for the submission of declarationsregarding civilian programmes without being more specific it also asks inthis paragraph for model report even though precedent exists this givescouncil members another pretext for questioning iraqs declarations andaffords an opportunity to spread untruthful allegations about iraqsfailure to cooperate 16 paragraph 4 of the resolution posits false hypothesis namely that iraq might submit declarations containing false statements or omissions or that itmight fail to comply with the resolution second false hypothesis is thenposited on the basis of the first namely that such action would constitute amaterial breach of security council resolutions the arbitrary judgement made in paragraph 4 is without precedent in national and international legislation at any time in the history of mankind inthe first place to consider that the supplying of false information bearing inmind the thousands of pages of information that must be submittedconstitutes material breach makes it perfectly clear that the intent is tofind pretexts for distorting iraqs position and justify military action againstthat country and not to attain the objectives set by the security councilsecondly to consider omissions from the statements submitted as materialbreach means that iraq has already been selected as target whateverjustification may be cited for doing so viewing omissions as materialbreachconstitutes an attempt to establish new norms of international law somethingthe security council is not authorized to do under the charter moreover suchnorms are incompatible with the principles of justice relating to legalprocedures 17 in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the resolution the security council unjustifiablyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs196 confers on unmovic and iaea arbitrary powers that are in contradiction with their international status which requires them to uphold the sovereigntyof the countries in which they operate and to respect the laws and rules ofthose countries as well as the human rights of their population in accordancewith the charter of the united nations these measures which areunprecedented in the history of the united nations and of internationalrelations and the disarmament and armscontrol processes are actuallyintended to obstruct the work of the inspectors sow confrontation generate acrisis of confidence with iraq and re open the door to misuse of inspection activities for purposes that have nothing to do with the objectives set out inthe security council resolutions the processes of disarmament and arms control are familiar and there arecriteria established in international conventions for attaining the goal ofdisarmament they in way provide for such activities as the holding ofmeetings with citizens of country in that country without the presence ofrepresentatives of their government the requesting of citizens to leave theircountry with their families in order for such meetings to take place in anothercountry the compiling of the names of all scholars and researchers in thecountry the entry into the country of united nations security guards to ensurethe security of the facilities provided to the inspection teams even thoughiraq in accordance with the law assumes responsibility for their safety andpays their salaries or the bringing in and taking out of equipment byinspectors without notifying the state in whose territory they are operating allat the expense of the state in which the operation is taking placewithout any statement of expenditure being submitted and without telling thestate once the mission is over what has been done with the equipment andvehicles used that are the property of that state 18 in paragraph 8 of the resolution the council decides that iraq shall not take or threaten hostile acts directed against any representative or personnel ofthe united nations or of any member state taking action to uphold anycouncil resolution here again the resolution gives distorted picture of iraqs cooperation the members of the former special commission and iaea worked in iraq foreight years while some of them engaged in acts of espionage provocationand troublemaking in contravention of united nations regulations and thelaws of the host country the iraqi authorities afforded them full protectionand they did not suffer from any prejudice or harassment if one considershow numerous they were and how long they stayed in iraq without everexperiencing any harm one can conclude that iraqs past behaviour sets anexample for the world something that cannot be said for the united stateswhere international civil servants and nationals of other states are subjected toall sorts of affronts harassment and attacks and may even be robbed ormurdered 19 in paragraph 10 the council requests unmovic and iaea to accepthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs197 recommendations from member states with regard to sites to be inspected persons to be interviewed conditions of such interviews and data to becollected all this is designed to undermine cooperation between iraq and the unmovic and iaea inspectors and affords certain states pretext forinterfering with their work it also underm ines the international status of these two bodies and makes them subject to the pressures desires allegations andintentions of certain states foremost of which the united states of americawhose objectives serve their own interests at the same time these provisionsdo not compel the states providing information to bear the legal political orfinancial consequences if the information they furnish is false and is intendedto jeopardize or obstruct operations 20 in paragraph 11 of the resolution the council directs the two aforementioned bodies to report to it immediately what it labels anyinterference by iraq with inspection activities as well as any failure by iraqto comply with its obligations including its obligations regarding inspections this paragraph does not confer upon either unmovic or iaea the power requested to assess the state of iraqs cooperation but does authorizethem to report to the council immediately any incident whatsoever be itsomething minor doubt or misunderstanding this hardly helps to buildtrust or address concrete practical problems that may arise in the field andthus it does not contribute to cooperation or the attainment of the goals set the logic of this paragraph also implies absolute good faith on the part of all members of the inspection teams and complete bad faith on the part of theiraqi authorities which totally contradicts what the international communityknows about the behaviour of many of the inspectors of the illfamed and nowdefunct special commission as well as what you yourself said in yourstatement of 27 june 1999 concerning the actions of its members and theremarks made by the former chairman of the dissolved commission mrekÃ©us during an interview with swedish radio station on 28 july 2002 sees2002982 paragraph 11 of the resolution seeks priori to incitewrongdoing to create unwarranted crises so that iraq can be portrayed asfailing to cooperate and to provide pretexts for attacking the country 21 in paragraph 12 of the resolution the council decides to convene immediately when situation described in paragraph 11 arises in order tosecure international peace and security by considering any interference by iraq with inspection activities to constitute threat to international peace and security the council isattempting to provide broad new interpretation of international peace andsecurity this runs counter to the principles set out in article 39 of the charterof the united nations particularly when two permanent members of thesecurity council are engaged daily in waging outright military aggressionagainst iraq violating its sovereignty and its territorial integrity bombing itstowns and villages without the security council deciding that such actshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31611crs198 constitute threat to international peace and security host of serious violations of international peace and security are committed in variousparts of the world including the ongoing zionist aggression against the arabterritories and the possession by the zionist entity of weapons of massdestruction 22 lastly the council before ending the resolution as it began it recalls in paragraph 13 that it has repeatedly warned iraq distorting reality andthreatening iraq with war and aggression the abovementioned facts show that those who pushed the security council to adopt resolution 1441 2002 are aiming at objectives other thanensuring that iraq has not produced weapons of mass destruction in spite ofthis and even though the resolution contains bad provisions we have decidedto cooperate in implementing this resolution in order to spare our people theregion and the rest of the world from the unleashing of evil and aggressionadvocated by the extremists in the united states government and to give theunited nations an opportunity to implement its resolutions in accordance withinternational law and the charter it is our hope that the secretariat and peaceloving states especially those that are permanent and nonpermanentmembers of the security council will urge unmovic and iaea to compeltheir inspectors to respect their obligations under the charter of the unitednations and their mandate while endeavouring to realize the purposes of theunited nations this will quickly show how inane are the tendentiousaccusations levelled by the united states of america against iraq to the effectthat iraq possess weapons of mass destruction and it will allow the unitednations to discharge its obligations under these resolutions in respect of iraqand theregion in general by lifting the iniquitous embargo by respecting thesovereignty security territorial integrity and vital national interests of iraqand by creating zone free from weapons of
