6312c03 shspec325 certifications and classifications see hcopl 26nov63 certificate and classification changes everyone classified why have we put in the classification and certification system the original method of dissemination very successful one was to gather group who had troubles and wanted processing and give them some training setting up coaudits and supervising them charging small fee for the supervision and having them pay only for patchup sessions as needed the textbook was the original thesis distributed in mimeo the auditing was clumsy but some fantastic things would happen when the foundations were formed not at lrhs instigation there were lots of bosses around and many schools of technology developed they started training on the basis of letting someone hang around for month or so to pick up what was going on that was parker morgans idea this started the academy these first auditors were trained to audit others not to coaudit lrh taught them straightwire the same fault turned up here as in the earlier group people wanted only to be processed not to process anyone this is destructive action because it denies training and dissemination and neglects the people who keep it going if you want lots of auditing to do get lots of coauditing going there are always lots of patchups to do so the central organizations of 1950 went into the processing business and everybody they processed who wanted only processing and who didnt want to give anything for it introverted the purely pc person doesnt ever disseminate despite all his gains and ability because he never mentions his auditing unless you do something wrong this is the phenomenon of negative gain if something is eradicated properly the pc never says anything about it because it is gone the pure pc remains at the effect point and needs to be moved to the cause point to some degree with respect to scientology people who coaudit disseminate central organization can also make the above mistake they can concentrate on income from the hgc and neglect training auditors coaudits do produce lot of randomity all sorts of goofs do occur but that means repairs which can be done in the hgc the individual who is helping someone else while he is being helped gets his attention extroverted and introverted during the time the coaudit is on life gets off the first dynamic often for the first time it puts person in better frame of mind to combine both flows furthermore person can progress only so far without an increase of understanding which comes from training the pc starts at level i with itsa just talking about his problems etc assists and r1c are at this level then he changes gets better and moves up to level ii where repetitive auditing gets used and where it is the number of commands per unit of auditing time that determines the pcs progress this principle carries through to the highest level of ot processes the pc longer gets ta from wandering around in itsa so now you have to start pounding ta out of him with smoothly run repetitive questions cchs straightwire and ow are at this level then the pc moves up to level iii r2h see p 426 above the auditor has to be able to get the pc to spot things like bpc and if the pc has reality on it he will drift around you may have had the idea that the higher the process the more it would do for the case well the process that does the most for the case is the one that is realest to the case at his state of case that is new look technical revision the pc will get maximal gains on the process that is the most real the further his case is from optimum the more tiny little things are real and the more big tough things are unreal we were running people over their heads in 1950 they couldnt confront engrams but they did fine on straightwire processes pc who is being asked for selfdetermined changes for prepcheck see problems intensive procedure p 292 above may not believe that he has ever decided to do anything he may need to be run on some lowerlevel process like get the idea of deciding to changenot to change until he cognites that he can decide and eventually that he has decided it takes an educated pc to run arc break processes because you are asking the pc to look at complicated area unless he knows something about it it is too confusing and there is too much charge in his way then at level iv we handle service facsimiles the service fac is very esoteric thing to conceive of the pc has to take over responsibility for his own illness that is impossible for lowerlevel cases missed withhold running is at this level because missed withholds take higher level of responsibility to run than ow at this level we also get arc break assessments and case programming at level v the pc gradually starts getting reality on the idea that he has had other bodies and other identities with some acquaintance at first with the past 2500 years at this level he works with implants engrams whole track and gets whole track case analysis at level vi the pc gradually gets reality on track back to trillions to the eighth power where the earliest implants are at this level he runs ot processes his own actual gpms and old r3 and r4 processes then at level vii he will get reality on track back to trillions to the 200ths that is real sweep of time here he finds that one gpm will cover from trillions 29 to trillions 21 dating gets crude when the numbers are that large at this level when the pc has all the bank run out there are various drills for ots route 1 change of space processing etc for route 1 see the creation of human ability pp 3343 this includes change of space processing done in connection with the grand tour the grand tour consisted merely of getting the pc to be at different places in the physical universe the change of space aspect added an alternation of being at these different locations with being in the auditing room the pc is made to run change of space on any area until that area is in pt this process is also known as r19 it is questionable whether any of these drills are necessary lrh has found that if he is exterior all he needs to do is to itsa to an auditor for awhile to get over feeling queasy about whether he can hold his position in space as far as we are concerned the whole problem is one of dissemination smooth processing and keeping the bridge open behind us the smoothest way to do it would be to insist that the individual doesnt outstrip his training level with his processing level how do you guarantee that someone will make it all the way that is an important question there is the economic question too if it would take 1500 to 2000 hours at 1000 per hour just to be processed then even if it were possible to go ot in this way it would be too expensive for most people how much would training fees add up to lets say 5000 to 6000 that makes it more possible this cost could be decreased further by requiring that each preceding course be very thoroughly done so that each subsequent course would be shorter the student would of course get unlimited processing provided he was expert enough to keep his coauditor thus the reality level of advance is cared for which takes care of dissemination so any hcahpa could train people at has up to class i this would give this individual coaudit area that he could cope with level ii training would be given in some district it would not be too expensive nor too long about thirty days is the most that most people could spend then you would have higher levels of coaudit going you would need textbooks for each level with all the relevant technology question and answer sections and exams that would really ensure that the person has got the data etc the system of the private scientology practitioner who takes people in processes them and ejects them hasnt been generally successful although few have done it this system is following system set forth by the healing professions which we arent it took the healing professions long time to get this going anyway private clubs also have privileges which are denied to members of the public who have government protection the certification system handles people who do the theory part of the course but not for classification classification is shown by roman numeral if student is studying for the next class he can do the processes of that class provided that he has the nextlower classification but he cant do any higher processes without getting higher classification what about class 0 and class i class 0 has to be double the person is being trained for the has certificate and you have to consider him class of some sort going for the has certificate then you have has certificate classed class i that condition doesnt occur again after that the student always has certificate to put class on there are cases all over scientology that are parked because they skipped one of these levels and tried to leap into upperlevel processes while still worried about the environment it is true that only at the upper levels do you really resolve what is wrong with the case it is also true that you have chance to get at that without getting what is on top out of the way this also reduces the randomity and dangers connected with processing results
