to support policymakers and military commanders in reviewing the performance of the us intelligence community prior to the terrori st attacks of september 11 2001 the 911 commission the national commission on terrori st attacks upon the united states concluded that greater coordination of the nations intelligence effort is required to enhance the collection and analysis of in formation specifically the 911 commission recommended that new position of national intelligence director nid be established to ensure greater interagency coordinati on number of legislative proposals were introduced in 2004 to establish such an office separate from the director of the central intelligence agency cia1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21948crs2 2 see crs report rl32506 the position of director

authorization act for fy2005 signed on december 23 2004 provides that the dci may discharge the func tions of the dni until the dni is appointedthe nid was envisioned by the 911 commi ssion as having number of budgetary and managerial responsibilities2 in addition the occupant of the position would retain the present dcis role as the principal intelligence adviser to the president3 t h commission also envisioned that the nid who would be confirmed by the senate and would testify before congress would have relatively small st aff of several hundred people taking the place of the existing co mmunity management offices housed at the cia4 the commission adds however that w hope the president will come to look directly to the directors of the national intelligence centers the national counterterrorism center and other centers focusing on wm d proliferation inte rnational crime and narcotics and chinaeast asia to provide allsource analysis in their areas of responsibility balancing the advice of these intelligence chiefs against the contrasting viewpoints that may be offered by depar tment heads at state defense homeland security justice and other agencies5 there is some debate whether the 9 11 commission envisioned the nid as having the responsibility for coordinating nationa l intelligence estimates and other community products the director of ce ntral intelligence dci has b een responsible for providing intelligence to the president to the heads of departments and agencies of the executive branch the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and senior military commanders and where appropriate the senate and house of representatives and the committees thereof the statute provides that suc h national intelligence should be timely objective independent of political considerations nd based upon all sources available to the intelligence community6 draft legislation in the fall of 2004 did include the assignment of responsibilities for preparing nati onal intelligence estimates to the dni on december 17 2004 the president approved the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 hereafte r the intelligence reform actpl 108 458 the act incorporated many of the proposals of the 911 commission including the establishment of director of national in telligence dni separate from the director of the cia although most of the debates prior to passage of the legi slation addressed the dnis responsibilities for managing the inte lligence budget the act also made number of changes affecting the preparation of anal ytical products for cons

national intelligence council nic composed of nior analysts within the intelligence community and substantive experts from the public and private sector8 the members of the nic shall constitute the senior intelligence advisers fo the intelligence community for purposes of representing the views of the intelligence community within the united states government the members of the nic are to be appointed by report to and serve at the pleasure of the dni the intelligence reform act provides that the dni when appointed will be responsible for nies and other analytical products prepared under the auspices of the nic the three statutory responsibilitie s of the nic have been to produce national intelligence estimate s for the government included whenever the council considers appr opriate alternativ views held by elements of the intelligence community evaluate communitywide collec tion and production of intelligence by the intelligence community and the requirements and resources of such collection and production and otherwise assist the dni in ca rrying out responsibilities established in law9 the dci historically and the dni in the future has unique responsibility for the quality of inte lligence analysis for consumers at all levels of government while number of agencies produce analytical products the most authoritative intelligence products of the us intelligence community are published under the authority of the dci and potentially the dni nies are the primary but not the sole form in which the intelligence community forwards its judgments to senior officials and they are the only one prescribed in statute nies are produ ced at the nics initiative or in response to requests from senior policymakers nies are sometimes highly controversial they are designed to set forth the best objective judgments of the intelligence community but they occasionally are more closely related to policy rationales than some analysts would prefer an nie produced in october 2002 on iraqs continuing prog rams for weapons of mass destruction has been much criticized more r ecent nie on prospects for iraq has been the source of significant media attention10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21948crs4 of intelligence central intelligence agency 1996 11 see crs report rs21696 us intelligence and policymaking the iraq experience 12 for listing of the nios and description of the nics functions see httpodcigovnic 13 50 usc 4033b2aalthough the importance of particular to specific policy decisions may be debatable11 the nie process provides formal opportunity for the intelligence communitys input to policy deliberations arguably it is the responsibility of policymakers to seek the input of the inte lligence community but most observers would argue that the dni should not be reticent in presenting intelligence information and judgments on major policy issues when di fficult decisions are under consideration national intelligence officers the most recent chairman of the nic is ambassador robert l hutchings who had previously served in the state department and in academic institutions12 in addition there are senior analysts known as national intelligence officers nios for africa east asia economics and global issues europe intelligence assurance latin america military issues near east and south asia russia and eurasia transnational threats warning and weapons of mass destructi on and proliferation the nios who do not receive senate confirmation co from variety of government agencies inside and outside the intelligence community and from the private sector national intelligence officers supervis the production of nies and other communitywide products typically an analyst in one agency is designated by the relevant nio to prepare draft analytical pr oduct the draft then is reviewed by relevant analysts throughout the community subsequen tly if approved by the leadership of the intelligence community the national foreign intelligence board and the dci the draft has been circulated to policymakers in the executive branch and on occasion to members of congress nies set forth th best information and judgments of the intelligence community and are usually directed at significant issues that may require policy decisions the nios have worked for the dci in his capacity as head of the intelligence community rather than in his capacity as director of the cia in the future they will report to the dni thus nies and rela ted analytical products have not been cia products they have represen ted the consolidated views of the intelligence community with alternative views held by elements of the intelligence community noted in accordance with the statutory mandate13 it may be reasonably assumed that the nic will continue to depend heavily on the resources of the cia the cia contains the most extensive analytical capability across the board on all subjects that might c oncern national policymakers as well as considerable capability to support military comma nders and midlevel desk officers the cia was originally designed to be central without obligations to support departmental objectives as has been considered to be the case with the intelligence arms of the military services and the state department in so areas however other agencies have more extensive capabilities and can make an equal or greater contribution to nies and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21948crs5 14 see srept 108301 pp 2729 15 the views of different agencies as reflected in the october 2002 nie iraqs

2004 the report also contains scription of the nie dr afting process see pp 911products designed to express the judgment s of the entire intelligence community some critics moreover charge that cia on occasi on develops an agency position that tends to discourage alternate perspectives14 alternative views and concerns about politicization on many topics there are inevitably different perspectives and according to many observers policymakers are best served by rigorous presentations of alternative positions15 at the same time however some nies reflect an effort to craft language that all agencies can agree on and thus to avoid airing differences that might draw agencies into policy arguments between and among g overnment departments agency managers understand that too close involvement in policy argument by intelligence analysts can make their analyses unwelcome across the board in addition they well understand that analysis is an uncertain science and art and that even the best analysts can miss developments that loom large in retrospect and leave their agencies open to harsh criticism or retribution concern is often expressed about the extent to which intelligence products can become politicized ie be drafted to support or undermine certa in policy options charge of politicization is difficult to pr ove and is often pendent upon readers subjective viewpoint most obs ervers believe that analysts make conscientious effort to avoid policy advocacy but note that they are fully aware of policy disputes and may have their own views that may subconscious ly or otherwise influence their products there is according to some observers tende ncy to avoid making intelligence judgments that directly conflict with policy options th at have been chosen observers caution that placing intelligence analysis at the cen ter of policy disputes can undermine the effectiveness of the analytical contribution they suggest that intelligence can best serve by informing policy debates but analysts cannot be expected to provide definitive judgments that will resolve disputes that may involve myriad of different factors some far removed from intelligence questions in addition observers note that it should be recognized that policymaking sometimes invol ves making judgment s based on incomplete intelligence or on willingness to accept risks and uncertainties beyond the ken of analysts analysis can have subjective quality to some degree and can be undermined by unreasonable expectations the intelligence reform act provides seve ral provisions designed to ensure that analysis is wellprepared and not politicized in addition to having authority to establish an office of inspector general the dni is to assign an individual or entity to ensure that agencies conduct alternative analyses of information and conclusions in intelligence products section 1017 the dni is also to ssign an individual or entity to ensure that intelligence products are timely objective independent of po litical considerations based on all sources of available intelligence and employ the standards of proper analytichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21948crs6 tradecraft section 1019 another section re quires that the dni assign an individual to address analysts concerns about real or pe rceived problems of analytic tradecraft or politicization biased reporting or lack of objectivity in intelligence analysis section 1020 other analytical products the presidents daily brief pdb left uncertain are responsibilities for preparing the written brief on current intelligence that is prepared daily for the president and very few other senior officials the presidents daily brief pdb along with the senior executive intelligence brief seib that has somewhat wi der distribution have been pr epared by cias directorate of intelligence di and are considered that directorates flagship products nonetheless should the dni be responsible for daily substantive briefings at the white house rather than the cia director it might be considered appropriate that the dni staff draft the pdb and the seib based on input from the cia and other agencies the number of analysts who actually prepare th pbdseib is not large but their work reflects ongoing analysis in the cia and other parts of the intelligence community some might argue moreover that close and impor tant links between cia desklevel analysts and the pdb would be jeopardized should the briefs be prepared outside of the cia in addition there are myriads of other analytical products reports memoranda briefings etc that are prepared on routine basis the intelligence reform act does not transfer extensive analytical efforts to the nid leaving such duties to existing agencies the nic will be responsible for assessments that set forth th judgments of the intelligence community as whole issues for congress the intelligence reform act provides that the dni will assume responsibilities for managing the nic the dni will be support by the nic staff probably numbering less than 100 positions this gives the dni the capability to oversee the preparation of nies and to ensure that the views of all agencies have been taken into consideration in inter agency assessments major change will be the fact that the nios and their staff will work for one person the dni while cia analysts will report to separate director of the cia congress may ultimately assess whether these changes as they are implemented have improved the efforts of the intelligen ce community and its analytical products the future responsibility fo r the production and presentation of the pdbseibs is uncertain they are currently prepared by cias directorate of intelligence and that responsib ility could be continued on the other hand if the dni rather than the cia director is to conduct the da ily briefing for the president and senior white house officials it might be argued that the dni and the dnis immediate staff should have responsibility for the document that provi des the basis for the daily briefings
