november 9 2004 asian soybean rust asr was discovered in the united states in an experimental field in louisiana in the following three weeks it was discovered in eight additional southern states alabama arkansas florida georgia mississippi missouri south carolina and tennessee because asrs arrival in the united states came late in the crop year it is not thought to have had any measurable effect on 2004 soybean production furthermore its detection has provided an early warning and has given the us soybean sector time to prepare strategies to guard against possible asr damage to the 2005 soybean crop asr is harmful fungal disease that affects the growth of several commercial plants most notably soybeans the rust spores once windborne can spread rapidly and have been known to infect an entire region the same year the disease is first detected asr has reduced soybean yields by 10 to 80 in infected areas the diseases rapid transmission rate coupled with an abundance of host species suggests that eradication would be unlikely once the fungus is established in the united states as result the most effective treatment is thought to be the development and use of resistant plant varieties however commercial us soybean cultivar is resistant to or tolerant of asr in the short term the only effective responses are costly fungicides and the use of earlymaturing soybean cultivars three chemicals are presently registered with the us environmental protection agency epa for treatment of rust on soybeans in addition epa has approved several temporary emergency exemptions under section 18 of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act for additional fungicides estimates suggest that the us currently has fungicide capacity to treat up to 12 million acres during the past three years 20022004 us soybean plantings have averaged 742 million acres thus available fungicide appears sufficient to treat about 16 of average plantings shortage of fungicides could lead to constituent call for congressional action the us department of agriculture usda is coordinating plan to deal with asr that encompasses various usda agencies state landgrant universities and industry participants widespread asr infection in the united states would likely have significant regional and national effects on domestic and international commodity markets timely fungicide applications can prevent national yields from declining dramatically however the added cost of fungicides would likely lead to significant reduction in soybean production in loweryielding southern states 2004 usda study suggests that annual us economic losses could range between 240 million and 2 billion depending on the severity and extent of any outbreaks the arrival of asr has implications

an experimental field in louisiana2 in the following three weeks it was discovered in eight additional southern states alabama arkansas florida georgia mississippi missouri south carolina and tennessee3 most experts expect the pathogen to spread into the more northerly us soybeangrowing areas of the corn belt during the 2005 growing season aprilnovember although there remains considerable uncertainty about the likely timing location and degree of infestation and its economic impact experts suggest that asr spores were carried to the southeastern united states from south america on upper elevation winds during the 2004 hurricane season because asr arrived late in the crop year it is not thought to have had any measurable effect on 2004 us soybean production by november 9 2004 nearly 90 of the us soybean crop had already been harvested4 furthermore its detection has provided an early warning and has given the us soybean sector time to prepare strategies for establishing regional sentinel crops5 and distributing information on methods for field scouting detection and treatment to guard against possible asr damage to the 2005 soybean crop 1 for more information see

service nass crop progress nov 14 2004 5 the sentinel crops are planted about one month prior to the commercial crops and scouted daily by the cooperator because of their greater maturity these sentinel crops become infected first giving area growers warning to start fungicide applications some of these sentinel crops are then turned into fungicide demonstration plots crs2 most experts anticipate the pathogens northward spread in 2005 into the corn belt states for three primary reasons first conditions eg mild temperatures and yearround presence of host species in the southern united states where the asr first appeared tend to favor pathogen survival during the winter months second spring planting occurs in the southeast and delta several weeks ahead of planting in the major soybean growing regions of the corn belt this would give the pathogen time to establish itself and be available for windborne transmission as the primary soybean plantings of the corn belt reach vegetative stage third rust spores are very light and move easily on winds sometimes traveling hundreds of miles in single day consolation to more northerly soybean producers is that because asr must have living host to survive the winter asr will only successfully overwinter in the most southerly extremes of the united states and must be reintroduced each successive year into more northerly soybean production areas background on asr nature of the disease asian soybean rust asr is harmful disease caused by either of two fungal species phakopsora pachyrhizi and phakopsora meibomiae that affects the growth of several plant species of commercial importance most notably soybeans p pachyrhizi is much more virulent pathogen of soybeans than p meibomiae environmental factors are critical to the incidence and severity of asr long periods of leaf wetness are needed for spore germination as well as temperatures between 60o and 85o fahrenheit and high relative humidity of 7580 as result asr has been most destructive in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia africa australia and more recently south america asr is an obligate pathogen which means it needs living host cells to survive the pathogen can infect and reproduce on 90 known plant species 20 of which are found in the united states and are most common in southern states including dry beans kidney beans peas leguminous forage crops such as trefoil and sweet clover and weeds such as kudzu6 the rust spores once windborne can be moved long distances reportedly up to 400 miles in single day recent infestations in africa have been widespread in the same year that they were first detected in contrast in south america two to three years elapsed between detection and widespread onset historical expansion based on its recent history of geographic expansion asr was expected to enter the mainland united states sometime within the 2004 2007 period the virulent form of asr p pachyrhizi was first discovered in japan in 1902 the next reports were in 1934 from australia and india and again in 1940 in china the pathogen then showed up in africa in 1997 spores are believed to have crossed from asia to africa in wind currents of the upper atmosphere it was initially identified in uganda kenya and rwanda in 1997 then in zimbabwe in 1998 zimbabwe suffered significant yield loss to the aggressive form of rust much of what is known today about the effects and control of this pathogen has been learned from scientists and farmers in zimbabwe the pathogen subsequently showed up in south africa in 2001 it is believed to have been spread throughout africa by prevailing winds 6 usda aphis ppq asr strategic plan nov 2004 crs3 the rust surfaced in argentina in 2000 then year later in paraguay along the border of southern brazil although major outbreak did not occur in either argentina or paraguay by 2002 the pathogen is believed to have moved approximately 1000 miles from the southern tip of brazil to the heartland of soybean production in central brazil causing significant yield losses one of the reasons the pathogen could have proliferated and spread so quickly in central brazil is because the region experiences very humid conditions ideal for the proliferation of the disease another potential factor is the discovery of rust reproduction on volunteer soybeans unlike in the us corn belt where harsh winter conditions preclude volunteer germination for several months in brazils tropical climate fallen soybeans can germinate and grow into the vegetative stage shortly after harvest this extends the window of spore production and enables the pathogen to move more quickly via prevalent winds by september 2004 asr spores had continued their northward travel appearing near cali columbia about 5 degrees north of the equator7 yield loss once soybean plant is infected rust lesions tend to cover most of the leaf stem and pods the lesions cause premature defoliation thereby reducing photosynthesis and the number of days to maturity heavily infected plants have fewer pods and lighter seeds marketable yields are further reduced by the resulting poor seed quality8 the pathogen has been shown to reduce soybean yield as much as 80 when left untreated yield losses of 10 to 50 are quite common during the 200203 crop year soybean producers in mato grosso and other brazilian states were caught unaware by asr in most cases fungicides either were not available or were applied too late brazils soybean crop losses in 200203 were estimated at 34 million metric tons mmt out of total crop of 526 mmt loss of value of about 13 billion9 the brazilian government subsequently took measures to alleviate the asr problem brazils agricultural research network was mobilized and effective fungicides were identified and made available on the marketplace the following year soybean yield damage in 200304 in brazil due to asr was difficult to assess due to the simultaneous occurrence of drought and flood across major soybeangrowing areas however some analysts suggest that soybean rust damage had grown to nearly 5 million metric tons10 treatment and control according to an expert at usdas agricultural research service ars the diseases rapid transmission rate coupled with an abundance of host species suggests that eradication would be unlikely

mary palm quoted in bill tomson plans made to fight soybean continued crs4 and scientific community agree that the best longrun strategy for minimizing the effects of asr is the development of resistant varieties however current commercial us soybean cultivars are not resistant to or tolerant of asr in the short run industry participants and the scientific community suggest that access to registered fungicides and the planting of earlymaturing soybean cultivars are the primary means of mitigating production losses due to asr fungicides have been used effectively in other countries to mitigate the impacts of asr on soybean production in addition the planting of earlymaturing soybean cultivars has been found to reduce asrs harmful effects by minimizing the extent of growing time under warmhumid conditions when the disease proliferates responding to asrs arrival what is being done to prepare usda has taken the lead in coordinating activities to prepare for the introduction of asr into the united states since may 2002 an ad hoc working group composed of usda agencies aphis ars and the cooperative state research extension and education service csrees and the national plant board as well as several major landgrant universities and industry participants has been working to develop and implement fourpronged approach to asr that includes protection detection response and recovery12 protection initially this component involved identifying and protecting possible pathogen entryways into the united states to slow or prevent the arrival of asr in particular aphis sought to use its legislative authority under the plant protection act title iv of pl 106224 to control the importation of commodities that may serve as pathways for the introduction of foreign plant and animal pests and diseases during the 108th congress legislation was proposed hr 3775 with the support of both the american farm bureau federation and the american soybean association to ban soybean imports from countries known to harbor the pathogen however action was taken as the confirmed arrival of asr into the united states has refocused work to the remaining three components of the plan detection the detection plan is designed to ensure the early detection and rapid identification of asr once it reaches the united states specifics include the distribution of information concerning field characteristics about the disease details on collection and submission of specimens as well as diagnostics and confirmation procedures according to usda accurate and timely identification is the key to determining whether response will be attempted and if so the extent direction and magnitude of that response sentinel soybean plantings made about three weeks prior to commercial plantings throughout major soybean growing areas will be used to provide early detection thereby allowing time to control the pathogen in commercial plantings 11 continued disease wall street journal nov 30 2003 12 usda aphis ppq asr strategic plan nov 2004 crs5 before the disease becomes epidemic aphis has identified and is training key participants throughout the soybean industry with respect to detection survey procedures and best crop management practices to ensure effective asr detection and treatment methods in addition scouting and other detection information is available through the north central soybean research programs ncsrps plant health initiative phi website13 response to help minimize the potential impacts aphis has established communication network for facilitating response once asr has been detected in particular locality also ncsrps phi provides recommendations for rust management and directs interested parties to other useful information sources finally aphiss plant protection and quarantine ppq is implementing forecasting system14 to provide information about the probability of rust occurring within specific region based on current detection sites weather patterns crop plantings and growth stage and other information recovery the principal component of recovery involves the research and development of improved lowercost fungicides and fungicide application practices as well as the research and development of diseaseresistant soybean cultivars personnel from usdas aphis ars and csrees are collaborating with iowa state university and with usdas foreign diseaseweed science research unit at fort detrick maryland to examine options for controlling the disease and developing new sources of genetic resistance ars and csrees also have been working with seed companies to develop commercially acceptable rustresistant or tolerant soybean varieties this research has been supported by usda and the homeland security department as well as the state soybean checkoff boards represented by the north central soybean research program and the united soybean board15 more recently congress appropriated 800000 for research on soybean rust and specifically included language encouraging usda to accelerate research on plant varieties that improve tolerance to soybean rust pathogens in the consolidated appropriations act 2005 pl108447 the joint research objectives include determine resistance of us commercial germ plasm to rust identify resistant germ plasm from international sources determine efficacy of fungicides against soybean rust as well as the optimum stage of disease development for applying fungicide treatment to maximize the effectiveness of treatments and to minimize the costs and environmental risks associated with chemical use tests are underway in countries with heavy rust infestations 13 ncsrp phi asian soybean rust at httpwwwplanthealthinfo 14 for more information see aphis ppq pest alert soybean rust us

prediction models to identify the potential rust pathway within the united states to determine which resistant varieties should receive research emphasis develop an international network of collaborators and collect soybean rust isolates according to the united soybean board usda scientists have already screened more than 20000 lines of us and exotic germ plasm for resistance to rust16 of the lines screened 700 lines appear to show at least partial resistance to rust yet the availability of cultivars with good resistance and other characteristics desired in soybeans for commercial production is still thought to be six to eight years away17 fungicide registration status in the united states the sale of any pesticide including fungicides is prohibited in the united states unless it is registered and labeled in accordance with the regulations of the us environmental protection agency epa18 new uses for example on soybean rust for pesticide active ingredients previously registered with the epa must also be reviewed and registered as of november 19 2004 three chemicals were registered with the epa for treatment of soybean rust19 in addition epa had approved several emergency exemptions for fungicides for the treatment of soybean rust under section 18 of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra section 18 registrations grant temporary emergency use rights in specifically named states chemical companies university researchers and the soybean industry are searching for additional efficacious chemicals formulations and application rates and methods selection testing and eventual registration with epa of potential fungicides for use in treating asr can be slow process that may take months or years major chemical companies that already have fungicides on the market are making efforts to get labeling changes approved through the epa however labeling changes can often require additional testing for residues and tolerance levels particularly if dosage rates and application methods for asr vary greatly from currently labeled uses epa receives its authority to regulate pesticides under fifra the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca and the food quality protection act fqpa under fifra epa registration requires more than 100 different scientific studies and tests from applicants to ensure that pesticide when used

up with specific exemption request fungicide availability one market watcher estimates that the united states currently as of november 13 2004 has fungicide capacity to treat up to 12 million acres23 during the past three years 20022004 us soybean plantings have averaged 742 million acres thus sufficient fungicide is available to treat about 16 of average plantings how widespread will asr outbreaks be how intense will any infestation be ie how may times will fungicides have to be applied to the same field fungicide producers confront these uncertainties when they make fungicide production decisions well in advance of knowing what demand will be soybean producers on the other hand are unlikely to purchase costly fungicides until they learn of the appearance of asr in their locality at which point they will want to purchase fungicide immediately shortage of fungicides or even the perception of fungicide shortage could lead to constituent call for congressional action the response of local state and federal agencies is limited because the us fungicide market is in private hands for discussion of government response during the 2004 influenza shortage an apparently analogous situation see crs report rl32655 influenza vaccine shortages and implications crop insurance according to usdas risk management agency rma the agency charged with administering the federal

about soybean rust continued crs8 recommended control measures will result in assessing uninsurable causes of losses if effective control measures are available or there are insufficient amounts of chemicals available for effective control the resulting loss of production is covered however producers are responsible to keep informed of soybean rust outbreaks in their area disaster assistance widespread and severe loss of soybean production due to asr may encourage legislation to assist growers if 2005 rust outbreak is severe there is substantial precedent for ad hoc disaster payments being made to assist growers who suffer yield loss due to plant disease25 most recently payments were made to producers of any 2003 or 2004 crop with significant losses caused by any natural disaster26 asrrelated market issues soybean production represents vital economic activity in large portion of the united states soybeans rank second only to corn as the most important field crop grown in the united states both in terms of planted area and value soybean harvested area has exceeded corn harvested area in every year since 1999 from 1999 to 2003 us soybean planted area averaged nearly 74 million acres while the value of soybean production averaged nearly 14 billion27 during that same period over half of the states derived important economic returns from soybean production the value

for several public policies including pest control research pesticide regulation disaster assistance and crop insurance30 potential effects of asr entry into the united states asr is potentially devastating to temperate soybean producers because it easily adapts to diverse environments it is prolific under the right environmental conditions and it is very mobile in april 2004 usdas economic research service ers completed simulation modeling exercise to project the potential economic losses associated with various degrees of asr infestation in the united states31 according to ers the extent of economic impacts will depend on the timing location spread and severity of rust establishment and outbreaks and on how soybean and crop producers livestock producers and consumers of agricultural commodities respond32 early asr detection combined with widespread fungicide availability can greatly reduce yield losses and economic damage however the added cost of fungicide application would lower soybean returns relative to other field crops such as corn that are unaffected by the pathogen as result it is likely that the presence of asr would lead to some acreage shifting away from soybeans and toward other crops these effects would vary regionally and would depend on relative expected returns of different crops and alternate landuse activities corn would likely be the primary beneficiary of displaced soybean acres especially in the corn belt in the plains states wheat other small grains and possibly pastureland could gain some area in the delta and southeast cotton probably would be the primary beneficiary of soybean acreage shifts ers mediumterm results which assume that asr is already established and endemic to the united states suggest that annual economic losses could range between 240 million and 2 billion depending on the severity and extent of subsequent outbreaks the large range of damage estimates reflects the uncertainty associated with the eventual effects of soybean rust in the united states under highinfestation scenario ers assumes national average yield losses of 95 in contrast under lowinfestation scenario ers actually assumes some yield gains due to shifting of soybean area out of loweryielding regions such as the southeast and delta states the ers simulation model suggests that soybean producers would bear most 60 to 70 of the costs of adjusting to soybean rust while consumers and livestock producers assume the remainder of the economic cost although not specifically included in the ers model the us oilseedcrushing industry would also likely see its profit margins squeezed by high soybean prices relative to meal and oil prices 30 for more information see usda ers economic and policy implications of windborne entry of asian soybean rust into the united states ocs04d02 by m livingston r johansson s daberkow m roberts m ash and v breneman april 2004 p 2 hereafter referred to as usda ers asr study april 2004 31 ibid 32 ibid p 2 crs10 market analysts suggest that the discovery of asr in the united states is not likely to have any impact on us soybean exports because nearly every major soybean producing country in the world also is infected by asr33 regional disparities under the ers simulation model the impact of an asr infestation falls heaviest on those regions that grow the most soybeans the corn belt the delta appalachia the northern plains and the southeast34 when soybean rust is assumed to infest given region soybean acres and soybean net returns decline livestock producers in all regions suffer economic losses due to higher feed costs usdas research suggests that because of the potential severity of the disease and fungicide costs needed to control field infections significant share of soybean production in the southernmost states could become unprofitable during the 1996 to 2002 period soybean yields in appalachia ap the delta dl and the southeast averaged about 26 below the national average see table 1 yet soybean production has been valuable agricultural activity for both regions during that same period the ap dl and regions combined averaged more than 10 million acres planted to soybeans with annual production valued at 16 billion35 the loss of significant share of soybean production in these regions likely would adversely affect their growing pork and poultry sectors due to the regions growing disparity between feed production and demand conclusion anticipatory work headed by usdas aphis to mitigate the adverse effects of asrs arrival in the united states is well underway until asr resistant soybean varieties are developed soybean producers will have to rely on fungicides and earlymaturing varieties to diminish potential yield losses the resultant higher production costs are expected to have important regional effects particularly in loweryielding southern states while livestock producers nationwide are expected to suffer economic losses due to higher feed costs 33 world perspectives inc asian soybean rust arrives in the us by john baize nov 12 2004 34 appalachia ky nc tn va wv corn belt ia il in mo oh delta ar
