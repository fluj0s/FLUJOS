christopher m davis analyst on the congress and legislative process government and finance division when conference committee completes its work successfully the committee presents and explains its agreements in two documents first conference report and second joint explanatory statement often called statement of managers1 the conference report presents the formal legislative language on which the conference committee has agreed the joint explanatory statement explains the various elements of the conferees agreement in relation to the positions that the house and senate had committed to the conference committee two copies of each document must be signed by majority of the house conferees and by majority of the sena conferees one pair of the signed documents is retained by each houses conferees thus conferee who supports the conference agreement signs four signature sheets two for the conferen ce report and two for the joint explanatory statement of course conferees who do not support the agreement are not expected to sign any of the signature sheets the house and senate create conference committee to resolve the disagreements that result when one house passes bill and th other house then passes the same bill with one or more amendments it is those amendments that are in disagreement between the houses and that are the subjects of conference negotiations in their conference report the conferees propose way to resolve the disagr eement created by each of the amendments assume that the house passed bill and that the senate later passed the same bill with for example three discrete amendments these senate amendments are numbered in the order in which they would affect the house bill and the conference report addresses each of them in turn there are essentially three ways in which conferees can propose to dispose of each amendment both houses can accept the senate amendment both houses can reject it or both houses can agree to compromise between the senate amendment and the corresponding provision of the h ousepassed bill in this examplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98382crs2 with respect to the first amendment in disagreement the conference report may propose that the senate recede from its amendment in other words that the houses position should prevail with respect to the second amendmen t in disagreement the conference report may propose that the house r ecede from its disagreement to the senate amendment and then concur in it in other words that the senates position should prevail and with respect to the third amendment in disagreement the conference report may propose first that the house recede from its disagreement to the senate amendment and then concur in it with house amendment the text of which is printed in the conference report and second that the senate also concur in this house amendment in other words that compromise between the house and senate positions should prevail the conference report itself only contains formal statements of whatever procedural actions the conferees propose that one or bot h houses take and the formal legislative language the conferees propose that the two houses approve thus the conference report is essentially comparable to the text of bill that standing committee reports to the house or senate the joint explanatory st atement on the other hand corresponds to the written committee report us ually prepared to accompany the bill and to explain the committees decisions clause 7e of house rule xxii and paragraph 4 of senate rule xxviii describe the purpose of this statement in s imilar terms the senate rule states in part that the statement shall be sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform the senate as to the effect which the amendments or propos itions contained in the conference report will have upon the measure to which thos amendments or propositions relate the joint explanatory statement typically identifies each major matter in disagreement that was submitted to the conferees the statement then summarizes the house position the senate position and th conferees recommendation when the conferees have negotiated over series of numbered amendments the statement of managers is likely to discuss each of these amendments in sequence when the conferees have negotiated over bill pa ssed by one house and an amendment in the nature of substitute approved by the other situation that often arises the statement is likely to discuss the house senate and conference positions on each of the major issues that the two versions of the bill addr ess like standing committee reports accompanying bills joint explanatory statements may prove informative as legislative history unlike standing committee reports however joint explanatory statements may not contain statements of minority or additional views each conference report and joint explanatory statement are printed in the house portion of the congressional record in addition they are printed together as single house report senate rule xxviii also requires that the report and statement be printed as senate report by nimous consent however the senate normally waives this requirement because the report and accompanying statement are printed as house report and there is need for the same documents to be printed twice
