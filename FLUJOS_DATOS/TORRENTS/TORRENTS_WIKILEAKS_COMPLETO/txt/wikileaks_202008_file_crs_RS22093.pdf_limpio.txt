tion on iraq see crs report rl31339 iraq post saddam governance and security issues by kenneth katzman introduction since the us invasion of iraq in march 2003 us policy has been focused on maintaining the territorial integrity of iraq and rebuilding its state institutions including national army and police forces that reflect iraqs diverse ethnic and sectarian makeup however the sunnidriven insurgency and overall us political reliance on shiites and kurds two historically persecuted iraqi groups emboldened by the overthrow of the saddam hussein regime have complicated us efforts to forge truly national iraqi military as has been widely reported sh iites and kurds comprise disproportionate amount of the iraqi security forces isf it is becoming increasingly evident that some iraqi shiite and kurdish leaders do not believe in the bush administrations vision of an iraq in which all communities share power and the new security forces are represen tative of iraqi society at large with sign of discernible progress toward national rec onciliation on the horizon there is an ever increasing risk that ustrained iraqi soldiers and police will be used by shiites and kurds to implement narrow parochial political agendas that exacerbate sectarian strife inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22093crs2 1 according to the congressionallymandated partment of defense qu arterly status report of november 2006 the coalition and the government of iraq are committed to creating an iraqi military that reflects the ethnic and religious fabric of iraq with diverse units loyal to the nation not sectarian interests there are however i ndications that political forces in iraq have influenced senior military appointment s on the basis of sectarian affiliation 2 ahmed s hashim military power and state formation in modern iraq middle east policy winter 2003 vol10 iss4 p29iraq many observers believe that shiite parties and militias the badr brigade controlled by the supreme council for islamic revoluti on in iraq and the mahdi army controlled by muqtada sadr through their influence in the iraqi interior ministry and its police forces are pursuing this strategy the iraq i army ia has been less politicized due to overall us control over many of its divisions1 nevertheless as the united states transfers authority over the ia to iraqi co mmanders and the ministry of defense mod the risk of ia penetration by either shiite militias or s unni insurgents increases dramatically historical background since its creation at the hands of the br itish in 1921 the iraqi army has never been able to effectively integrate the countrys arabs and kurds as the army has traditionally been strong institution and source of pr ide among many iraqi sunni and some shiite arabs sunni arab officers who had served in both the ottoman empire and the arab revolt against that empire in world war i fo rmed the core of the nascent army which was primarily designed to be an internal secur ity force with little or ability to project power beyond iraqs borders during the british mandate 19201932 the british effectively controlled the iraqi army but curbed its expansion by relying on british air power and an ethnicallyreligiouslybased unit known as th assyrian levies which was controlled by the ministry of the interior and was used as bulwark against turkish meddling in the north and as counterinsurgency force agains t rebellious segments of iraqi society such as the shiites and kurds after iraq obtained full independence in 1932 its sunni army officers became outwardly more politicized culminating in the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958 by major general abdulkarim qass im sunnis continued to dominate the officer corps of the iraqi army and by the early 1960s sunnis composed 70 of all officers in the iraqi army of whom 45 hailed from mosul with shiites making up 20 and kurds and other minorities 102 relations between sunni shiite and kurdish officers were tense due to repeated kurdish revolts in northern iraq and institutional discrimination against shiites within the army saddam hussein who himself had formal military training purged the army of anyone considered to be potential threat to him and to the ruling baath party he created number of overlapping security agencies and filled them with members of his immediate family and larger tribe saddam largely ignored the regular iraqi army with the exception of the elite republican guard units as power within his regime wa s based largely on his special security agencies which kept close tabs on iraqi officers saddam continued the practice of relegating shiites to low level positions and to conscripts within the regular army shiites took disproporti onate amount of casualties on the front

of entities as among the most im portant factors in stabilizing iraq after the cessation of large scale military opera tions although observers expected us officials to prohibit the upper echelon of sa ddams security forces from rejoining the army the initial decision to exclude regular army officers and conscripts surprised many analysts who had argued for the adminis tration to distingu ish between saddams privileged inner core and the largely neglected regular army ambassador l paul bremer iii former head of the coa lition provisional authority cpa defended the policy noting the role the decree had in reassuring the ku rds that the cpa was serious about creating united iraq and convincing them not to secede3 current us training efforts during 20042006 us policy was focused on

report recommends th at the highest priority be given to training the isf and that only the most high ly qualified us officers should be assigned to embedded teams5 although many observers consider us advisory efforts crucial to boosting isf morale and combat effectiveness cr itics charge that us training efforts are hampered by several challenges that may be difficult to overcome in the short term

make up the military training teams have formal authority over ir aqi commanders complicity between iraqi ministries in baghdad and politicallymotivated commanders in the field is commonplace and according to one us soldier right now we cannot even fire iraqi army leaders whom we know cooperate with in surgents or are incompetent7 on january 10 2007 president bush tacitly acknowledged the lack of capability of the isf by announcing that we will increase the embedding of american advisers in iraqi army units and partner coalition brigade w ith every iraqi army division currently 4000 coalition trainers are embedded in iraqi units that figure is expected to either triple or quadruple in the coming months this increase not net increase also reflects an expansion of mission to include operations as well as training overall the pentagon estimates that approximately 325000 iraqi pe rsonnel are in the isf both army and police however due to poor iraqi record keep ing it is uncertain how many iraqi soldiers remain in service as noted in numerous us military and independent studies on the rebuilding effort chronic absenteeism8 and high desertion rates lead iraqi units to be in constant state of undercapacity averag ing around 6570 strength at any given moment9 currently it is not illegal for an iraqi soldier to abandon his unit or go awol according the us defense department ia awol rates exceed 50 when units were directed to deploy to areas of combat outside of their norma l areas of operations shiite militias although militias independent of the iraqi ar med forces were declared illegal under cpa order 91 june 2004 in an effort to combat the insurgency and increase the number of iraqi forces serving in the field iraqi and us officials early on allowed some militias to infiltrate their members into the regu lar iraqi security forces in reality these militias badr brigade10 and kurdish peshmerga remained independent in retrospect many observers have decried that decision asserting that it favored shortterm political expediency over iraqs na tional longterm interests under successive iraqi transitional and permanent governments shiite militias operating under the guise of paramilitary police and army units have used the sunni insurgent threat to expand their reach lyzing any attempt to forge nonsectarian iraqi military the shiite political parties that control the militias have through the us guided political process gained control over the iraqi government making outside effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22093crs5 11 us military urging

training when we stood them up we didnt ask are you sunni or are ou shia they ended up being 99 percent shia now when we look at that we say they do not reflect the population of iraq12 although the current iraqi interior minist er jawad bolani who succeeded bayan jabr former officer in the military wing of sc iri has fired corrupt interior ministry employees and even disbanded whole police br igades accused of acting as death squads shiite militias have proliferated and may longer answer directly to their leadership the battle for baghdad many analysts believe that under the current iraqi government headed by prime minister nouri kamal maliki shiite the iraqi army has been underut ilized and circumvented particularly in the capital of baghdad by paramilitary police forces widely believed to be operating in collusion with shiite militias as us and iraqi policy makers formulate and revise plans to secure the capital the maliki government has been criticized for deploying onl two of six additional ia brigades it pledged to reinforce in baghdad during operation together forward in the summer of 2006 many believe that malikis hesitation st ems from his dawa partys governing alliance with shiite radical leader muqtada sadr and the fact that ia soldiers serving in baghdad were recruited locally and therefore more likely to be loyal toward sadr and other shiite leader s the iraq study group report asserts that the iraqi government under maliki has rejected sustained security operations in sadr city vast baghdad slum protected by mahdi army figh ters ia units from outside the capital may be more willing to crack down on shiite militias like the mahdi army engaged in sectarian violence as shiite soldiers recruited elsewhere may have fewer kinship and tribal ties to shiites in baghdad according to one us army colonel serving as an advisor to iraqi army units in baghdad what the iraqi army cant do is protect soldiers when they go home or protect their families its very very difficult thats why solution has to be political one and not military one13 on january 18 2007 iraqi officials announced that for the first time it had taken significant action against the

enemy iran us and iraqi military commanders have conducted town hall meetings in several sunni provi nces in order to convince trib leaders to encourage their members to join the isf this strategy has met with limited succe ss though some tribal leaders bent on ridding their towns of foreign fighters have contributed local fighters to the isf on temporary basis overall s unni arabs have demande d that rather than working with existing isf units they be allowed to raise their own tribal militias many analysts believe that tribal units from sunni areas would be too susceptible to insurgent infiltration iraqi sunni arabs are unwilling to serve outside th eir home provinces as required by the iraqi army sunnis who do serv in the isf take enormous risk to their personal safety and the safety of their families shiite control of the ia according to january 2007 angeles times report the ias 5th division stationed in diyala pr ovince region north and east of baghdad with mix of sunnis shiites and kurds was penetrated by shiite militia and subsequently conducted an intimidation campaign against the provinces sunni population according to the report the pr ovincial commander was chosen by the badr brigade14 colonel brian d jones who was the commander of us forces in diyala suggested that the ias operations in diyala came on orders from the central government in baghdad according to col jones i believe this is larger plan to make diyala shia province rather than sunni province15 kurdish loyalties many analysts have questioned whether over the long run the isf can successfully integrate iraqi arabs and kurds since the start of us efforts to rebuild the iraqi army the combination of the sunni character of the insurgency in conjunction with the poorer quality of the arab sunni and sh iite recruits forced us and iraqi officials to rely heavily on the kurdish components of the security forces the iraq armys second and third divisions have large kurdish components re portedly kurdish brigades of the ia may be deployed to baghdad in the coming months kurdish leaders have insisted on retaining their own militias some military analysts note that kurdish recruits are more loyal to their tribal and political party leaders than they are to the central government in baghdad calling in to question the viability of single unified iraqi army the combination of long history of kurdisharab conflict th use of chemical w eapons against kurdish villages between 19881990 and kurdish desi res for autonomy may have produced strong antipathy among kurdish politicians for strong centralized military force in iraq according to massoud barzani leader of the kurdish democratic pa rty one of the two main kurdish parties we want to keep our peshmerga because they are symbol of resistanceits not matter to be discussed or negotiated16
