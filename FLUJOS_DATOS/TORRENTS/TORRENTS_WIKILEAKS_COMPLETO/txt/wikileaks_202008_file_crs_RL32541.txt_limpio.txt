the 911 commission updated march 30 2005 bart elias specialist in aviation safety security and technology resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress aviation securityrelated findings and recommendations of the 911 commission summary the 911 commission found that qaeda operatives exploited known weaknesses in us aviation security to carry out the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 while legislation and administration actions after september 11 2001 were implemented to strengthen aviation security the 911 commission concluded that several weaknesses continue to exist these include perceived vulnerabilities in cargo and general aviation security as well as inadequate screening and access controls at airports the 911 commission issued several recommendations designed to strengthen aviation security by enhancing passenger prescreening improving measures to detect explosives on passengers addressing human factors issues at screening checkpoints expediting deployment of inline baggage screening systems intensifying efforts to identify track and screen potentially dangerous cargo and deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft in addition to these specific recommendations an overarching recommendation for transportation security policy asserts that priorities should be set based on risk and the most practical and cost effective deterrents should be implemented assigning appropriate roles and missions to federal state and local authorities as well as private stakeholders in response to the 911 commissions recommendations the national intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 118 stat 3638 was enacted on december 17 2004 the act contains numerous aviation security provisions many of which address 911 commission recommendations related to aviation safety these provisions build upon prior aviation securityrelated provisions contained in vision 100 the century of aviation reathorization act pl 108176

aviation securityrelated findings and recommendations of the 911 commission the intelligence authorization act for fy2003 pl 107306 116 stat 2383 established the national commission on terrorists attacks upon the united states the 911 commission the bipartisan 911 commission was charged with the responsibilities of examining and reporting on the facts and causes of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and presenting its findings conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures to prevent future acts of terrorism to the president and the congress the 911 commission concluded its investigation and released its final report on july 22 2004 this crs report discusses the 911 commissions findings and recommendations pertaining to aviation security exploited weaknesses in aviation security the national commission on terrorists attacks upon the united states the 911 commission found that qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in the aviation security system to carry out the attacks of september 11 2001 weaknesses in aviation security exploited by the 911 terrorists included prescreening process that focused on detecting potential aircraft bombers and not potential hijackers lax checkpoint screening and permissive rules regarding small knives lack of inflight security measures such as air marshals and reinforced cockpit doors an industrywide strategy of complying with hijackers in non confrontational manner and lack of protocols and capabilities for executing coordinated federal aviation administration faa and military response to multiple hijackings and suicidal hijackers the 911 commission found that underlying these specific weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the aviation system was what they termed failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence national defense and aviation security the 911 commission concluded that while suicide hijackings were by means farfetched possibility given qaedas past methods and motives these scenarios were slow to work their way into the thinking of aviation security experts1 while some agencies were concerned about hijackings 1 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission continued crs2 and had speculated about various hijack scenarios there were specific constructive actions taken to defend against these possible threats prior to september 11 2001 furthermore the likelihood of suicide hijacking scenario was greatly underestimated the 911 commission also concluded that before september 11 2001 congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking while congress focused its aviation oversight activities on airport congestion and passenger service regarding congresss aviation related activities prior to september 11 2001 the 911 commission wrote heeding calls for improved air service congress concentrated its efforts on passenger bill of rights to improve capacity efficiency and customer satisfaction in the aviation system there was focus on terrorism2 legislative actions following the 911 attacks in the aftermath of september 11 2001 congress moved quickly to pass the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 115 stat 597 designed to correct weaknesses in aviation security exploited by the 911 hijackers as well as other potential vulnerabilities in transportation systems atsa established the transportation security administration tsa as new organization within the department of transportation responsible for security matters in all modes of transportation highlights of atsa included establishing federal security screener workforce under tsa at airports requiring explosive detection screening of all checked bags deploying air marshals on all high risk flights and hardening cockpit doors atsa also gave the tsa broad authority to assess threats to security in all transportation modes primarily focusing on aviation and implement appropriate security measures in this regard atsa was seen as comprehensive legislative vehicle for addressing transportation security with specific emphasis on aviation security the following year the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 116 stat 2135 established the department of homeland security dhs and placed the tsa within this new department the act also authorized the arming of airline pilots as an additional measure to protect aircraft against terrorist hijackers additional aviation security measures were included in the most recent faa reauthorization act vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 117 stat 2490 most notably vision 100 established an aviation security capital fund to help pay for placing explosive detection systems eds inline with baggage conveyers and sorting facilities in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of 1 continued report new york ny w w norton co 2004 p 344 2 the 911 commission report pp 8586 crs3 checked baggage screening and expanded the program to arm pilots to include pilots of allcargo aircraft despite these actions congressional and administration oversight of aviation security has identified several areas of vulnerability that persist these include air cargo operations general aviation access controls for airport employees screener performance and possible terrorist attacks using shoulderfired missiles recommendations of the 911 commission the 911 commission also recognized many of these vulnerabilities the 911 commission concluded that major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security these together with inadequate screening and access controls continue to present aviation security challenges3 based on these findings the 911 commission made specific recommendations regarding improvements to airport passenger and baggage screening and air cargo security while the commission identified potential threats posed by inadequate access controls to secured areas of airports and general aviation operations it did not issue any recommendations pertaining to these risks also while the 911 commission acknowledged concerns raised by previous and current administrations over possible shoulderfired missiles attacks against commercial airliners it did not make any specific recommendations regarding this threat the 911 commission delineated its recommendations regarding aviation security in section titled layered security system as suggested by this title the 911 commission concluded that the tsa must implement multilayered security system that takes into consideration the full array of possible terrorist tactics the 911 commission noted that these various layers of security must each be effective in their own right and must be coordinated with other layers in manner that creates redundancies to catch possible lapses in any one layer this conclusion is consistent with aviation security mandates under atsa and tsas concept of concentric rings of security4 since many facets of aviation security have been addressed through legislation and administration actions since the 911 attacks the 911 commission focused its aviation security recommendations on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation while not all recommendations offered in the 911 commissions final report were formally labeled as such crs has identified six aviationspecific recommendations5 these are 1 enhancing passenger prescreening 2 improving measures to detect explosives on passengers 3 addressing human factors issues at screening checkpoints 4 expediting deployment of inline baggage screening systems 5 intensifying efforts to identify track and screen potentially dangerous 3 ibid p 391 4 transportation security administration budget estimates fiscal year 2004 march 2003 5 for clarity multipart 911 commission recommendations have been separately identified in this report crs4 cargo and 6 deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft in addition to these six aviationspecific recommendations the 911 commission also issued an overarching recommendation for transportation security policy to set priorities based on risk and implement the most practical and cost effective deterrents assigning appropriate roles and missions to federal state and local authorities as well as private stakeholders enhancing passenger prescreening on september 11 2001 passenger prescreening consisted of three measures the computer assisted passenger prescreening system capps answers to two securityrelated questions asked by airline ticketing and gate agents and the presentation of photo identification to airline personnel more than half of the september 11 2001 hijackers were identified as selectees based on one or more of these prescreening techniques however there was little consequence to their selection because at the time prescreening was used solely as tool to screen for individuals that might try to bomb passenger jet using methods similar to those employed in the bombing of pan am flight 103 while the capps system is still in use its purpose has since been expanded to screen for possible hijackers as well capps is maintained directly by the airlines as part of their security program and uses computer algorithms to identify selectees based on matching passengers behaviors eg method of ticket purchase to hijacker and bomber profiles the followon to capps dubbed capps ii has been embroiled in controversy for the past two years over concerns regarding protection of personal data and civil liberties as proposed capps ii would implement two step process to 1 authenticate passengers identity using commercial databases and 2 check that name against terrorist watch lists maintained by the federal government if flagged by the system passengers could be either denied boarding or selected for secondary screening the 911 commission recommended that improved passenger pre screening capabilities should not be delayed while the argument about successor to capps continues the 911 commission further recommended that the prescreening system should utilize the larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government both the homeland security appropriations act for fy2004 pl 108 90 117 stat 1137 and vision 100 directed the department of homeland security to address these concerns and limited implementation of capps ii to system testing until the government accountability office gao verifies that adequate steps have been taken to address these concerns however in february 2004 the gao found that the tsa had adequately addressed only one of the eight concerns regarding capps ii implementation6 continued reluctance by the airlines to provide data for testing capps ii due to liability concerns has also stymied progress the 911 commission recommended that airlines should be required to supply the information needed to test and implement passenger prescreening 6 us general accounting office aviation security computerassisted passenger prescreening system faces significant implementation challenges gao04385 february 2004 crs5 recent media reports indicate that the capps ii program has essentially been scrapped over privacy concerns however secretary of homeland security tom ridge has suggested that new program with different name might eventually take its place7 in light of the 911 commission recommendation to forge forward with implementing passenger prescreening system and the current lack of progress toward developing such system congress may intensify its oversight of the secure flight program the successor to capps and engage in debate over the best way to proceed hr 10 contains provision that would require the tsa to take over responsibility for prescreening from the airlines withing 180 days on enactment and begin testing of the system by november 1 2004 this measure is in line with administration plans for the testing and rollout of the secure flight program improving measures to detect explosives on passengers evidence highlighted by the 911 commission indicated that qaeda has had keen interest in bombing airliners for some time the 911 commissions report describes ramzi yousefs 1994 bombing of phillippines airlines flight bound for tokyo as precursor to larger operation the socalled bojinka plot to bomb multiple usbound airliners over the pacific ocean in the philippines airlines bombing yousef reportedly assembled an improvised explosive device ied in the airplanes lavatory and hid it under seat during the previous flight affixing digital watch timer he had invented concerns over ieds were brought to public attention in december 2001 when richard reid attempted to down transatlantic flight using explosives concealed in shoe concerns over ieds were again raised by the media in october 2003 when college student nathaniel heatwole snuck banned items and materials resembling plastic explosives aboard passenger jets while neither of these high profile incidents was cited in the 911 commission report the 911 commission acknowledged persisting weaknesses in the ability to detect explosives on passengers by formally recommending that the tsa and congress give priority to improving detection of explosives on passengers the 911 commission further recommended that as start all individuals selected for secondary screening undergo explosives screening current screening technologies and procedures offer limited capabilities to detect explosives carried on passengers while carryon items and sometimes shoes are xrayed and may be subjected to secondary chemical trace detection screening methods passengers are typically only screened by metal detectors new technology offers the capability to detect bombmaking chemicals on individuals using trace detection methods these systems are being operationally tested in various transportation settings including ongoing field tests at five airport sites tf green state airport providence ri greater rochester international airport ny san diego international airport ca tampa international airport fl and gulfportbiloxi international airport ms other possible methods for detecting explosives on passengers involve body scan imaging using low dose xray backscatter or other techniques body scan technology is considered somewhat more 7 mimi hall and barbara delollis plan to collect flier data canceled usa today july 14 2004 crs6 controversial because it renders nude image of the scanned individual which is regarded by some as overly intrusive alternative methods to these technologies include the use of bombsniffing dogs and physical searches of individuals in light of the 911 commission recommendation congress may debate whether and how to implement and fund an initiative for screening passengers using the most effective means available see crs report rs21920 detection of explosives on airline passengers recommendation of the 911 commission and related issues addressing human factors issues at screening checkpoints the 911 commission also recommended that the tsa conduct human factors study to understand problems in screener performance and set attainable objectives for improving performance at screening checkpoints screener performance deficiencies were highlighted by recent dhs inspector generals audit that found poor screener performance among both federal and contract screeners during covert testing at screening checkpoints8 the tsa has launched several initiatives to address these concerns for example the tsa has greatly expanded the use of threat image projection tip system that tests screener onthejob performance by projecting images of threat objects on xray monitors using data from tip researchers can assess certain human performance needs in aviation security the tsa is also examining ways to improve the recurrent training of screeners key human factors issues are likely to include screener selection and training fitness for duty and human interaction with screening technologies while the tsa maintains small cadre of human factors researchers and some ongoing research in this area is being conducted by universities and contractors research on aviation security human factors and funding for these activities pales in comparison to human factors research programs in the department of defense and faas safetyrelated human factors activities also there presently is lack of comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security in light of this recommendation and persisting concerns over screener performance congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where tsas human factors research efforts may not be adequately addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance congress may also consider whether to task the national academy of sciences or some other independent body with examining human factors needs in aviation security while the national academy of sciences did address human factors in its 1999 assessment of aviation security technologies it has not conducted focused study of human factors needs in the aviation security system and has not examined this issue since the terrorist attacks of september 11 20019 hr 10 contains provision that would require the tsa to conduct human 8 statement of clark kent ervin inspector general us department of homeland security before the committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on aviation us house of representatives april 22 2004 9 national research council assessment of technologies deployed to improve aviation security first report publication nmab4825 washington dc national academy press 1999 crs7 factors studies to improve screener performance as part of pilot program to examine nextgeneration checkpoint screening technologies expediting deployment of inline baggage screening systems the 911 commission recommended that the tsa expedite installation of in line baggage screening systems therefore congress may debate the adequacy of current funding for this activity while vision 100 authorizes up to 500 million annually to be deposited into the aviation security capital fund only 250 million was appropriated in fy2004 and requested in fy2005 for this activity since the total cost of integrating eds equipment at all passenger airports is estimated to exceed 4 billion it may take several years to complete integration of baggage screening systems given current funding levels letters of intent lois issued to airports by the tsa were established as vehicle to leverage limited federal funding by stretching obligations over several years lois were created in appropriations legislation as means for tsa to convey to airports its intent to obligate future funds for the purpose of eds integration however the tsa has thus far implemented lois by reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred this approach could further slow the progress of integrating eds systems at airports the 911 commission also recommended that because the aviation industry will derive substantial benefits from inline eds deployment it should pay fair share of the costs10 however defining that fair share has been significant point of contention airlines already indirectly pay the federal share of eds integration because the first 250 million annually all that was budgeted in fy2004 for this activity must come directly from aviation security fees paid by the airlines and their passengers airports pay portion of the costs too albeit much smaller one under the scheme adopted by vision 100 large and mediumsized airports contribute 10 of the cost while small airports contribute 5 however the tsa has proposed to reduce the federal obligations for these programs and increase the local share to 25 at large and mediumsized airports and 10 at small airports proposal that airports obviously oppose the 911 commission did not specifically say what they would consider to be more equitable contribution from industry however their recommendation implies that they believe industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme congress may continue debate over the equity of costsharing for eds integration in light of this recommendation the house homeland security appropriations bill hr 4567 as reported included language to limit the federal share for airport security projects to 75 at large and medium hubs and 90 at all other airports however this language was stricken by point of order during floor debate legislation introduced in the house hr 5121 seeks to double the amount collected in aviation security fees that must be designated for aviation security capital fund from 250 million annually to 500 million annually for fy2005 through 10 the 911 commission report p 393 crs8 fy2007 hr 5121 also seeks to increase the tsas flexibility to meet checked baggage security screening requirements by allowing it to enter into multiyear contracts not to exceed 10years with airports or third party vendors to provide eds imaging capabilities while most of the aviation securityrelated provisions of hr 5121 were incorporated into hr 10 neither of these measures were included in hr 10 intensifying efforts to identify screen and track cargo the 911 commission recommended that the tsa needs to intensify its efforts to identify suspicious cargo and appropriately screen and track potentially dangerous cargo in aviation as well as in maritime operations stemming from recommendations of the aviation security advisory committee asac standing committee of aviation stakeholders the tsa unveiled strategic plan for cargo security in november 2003 that plan consists multilayered riskbased approach with four key strategic objectives 1 enhancing shipper and supply chain security 2 identifying elevated risk cargo through prescreening 3 identifying technology for performing targeted air cargo inspections and 4 securing allcargo aircraft through appropriate facility security measures11 goals of the plan include pre screening all cargo shipments in order to determine their level of relative risk working with industry and federal partners to ensure that 100 of items considered to pose an elevated risk are inspected developing and ensuring that new information and technology solutions are deployed and implementing operational and regulatory programs that support enhanced security measures12 the 911 commission recommendations seem to imply that it concurs with tsas overall approach as outlined in this strategic plan but feels that progress toward achieving these objectives must be accelerated and perhaps augmented since the 911 commission recommendation provides specific guidance on how to intensify the identification tracking and screening of cargo congress may further scrutinize tsas efforts on cargo security and further debate approaches to air cargo security recent debate in congress over air cargo security has focused on the level of physical screening or inspection of cargo needed to adequately mitigate the risks posed by cargo placed on passenger aircraft while proposals have been offered to require 100 physical screening or inspection of all cargo placed on passenger aircraft congress has thus far supported tsas plan to instead implement risk based approach that relies heavily on the knownshipper program and database to assess shipments placed aboard passenger aircraft both hr 10 and s 2845 contain 11 transportation security administration air cargo strategic plan november 2003 12 there has been considerable confusion regarding the terms screening and inspection as they pertain to air cargo and presently statutory or regulatory definitions of these terms exist in general the tsa refers to screening as vetting process such as the use of knownshipper database to assess the level of risk associated with cargo shipment tsa uses the term inspections on the other hand to refer to physical scrutiny of cargo though any of several available means such as canine teams hand searches or the use of xray equipment or explosives detection systems in this report the term prescreening has been used in place of what tsa commonly calls screening to avoid confusion since this does not refer to physical screening process crs9 measures to improve the screening and tracking of cargo s 2845 would specifically require the tsa to double the amount of air cargo screened within one year see crs report rl32022 air cargo security deploying hardened cargo containers in addition to these measures to improve cargo security the 911 commission specifically recommended the deployment of at least one hardened cargo container on every passenger aircraft that also hauls cargo to carry suspicious cargo the national research council examined this very concept in 1999 and concluded it would cost 125 million to acquire sufficient number of hardened containers13 they also estimated that the annual industrywide cost of lost revenue due to reduced aircraft revenue payload and increased fuel burn would total 11 million thus even if proposal were made to federally fund this initiative passenger airlines may oppose it because it would increase operational costs it is likely that opponents of deploying hardened cargo containers would also argue that if recommended initiatives are implemented to improve the identification tracking and screening of cargo then hardened cargo containers are not needed on the other hand proponents of deploying hardened cargo containers may argue that doing so creates redundant layer of defense analogous to hardened cockpit door that is consistent with the overarching goal of establishing multilayered security system with builtin redundancies however using just one hardened cargo container per passenger aircraft still leaves the system open to potential vulnerabilities that are directly tied to the effectiveness of measures to conduct riskbased assessments of cargo and flag suspicious cargo for this reason the tsa currently requires that all cargo from shippers that have not been properly vetted and verified through the knownshipper program be carried in allcargo airplanes and not aboard passenger airplanes while tsa is working on expanding its capabilities to detect high risk cargo it is unclear how this system could be adapted to assign risk levels that would permit certain suspect cargo to travel in hardened cargo containers on board passenger airplanes also from policy standpoint it is unclear what criteria could be used to permit shipment of suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft in hardened cargo containers instead of offloading that shipment from passenger aircraft altogether congress may debate whether deployment of hardened cargo containers could provide an effective layer of security to protect against potential cargo bombings key policy issue in this debate is likely to be the possible implications of allowing suspicious cargo to travel on passenger aircraft even if they are secured in hardened cargo containers hr 10 contains provision that would require tsa to carry out pilot program to evaluate the use of blastresistant containers for carrying baggage and cargo on passenger airliners while s 2845 does not contain similar provision legislation passed by the senate on may 9 2003 s 165 would require the dhs in 13 national research council assessment of technologies deployed to improve aviation security first report crs10 coordination with the faa to submit report evaluating blastresistant cargo container technology riskbased prioritization as the basis for transportation security policy in addition to the aviation specific recommendations discussed above the 911 commission also issued an overarching recommendation that riskbased priorities for protecting all transportation assets be established based on this assessment of risks the 911 commission recommended that tsa select the most practical and cost effective approaches for implementing defenses of transportation assets and develop plan budget and funding to implement this effort the plan according to the 911 commission should assign roles and missions to federal state and local authorities as well as to private stakeholders strategic plan for aviation security the riskbased approach to aviation security is nothing new and has been viewed for some time as the principal policy tool for allocating limited resources what is lacking however is unified strategic plan for aviation security to some extent atsa has set the strategy for aviation security following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the tsas initial focus was on meeting the mandates of atsa particularly deploying air marshals and federal screeners now that tsa has achieved some level of normal operations it should be better poised to focus on developing more formal strategy for national aviation security policy based on tsas strategic approaches to date particularly in addressing air cargo security needs it is likely that riskbased multilayered approach to aviation security will form the core of future aviation security policy this appears to be largely in step with what the 911 commission is recommending in light of the 911 commission recommendation congress may consider whether to formally task the tsa with developing national strategy for aviation security that addresses funding needs budgetary implications and the appropriate roles of federal local and state authorities and industry stakeholders while some may argue that such plan already exists in various tsa program plans and budget documents others may argue that more formal strategic planning document for aviation security needs to be developed cooperation and integration while aviation security relies extensively on cooperation and the integration of shared responsibilities challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement at airports the local role is defined in the airport security program which is tailored for each airport location physical security of the airport site is ultimately the role of local jurisdictions carried out by airport operators while tsa maintains the overall role of security oversight and enforcement as well as direct responsibility for passenger screening the role of local governments and in some cases state authorities in aviation security often involves both law enforcement support for airport site security and law enforcement presence at screening checkpoints passenger air carriers must also participate in security through procedures and training for controlling access to aircraft and secured areas of airports carrying out security inspections of aircraft and so on in air cargo and general aviation security measures rely heavily on the direct participation of aircraft crs11 owners and operators while the federal role is one of oversight and enforcement of aviation security requirements while implementing aviation security already involves federal state local and industry participation what appears to be lacking is unified plan or strategy for assigning roles and missions to each stakeholder based on careful consideration of logistics and costs and adopting systems approach to define how each element contributes to the overall security strategy in light of the 911 commission recommendation congress and the tsa may consider ways to improve the strategic planning resource allocation and integration of federal state local and privatesector resources for aviation security congress and the tsa may also consider how the specific strategies and approaches to aviation security may be integrated with an overarching transportation security strategy that encompasses rail maritime and highway security as well and addresses logistics funding and resource allocation to meet security needs in all modes of transportation hr 10 requires the department of homeland security dhs to prepare and update transportation security plan and modal security plans including modal plan for aviation to set riskbased priorities select the most practical and costeffective methods for protecting aviation assets and assign roles and missions to federal state regional and local authorities and aviation stakeholders congressional actions in response to the 911 commission recommendations since the release of the 911 commission report congress has given considerable attention to the recommendations contained in the report the senate committee on commerce science and transportation held hearing on the 911 commission recommendations regarding transportation security on august 16 2004 and the house subcommittee on aviation held hearing reviewing the aviation security recommendations of the 911 commission the 108th congress passed two major pieces of legislation containing numerous provisions pertaining to aviation security vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 which was enacted prior to the 911 commissions final report and the national intelligence reform act pl 108458 118 stat 3638 which was enacted in large part in response to the 911 commissions recommendations vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act before the 911 commission had completed its report several aviation security related provisions were included in vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 which was enacted on december 12 2003 vision 100 established redress process for pilots mechanics or other licensed aviation professionals whose certification is denied suspended or revoked on the grounds that they pose risk to aviation security vision 100 also requires the crs12 federal aviation administration to provide justification to congress when establishing an air defense identification zone adiz around cities where pilots are required to use special communications and operating procedures to enable air traffic controllers to identify potential security threats vision 100 also modified existing requirements for security training of airline flight and cabin crew members under these provisions the airlines are responsible for providing mandatory basic training in security for crews while the tsa was to develop and provide voluntary advanced selfdefense training program for crew members vision 100 also required the department of homeland security to study and report to congress on the effectiveness of the aviation security system including the air marshal program hardening of cockpit doors and security screening of passengers checked baggage and cargo the report was to include recommendations including legislative recommendations for improving the effectiveness of aviation security vision 100 also created the aviation security capital fund the act authorizes up to 500 million per year through fy2007 to be appropriated to this fund and requires that the first 250 million in aviation security fee collections be deposited in this fund each year through fy2007 the act also provided the undersecretary for border and transportation security with the authority to issue grants to airports for projects to integrate baggage explosive detection systems with baggage conveyer systems reconfigure terminal baggage areas as needed to install explosive detection systems deploy explosive detection systems behind the ticket counter in baggage sorting areas or in line with baggage handling systems and for other aviation securityrelated capital improvement projects vision 100 set the federal share of costs for such projects at 90 for large and medium hub airports and at 95 for all other airports and set guidelines for the allocation of aviation security capital fund monies for these projects vision 100 also required the implementation of security programs for air charter operators who use aircraft weighing more than 12500 pounds maximum takeoff weight vision 100 also required the government accountability office gao to review the proposed capps ii passenger prescreening system and prevented the tsa from fully implementing this program until the undersecretary for border and transportation security certified that variety of enumerated issues pertaining to civil liberties privacy data protection system security system performance and system oversight had been adequately addressed the tsa has since scrapped the capps ii program and is developing an alterative prescreening system called secure flight vison 100 also authorized flight crew members of allcargo airlines to voluntarily participate in the federal flight deck officer program that trains and deputizes armed pilots to guard aircraft cockpits against hostile attacks vision 100 also expanded the program to include other flight crew members such as flight engineers in addition to pilots crs13 vision 100 also requires the promulgation of regulations to ensure the security of foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations the act also requires the tsa in coordination with the faa to complete security review and audit of foreign repair stations that work on air carrier aircraft and components vision 100 also modified the background check requirements for foreign pilots seeking flight training in the united states the act transferred the duties of conducting these background checks from the department of justice to the dhs the provisions require flight schools or instructors to provide notification and identification information for individuals seeking training in smaller aircraft weighing less than 12500 pounds and require background checks be completed before training can be initiated in larger aircraft the legislation authorizes fee collections to offset the costs of conducting these background checks for further discussion see crs report rl32498 vision 100 an overview of the century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 the national intelligence reform act of 2004 the national intelligence reform act pl 108458 contains numerous provisions related to aviation security many directly addressing the concerns and recommendations of the 911 commission the act requires the department of homeland security to develop prepare implement and update as needed national strategy for transportation security as well as modalspecific security plans including plan for aviation security the modal security plan for aviation is to include threat matrix outlining each threat to the united states civil aviation system and the corresponding layers of security in place to address these threats and plan for mitigation and reconstitution of the aviation system in the event of terrorist attack the act requires the tsa to issue guidance for the use of biometrics in airport access control systems and establish biometric credential and authentication procedures to identify law enforcement officers authorized to carry firearms aboard passenger aircraft the act authorizes 20 million in addition to any other authorized amounts for research and development of biometric technologies for aviation security the act also authorizes 1 million to establish center of excellence in biometric technologies the act required the tsa to begin system testing of an advanced passenger prescreening system by january 1 2005 although the act does not provide deadline for the completion of testing the prescreening system it requires the tsa to begin to assume the role of passenger prescreening and checking passenger names against watch lists later than 180 days after completing that testing the act requires the tsa to establish redress and remedy procedures for passengers who are delayed or denied boarding because of being falsely identified or targeted by the system and requires the tsa to ensure that the number of such false positives is minimized the act also requires the tsa to establish an oversight board and implement safeguards to ensure the security and integrity of the system and address crs14 and resolve any privacy concerns the act also requires that the dhs prescreening of international flights to or from the united states be conducted prior to departure the act further requires that individuals seeking faa certificates such as pilots and mechanics as well as individuals requesting unescorted access to airport secure areas and air operations areas be screened against the consolidated and integrated terrorist watch list the act also requires the tsa to establish process where air charter and leasing companies can voluntarily submit information regarding prospective customers seeking to use

and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft at the earliest date possible and amend security directives and procedures to at minimum triple the percentage of cargo inspected on passenger aircraft possible continuing policy concerns for congress since the 108th congress enacted several major provisions pertaining to aviation security many directly reflecting the concerns and recommendations of the 911 commission there are few policy concerns that were not addressed at all during the 108th congress however two areas where some may consider that policy concerns were not adequately addressed through legislation in the 108th congress include general aviation security and air cargo security procedures and oversight the 911 commission made brief reference to concerns over the security of general aviation operations however it did not make any formal recommendations to address this concern during the 108th congress legislation on the security of general aviation operations focused on airport and airspace restrictions and examining ways to alleviate what some believed to be unnecessary constraints on certain operations for example provision in vision 100 required the dhs to develop and implement security plan allowing general aviation flights to resume at ronald reagan washington national airport but set timetable for carrying out this provision in appropriations language on the other hand temporary flight restrictions over stadiums and other venues during major outdoor sports events were kept in full force and made permanent arguably the legislation pertaining to general aviation security enacted during the 108th congress was viewed by many as not being as cohesive and comprehensive as legislation addressing other aviation security concerns some have expressed renewed concerns over the risk posed by general aviation corporate jets private planes and helicopters in response to recent assessment prepared jointly by the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the dhs and widely reported in the press14 some may also argue that comprehensive legislation pertaining to air cargo security operations and oversight and expansion of the knownshipper program were not adequately addressed during the 108th congress specifically comprehensive measures that had been passed by the senate in s 165 108th congress were stripped from the final version of the national intelligence reform bill of 2004 and replaced by language directing the tsa to make final proposed rulemaking addressing these issues this was presumably done because the tsas regulatory proposals largely reflected the intent of the proposed legislation however because congress did not formally enact several of these specific provisions pertaining to air cargo security operations and oversight the 109th congress may be particularly interested in oversight of the tsas implementation of its air cargo security rules and its air cargo strategic plan to ensure that they meet desired objectives
