children and family court advisory and support service paper for the board meeting on 19 january 2007 cafcass 20072010 communicating vision for improved outcomes for children and families 1 introduction 1 this paper outlines communications strategy for cafcass during time of organisational change investment in practice development changes in the external policy environment and continuing budgetary constraints 2 purpose of the paper 1 the communications strategy for 200506 has expired and the organisation needs new communications strategy that meets both current and projected needs threeyear communications workplan will be drafted to support the draft recommendations in the consultation paper organising for quality as well as the need to promote greater public understanding of our work 2 cafcass will continue to need support with internal and external communications due to the high profile politicised nature of much of our work 3 all public services need to demonstrate that they are meeting established government priorities for cafcass this means providing information for our service users stakeholders the wider public and the media the paper proposes clear strategy for doing this effectively 3 strategic context 1 the proposed national standards and other corporate strategies now in place which have been developed following the every day matters consultation process in 200506 provide clear direction for the activities of the communications team 2 specifically the proposals in organising for quality are response to the need to put more cafcass time and resources into practice development thereby improving the service we deliver as well as continuing to make the efficiency savings required of us by central government as demand is continuing to rise faster than our resources radical steps must be taken to ensure both objectives are delivered simultaneously strong internal communications strategy can support practitioners in obtaining the information they need to develop and improve their practice 3 new business plan will be developed by april 2007 replacing the existing plan which timeexpires and this will need to be integrated into the 200708 communications workplan 4 the dfes five year strategy for children and learners maintaining the excellent progress sets out the departments seven priorities to 2009 and beyond three of these point to role for cafcass in the following areas safeguard the young and vulnerable reduce the number of young people on the path to failure improve health and well being 5 in addition the dfes communications team has identified six strategic communications theme four of which chime with our objectives support better parenting good start in life support the most vulnerable increase public confidence in public services 4 analysis of the core communications issues 1 anecdotal evidence suggests that cafcass has low general public recognition if this is the case many of the 100000 children and families who use cafcass services will not have heard about the services we offer in advance if we increase general public understanding of our work we could reduce the anxiety for both children and families who are introduced to whole array of professionals for the first time 2 the major change programme planned for the years 20072010 will require significant support to build understanding and support both internally and externally 3 all planned communications activity which sits within the six channelsfunctions are set out below at 45 each channel includes discussion of the strategic aim key principles and an outline implementation plan 4 discussion with staff across cafcass suggests that there is room to improve internal channels of communication 5 the strategy defines six functionschannels of corporate communications media relations internal communications web and intranet communications stakeholder relations campaigns conferences and events marketing publications and visual identity 5 communications objective for cafcass 1 cafcass needs an overarching objective that describes what we want from our communications activity the following is suggested through an integrated communications plan to improve awareness of the full range of services which cafcass provides for children and families using the family justice system 2 the strategy for delivering the above objective is as follows to promote cafcass services to potential service users and all key stakeholders by visibly contributing at every level to discussions on improving outcomes for children using the family justice system and wider childrens services in england 6 vision and key messages 1 cafcass vision and values has been set down in the consultation document organising for quality our key messages will be drawn from that list cafcass will put children first keep children as safe as possible ensure each child has voice that is heard understood and respected in the family courts in way that is consistent with and responds to each childs wishes competence and understanding start with the child and stay with the child throughout the life of cases be clear about the needs wishes and feelings of individual children in family court cases as the core business of cafcass make contribution to securing the safest high quality outcomes possible for each child and evaluate this contribution after case is closed respect the importance of family life and family members for each child respect the diversity and individuality of each child and family throughout the organisation keep the focus on front line services maintain our independence and objectivity at all times in all circumstances 7 outcomes 1 the outcomes from implementing this threeyear strategy will be as follows increased awareness amongst prospective service users of cafcass work greater awareness amongst stakeholders of the full range of services offered by cafcass increased public understanding of how cafcass services can contribute to improved outcomes for children and their families creation of more cohesive corporate working environment of trust and loyalty in which aspirations to excellence and innovation are valued and encouraged increased awareness by elected representatives of our services at national regional sub regional and local level improved media profile resulting in increased awareness and wider popular support for our work 8 tone style and communication principles 1 honest and open multidirectional communication is the lifeblood of any successful organisation strong communication is essential to how we work and provide our services 2 we will communicate clearly openly and regularly with our service users the public with our professional partners and with each other in order to promote high level of mutual understanding and facilitate better outcomes for children and families using the family justice system 3 information should be shared and made available in support of excellent practice poor practice will be acknowledged and improved we will improve the accessibility and content of the cafcass intranet to facilitate this 4 all communication spoken written and electronic should be clear easily understood timely and up to date 5 all published material should adhere to our accepted corporate style and be easily and instantly identifiable as originating from cafcass 6 given the number of stakeholders involved in promoting positive outcomes for children we need to be proactive in developing shared public messages with wider range of stakeholders 9 systems and processes required for effective communication 1 effective communications requires that consideration be given to how initiatives and policies are to be communicated at the strategic development phase 2 the new intranet and website will allow for easier and more effective dissemination of information to both internal and external audiences work on both these projects is due for completion by july 2007 recommendation 1 all major initiatives and policies should contain simple communications plan in addition section should be added to the business case and cdg and board report templates referencing the communications actions required 10 media strategy 1 the balance of coverage since july 2006 has been broadly neutral the newly formed communications team has been successful in addressing number of potentially damaging storylines through rapid response and close liaison with practitioners and frontline managers the average number of cafcass media mentions over the last three months including broadcast is 9 per month 2 there is new computer system in place for logging media articles and activity it has been populated with data over the last three months but needs further three months before useful comparative data can be obtained 3 over the past six months there has been approximately three to four proactive approaches per month to the media over specific stories whilst this has been largely successful cafcass needs more sophisticated approach to generating positive news coverage 4 the recently approved media contact policy provides the operational framework for contact with the media 5 strategic aim to utilise the media as channel to communicate the breadth and value of our work to our stakeholders and the wider public 6 key principles we will promote our services as being vital ingredient in safeguarding children who are using the family justice system we will provide information to the media in clear consistent concise and timely manner 7 implementation we will identify steady stream of media opportunities generated by the successes of our work and rapid response to running media storylines forge strong links with local regional and national trade broadcast and print media so that journalists come to us to support their story packages provide media training for identified tiers of cafcass spokespeople and the cafcass young peoples board continue to support staff who wish to write articles for the media we will identify areas that make us unique 8 recommendation 2 the communications team will send out quarterly bulletin to relevant editors and correspondents advising them about spokespeople and areas of expertise 9 recommendation 3 work with the young peoples board to produce articles for regional print media about their work with cafcass in addition we will promote our yp board as being available with support for comment as service users about the operation of the family justice system 10 recommendation 4 we will produce case study database for use in our publications and press releases this will highlight areas of success and good practice anonymised where appropriate 11 recommendation 5 an outline annual news grid updated monthly will be produced to facilitate proactive media coverage 12 recommendation 6 media briefing strategy to include once year get together with key journalists and senior cafcass staff 11 internal communications strategy 1 good internal communication systems are essential for large geographically dispersed organisations the communications team has recently amalgamated the eight departmental newsletters into one heavily branded staff newsletter entitled channel c the newsletter is also being printed and eight copies distributed to each office this is to develop the readership and encourage the submission of items alongside the newsletter we have produced bullet pointed service managers briefing which selects the key suggested items to be discussed at team meetings 2 strategic aim to use cafcass internal cascade mechanisms to promote an environment in which staff are motivated to perform to the highest standards and share best practice 3 key principles all strategies policies and initiatives adopted by cafcass should be accompanied by clear plan of how it will be communicated when by whom and with what resources everyone employed by or working within cafcass should be fully informed of all matters relevant to their area of work employees will be actively engaged in communication and in decisions wherever appropriate key messages to be transmitted clearly quickly and effectively throughout cafcass effective internal communication requires the use of multi directional communication channels vertical horizontal and diagonal 4 implementation use all available channels of communication to ensure maximum message penetration channel c intranet memo service managers briefing team meetings flyers posters publications and booklets each internal communication will have clear owner regional dissemination of controlled messaging across cafcass through management tiers develop one continuously updated staff contact list make organisational news exciting and relevant to employees daily work messages need to be repeated frequently message penetration needs to be evaluated 5 recommendation 7 the communications team to work with unisys and our hr department using the new intranet to integrate email addresses phone lists and postal addresses to allow one definitive staff contact list within cafcass 6 recommendation 8 provide daily news service summarising key articles possibly initially emailed to all staff and then placed on the intranet each morning 7 recommendations 9 working in conjunction with policy authors we should evaluate the penetration of key internal messages both formally and informally 12 web and intranet communications 1 1 the way cafcass works has changed significantly since the website and intranet were last upgraded at the end of 2002 for instance cafcass is more clearly focused on listening to the voice of children and young people through the childrens rights programme diversity should be more central element of our work programme and we expect staff to keep in touch with best practice on national and international level cafcass is also forging stronger corporate culture of excellence with performance management and quality assurance at its core 2 the external world has also changed with the findings of lord lamings victoria climbie inquiry making its way into government policy public services generally are expected to be more open and transparent about the services provided with taxpayers funds freedom of information also accelerates the speed with which information now enters the public domain 3 the current intranet is longer fit for purpose and the website is beginning to look out of date initial findings from the staff survey suggest that the vast majority of staff use the intranet as main source of information despite its weaknesses advances in technology mean that updating website and intranet need longer be carried out by third party thus saving costs it is now possible to increase the speed with which information is added to the intranet and website in structured manner by democratising corporate knowledge 4 cafcass has allocated funding from its national change programme budget for 200607 to improve the website and intranet highlevel business case has been approved by cdg and we are in the process of selecting new content management system which will enable vastly enhanced and more interactive website and intranet to be delivered 5 strategic aim to make use of advances in technology to promote cafcass internally and externally 6 key principles information will be communicated via channels suited to specific audiences and in web information about cafcass will be in accessible formats the website and intranet will be updated on regular basis 7 implementation it is anticipated that software and hardware upgrades will be completed by march 31st 2007 with new content migrated to the new intranet and website by august 2007 detailed route map for adding content to the new systems will need to be produced this will include plans for corporate taxonomy and training of super users 8 recommendation 10 content owners within cafcass should begin to review what information needs to be on the intranet and website detailed guidance will be produced in march 2007 more work needs to be done to increase the depth of information available to the public via our revamped website 9 recommendation 11 once the new website is complete work is needed to promote the site which should include relaunch prominent branding on all cafcass publications and the addition of links to and from other sites within the sector and beyond 10 recommendation 12 systems will be developed to ensure that the web site is updated dailyweekly by owners of the posted material 13 stakeholder relations 1 relationship management system for specific organisations and key individuals already exists within cafcass but there is scope for more general approach to raising awareness about our work and priorities 2 anecdotal evidence suggests the following groups would benefit from increased information about cafcass and the role we perform children and families judiciary solicitors schools gps and the nhs police social workers politicians local and national 3 strategic aim to improve understanding of cafcass work amongst key stakeholders 4 key principles provide information tailored to specific audiences 5 implementation the approach to each group will differ as would the level and type of communication for instance some groups might benefit from wider distribution of special quarterly editions of channel c 6 recommendation 13 the communications team should develop simple strategy and workplan for raising awareness amongst each stakeholder group by working with the relevant relationship manager 7 recommendation 14 the publications editor should explore the possibility of an external version of channel c to be produced quarterly 14 campaigns conferences and events 1 cafcass is well represented at conferences across the country but there is an opportunity to maximise opportunities to promote our work through greater coordination 2 cafcass should focus most resources on high profile conferences such as the annual adcslga conference on childrens and adults services 3 in addition cafcass should promote key speakers to the major conference organisers 4 whilst we are not principally campaigning organisation there is considerable scope to work with other organisations in support of our core organisational objectives an initial idea for campaign has been developed entitled stop the fight that is aimed at raising awareness of the impact of divorce and separation on children and young people tentative date for launch has been set for the final week in april 2007 5 strategic aim cafcass should promote its core objective of improving the outcomes for children using the family justice system in more visible manner 6 key principles where appropriate cafcass will work with like minded organisations to raise awareness on issues of mutual concern the communications team will support staff members wishing to speak at external conferences 7 implementation recommendation 15 produce calendar of external conferences recommendation 16 produce an internal list of speakers with key areas of expertise this could work in conjunction with an upgraded staff contact list 15 marketing publications and visual identity 1 cafcass has clear guidelines for the use of its brand and corporate identity initial analysis suggests that if we cover the cafcass logo on our publications it is very difficult to ascertain the ownership of the document our brand should be recognisable from the use of colour font and publications style modern public service organisations now adopt quite sophisticated marketing and storytelling techniques to explain the work they do 2 there are number of publications in production and the communications team should implement system to manage demand and workflow 3 strategic aim to provide clear modern and appealing corporate identity 4 key principles the identity refresh will be subtle low key and easy for staff to use 5 implementation recommendation 17 cafcass should produce communications guide which gives direction as to how our logo should be used the document would also include range of templates for posters letters and fax headers along with defined colour palette recommendation 18 cafcass should consolidate its corporate identity by subtly upgrading the existing logo and broadening the range of storytelling options for inclusion across range of media options to be presented to ecdg in february 2007 recommendation 19 the communications team will produce an annual publications schedule which will be updated quarterly 16 action for the board 1 the board is asked to approve the communications strategy and the recommendations 17 financial implications 1 the new website and intranet will attract annual support costs of approximately 10000 per annum in addition we should allow further 30000 for additional development needs the total additional requirement matches the intranet updating costs of the current system which has historically been met within the it budget it is requested that 40000 per annum be added to the communications or it budget for this purpose 18 diversity considerations 1 the communications team will continue to work closely with sherry malik and paul brown on the implementation of our diversity strategy diversity handbook and toolkit is currently in production 2 in addition diversity messages will be injected into our communications work programme 19 synergies with the childrens rights agenda 1 much of the media activity for the year ahead will involve close liaison with the childrens right team and the young peoples board risk appraisal form has been developed and will be completed by each member of the young peoples board prior to exposure to the media takki sulaiman head of communications january 2007 pic
