ttention until the late 1990s the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 also known as bcra or mccainfeingold for its principal sena sponsors constituted the first major change to the nations campaign

110th congress legislative activity regarding campaig n finance has occurred on two fronts during the 110th congress first and most notably the honest leadership and open government act hloga contains some campaign finance provisions but the law is primarily devoted to lobbying and ethics hl oga and the afp extension were the only legislation changing campaign financing policy to become law during the 110th congress second various other bills that emphasize campaign finance have been the subject of committee or floor acti on but none have beco law overall approximately 50 bills that would affect campaign finance policy have been introduced in the 110th congress12 the following discussion provides additional details on campaign finance bills that have been the subject of committee action or floor votes during the 110th congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34324crs4 13 see also crs report rl34166 lobbying law and ethics rules changes in the 110th congress by jack maskell that

another related to travel aboard private aircraft13 both were seen as sources of potential abuse in the past the law also prohibits member ttendance at presidential convention events in their honor if registered lobbyists or pri vate entities that hire lobbyists pay for the events14 it also requires additional disc losure about lobbyists contributions exceeding 200 to political committees presidential inaugural committees and presidential libraries15 fec rulemaking discussed below is required to implement the bundling and campaign travel portions of hloga secti ons 204 and 601 respectively although the travel section took effect upon the bills actment the fec in late 2007 adopted rules providing its interpretation of the law hloga requires the fec to promulgate regulations implementing the bundling provision within six months of enactment march 14 2008 although the lack of quorum prevented the agency from doing so16 bundling bundling refers to campaig n fundraising practice in which an intermediary often lobbyist either receives contributions and passes them to campaign or is credited with soliciting contributions that campaign receives directly before hloga became law although fec regulations on earmarked contributions technically restricted bundling they were viewed as largely inapplicable to designated campaign fundr aisers including certain lobbyists in response hloga requires disclosure of bund ling activities by registered lobbyists specifically political committees candidate committees party committees and pacs must report to the fec the name ddress and employer of each lobbying disclosure act ldaregistered lobbyist r easonably known to have made at least two bundled contributions totaling more than 15000 during specified sixmonth reporting periods17 hloga only requires disclosure of bundling by registered lobbyists not other fundraisers therefore hloga will provide more transparency than was previously ava ilable about which lobbyists arrange bundled contributions however it doe s not mandate disclosure of bundled contributions that do not meet the time and monetary thresholds discussed above or require information about bundling by nonlobbyists httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34324crs5 18 federal election commission reporting contributions bundled by lobbyists registrants and the pacs of lobbyists and registrants 72 federal

fec issued notice of proposed rulemaking nprm on the bundling issue on october 30 200718 most notably and consistent with hloga the fecs proposed rules would require political committees to report bundled contributions if the same source arra nged or was credited with arranging two or more contributions totaling at leas t 15000 during sixmonth period the fec also solicited comments about an alternative proposal for quarterly reporting19 the proposed rules would also add the term lobbyistregistrant pacs those committees established or controlled by registered lobbyists to existing examples of political committees subj ect to feca regulation and bundling disclosure20 despite some specificity the nprm di d not address how all reporting issues would be resolved rather throughout the document the commission posed several questions about range of issues such as how widely disclosu re requirements should apply and how committees should determin whether contribu tions were bundled21 parts of the nprm suggested that bundlin g disclosure could apply beyond lobbyists per specifically the fec asked whether congress intended for bundling disclosure to apply only to contributions rranged by registered lobbyists who would be known as lobbyistregistrants under propos ed rules or also to fundraising by other actors the latter could incl ude nonlobbyist employees at lobbying organizations or hosts of fundraisers at which bundling occurs22 several interested parties including members of congre ss submitted comments responding to the nprm september 17 2008 fec hearing explored many of the issues raised in the nprm in particular discussion and bate among commissione rs and witnesses election lawyers and interestgroup representatives addressed how bundling activities should be reported to the fec which activitie s should be reported and how fundraising should be reporte d if several individuals ar involved in fundraising at single event the fec has yet to announce final bundling rules as noted previously hloga requires the fec to issue bundling rules within six months of the laws enactment the relevant deadline would have been march 14 2008 however the agency was unable to act between january and june 2008 due to the loss of its quorum on july 28 2008 fec chairman donald f mcgahn reportedly stated that bundling regulations could not realistically be pr omulgated in time to affect the 2008 elections23 if it chose to do so congress could legislate bundling disclosure details that would normally be left to the fec

wwwfecgovagenda2007mtgdoc0794pdf 27 on the quoted material see fec draft final rule on campaign travel p 7 28 the fec reportedly chose this arrangement out of concern that pa rty and pac officials providing travel reimbursement could indir ectly subsidize candidate travel which hloga sought to restrict telephone consulta tion between duane pu gh deputy director congressional affairs fec and r sam ga rrett january 10 2008 conversely under the new rules candidates are arguably subsidizing party or pac travel the fec could clarify this issue when it considers related explanation and justification document which is discussed in the text of this report campaign travel hloga restricts campa ign travel on private noncommercial aircraft before hl oga became law political committees were permitted to reimburse those providing private aircraft at the rate of firstclass travel as long as commensurate firstclass commerc ial service were available for the route flown24 reimbursement at nondiscounted co ach or charter rates was required if commensurate firstclass service were unava ilable on that route under the new law senators candidates and sta ff may continue to travel on private aircraft only if they reimburse the entity providing the aircraft for the pro rata share of the fair market value for rental or charter of comparab aircraft those amounts could be well above the old firstclass rate that applied to most flight s before the law took effect unlike their senate counterparts hous members candidates and staff are substantially banned from fl ying aboard private nonco mmercial aircraft as the law precludes reimburseme nts for such flights25 fec rulemaking under rules adopted by the fec on december 14 2007 all senate presidential and vicepresidential campaign travel must be reimbursed at the prorata share of the charter rate regardless of the route flown26 consistent with hloga political committees related to house of representatives candidates are prohibited from making reimbursements for campaign travel aboard private aircraft which essentially bans such travel the prorata share reimbursement standard for senate presiden tial and vicepresidential tr avel is based on the number of candidate committees ie candidate campaigns represented on flight if more than one candidate is represented on f light reimbursement w ould be shared among the relevant candidate committees specifically political committees must provide reimbursement for all campaign travelers shares of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for travel on comparable aircraft or comparable size27 these requirements also apply to travel on behalf of pacs including leadersh ip pacs and party committees although candidate committees represented on the flig ht would be responsible for covering costs for those travelers28 travel aboard government aircraft must also be reimbursed at the perperson charter rate or at the rate the government

fec received and the agencys reasoning in interpreting the law these documents typically provide additional information about how the commission intends to enforce the new rules and what those rules mean in practice although the fec approved final travel rules in december 2007 it did not formally consider an ej document that documen t cannot be approved without affirmative votes from at least

the rules and administration committee has held hearings on four b ills first on march 28 2007 the committee held hearing on s 223 feingold which would require senate campaign committees including candidate committees and party committees to file campaign finance disclosure reports electronically currently senate campaign committees are the only federal political committees not required to do so the bill has not received floor consideration despite attempts to bring it up by unanimous consent second on april 18 2007 the committee considered s 1091 corker which would lift existing limits on

the designee would have authority to disburse campaign funds currently campaign treasurers have authority over campaign funds as is discussed below the bill would not relieve treasurers from fec reporting responsibilities the bill c ould alleviate the potential for asset disputes following candidate deaths provide d that designees would be more faithful to candidates wishes than would be treas urers to that end hr 3032 also permits candidates to provide instruc tions for disbursing campaign funds in the event of their death hr 3032 would provide more candida control over campaign assets than currently exists feca is larg ely silent on candidate responsib ility for campaign operations including spending in fact treasurers not candidates are legally responsible for disbursing campaign funds and for most fec compliance regardless of whether the candidate is living or dead38 feca also does not specify role for candidates in campaign financ ial decisions accordingly although hr 3032 would provide legal mechanism for circumventing the treasurer after candidate dies the bill would not provide additional remedies for such action while the candidate is living this may be minor distinction due to candidates facto influence over their campaigns despite fecas general silence on the issue nonetheless if congress chose to enact hr 3032 and felt it were important to create parity in candidates abilities to direct campaign spending in life and after death it could amend feca to create clearer candidate role over campaign funds regardless of whether the candidate is living or dead congress might also provide explicit permission in feca for candidates to hire and fire campaign treasurers hearings on automated political calls also during the 110th congress house and senate committees have held hearings on automated political telephone calls also known as robo calls or auto calls this issue is related to campaign finance because fec reporting and disclaimer

electioneering communications40 under bcra electioneering communications are broadcast cable or satellite political advertising aired within 30 days of primary election or convention or caucus or 60 days of general election or special or runoff election that refers to clearly identified federal candidate and is targeted to the relevant electorate41 before bcra became law such advertising was often viewed as thinly veiled electioneering by corporations and unions although some observers contended that the adve rtising reflected sponsors policy positions on june 25 2007 the us supreme court issued 54 decision in federal election commission v wisconsin right to life inc wrtl ii 42 in brief the case considered whether the electioneering communication provision prohibited the group wisconsin right to life wrtl from paying for advertising mentioning senate candidate it intended to run during the 2004 election cycle the court held that the electioneering communication provision was unconstitutional as applied to the wrtl ads shortly thereafter the fec announced that it would revise its electioneering communications ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34324crs11 43 the hearings focused on two alternative rules one that would have allowed corporate and unionfunded electioneering commu nications but would have maintained fec reporting and disclaimer requirements and another

must be reported to the fec46 the advertisements must also contain disclaimers identifying the person or orga nization responsible for the electioneering communication47 the new rules also require that electioneering communications paid for with corporate or union treasury funds must meet three safe harbor criteria intended to ensure that the advertising is not directly aimed at electing or defeating candidates specifically the advertising may not 1 mention any election candidacy political party opposing candidate or voting by th general public or 2 take position on candidates character

fund issueoriented advertising in ways that were prohibite d by bcra for those who view issue advertising as thinly veiled electoral advocacy the rules could be seen as loophole that allows otherwise prohibited corpor ate and union money to influence elections the same concern that motivated bcras electioneering communications provision that was held unconstitutional as applied to the wrtl ads on the other hand the fecs explanatory statement accompanying the new rules suggests that even general references to elections or candidates eg electi on dates or party name could void the safe harbor protection for cor porate and union spending49 if the commission reaches such determin ation in future enforcement cases electioneering communications funded by corporate or union treasury funds would have to be strictly related to public policy issues lthough they could be aired during election periods precise implications of the new rules are likely to become clearer over time as advertis ers test the rules during the 2008 election cycle and beyond and as the fec considers future advisory opi nions and enforcement cases additional litigation which has been common following bcra rulemakings is also possible millionaires amendment on june 26 2008 54 majority of the us supreme court declared the millionaires amendment unconstitutional in davis v federal election commission 50 another crs product provides legal analysis of the case51 the millionaires amendment which was acted in bcra pe rmitted congressional candidates facing certain selffinanced opponents to receive larger campaign contributions than would normally be permitted in some cases political parties could also make unlimited coordinated expenditures on behalf of campaigns facing selffinanced opponents the fec issued public statement on july 25 2008 noting that the courts analysis in davis precludes enforcement of the house provision of the millionaires amendment and effectively precludes enforcement of the senate provision as well52 accordingly the amendments reporting requirements and increased contribution limits longer apply the commission will initiate rulemaking to comport with the ruling but will longer enforce the amendment53 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34324crs13 54 federal election commission increased contribution and coordinated party expenditure limits for candidates opposing selffinanced candidates 73 federal register 62224 october 20 2008 55 as noted previously two commissioners did remain in office during the 2008 shutdown and staff continue d doing work that did not require commission approvalon october 2 2008 the commission approve d notice of proposed rulemaking in light of davis 54 essentially the fec proposes to repeal its rules originally promulgated to implement the millionaires amendment language in bcra particularly rules currently at 11 cfr 400 repealing thes and other relevant rules would clarify that the millionaires amendment is longer applicable in house and senate elections such re peal would be consistent with the commissions stated practice of longer enforcing the amendment the public comment period on the proposed repeal of the fecs millionaires amendment rules will close on november 21 2008 conclusion and analysis hloga represents the most significan t legislative deve lopment related to campaign finance during the 110th congress more than 50 other campaign finance bills have been introduced in the 110th congress but few have received major legislative attention ot her significant campaign fi nance developments have occurred away from capitol hill particularly at the fec and in the federal courts fec activity has focused on rulemakings in response to recent congressional activity particularly regarding hloga the campaign travel rules are relatively straightforward and consistent with the ne w lobbying and ethics law those rules however could be clarified by an ej statem ent that has yet to be considered the bundling and electioneering communications rulemakings the latter was undertaken in response to the supreme courts ruling in wrtl ii are more complicated and in some cases less clear although the pr oposed bundling rules are consistent with hlogas content the many questions and regulatory alternatives posed in the nprm and at the september 2008 fec hearing suggest that the agency is still considering how to implement that secti on of the law similarly although the commission has already adopted final elec tioneering communications rules what those rules mean in practice will depend on how the fec decides to pursue future enforcement and advisory cases these i ssues could also be revisited now that additional commissioners are in office the longterm effect of the fecs inability to consider major policy questions between january and june 2008 remains to be seen55 it is clear however that the agency faces substantial rulemaking nd enforcement backlog in the short term the fact that four of six commissioners are new to the agency could also delay some activities the hloga rulemaking is perhaps the most prominent one now facing the fec the absence of bundling rules mean s that certain disclosure required under hloga is not occurring nor can it occur until the agency tells political committees how to report their bundled contributions the schedule set forth in hloga wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34324crs14 have facilitated pa rtial reporting for the 2008 cycle it now appears however that bundling disclosure as envisioned in hloga will not take effect til the 2010 cycle even if bundlingdisclosure rules were in place now however they would not necessarily alter fundraising practices indeed as was di scussed at the september 17 fec hearing hloga requires more tran sparency about bundling but does not restrict the practice in addition and as noted previously although the hloga travel rules also have yet to be finalized via publication in the federal register implementation of those rules is perhaps less pressing matter because the relevant portion of the law took effect upon enactme nt whereas the fec bundlingdisclosure provisions in hloga require commi ssion action to take effect overall recent changes in campaign finance policy have been incremental as has been the case since fe ca became law in the 1970s congress generally did not focus on campaign finance legislation in the immediate aftermath of feca and bcra perhaps because passing those laws had required substantial momentum that was difficult to replicate in the short term that pattern could also hold following hloga although most of that bill was rela ted to lobbying and ethics rather than campaign finance even if cong ress decides not to undertake major legislative activity on campaign finance in the near fu ture nonlegislative activity is likely to keep campaign finance before the public and lawmakers this is particularly true given the highprofile 2008 elections nd heavy spending that has and will accompany those contests litigation and the fecs response is also likely to continue shaping the policy environment these events demonstrate that the evolution of campaign finance policy occurs not only in congress but also at the fec in the courts in other federal agenci and perhaps most of all in campaigns themselves as long as those campaig ns continue congre ss will be faced with questions about how to re gulate political money
