classified by charge daffaires w scott reid iii reasons 14 b c d 1 srel nato summary national intelligence officer nio for south asia dr peter lavoy briefed nato permanent representatives on the national intelligence estimate nie for afghanistan on november 25 he said the nie describes grim situation in afghanistan and predicts that negative trends will continue through 2009 if five interdependent regional challenges in south asia are not addressed defeating alqaida in pakistan creating stability in afghanistan creating stability in western pakistan creating stability in pakistan as whole particularly in the economy and improving the bilateral indiapakistan relationship permanent representatives called lavoys report unrelentingly gloomy but appeared to agree with his assessment that afghanistan is winnable especially if nato takes several immediate concrete steps to improve the situation end summary key challenges 2 srel nato nio lavoy opened his briefing to november 25 informal meeting of nato permanent representatives permreps by saying the situation for 2009 in afghanistan looked bleak unless the international community addressed five interdependent regional challenges defeating alqaida in the federally administered tribal areas fata of pakistan creating stability in afghanistan creating stability in pakistans northwest frontier province baluchistan province and the fata creating stability in pakistan as whole with particular emphasis on pakistans economy and improving the bilateral indiapakistan relationship 3 srel nato lavoy described fata as the command and control center for alqaida worldwide and said few hundred senior and midlevel trainers planners and operators reside there despite alqaidas presence in the fata he continued it plays surprisingly insignificant role in afghanistan where the numbers of foreign fighters remain relatively low alqaida is more disrupted than at any time since october 2001 but the organization is damaged not broken the international community cannot afford to let pressure off alqaida because it has demonstrated an ability to reconstitute itself in the past and could easily reversemigrate back to afghanistan if the taliban were to regain control lavoy emphasized that the consequences of failing in afghanistan and permitting alqaida to shift its center of gravity to afghanistan would pose threat to all nations inside their own borders sources of instability 4 srel nato turning to afghanistan lavoy underlined that there are more significant factors than alqaida that contribute to the bleak security situation the afghan government has failed to consistently deliver services in rural areas this has created void that the taliban and other insurgent groups have begun to fill in the southern eastern and some western provinces the taliban is mediating local disputes in some areas for example offering the population at least an elementary level of access to justice provincial governors appointed due to close ties to karzai have proven ineffective often putting certain tribes or subtribes at unnatural disadvantage while promoting others the taliban have effectively manipulated the grievances of disgruntled disenfranchised tribes to win over antigovernment recruits responding to question lavoy said karzai reflects the tribal fragmentation of afghanistan if there could be more balance of resources at the district level instead of channeling all money and efforts through karzai we could have greater success improving government linkages to the population 5 srel nato the taliban has become more militarily effective and is demonstrating more sophisticated infantry communications and command and control techniques their marksmanship is more precise and their explosives more lethal than in previous years for these reasons lavoy noted violent attacks initiated by insurgents rose 40 percent over the past year matching threeyear trend for drastic annual increases in insurgent attacks norwegian and turkish permreps asked about the source of expertise and financing that is allowing the taliban to become militarily proficient especially if the number of alqaida senior and midlevel personnel is low lavoy responded that the opium economy is the number one domestic funding source for pakistanoriented and afghan taliban organizations he added that insurgents have proven themselves highly adaptable and many fighters veteran status has contributed to opposing forces improved abilities 6 srel nato lavoy pointed to the growing professionalism and performance of the afghan national army ana as good news story but noted that isaf has 40 percent deficiency in numbers of trainers needed to constitute projected afghan army force strength of 134000 troops there is similar training deficiency for afghan national police anp development he said police are seen in many provinces as predatory force plagued by systemic problems beyond lack of professionalism equipment and training extortion of bribes from the populace remains common practice often to supplement provincial government coffers while there are cases where police are doing better the anp needs more resources 7 srel nato even if the international community rectifies training gaps in afghan army and police development lavoy concluded efforts would be insufficient if pakistan remains safe haven for insurgents similarly solving the safe haven in pakistan is necessary but insufficient to win in afghanistan without simultaneously addressing the severe governance development and access to justice gaps pakistans precarious situation 8 srel nato lavoy commented on two causes of instability in western pakistan that could cause pakistan to completely lose control of its pashtun territories over the next few years traditional pashtun tribal authority has broken down since the antisoviet jihad period and is longer capable of resolving social harmony at the community level pakistan has also promulgated policy of neglect of pashtun areas and still lacks strategy to deal holistically with social problems of illiteracy unemployment and disaffected youth both of these situations play to the advantage of insurgent and extremist groups 9 srel nato although pakistan now identifies both alqaida and the taliban as existential threats lavoy said pakistani government institutions still support the taliban in two key ways they permit the quetta taliban shura the taliban leadership council to operate unfettered in baluchistan province interservices intelligence isi provides intelligence and financial support to insurgent groups especially the jalaluddin haqqani network out of miram shah north waziristan to conduct attacks in afghanistan against afghan government isaf and indian targets permreps questioned the rationality of pakistans support for the taliban which lavoy explained in three ways first pakistan believes the taliban will prevail in the long term at least in the pashtun belt most proximate to the pakistani border second pakistan continues to define india as its number one threat and insists that india plays an overactive role in afghanistan finally pakistani officials think that if militant groups were not attacking in afghanistan they would seek out pakistani targets 10 srel nato lavoy said that after the storming of lal masjid red mosque in july 2007 the pakistani government had tried to sever ties with insurgent groups that its government institutions had cultivated over three decades when militants sought alqaida support and launched wave of attacks against pakistani government and security personnel pakistan realized it had lost control of these insurgent groups pakistan rapidly approached the various militant groups to reach domestic nonaggression deals lavoy claimed that the pakistani armys current operations in the fatas bajaur agency are directed exclusively against insurgent groups that refused to cooperate while the haqqani network remains untouched and continues policy of crossborder attacks urging militant groups to be outwardly focused he said is perceived by pakistani officials as method to safeguard internal security in addition pakistan has probably correctly assessed that it is only capable of targeting several groups at time which leads to policy of appeasement of other groups in the meantime 11 srel nato ongoing pakistani army operations in bajaur agency are missing counterinsurgency strategy to assist the population postconflict lavoy said the army requires the population to flee fights the remaining insurgents then uses air power to raze all structures associated with militants tunnels homes infrastructure etc the most urgent need for humanitarian international assistance to pakistan is in bajaur where up to 300000 residents have been displaced pakistan needs to be able to repatriate these citizens and effectively rebuild in the wake of operations it is critical lavoy said that the pakistani army succeed in bajaur agency there is rapidly changing perception in pakistans military that coordination with isaf is critically important 12 srel nato amidst the problems on the frontier the pakistani economy is in tatters lavoy continued the international monetary funds pledge of usd 67 billion will only address the immediate balance of payments crisis but will not alleviate under or unemployment for over third of the population pakistans population is becoming less and educated the country lacks sufficient energy and clean water resources to serve its population an there is minimal foreign investment lavoy addd that despite pending economic catastrophe pakstan is producing nuclear weapons at faster rae than any other country in the world irans role 13 srel nato lavoy responded to permreps questions about iran during the discussion he said iran calibrates its posture in afghanistan it provides welcome development and social services assistance in western provinces and generally acknowledges the taliban as longterm threat however it also provides some lethal support to the taliban hedging bets that the taliban might prevail positive political signs 14 srel nato moving to more optimistic topic lavoy mentioned that political signals from india may indicate trend of toneddown rhetoric against pakistan he said that although india believes without doubt that isi supported the haqqani network in orchestrating the indian embassy bombing in kabul that killed over 40 people in july indian diplomats and politicians showed restraint in public statements according to lavoy political leaders also seem to realize that indias past tactic of using military pressure to influence pakistani government to reign in militants may longer work especially if insurgent groups are operating against or independently of isi despite this positive political development lavoy said india could do more to assuage what one permrep called pakistani paranoia the indian military continues cold start exercises on the kashmir border confirming the pakistanis worst suspicions he added india would ideally move forces back from the border 15 srel nato on pakistanafghanistan relations lavoy characterized karzais relationship with pakistani president zardari as trustful and allied at political level he pointed out that the pakistani army remains deeply distrustful of the afghan president and of zardari himself lavoy suggested that pakistan could benefit from creating civilianmilitary national security board because politically progressive ideas on regional engagement with both india and afghanistan have not permeated the pakistan military helping pakistan reorient its national defense policy away from india and toward counterinsurgency he said could help refocus the pakistani military to be more successful permreps discussion 16 srel nato the secretary general syg thanked dr lavoy for presenting the expose on the regional situation in south asia several permreps noted that the feelgood factor of the briefing was pretty low and the report was chilling and unrelentingly gloomy 17 srel nato several permreps were interested to know how the nie affects the ongoing national security council strategic review ambassador volker responded that the nie forms baseline analysis to inform usg officials as they formulate and evaluate policy options and recommendations for the incoming administration 18 snf the canadian permrep agreed the importance of vastly larger and more competent ana force and proposed that up to 200000 troops might be necessary the belgian ambassador proposed that nato may need to prioritize ana training as isafs number one priority in coming months note belgium stood in the way last week of enabling the ana trust fund to expand its mandate to accept national contributions to sustain ana troops end note belgium added that delegations will need help crafting messages for their capitals he said that parliaments could make generating resources for longterm commitment even more difficult if permreps used the nie assessment to imply we have little control over many regional and systemic factors causing instability in afghanistan and pakistan 19 srel nato the turkish permrep said this briefing while pessimistic in tone was timed perfectly and urged the nac to craft strong messages for the syg to deliver during an upcoming trip to pakistan he commented that in the absence of effective afghan government leadership international efforts will make little difference the polish permrep said the report highlighted the renewed importance of pakistan to nato and an urgent requirement for nato to put added pressure on pakistan what should nato do 20 srel nato ambassador volker suggested three specific areas where nato could help improve the regional situation he said the alliance needed to ask itself how it can better engage at the provincial and district level how nato and isaf should facilitate better contact among afghanistan pakistan and india and whether it should encourage nations to commit resources to help pakistan deal with displaced people and repopulate the fata postconflict 21 srel nato lavoy endorsed these ideas and added that despite the troubling picture in afghanistan in 2008 afghanistan is winnable and the international community can help pakistan turn corner the formula is to enhance security exhibit good governance emanating from kabul but active at the district level and empower the tribes to have stake in development at the lowest levels these recommendations are logical extensions of the current strategy but require reorganization of resources he concluded nato should consider shifting the isaf center of gravity to the district level the international community needs to engage tribes without arming them and reinvigorate the traditional tribal system by instilling confidence in the population securing the people will go long way to improve their willingness to resist the taliban the ana needs to be stronger and is the best tool it will cost more resources and require more ingenuity anything nato can do including strong messages the syg can carry to pakistan on an upcoming trip to encourage closer militarytomilitary cooperation would be helpful elections are critical event and must be successful september is the right time so that we have enough time to organize to secure the pashtun population 2009 is the key year to influence pakistan and iran to halt lethal assistance to the taliban by showing afghanistans neighbors that the taliban will not prevail the international community should be relentless in pressuring pakistanis on this issue the international community should put intense pressure on the taliban in 2009 in order to bring out their more violent and ideologically radical tendencies this will alienate the population and give us an opportunity to separate the taliban from the population reid
