on may 18 1995 when the eastman kodak company filed petiti on with the office of the us trade representative ustr alleging that certain acts policies and pr actices of japan deny access to the market for photographic film nd paper there on july 2 1995 the ustr initiated an investigation to determine whether those acts policies and practices were actionable under section 301 unfair trade practices of the trade act of 1974 and requested consultations with the japanese government the two nations held preliminary discussions on october 3 1995 but the japanese government re fused to discuss the issue further kodak claimed that its market share in japan has been kept to less than 10 by anticompetitive actions by the fuji photo film company and count

policymeasures taken by the japanese government in particular the four largest wholesale distributors of photographic film products in japan handle fuji products exclusively these exclusive relationships allegedly re sulted from various government actions and regulations designed to offset the opening of japans film market to foreign firms and from certain actions by fuji that may violate japans antimonopoly law fuji claimed that it had not engaged in anticompetitive behavior and asserted that kodak actually has access to all film retailers in japan the fact that fuji has exclusive ties to the major wholesalers does not keep kodak from distributing to retailers through its own channels fuji pointed out that kodak engages in similar actions in the us market to maintain its high market share here on june 13 1996 as the oneyear deadline for action under section 301 approached the acting ustr announced that she had deter mined that certain of japans actions with respect to the sale and distribution of c onsumer photographic materials in japan are unreasonable and burden or restrict us co mmerce specifically the acting ustr found that the government of japa n established and tolerated market structure that impedes us exports of consumer photographic materi als to japan and in which practices occur that also impede us exports of these pr oducts to japan thereby denying fair and equitable market opportunities the ustr also concluded th at there is reason to believe based on strong evidence that certain japa nese government lib eralization counter measures including inter alia distribution guidelines and related measures the law pertaining to adjustment of business activities of the re tail industry for large scale retail stores1 lsrs and the law against unjustifiable premiums and misleading representations2 premiums law contravene japa ns obligations under the wto and nullify or impair benefits accruing to th united states under the wto

advised kodak to take certain antitrust issues to japans fair trade commission4 with respect to the wto dispute settlement mechanism the us made three separaterequests for consultations under wto

of gatt benefits arising from the full panoply of liberalization countermeasures that the government of japa n has put in place and maintained to thwart imports in this sector second the united states requested consulta tions regarding violations of the gats general agreement on trade in services arising from the requirements and operation of japans large scale retail store law lsrs the united states alleges that the lsrs constitutes serious barrier to foreign servi ce suppliers as well as imports of film and other consumer products third the united states requested cons ultations under gatt decision concerning restrictive business practices through this mechanism the united states intended to discuss the significant evidence of anticompetitive activities that it has uncovered in this sector and to ask the government of japan to take appropriate action5 in addition the united states requested th at kodak submit information to japans fair trade commission concerning anticompetitiv activities in this sector in august 1966 kodak filed complaint with the jftc and formally requested the commission to take enforcement action to insure greater competition in the market the two nations held the first round of consultations on the wto cases on july 10 11 1996 in geneva switzerland the consultations did not resolve the disputes so on september 20 the united states requested th at the wto dispute settlement body form an international panel to consider the complaint the panel was formed on october 16 1996 further consultations were requested on the gats case dealing with japans largescale retail store law on february 20 1997 the united states submitted brief to the wto dispute settlement panel ex amining japans film market the brief ran more than 200 pages and was supported by 10 volumes of documents the ustr claimed that for over 30 years japan had limited the sa of imported consumer photog raphic film and paper in the japanese market it was case of cla ssic protectionism accomplished through novel means6 according to the ustr japans liber alization countermeasures included distribution countermeasures japans ministry of international trade

h were uniquely positioned to sell photographic materials to thousands of re tailers throughout japan as result of mitis restructuring plan by the mid1970s the leading photospecialty wholesalers as well as many smaller wholesalers retailers and photo finishing laboratories handled onl domestic film and paper excluding imports from the distribution system restrictions on large retail stores in addition to denying foreign film and paper access to the primary distribution network japan closed off the next best available alternative large retail stor whereas wholesalers are needed to reach japans multitude of photospecialty retailers large retail stores have sufficient economies of scale to make directtoretail sales efficient moreover the greater amount of shelf space in rge stores increases the likelihood that imports will be displayed beside domestic brands japan however has established highly restrictive regulatory system limiting the expansion and operation of large retail stores this has had an adverse effect on access to the japanese market for imported film and paper7 promotion countermeasures japan has reinforced the foregoing measures affecting wholesalers and retailers by limiting the extent to which foreign producers might rely upon their marketing st rength to promote sales through the use of economic inducements or premiu ms and other ma rketing techniques such promotions stimulate demand for products and thereby serve as incentives for wholesalers and retailers to carry them japan adopted series of promotion countermeasures restricting the ability of suppliers to use certain discounts coupons lotteries giveaways or other economic incentives and particular representations in advertising especially where price or price discounts are discussed the united stat claimed that these measures have limited the sale of importe d photographic materials japan responded with various arguments and counterpoints the initial burden of proof was on the united states the ited states primarily pursued gatt remedy that comes into play when another wto member has imposed measures that do not violate wto agreement but that allegedly negate the effect of or nullify and impair the benefits of tariff reductions that the mber has previously ne gotiated it took this track because the wto has agreement on competition policy under this nonviolative track case not involving vi olation of wto agreement the united states argued that the japanese government took measures that nullified or impaired benefits expected to accrue to this country under th kennedy tokyo and uruguay r ounds of mu ltilateral tariff negotiations which redu ced import tariffs in japan on photographic film and paper the panel examined sixteen specific japa nese government measures fuji film companys private and allegedly anticompetitive practices were not considered the united states also argued that even though the individual measures standing alone

trade organization japan measures affecting consumer photographic film and paper report of the panel report wtds44r march 31 1998 on internet at http wwwwtoorgwtodisputedistabhtm textual references refer to paragraphs in this wto report whole to accomplish that purpose scholars in japan agree that one way that japanese government administrative guidance formal and informal direction to the private sector is made effective is through continuous process of studying surveying cajoling and targeting the use of fiscal incentives that k eeps the private sector focused on the goals set by the government the united states alleged that some of the measures actually were designed to work in conjunction with other measures not alone the wto panel report released on march 31 1998 concluded that the united states failed to prove its case for all sixteen of th japanese government measures considered the panel examined the arguments on both side s but the crucial one seemed to be that the measures in question were enacted and should have been known to the united states before the relevant tari ff concessions were made8 the decision in the case therefore turned as much on questions of timing as on whether barriers in japans film market actually existed or not it also may imply for future wto tariff reductions that for products being negotiated countries are re sponsible to know about the existence of countermeasures in other c ountries as of the date of their publication 620 1080 the panel noted that in nonviolative cases countries ordinarily claim that the impaired benefit is that of legitimate expectations of improved market access opportunities resulting from tariff concessions for expectati ons to be legitimate they must take into account all measures of the party making the cession that could have been reasonably anticipated at th time of the concession 1061 with respect to the us charge that the measures by japan worked as an organic whole 10350351 the panel stated that this legal theory was not implausible it concluded however that the us side did not present sufficient evidence or argument to support its claim that all these measures have worked in concert to upset us market access expectations 10353 results of the case even though the united states did not succeed in this instance the case did make certain findings that may benefit the united states in future cases or may reduce japanese government intervention into its economy on behalf of domestic companies the wto panel established that in nullification cases it was not inappropriate to consider government actions either fina ncial or nonfinancial that ar not laws or regulations as measures10431038 these include ac tions designed to strengthen the competitiveness of certain distribution or industrial sectors and encompass governments industrial policy w ith goal of increased effici ency in sector the panel concluded that such policies could upset the competitive relationship between domestic and imported products in way that could violate obligations under the wto even if they do not infringe upon wto rules they s till could be implement ed in manner that results in disproportionate impact on mark et conditions for im ported products 1038 this interpretation appears to open many of the lessformal items of japanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98442crs6 9office

panel clarified to some extent what types of evidence and information would be necessary if the united states were to take similar disputes to the wto in the future in the process of arguing its case the japanese government also asserted that certain conditions existed in its market for example it maintained that there are government imposed barriers in japan that prevent fore ign market penetrati

government measures of any ki nd that would in any way stop foreign manufacturer from expanding or improving its distribution network there 541 the country further asserted that there is market barrier preventing access to imported products by retailers 559 nd that the actions of its fair trade commission antitrust watchdog agency in enforcing rules dealing with excessive premiu ms and other matters are trade neutral and appl equally to foreign nd domestic producers 10273 according to the us trade representative ja pan also represented to the panel that the japanese government actually
