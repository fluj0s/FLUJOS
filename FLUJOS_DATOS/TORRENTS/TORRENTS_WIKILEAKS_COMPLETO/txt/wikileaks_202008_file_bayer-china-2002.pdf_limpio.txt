reasonable arrangement of noise sources shall be taken into consideration in noise control the main preventive measures are 1 lownoise equipment should be selected as much as possible 2 to make reasonable arrangement avoiding noise superposition and interference 62 countermeasure against unorganized discharge unorganized emission refers to irregular emission of atmospheric pollutants not through vent stack or emission sources from vent stack under 15m it is mainly irregular emission resulting from leakage furthermore evaporation during material handling and maintenance also leads to unorganized emission quantity of unorganized emission is related to process technology level quality of equipment and pipelines operating conditions and operation management level etc due to the advanced technology and equipment used in the project and related leakage is prevented by feasible countermeasures the unorganized discharge of this project is under effective control the countermeasures integrated in the engineering are as follows 1 all the storage tanks in the project are provided with nitrogen seal and lda project ei rev 0 41connected with exhausting headers by which the gas emitted is sent to safety dipin tanks before incineration in case of incinerator failure or shutdown due to maintenance waste gas treatment system will be switched to active carbon adsorption unit and thus unorganized discharge from the storage tanks is avoided effectively 2 in this project electromagnetic driven pumps double mechanical seal pumps and diaphragm pumps or other kind of leakageproofing pumps are selected for transfer of harmful fluids as result fluid leakage due to aging of seals is eliminated and unorganized discharge of harmful fluids is effectively avoided because of the practical countermeasures mentioned above remarkable fluid leakage and escaping will occur in our opinion only the leakage from the pipingflanges valves etc can cause unorganized emission other preventive measures will be made as follows 1 promptly collecting and treating the washing water generated from equipment routine maintenance strictly control washing water consumption 2 recover the fluids after maintenance of such equipment as compressors and pumps during plant operation 3 set up necessary management regulations strengthen the operator post patrol inspection and promptly eliminate any found leakage 63 counter measures during construction period the project construction will inevitable give rise to some environmental impact countermeasures against pollution must be taken to prevent any avoidable harm to the environment 1 special sprinkling vehicles should be provided to reduce the dusts generated during excavation building material handling application
