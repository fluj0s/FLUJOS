specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division advanced nuclear power and fuel cycle technologies outlook and policy options summary current us nuclear energy policy focuses on the nearterm construction of improved versions of existing nuclear power plants all of todays us nuclear plants are light water reactors lwrs which are cooled by ordinary water under current policy the highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel from lwrs is to be permanently disposed of in deep underground repository the bush administration is also promoting an aggressive us effort to move beyond lwr technology into advanced reactors and fuel cycles specifically the global nuclear energy partnership gnep under the department of energy doe is developing advanced reprocessing or recycling technologies to extract plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel as well as an advanced reactor that could fully destroy longlived radioactive isotopes does generation iv nuclear energy systems initiative is developing other advanced reactor technologies that could be safer than lwrs and produce hightemperature heat to make hydrogen does advanced nuclear technology programs date back to the early years of the atomic energy commission in the 1940s and 1950s in particular it was widely believed that breeder reactors designed to produce maximum amounts of plutonium from natural uranium would be necessary for providing sufficient fuel for large commercial nuclear power industry early research was also conducted on wide variety of other power reactor concepts some of which are still under active consideration although long goal of nuclear power proponents the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is also seen as weapons proliferation risk because plutonium extracted for new reactor fuel can also be used for nuclear weapons therefore primary goal of us advanced fuel cycle programs including gnep has been to develop recycling technologies that would not produce pure plutonium that could easily be diverted for weapons use the proliferation resistance of these technologies is subject to considerable debate much of the current policy debate over advanced nuclear technologies is being conducted in the appropriations process for fy2009 the house appropriations committee recommended further funding for gnep although it increased funding for the generation iv program typically the senate is more supportive of gnep and reprocessing technologies recent industry studies conducted for the gnep program conclude that advanced nuclear technologies will require many decades of governmentsupported development before they reach the current stage of lwrs key questions before congress are whether the time has come to move beyond laboratory research on advanced nuclear technologies to the next more expensive development stages and what role if any the federal government should play contents nuclear technology overview 2 doe advanced nuclear programs 4 global nuclear

policy implications 11 advanced nuclear power and fuel cycle technologies outlook and policy options all commercial nuclear power plants in the united states as well as nearly all nuclear plants worldwide use light water reactor lwr technology that was initially developed for naval propulsion cooled by ordinary water lwrs in the early years were widely considered to be an interim technology that would pave the way for advanced nuclear concepts after the early 1960s the federal government focused most of its nuclear power research and development efforts on breeder reactors and high temperature reactors that could use uranium resources far more efficiently and potentially operate more safely than lwrs however four decades later lwrs continue to dominate the nuclear power industry and are the only technology currently being considered for new generation of us commercial reactors federal license applications for as many as 30 new lwrs have been recently announced the proposed new nuclear power plants would begin coming on line around 2016 and operate for 60 years or longer under that scenario lwrs appear likely to dominate the nuclear power industry for decades to come if the next generation of nuclear power plants consists of lwrs what is the potential role of advanced nuclear reactor and fuel cycle technologies do current plans for new generation of lwrs raise potential problems that advanced nuclear technologies could or should address can new fuel cycle technologies reduce the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation what is the appropriate time frame for the commercial deployment of new nuclear technology this report provides background and analysis to help congress address those questions prominent among the policy issues currently before congress is the direction of the existing nuclear energy programs in the us department of energy doe doe administers programs to encourage nearterm construction of new lwrs such as the nuclear power 2010 program which is paying half the cost of licensing and firstof akind engineering for new us lwr designs and loan guarantees for new reactors now under consideration by us utilities does global nuclear energy partnership gnep is developing advanced fuel cycle technologies that are intended to allow greater worldwide use of nuclear power without increased weapons proliferation risks advanced nuclear reactors that could increase efficiency and safety are being developed by does generation iv program which is looking beyond todays generation iii light water reactors the priority given to these options depends not only on the characteristics of existing and advanced nuclear technologies but on the role that nuclear power is expected to play in addressing national energy and environmental goals for example if nuclear energy is seen as key element in global climate change policy crs2 because of its low carbon dioxide emissions the deployment of advanced reactor and fuel cycle technologies could be considered to be more urgent than if nuclear power is expected to have limited longterm role because of economic nonproliferation and safety concerns nuclear technology overview as their name implies light water reactors use ordinary water for cooling the reactor core and moderating or slowing the neutrons in nuclear chain reaction the slower neutrons called thermal neutrons are highly efficient in causing fission splitting of nuclei in certain isotopes of heavy elements such as uranium 235 and plutonium 239 pu239 therefore smaller percentage of those isotopes is needed in nuclear fuel to sustain nuclear chain reaction in which neutrons released by fissioned nuclei then induce fission in other nuclei and so forth the downside is that thermal neutrons cannot efficiently induce fission in more than few specific isotopes natural uranium has too low concentration of u235 07 to fuel an lwr the remainder is u238 so the u235 concentration must be increased enriched to between 3 and 5 in the reactor the u235 fissions releasing energy neutrons and fission products highly radioactive fragments of u235 nuclei some neutrons are also absorbed by u238 nuclei to create pu239 which itself may then fission after several years in an lwr fuel assemblies will build up too many neutronabsorbing fission products and become too depleted in fissile u235 to efficiently sustain nuclear chain reaction at that point the assemblies are considered spent nuclear fuel and removed from the reactor lwr spent fuel typically contains about 1 u235 1 plutonium 4 fission products and the remainder u238 under current policy the spent fuel is to be disposed of as waste although only tiny fraction of the original natural uranium has been used long lived plutonium and other actinides1 in the spent fuel pose longterm hazard that greatly increases the complexity of finding suitable disposal site reprocessing or recycling of spent nuclear fuel for use in fast reactors in which the neutrons are not slowed is intended to address some of the shortcomings of the lwr oncethrough fuel cycle fast neutrons are less effective in inducing fission than thermal neutrons but can induce fission in all actinides including all plutonium isotopes therefore nuclear fuel for fast reactor must have higher proportion of fissionable isotopes than thermal reactor to sustain chain reaction but larger number of different isotopes can constitute that fissionable proportion fast reactors ability to fission all actinides makes it theoretically possible to repeatedly separate those materials from spent fuel and feed them back into the reactor until they are entirely fissioned fast reactors are also ideal for breeding the 1 actinides consist of actinium and heavier elements in the periodic table crs3 maximum amount of pu239 from u238 eventually converting virtually all of natural uranium to useable nuclear fuel current reprocessing programs are generally viewed by their proponents as interim steps toward commercial nuclear fuel cycle based on fast reactors because the benefits of limited recycling with lwrs are modest commercialscale spent fuel reprocessing is currently conducted in france britain and russia the pu239 they produce is blended with uranium to make mixedoxide mox fuel in which the pu239 largely substitutes for u235 two french reprocessing plants at hague can each reprocess up to 800 metric tons of spent fuel per year while britains thorp facility at sellafield has capacity of 900 metric tons per year russia has 400ton plant at ozersk and japan is building an 800ton plant at rokkasho to succeed 90ton demonstration facility at tokai mura britain and france also have older plants to reprocess gascooled reactor fuel and india has 275ton plant2 about 200 metric tons of mox fuel is used annually about 2 of new nuclear fuel3 equivalent to about 2000 metric tons of mined uranium4 while long goal of nuclear power proponents the reprocessing or recycling of spent nuclear fuel is also seen as weapons proliferation risk because plutonium extracted for new reactor fuel can also be used for nuclear weapons therefore primary goal of us advanced fuel cycle programs including gnep has been to develop recycling technologies that would not produce pure plutonium that could easily be diverted for weapons use the proliferation resistance of these technologies is subject to considerable debate removing uranium from spent nuclear fuel through reprocessing would eliminate most of the volume of radioactive material requiring disposal in deep geologic repository in addition the removal of plutonium and conversion to shorterlived fission products would eliminate most of the longterm post1000 years radioactivity in nuclear waste but the waste resulting from reprocessing would have nearly the same shortterm radioactivity and heat as the original spent fuel because the reprocessing waste consists primarily of fission products which generate most of the radioactivity and heat in spent fuel because heat is the main limiting factor on repository capacity conventional reprocessing would not provide major disposal benefits in the near term doe is addressing that problem with proposal to further separate the primary heatgenerating fission products cesium 137 and strontium 90 from high level waste for separate storage and decay over several hundred years that proposal would greatly increase repository capacity although it would require an alternative secure storage system for the cesium and strontium that has yet to be designed 2 world nuclear association processing of used nuclear fuel for recycle march 2007 at httpwwwworldnuclearorginfoinf69html 3 world nuclear association mixed oxide fuel mox november 2006 at httpwwwworldnuclearorginfoinf29html 4 world nuclear association uranium markets march 2007 crs4 safety and efficiency are other areas in which improvements have long been envisioned over lwr technology the primary safety vulnerability of lwrs is lossofcoolant accident in which the water level in the reactor falls below the nuclear fuel when the water is lost the chain reaction stops because the neutrons are longer moderated but the heat of radioactive decay continues and will quickly melt the nuclear fuel as occurred during the 1979 three mile island accident does generation iv program is focusing on high temperature gascooled reactors that would use fuel whose melting point would be higher than the maximum reactor temperature the high operating temperature of such reactors would also result in greater fuel efficiency and the potential for costeffective production of hydrogen which could be used as nonpolluting transportation fuel however the commercial viability of generation iv reactors remains uncertain doe advanced nuclear programs does advanced nuclear technology programs date back to the early years of the atomic energy commission in the 1940s and 1950s in particular it was widely believed that breeder reactors would be necessary for providing sufficient fuel for commercial nuclear power industry early research was also conducted on wide variety of other power reactor concepts some of which are still under active consideration the us research effort on various advanced nuclear concepts has waxed and waned during subsequent decades sometimes resulting from changes in administrations technical and engineering advances have appeared to move some of the technologies closer to commercial viability but significantly greater federal support would be necessary to move them beyond the indefinite research and development stage global nuclear energy partnership gnep is the bush administrations program for commercial deployment of reprocessing or recycling of spent nuclear fuel the programs goal is to develop proliferation resistant fuel cycle technologies not producing pure plutonium that could be used around the world previous us commercial reprocessing programs have been blocked at least partly over concerns that they would encourage other countries to begin separating weaponsuseable plutonium history the fundamental technology for spent fuel reprocessing is the purex process plutoniumuranium extraction developed to provide pure plutonium for nuclear weapons commercial purex plant operated from 1966 through 1972 in west valley new york and two other commercial us plants were built but never operated meanwhile doe and its predecessor agencies worked to develop fast breeder reactors that could run on the reprocessed plutonium fuel major facilities included experimental breeder reactors i and ii which began operating in idaho in 1951 and 1964 and the fast flux test facility fftf larger fast reactor that began full operation in hanford washington in 1982 fftf was designed to pave the way for the first us commercialscale breeder reactor planned to begin construction near crs5 clinch river tennessee in 1977 however the clinch river breeder reactor crbr and the federal governments support for commercial reprocessing were halted by president carter in 1977 because of the nuclear proliferation issues noted above upon taking office in 1981 president reagan reversed the carter policy and restarted preparations for crbr but congress eliminated further funding for the project in 1983 doe then turned to an alternative technology based on work carried out at experimental breeder reactor ii ebrii which used metal fuel that could be recycled through pyroprocessing melting and electrochemical separation rather than with the aqueous waterbased purex process supporters of this program called the integral faster reactor ifr and the advanced liquid metal reactor almr contended that pyroprocessing would not produce pure plutonium product and could be carried out at small scale at reactor sites reducing weapons proliferation risks the clinton administration however moved in 1993 to terminate does advanced reactor programs including shutdown of ebrii congress agreed to the proposed phaseout but continued funding for pyroprocessing technology as way to treat ebrii spent fuel for eventual disposal current program the george w bush administration made energy policy high priority and placed particular emphasis on nuclear energy the national energy policy development nepd group headed by vice president cheney recommended in may 2001 that nuclear power be expanded in the united states and that reprocessing once again become integral to the us nuclear program the nepd group recommends that in the context of developing advanced nuclear fuel cycles and next generation technologies for nuclear energy the united states should reexamine its policies to allow for research development and deployment of fuel conditioning methods such as pyroprocessing that reduce waste streams and enhance proliferation resistance in doing so the united states will continue to discourage the accumulation of separated plutonium worldwide the united states should also consider technologies in collaboration with international partners with highly developed fuel cycles and record of close cooperation to develop reprocessing and fuel treatment technologies that are cleaner more efficient less wasteintensive and more proliferationresistant5 the bush administrations first major step toward implementing those recommendations was to announce the advanced fuel cycle initiative in 2003 afci doe program to develop proliferationresistant reprocessing technologies the program built on the ongoing pyroprocessing technology development effort and reprocessing research conducted under other doe nuclear programs much of the 5 national energy policy development group national energy policy may 16 2001 p 522 crs6 programs research has focused on an aqueous separations technology called urex in which uranium and other elements are chemically removed from dissolved spent fuel leaving mixture of plutonium and other highly radioactive elements congress provided 5 million above the administrations 63 million initial request in fy2004 for afci and the program received statutory authorization in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 sec 953 including support for international cooperation the announcement of the gnep initiative in february 2006 as part of the administrations fy2007 budget request appeared to further address the 2001 reprocessing goals of the national energy policy development group using reprocessing technologies to be developed by afci gnep envisioned consortium of nations with advanced nuclear technology that would guarantee to provide fuel services and reactors to countries that would agree not to conduct fuel cycle activities such as enrichment and reprocessing gnep has attracted significant international attention but country has yet indicated interest in becoming solely fuel recipient rather than supplier the nuclear nonproliferation treaty guarantees the right of all participants to develop fuel cycle facilities and gnep statement of principles signed by the united states and 15 other countries on september 16 2007 preserves that right while encouraging the establishment of viable alternative to acquisition of sensitive fuel cycle technologies6 according to doe gnep currently has 21 member countries and 17 candidates and observers7 although gnep is largely conceptual at this point doe issued spent nuclear fuel recycling program plan in may 2006 that provided general schedule for gnep technology demonstration program tdp8 which would develop the necessary technologies to achieve gneps goals according to the program plan the first phase of the tdp running through fy2006 consisted of program definition and development and acceleration of afci phase 2 running through fy2008 was to focus on the design of technology demonstration facilities which then were to begin operating during phase 3 from fy2008 to fy2020 the national academy of sciences in october 2007 strongly criticized does aggressive deployment schedule for gnep and recommended that the program instead focus on research and 6

government accountability office10 as part of gnep afci is conducting rd on an advanced burner reactor abr that could destroy recycled plutonium and other longlived radioactive elements the abr is similar to breeder reactor except that its core would be configured to produce less plutonium from u238 than it consumes reducing potential plutonium stockpiles funding afci the primary funding component of gnep has received steadily increased funding from congress but far less than requested during the past two budget cycles for fy2007 doe sought 2430 million and received 1661 million and for fy2008 the request of 3950 million was cut to 1794 million typically the senate recommends more for the program than the house does and that pattern appears to be continuing for fy2009 the fy2009 advanced fuel cycle initiative funding request is 3015 million nearly 70 above the fy2008 appropriation of 1794 million but below the fy2008 request of 3950 million the house appropriations committee recommended cutting afci to 900 million in fy2009 eliminating all funding for gnep11 the remaining funds would be used for research on advanced fuel cycle technology but none could be used for design or construction of new facilities the committee urged doe to continue coordinating its fuel cycle research with other countries that already have spent fuel recycling capability but not with countries aspiring to have nuclear capabilities fy2009 funding of 104 million was requested for conceptual design work on an advanced fuel cycle facility afcf to provide an engineeringscale demonstration of afci technologies according to the budget justification the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act rejected funding for development of afcf as did the house appropriations committee for fy2009 doe requested 180 million for the abr program for fy2009 up from 117 million in fy2008 the program is expected to focus on developing sodiumcooled fast reactor sfr the house appropriations committee recommended fy2009 funding for the abr generation iv doe describes generation iv as advanced reactor technologies that could be available for commercial deployment after 2030 these technologies are intended to offer significant advantages over existing generation iii reactors lwrs in the 9 national academy of sciences review of does nuclear energy research and development program prepublication

and very high temperature reactors13 these reactor concepts are not new and some have been demonstrated at the commercial scale but none has been sufficiently developed for successful commercialization the doe generation iv nuclear energy systems initiative gen iv is focusing on heliumcooled very high temperature gas reactor vhtr and conducting crosscutting research on materials and other areas that could apply to all reactor technologies including lwrs the vhtr technology is being developed for the next generation nuclear plant ngnp authorized by the energy policy act of 2005 development of sodiumcooled fast reactors is being conducted by the afci program as part of the abr effort described above doe requested 700 million for gen iv for fy2009 449 million below the fy2008 funding level of 1149 million which was nearly triple the administrations fy2008 budget request of 361 million the house appropriations committee recommended an increase to 2000 million most of the fy2009 request 595 million is for the ngnp program the vhtr technology being developed by doe uses helium as coolant and coated particle fuel that can withstand temperatures up to 1600 degrees celsius phase i research on the ngnp is to continue until 2011 when decision will be made on moving to the phase ii design and construction stage according to the fy2009 doe budget justification the house appropriations committee provided 1960 million to accelerate work on ngnp all but 40 million of the committees total funding level for the generation iv program the energy policy act of 2005 authorizes 125 billion through fy2015 for ngnp development and construction title vi subtitle c the authorization requires that ngnp be based on research conducted by the generation iv program and be

advanced fast reactor according to doe14 schedule for completing this process has not been announced industry studies to help determine the future direction of the gnep program doe solicited studies from four industry consortia the four studies released by doe on may 28 2008 describe concepts for advanced fuel recyclingreprocessing facilities along with general cost estimates and schedules the four teams have signed cooperative agreements with doe to continue developing conceptual designs technology development roadmaps and business plans for potential deployment and commercialization of recycling and reactor technologies at least through fy2008 and possibly through fy2009 according to doe these additional studies will help inform decision on the potential path forward for technologies and facilities associated with domestic implementation of gnep15 energysolutions shaw and westinghouse energysolutions waste treatment and disposal firm shaw group an engineering and construction firm and westinghouse electric company reactor design firm led an industry team that proposed that aqueous reprocessing facilities to handle 1500 metric tons per year of lwr spent fuel begin operating by 2023 fuel fabrication plant would be built to supply mox fuel to existing lwrs recycling facilities during this initial phase would be funded and built by doe the next phase of the energysolutions proposal would run from 2030 to 2049 410 megawatt electric fast reactor would begin operating in 2033 with four additional units starting up by 2045 aqueous reprocessing capacity would be expanded by 3000 metric tons per year and nonaqueous reprocessing facilities would be added in the final phase 2050 through 2100 the fast reactor recycling fleet would expand to 96 gigawatts about the capacity of todays us lwr fleet and less aqueous reprocessing capacity would be needed federal corporation would be established to sign longterm contracts with industry for spent fuel recycling and fuel fabrication build and operate waste repository and transport spent fuel the federal corporations funding would come from nearly doubling the nuclear waste fee currently imposed on nuclear power generation from 1 mill per kilowatthour to 195 millskwh assuming the previously collected balance in the nuclear waste fund the treasury account that holds the waste fees is not used at the current rate of nuclear power generation the proposed fee would produce revenues of about 15 billion per year gehitachi team led by general electric hitachi nuclear energy prepared proposal based on

gnep industry reports and presentations may 28 2008 crs10 pyroprocessing facility that is proposed would use the electrometallurgical separations process developed by the ifr program with improvements that have been made during the subsequent 15 years the fast reactor is the power reactor inherently safe module prism that ge developed for the almr program also with subsequent refinements according to the report power plant consisting of six prism modules totaling 1866 megawatts electric mwe along with the necessary reprocessing capacity would consume 5800 metric tons of lwr spent fuel over its planned 60year operating life the first phase of the gehitachi proposal taking about 20 years would consist of construction and operation of one or two prism modules the second phase lasting about 10 years would feature commercial deployment of at least one advanced recycling center arc consisting of six prism modules and reprocessing and fuel fabrication facility multiple arcs would be constructed in the third phase after 30 years general atomics general atomics long associated with gascooled reactor technology led team that proposed twotier spent fuel recycling system in the first tier lwr spent fuel would be sent to aqueous reprocessing plants to extract nuclear fuel material to be used in hightemperature gas reactors such as the type being developed by the doe gen iv program because of their high fuel burnup the gas reactors would eliminate most plutonium and minor actinides in the second tier spent fuel from the gas reactors would be pyroprocessed so that the remaining plutonium and minor actinides could be fissioned in fast reactor under the teams preferred scenario lwrs would continue to be constructed through 2050 136 in all and be phased out by 2110 the first gascooled reactor module 385 mwe would start up by 2025 and the first aqueous reprocessing center would begin operation by about 2030 the aqueous reprocessing centers would have capacity of about 1500 tons of lwr spent fuel per year and cost about 83 billion to construct in 2006 dollars the first pyroprocessing facility would open in 2040 and the first fast reactor would open by 2075 the team recommended that initial facilities for the program be developed by government corporation which would be privatized by 2035 areva the french nuclear firm areva which has long experience with commercial purex reprocessing plants in france led team that proposed continued reliance on lwrs with gradual buildup of fast reactors through 2019 the team recommended that mox fuel be tested in existing us reactors from plutonium extracted from usorigin spent fuel reprocessed overseas the first 800 ton per year aqueous recycling plant would open in 2023 with additional 800ton modules starting up in 2045 and 2070 500 mwe fast reactor would begin operating in 2025 1000 mwe reactor would open in 2035 and 1500 mwe reactor would begin operating in 2050 with additional 1500 mwe units starting up about every two years thereafter government corporation would be established to run the recycling program costs are estimated to be 1070 higher than the existing 1 millkwh nuclear waste fee crs11 policy implications for congress and other federal policymakers issues posed by current gnep and gen iv proposals are similar to those of the past several decades the fundamental policy question is whether the government should encourage the expansion of nuclear power the industry has long contended that new commercial reactors will not be constructed without increased government incentives or subsidies after the initial federal push to commercialize nuclear power in the 1950s and 1960s government support waned to the point where nuclear phaseout seemed possible but nuclear power proponents now contend that dramatic growth will be needed with federal support to meet future energy demand in carbonconstrained environment such highgrowth scenarios must overcome many of the same perceived challenges that faced the optimistic initial expectations for nuclear power if dramatic growth were to finally occur could light water reactors meet the challenge or is transition to advanced nuclear technologies necessary and if new technologies will be needed how urgently must the federal government move forward as in the early years of the nuclear power program primary concern with renewed nuclear power growth is longterm fuel supply since lwrs can extract energy from only fraction of natural uranium during the past two decades of slowed us and world nuclear power expansion the only problem with uranium was oversupply and chronically low prices supply has since tightened but uranium production capacity is expanding rapidly in response whether increased exploration activity will result in higher worldwide resource estimates will have important implications for this issue the longproposed solution to the fuel problem replacing lwrs with fast breeder reactors raises the nuclear weapons proliferation issue lwr spent fuel is highly resistant to proliferation at least for the first 100 years although the technology requires uranium enrichment facilities that may pose their own risks gneps goal of expanding nuclear power while limiting the proliferation of fuel cycle facilities is widely shared but the success of the programs current approach remains uncertain nuclear waste management has also been longstanding problem in the united states and the world the oncethrough lwr fuel cycle requires extremely long term isolation of plutonium and other longlived radionuclides reprocessing could potentially shorten the disposal horizon and make siting easier for waste repositories but if longterm isolation is determined to be feasible the waste disposal benefits of reprocessing may become less significant other anticipated benefits of advanced reactor technologies over lwrs include improved safety lower costs and hightemperature heat production for hydrogen and other industrial purposes lwr technology has improved steadily in safety particularly in its vulnerability to lossofcoolant accidents and the projected risks of the latest designs have been reduced one to two orders of magnitude below that of existing reactors proposed generation iv designs are intended to virtually eliminate crs12 the major risk factors inherent in lwrs although they may have other safety risks that have yet to be as fully quantified new lwr designs are also intended to reduce costs from those incurred by existing reactors but cost estimates have recently escalated along with those of all competing power systems generation iv reactors are projected by their designers to reduce both construction and operating costs but these projections have yet to be demonstrated lwrs are limited to relatively lowtemperature operation so hightemperature gas reactors could be the most practical technology for nuclear generation of hydrogen as transportation fuel if hydrogen were to become major transportation fuel which remains far from certain nuclear power could begin to play significant role in replacing petroleum however more commercial attention has recently been focused on batterybased electric vehicle systems which could be recharged by lwrs recent us nuclear energy policy has focused primarily on large government incentives for privatesector construction of new lwrs such as loan guarantees tax credits and regulatory risk insurance imposition of federal controls on carbon dioxide emissions would provide additional powerful incentives for lwr construction as shown by the industry studies described above the advanced nuclear technologies under development by gnep and gen iv will require many years of governmentsupported development before they reach the current stage of lwrs the bush administration has renewed the federal research effort on these technologies so now the question before congress is whether the time has come to move to the next more expensive development stages for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34579
