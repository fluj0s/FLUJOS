constitutional iss ues courtstripping summary over the years various proposals have been made to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear cases regarding particular areas of constitutional law such as busing abortion prayer in school and most recently reciting the pledge of allegiance several such propos als passed the house in the 108th congress including an amendment to hr 2799 to limit the use of funds to enforce federal court decision regarding the pledge of allegiance hr 2028 to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear cases regarding the pledge of allegiance and hr 3313 to limit federal court jurisdiction over questions regarding the defense of marriage act generally proponents of these proposals are critical of specific decisions made by the federal courts in that particular substantive area and the proposals are usually intended to express disagreement with cases in those areas andor to influence the results or applications of such cases pr oposals of this type ar often referred to as courtstripping legislation the label arises from the fact that many of these proposals invoke the congresss power to regu late federal court jurisdiction ie the courts power to consider cases of partic ular class and in particular procedural posture it should be noted however that some proposals characterized as court stripping rather than focusing on jurisd iction address what re medies are available to litigants or what procedures must be followed to bring constitutional cases although the united states congress has broa d authority to regulate in all three of these areas of judicial power jurisdicti on procedure and remedi this authority is generally used to address broader issues of court effi ciency and resource allocation this report however is limited to proposals to allocate judicial power in way that affects or influences the result in cases concerning specific constitutional issues there are at least three different types of court stripping proposals 1 limiting the jurisdiction of the inferior federal courts 2 limiting the jurisdiction of all federal courts and 3 limiting the jurisdiction of both state and federal courts together while the congress s broad authority under article iii of the cons titution to regulate the jurisdiction procedures nd remedies available in state and federal courts this power is generally not used as means to affect substantive law consequently the federal courts have only rarely faced the question of what happens when the congress acts under article i ii to limit substantive litigation and the supreme court has not squarely faced m odern law limiting jurisdiction to affect or influence litigation of constitu tional questions thus an analysis of these proposals relies to some extent on xtual analysis and scholar ly discussion congresss authority to limit the jurisdiction of inferior federal courts appears relatively broad so that laws limiting the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts would appear to raise fewer constitutional issues significant constitutional questions arise however with regard to whether congress could eliminate both inferior federal court and supreme court review of constitutional matters further elimination of review of constitutional issues by any court state or federal court seems the least likely to survive constitutional scrutiny various commentators however have suggested that limiting jurisdiction for any court for particular class of cases raises questions regarding both the separation of powers doc trine and the equal protection

under the discussion of article iii 2 cl 2act3 finally in september 2004 the house passed hr 2028 the pledge protection act which was intended to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts to hear cases regarding the pledge of allegiance4 all of these proposals appear to be di stinguishable from other bills relating to judicial power in that they are narrowly focused on substantive constitutional issues further proponents of thes proposals are gene rally critical of specific decisions made by the federal courts in the particular substantiv area and the proposals are represented as intended to influence the results or applications of such cases this report addresses th constitutionality of propos als to allocate or limit judicial power for the purpose of affectin g or influencing the substantive result of cases regarding particular constitutional issues5 these proposals are often referred to as courtstripping proposals the label arises from the fact that many of these proposals invoke the congresss power to regu late federal court jurisdiction ie the courts power to consider cases of partic ular class and in particular procedural posture it should be noted however that some proposals characterized as court stripping actually involve either changing what remedies are available to litigants or amending the procedures that must be followed to bring constitutional cases although the united states congress has broad authority to regulate in all of these areas of judicial power jurisdiction pro cedure and remedies this authority may be subject to certain constitutional limits background the authority of congress to regulate the jurisdiction procedures and remedies available in federal courts is principally found in article iii of the united states constitution article iii provides that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs3

article iii identifies the cases covered by this judicial power by two separate criteria the subject matter of particular cases or the identity of the litigants or persons affected the subject matter of the federal judicial power is qu ite broad as it includes the power to consider all cases arising under either the c onstitution federal law or tr eaty or arising from the admiralty or mar itime jurisdiction as noted article iii also extends the federal judicial power to cases based on the types of parties affected or involved these latter cases can be divided into two different groups the first group includes all cases whic h affect an ambassador or other public ministers or consuls or which involve controversy between two or more states the second group includes cases involving di sputes between the united states and another party state and citizens of anot her state citizens of different states citizens of the same state claiming land under grants of different states and between state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizens or subjects7 the cases in the first group and any other cases where st ate is party are to be heard directly by the supreme court under the courts original jurisdiction8 the remaining cases in the second group along with the courts previously noted substantive authority are heard under the court s appellate jurisdiction9 it is important to note that the courts appellate jurisdiction unlike its original jurisdiction is subject to exceptions nd under such regulations as congress shallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs4 10 in

appears to contain authority to create state courts martin v hunters lessee 14 us 304 331 1816 13 see richard fallon daniel meltzer david shapiro supra note 8 at 636 644 14 it should be noted that unlike the limiting of federal court jurisdiction that the limiting of state court jurisdiction to consider federal constitutional issues is well establishedmake10 it should also be noted however that the constitution provides for jurisdiction in all cases under its substa ntive jurisdiction or under the first group of cases based on parties as will be discussed later this has led some commentators to suggest that while congress has the power to limit the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction that at least some cases must be considered by some federal court whether it be the supreme c ourt or an inferior court the supremacy clause found in article vi provides that the judges in every state are bound to follow the united states constitution and appli cable federal law11 the congress does not appear to have the authority to establish state courts of competent jurisdiction12 however once such state courts exist the congress can endow them with concurrent power to consider certain cas concerning federal law when state court has rendered decision on an issue of federal law and final determination has been made by the highest court in that state then that case may generally be appealed to the supreme court13 thus state court cases can also fall under the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction the question arises however precisely how the judicial power should be allocated between the various courts and what sort of limitations can be implemented on the combined court systems by congress while there have been many proposals to vary fede ral court jurisdiction in or der to affect particular judicial result few have pa ssed and even fewer have b een subjected to scrutiny by the courts further those laws that did pass varied from modern proposals thus the answer to these complex questions must be ascertained by reference to constitutional text historical practice limited set of case law and scholarly commentary federal district courts and courts of appeal the in ferior federal courts are authorized to consider most questions of federal statutory and constitutional law with appeal to the supreme court in genera l most modern courtstripping proposals appear to be intended to increase state court involvement in constitutional cases by decreasing federal court invol vement there are at least three possible variations to these proposals14 first there are

cases in the state courts without app eal to the supreme court16 third the congress might act to exclude any judicial review over particular class of constitutional cases from any court whether state or federal it should be noted that there are also proposals not examined in depth here that would limit the methods available to the va rious courts to remedy constitutional injury17 to the extent that these remedy limitations actually prevent the vindication of established constitutional injury they w ould appear to fall under the same category as proposals that limit the jurisdiction of pa rticular courts thus for instance the amendment noted above which would prohib it the use of funds for enforcement of particular district court decision18 would seem likely to be analyzed similarly to an amendment limiting lower court jurisdiction over constitutional cases however in situations where other sufficient remedies are left unchanged court might determine that the constitutional right could be effectuated despite limits on particular remedy19 analysis as noted previously the congress consid ers and passes many laws that are exercises of its control over judicial power under article iii there appears however to be direct legislative precedent for the types of courtstripping proposals noted above while federal court jurisdiction or remedies have occasionally been varied by congress to affect particular judicial result the associated case law is of only limited applicability to the modern proposals thus an analysis of these proposals will principally c oncern textual analysis of the extent and limit ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs6 20 see notes 5057 and accompanying text supra 21 1 f arrand the records of the federal convention 124 1911congresss power under article iii scholarly discussion on that subject and related case law it should be noted however that various commentators have suggested that the constitutional problems with courtstripping provisions are more fundamental than an analysis of congress article iii powers20 the most significant issue is whether congress by attempting to change constitutional law by statute rather than constitutional amendment is in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers further when specific constitutional rights are singled out for disparate treatment question arises as to whether that class of litigants is being treated in manner inconsistent with the equal protection clause ultimately an evaluation of particular piece of courtstripping legislation may vary depending on what jurisdiction remedies or procedures are affected and what ultimate impact this is likely to have on the specified constitutional rights limiting consideration of specific constitutional issues to state courts subject to supreme court review the argument has been made that because the congress has the authority to decide whether or not to create inferior federal courts it also has authority to determine which issues these courts may consider there appears to be significant historical support for this position while the establishment of federal supreme court was agreed upon early in the cons titutional convention the establishment of inferior federal courts wa s not foregone conclusion at one point it was proposed that the convention eliminate provision blishing such inferior courts this proposal would have had state tribunals c onsider most federal cases while providing supreme court review in order to enforce national rights and ensure uniformity of judgments21 james madison opposed the motion to liminate lower federal courts arguing that such decentralized system would result in an oppressive number of appeals and would subject federal law to the local biases of state judges compromise resolution proposed by madison and others was agreed to whereby the congress would be allowed but not comp elled to create courts inferior to the supreme court the new plan referred to as the madis onian compromise was ultimately adopted thus article iii provides that congress has the power to create courts inferior to the supreme court but that it need not exercise it once the congress has agreed to the crea tion of inferior courts however the question then arises as to whether the congress must grant these courts the full extent of the jurisdiction contemplated by article iii some commentators have argued that the very nature of the madisonian comp romise described above plainly allowed the establishment of federal courts with something less than the full judicial powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs7 22 paul bator congressional power over the juri sdiction of the federal court 27 vill l rev 1030 1031 1982 23 14 us 1 wheat 304 1816 24 14 us at 330331 25

hunters lessee23 however suggested that the constitution requires that if inferior courts are established there are some aspects of the judicial power which the congress may not abrogate for instance justice story argued that the congress would need to vest inferior courts with jurisdiction to hear cases that are not amenable to state court jurisdiction24 thus arguably constitutional i ssue which arose under law within the exclusive federal jurisdiction25 would need to be deci ded by federal court there is significant histor ical precedent however fo r the proposition that there is requirement that all jurisdiction that c ould be vested in the federal courts should be so vested for instance the firs t judiciary act implemented under the constitution the judiciary act of 1789 is consid ered to be an indicator of the original understanding of th article iii powers that act however falls short of having implemented all of the judicial powers which were specified under article iii for instance the act did not provide jurisdiction for the inferior federal courts to consider cases arising under federal law or the constitution although the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction did extend to such cases when they originated in state courts its review was limited to where claimed statutory or constitutional right had been denied by the court below26 there is also supreme court precedent that holds that the congress need not vest the lower courts with all jurisdiction authorized by article iii in sheldon v sill27 the court was asked to evaluate whether the congress need grant federal circuit court jurisdiction in case where di versity jurisdiction based on parties being from different states had b een manufactured by assignment of mortgage to person in another state the court held that congress having the power to establish the courts must define their respective jurisdictions28 the court further indicated that congress may withhold from any court of its creation jurisdiction of any of the enumerated controversies so that statute which does prescribe the limits of their jurisdiction cannot be in conflict with the constituti on unless it confers powers not enumerated therein29 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs8 30 14 us 1 wheat 304 1816 31 see note 7 supraas noted earlier the supremacy clause provides that state courts are bound to follow the united states constitution so that state courts which have cases within their jurisdiction are required to consider and decide such constitutional issues as they arise the congress does not have the authority to establish the jurisdiction of state courts and consequen tly those court stripping proposals that relate to the inferior federal courts do not generally specify that state courts will become the primary courts for vindication of specified constitutional rights to the extent however that state courts provide forum for the complete vindication of constitutional rights then concerns about re moval of such issues from federal court are diminished however as will be addressed later critics maintain that such court stripping proposals may suffer fro m other constitutional defects limiting consideration of specific constitutional issues to state courts with supreme court review this scenario requires evaluation of two aspects of article iii the power of congress to allocate federal judicial pow er and the power of congress to create exceptions to the supreme courts ppellate jurisdiction under the exceptions clause as to the former the question arises as to whether congress need allocate any of the authorities delineated in article iii to the federal courts bey ond cases decided under the original jurisdicti on of the supreme court in martin v hunters lessee30 justice story noted that the constitution provides that the judicial power shall be vested in the supreme court or in the such inferior courts as are created his opinion thus asserted that it is the duty of congress to vest the whole judicial power where it is so directed either in the supreme court or in the inferior courts justice story did however note that the text of the constitution suggests some limits to the requirement that the whole judicial power shall vest this limit arises from the previously noted fact that some types of federal judicial power are extended by the text of the constitution to all such cases ie cases arising under either the constitution federal law treat admiralty or ma ritime jurisdiction or cases affecting an ambassador or other public ministers or consuls31 the vesting of other types of cases cited in article iii such as cases between c itizens of different states is not so characterized and thus arguably congress would have discretion whether or not to establish thes powers in the federal courts under this textual analysis the powe r to consider cases concerning the constitution must be vested in some federa l court thus according to justice story statute limiting consideration of specific constitutional issues to state courts with supreme court review would be unconstitutional this analysis however has attracted large amounts of scholarly atten tion and there is significant dispute over justice storys conclusion on one hand at least one commentator asserts that not only is this theory supported by analysis of the text of the constitution but that it is also consistent with juri sdictional limitations found in th judiciary act of 1789 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs9 32 akhil amar neofederalist view of article iii

1869subsequent case law32 other commentators however have taken issue with this analysis33 absent additional court precedent on this point resolution of this scholarly debate would be largely speculative the second issue whether supreme court review ove r category of cases can be limited by legislation under the exceptions clause has been addressed to some extent by the supreme court in ex parte mccardle34 in ex parte mccardle the congress had authorized federa l judges to issue writs of habeas corpus mccardle the editor of the vicksburg times was arrested by federal military authorities on the basis of various editorials published in hi s newspaper and charged with disturbing the peace libel incitement and impedin g reconstruction cl aiming constitutional infirmities with his case mccardle sought and was denied writ of habeas corpus in an inferior federal court decision wh ich he then appealed to the supreme court during the pendency of that appeal however in an apparent attempt to prevent the supreme court from hearing the appeal the congress repealed the jurisdiction of the supreme court to hear appeals from habeas corpus decisions in mccardle the congress purported to be acting under its authority under article iii to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the court in reviewing the statute repealing the supreme courts jurisdiction the court noted that it was not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature we can only examine its power under the constitution and the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words35 consequently the supreme court accepted the withdrawal of jurisdiction over the defendants case and dismissed the appeal the case of ex parte mccardle while it made clear the authority of the congress to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court does not appear to answer the question as to whether all supreme court review of constitutional issue can be eliminated the court specifically noted that mccardle had other avenues of review to challenge the constitutionality of his arrest apart from appellate review name ly the invocation of habeas corpus directly by the supreme court36 consequently unlike the instant proposals the supreme court in mccardle maintained the ability to otherwise cons ider the underlying constitutional issues being raised in sum there is direct court preceden t on this issue and little or consensus among scholars the practical conseque nces of enacting these proposals is also unclear

on any issue where supreme court review was precluded arguments have been made th at such result would undercut the intention of the founding fathers to establish uniform federal constitutional scheme38 prohibiting any court state or federal from considering specific consti tutional issue series of lower federal court decisions seems to indicate that in most cases some forum must be provided for the vindication of constitutional rights for instance in 1946 series of supreme court decisions39 under the fair labor standards act of 193840 exposed employers to 5 billion dollars in damages and the united states itself was threatened with liability for over 15 billion dollars subsequently the congress enacted the portal to portal act of 194741 which limited the jurisdiction of any court state or federal to impose liability or impose punishment with respect to such liabilities although the act was upheld by series of federal district courts nd courts of appeals most of the courts disregarded the purported jurisdictional limits and decided the case on the merits as one court noted while congress has the undoubted power to give withhold or restrict the jurisdiction of courts other than the suprem court it must not exercise that power as to deprive any person of lif liberty or property without due process or just compensation 42 the court has also construed other similar statutes narrowly so as to avoid serious constitutional questions that would arise if judicial forum for constitutional claim existed43 the supreme court has not directly ddressed whether there needs to be judicial forum to vindicate all constitutional rights justice scalia has pointed out that there are particular cases such as political questions cases where all constitutional review is in effect precluded44 other commentators point to sovereign immunity and the ability of the government to limit the remedies available to plaintiffs45 however the court has in cases involving particul ar

constitutional violation has been alleged the question arises as to whether the congress can limit the remedies available to prevailing litigants various such proposals have been made ch as the previously noted amendment limiting funds available to the courts for forcement of particular court decision47 while the congress would certainly be within its authority to regulate certain aspects of remedy it is not at all clear that congress could eliminate all remedies available to court48 or eliminate such remedies as would make the vindication of constitutional right meaningless49 arguably laws that had such an effect would be analyzed by court as having the same impact as limiting courts jurisdiction and thus would be interprete d under the same analysis laws intended to influence constitutional results generally finally there is more general constitutional concern that would apply to proposals in all of the above categories and that is the extent that congress is prohibited from exercising powers allocated to another branch of government50 in united states v klein 51 the congress passed law design ed to frustrate finding of the supreme court as to the effect of presidential pardon the court struck down the law essentially holding that the congress had an illegitimate purpose in passage of the law the language of the pr oviso shows plainly that it does not intend to withhold appellate jurisdiction except as means to an end its great and controlling purpose is to deny to pardons granted by th president the effect which this court had adjudged them to have it seems to us that this is not an exercise of the acknowledged power of cong ress to make exceptions nd prescribe regulations tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs12 52 80 us at 146 the court also

david l shapiro supra note 8 at 351354the appellate power52 similarly law which was specifically intended to limit the ability of court to adjudicate or remedy constitutional violation could violate the doctrine of separation of powers as providing relief from unconstitutional acts is judicial branch function53 constitutional considerations other than separation of powers could also be at issue if proposed legislati on was intended to significan tly burden particular group or to impair fundamental right it is gene rally agreed that law that limited federal courts power for an illegitimate constituti onal purpose could run afoul of provisions of the constitution apart from article iii for instance law which limited access to the judicial system based on membership in suspect class would appear to violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment54 but what if members of group being discriminated against were not defined by membership in suspect class but instead by their status as plaintiffs in particular type of constitutional cases in general article iii allows the congress to provide different legal proce dural rules for different types of cases if there is rational reason to do so55 however even rational basis analysis of such disparate treatment might not be met if the court fi nds the argument put forward for burdening particular class of cases is illegitimate56 as mere disagreement with the results reached by the federal courts in prior cas regarding the constitution may not be legitimate legislative ju stification alternativ justifications for such laws would need to be developed the level of burden imposed by such proposals might also be factor in evaluating their constitutionality for instance requiring litigants in particular federal constitutional cases to pursue their cases in state courts may not represent significant burden57 and thus might require less legi slative justification however more serious attempts to impair either the burden of litigation or the remedies available might well require the establishment of more significant governmental interest before such law could be enforcedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32171crs13 conclusion congresss authority to limit the jurisdiction of inferior federal courts appears relatively broad so that limiting the jurisdiction of these courts to consider particular constitutional cases is arguably within its article iii authority more serious question is whether congress could eliminate review of constitutional matters by both inferior courts and the supreme court finally elimination of review of constitutional issues by any court state or federal seems the least likely to survive constitutional scrutiny it should be noted however that various commentators have suggested that any limitation of jurisdiction for particular class of constitutional cases raises questions regarding both the separation of powers doc trine and the equal protection clause there appears however to be direct legislative or judicial precedent for modern courtstripping proposals wh ile federal court jurisdiction or remedies have been otherwise varied by congress to affect pa rticular judicial re sult few have passed and even fewer have been subjected to scrutiny by the federal courts in modern times thus resolution of these broader stions would depend on further judicial developments in this area
