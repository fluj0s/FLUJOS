which federal court may review the legality of an individuals incarceration it is most often the stage of the criminal appellate process that follows direct appeal and any available state collateral review the law in the area is an intricate weave of statute and case law current federal law operates under the premise that with rare exceptions prisoners challenging the legality of the procedures by which they were tried or sentenced get one bite of the apple relief for state prisoners is only available if the state courts have ignored or rejected their valid claims and there are strict time limits within which they may petition the federal courts for relief moreover prisoner relying upon novel interpretation of law must succeed on direct appeal federal habeas review may not be used to establish or claim the benefits of new rule expedited federal habeas procedures are available in the case of state death row inmates if the state has provided an approved level of appointed counsel the supreme court has held that congress enjoys considerable authority to limit but not to extinguish access to the writ this report is available in an abridged version as crs report rs22432 federal

intricate weave of statute and case law whose reach has flowed and ebbed over time prior to enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa the most recent substantial recasting of federal habeas law and the supreme court cases that immediately preceded it it was said that federal habeas was the most controversial and friction producing issue in the relation between federal and state courts commentators were critical federal judges were unhappy state courts resented it and prisoners thrived on it as form of occupational therapy 1 the aedpa was passed and yet the debate goes on judges academics and political figures regularly urge that the boundaries for federal habeas be readjusted some would make it more readily available others would limit access to it debate has been most intense in capital punishment cases there unlike most other cases the decisions of the state courts stand unexecuted while they await completion of federal habeas corpus proceedings there unlike most other cases an erroneously executed sentence is beyond any semblance of correction or compensation the aedpa offers states expeditious habeas procedures in capital cases certain circumstances 2 state has yet been able to effectively qualify and as consequence congress adjusted the method of determining qualification in the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act3 congress has also modified the availability of habeas for detainees at guantanamo bay cuba4 in manner which provides the supreme court with an opportunity to further explain the scope of congressional

writs many of which have survived to this day the writs were series of written order forms issued by the court in the name of the king commanding the individual to whom they were addressed to return

example subpoena ad testificandum was command to return the writ to the court at specified time and place sub poena that is under penalty for failure to comply and ad testificandum that is for the purpose of testifying just as the writs of subpoena have been shortened in common parlance to subpoena so references to the several writs of habeas corpus were shortened the habeas corpus writs were all issued by the courts in the name of the king and addressed to one of the kings officials or lower court the writs commanded the officers of the crown to appear before the court with the corpus body of an individual named in the writ whom habeas you have or you are holding for the purpose stated in the writ thus for instance the writ of habeas corpora juratorum commanded the sheriff to appear before the court having with him or holding the bodies of potential jurors 6 by the colonial period habeas corpus had come to be understood as those writs available to prisoner held without trial or bail or pursuant to the order of court without jurisdiction ordering his jailer to appear with the prisoner before court of general jurisdiction and to justify the confinement7 6 other habeas corpus writs included 1 habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum writ for bringing an accused from different c ounty into court in the place where an offense had been committed for purposes of trial or more lite rally to return holding the body for purposes of deliberation and receipt of decision 2 habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum writ of court of superior jurisdiction to custodian to return with the body being held in confinement pursuant to the order of lower court for purposes of receiving the courts decision and of doing what the court instructed with the prisoner 3 habeas corpus ad faciendum subjiciendum et recipiendum or more simply habeas corpus ad subjiciendum writ ordering custodian to return with prisoner for the purposes of submitting the question of confinement to the court of receiving its decision and of doing what the court instructed with the prisoner 4 habeas corpus ad prosequendum writ ordering return with prisoner for the purpose prosecuting him before the court 5 habeas corpus ad respondendum writ ordering return to court of superior jurisdiction of body under the jurisdiction of lower court for purposes of allowing the individual to respond with respect to matters under consideration in the high tribunal 6habeas corpus ad satisfaciendum writ ordering return with the body of prisoner for satisfaction or execution of judgment of the issuing court 7 habeas corpus ad testificandum writ ordering return with the body of prisoner for the purposes of testifying and 8 habeas corpus cum causa writ ordering return with the body of

of the writ8 the drafters of the united states constitution after enumerating the powers of congress inserted the limitation that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it9 the act that created the federal court system empowered federal judges to issues writs of habeas corpus and other writs not specially provided for by statute which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions and to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment 10 the power was limited however in that writs of habeas corpus shall in case extend to prisoners in gaol unless where they are in custody under or by colour of the authority of the united states or are committed for trial before some court of the same or are necessary to be brought into court to testify11 the supreme court further clarified federal habeas corpus law when in ex parte bollman 8 us4 cranch 75 1807 it held that the power of the federal courts to issue the writ was limited to the authority vested in them by statute the courts had common law or inherent authority to issue writs of habeas corpus while the comm on law might provide an understanding of the dimensions of the writ the power to issue it depended upon and was limited by the authority which congress by statute vested in the courts id at 93 consistent with the common law the writ was available to those confined by federal officials without trial or admission to bail but was not available to contest the validity of confinement pursuant to conviction by federal court of competent jurisdiction even one whose judgment was in error 12 congress expanded the authority it had given the federal courts in response to the anticipated state arrest of federal officers attempting to enforce an unpopular tariff in 1833 and again in 1842 in response to british protest over the american trial of one of its nationals the writ was made available to state prisoners held because of any act done or omitted to be done in pursuance of law of the united states13 and to state prisoners who were foreign nationals

authorizing its issuance in all cases state or fe deral where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution or of any treaty or law of the united states 16 originally habeas corpus permitted collateral attack upon prisoners conviction only if the sentencing court lacked subject matter jurisdiction shortly after 1867 however the supreme court began to recognize growing number of circumstances where courts were said to have acted beyond their jurisdiction because some constitutional violation had extinguished or voided their jurisdiction17 14 that either of the justices of the supreme court of the united states or judge of any district court of the united states in which prisoner is confined in addition to the authority already conferred by law shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus in all cases of any prisoner or prisoners in jail or confinement where he she or they being subjects or citizens of foreign state and domiciled therein shall be committed or confined or in custody under or by any authority or law or process founded thereof of the united states or of any one of them for or on account of any act done or omitted under

courts within their respective jurisdictions in addition to the authority already c onferred by law shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution or of any treaty or law of the united states and it shall be lawful for such person so restrained of his or her liberty to apply to either of said justices or judges for writ of habeas co rpus which application shall be in writing and verified by affidavit and shall set forth the facts concerning the detention of the party applying in whose custody he or she is detained and by virtue of what claim or authority if known and the said justice or judge to whom such application shall be made shall forthwith award writ of habeas corpus unless it shall appear from the petition itself that the party is not deprived of his or her liberty in contravention of the constitution or laws of the united states 14 stat 38586 1867 at the same time congress modified and codified much of the procedure associated with the writ including an appellate provision that was soon thereafter repealed 15 stat 44 1868 see ex parte mccardle 74 us 7 wall 506

most were confined under state convictions and relatively few of the rights guaranteed by the constitution were thought to apply against the states even when constitutional claim was available state prisoners could not be granted federal habeas relief until all possibility of state judicial relief trial appellate and postconviction had been exhausted18 g7g139g139g561g138g151g141g561g8g149g152g160g561 eventually two developments stimulated new growth first the application of jurisdictional tests proved cumbersome and somewhat artificial nd was discarded in favor of more generous standard later the explosion in the breadth of due process and in the extent of its application to the states multiplied the instances when state prisoner might find relief in federal habeas corpus evolution began with two cases which reached the court early in the last century and in which petitioners claimed that mob rule rather than due process of law led to their convictions and death sentences the court in frank v mangum 237 us 309 1915 denied the writ because franks claim had already been heard and rejected as part of the state appellate process the court did suggest however that state court might lose jurisdiction by virtue of substantial procedural defect such as mob domination of the trial process and that federal habeas relief would be available to anyone convicted as consequence of the defect it also indicated that the question of whether relief should be granted was not to be resolved solely by examination of the trial court record as had historically been the case but upon federal court consideration of the entire judicial process which predated the petition 19 if frank had been intended as warning it appears to have been in vain for soon thereafter the court confronted yet another conviction allegedly secured by mob intervention20 in spite of the fact that the state appellate courts had already heard and denied the petitioners claims the court ordered the lower federal court in which relief had been initially sought to make its own determination of the validity of petitioners claims of procedural defect soon thereafter it became clear that federal habeas was not limited to instances of mob intervention or other external contaminants of the judicial process it reached deficiencies from within the process which rendered the process so unfair as to result in loss of life or liberty without due process of law whether they took the form of prosecutors knowing use of perjured testimony and suppression of evidence that would impeach it 21 or of denial of the assistance of counsel in criminal prosecutions22 or of confessions or guilty pleas secured by government coercion23 18 ex parte royall 117 us 241 1886 ex parte fonda 117 us 516 1886 pepke v cronan 155 us 100 1894 19 it results that under the federal habeas sections cited prisoner in custody pursuant to the final judgment of state court of criminal jurisdiction may have judicial inqu iry in court of the united states into the very truth and substance of the causes of his detention although it may become necessary to look behind and

constitutional violation void the jurisdiction of the trial court before federal habeas relief could be considered24 federal judges soon complained that federal prisoner abuses of habeas had become legion25 congress responded by incorporating into the 1948 revision of the judicial code the first major revision of the federal habeas statute since 186726 state courts exerted little pressure for revision of the federal habeas statute in 1948 although habeas relief had been available to state prisoners by statute since 1867 and subsequent decisions seemed to invite access the hospitality that federal habeas extended to state convicts with due process and other federal constitutional claims had not yet become apparent this all changed over the next two decades as noted earlier some of the change was attributable to expansive supreme court interpretations of the procedural guarantees of the bill of rights and of the extent to which those guarantees were binding upon the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment 27 federal habeas was the vehicle used to carry much of the due process expansion to the states after brown v allen 344 us 443 195328 there was little doubt that the federal habeas corpus statute afforded relief to state prisoners whose convictions were tainted by constitutional violations both those violations that would void state court jurisdiction and those that would not the majority position in brown on the impact of the courts denials of certiorari contributed to the expansion of federal habeas as well when the court refused to review state case by denying certiorari it thereby left the decision of the states high court intact if this should be read as the courts endorsement of the states disposal of constitutional issues as part of the normal appellate process it would seem to chill any subsequent lower federal court reconsideration of those issues under habeas brown precludes such result29 24 id at 104105 see also

proper the views of the court on these questions may thus be drawn from the two opinions jointly 344 us at 497 frankfurter j 29 commentators suggested in fact that the court intended the denial of

had declined to hear the case conclusions on the courts view of the issues raised could be drawn from its declinations moreover in subsequent habeas proceedings the lower federal courts were not bound by state resolution of federal constitutional issues even if the state courts had given applicants for the writ full and fair hearing on the very same issues raised on habeas but the requirement to exhaust state remedies remained brown held that state prisoner seeking habeas relief could not satisfy the requirement merely by showing that remedy once open to him had been lost by his own inaction30 the court eased the exhaustion restriction considerably in fay v noia 372 us 391 1963 in which it held that federal courts were permitted but not required to deny habeas for an intentional failure to exhaust state remedies31 at the same time it articulated circumstances under which the evidentiary hearing found permissible in brown would be mandatory townsend v sain 372 us 293 196332 relaxation of the default bar coupled with expansion of the circumstances under which constitutional issues might be reconsidered forecast the possibility of repetitious habeas applications and of lower court efforts to discourage repetition the court and congress anticipated and combined to control such eventualities within weeks of noia and townsend the court announced the rule applicable for federal prisoners33 controlling weight may be given to denial of prior application for federal habeas corpus relief only if 1 the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined

remedy in the absence of some interference or incapacity bars federal habeas corpus the state requires that the applicant exhaust available state remedies to show that the time was passed for appeal without an appeal by the prisoner is not enough to demonstrate the absence of state remedy and to empower the federal district court to issue the writ 344 us at 487 31 we therefore hold that the federal habeas corpus judge may in his discretion deny relief to an applicant who has deliberately bypassed the orderly procedure of the state courts and in so doing has forfeited his state court remedies but we wish to make very clear that this grant of discretion is not to be interpreted as permission to introduce legal fictions into federal habeas corpus if habeas applicant after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts whether for strategic tactical or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate bypassing of state procedures then it is open to the federal court in habeas to deny him all relief if the state courts refused to entertain his federal claims on the meritsthough of course only after the federal court has satisfied itself by holding hearing or by some other means of the facts bearing upon the applicants default

decisions grounded in the values of respect for the work of state courts and finality in the process of trial and review thus state prisoners who fail to afford state courts an opportunity to correct constitutional defects are barred from raisin g them for the first time in federal habeas in the absence of justification34 nor may they scatter their habeas claims in series of successive petitions35 those who plead guilty and thereby waive as matter of state law any constitutional claims may not use federal habeas to revive them36 and state prisoners may not employ federal habeas as means to

that unlike the defendants serving their imprisonment whose only incentive to apply for collateral review is the small chance that they will be released defendants on death row have very good reason to bring as many habeas corpus proceedings as the law allows th time these reviews take literally keeps the death row defendants alive and from their point of view the investment of time and energy for legal proceedings is very worthwhile of course from our point of view it can be argued that if these defendants know there is substance in their claims they should withdraw their suits and take their punishment unfortunately this kind of selfsacrifice is asking too much of anyone let alone the kinds of people who have committed the types of crimes which have resulted in their being sentenced to death moreover the reversal rate in capital cases both on direct appeal and on postconviction relief is far greater than that of noncapital even murder cases partly this results from the greater complexity of capital cases since courts are especially careful in these cases to make sure the law is followed and there is doubt that the ambivalence of the courts toward the death penalty plays part in this proce ss moreover capital cases being harder fought tend to raise more issues upon which the defense can appeal and provide more incentive to make sure they are thoroughly briefed and argued moreover in capital cases the appellate courts are less willing to conclude that they should not disturb the verdict on the grounds that on the whole justice was done in capital cases more than

passage of the aedpa state court interpretations or applications of federal law were not binding in subsequent federal habeas proceedings49 the debate that led to passage was marked by complaints of delay and wasted judicial resources countered by the contention that federal judges should decide federal law50 out of deference to state courts and to eliminate unnecessary delay the aedpa bars federal habeas relief on claim already passed upon by state court unless the adjudication of the claim 1 resulted in decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 2 resulted in decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding 28 usc 2254d for purposes of section 2254 an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court occurs when state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the courts decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the case before it 51 moreover the court has said on several occasions the question before the federal courts when they are confronted with challenged state court application of supreme court recognized principle is not whethe r the federal courts consider the application incorrect but whether the application is objectively unreasonable52 on the other hand for purposes of section 2254d1 decision is contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court if it applies rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme courts cases or if it confronts set of facts that is 49 brown v allen 344 us 443 463 1953 50

exhaustion the deference extended to state courts reaches not only their decisions but the opportunity to render decisions arising within the cases before them state prisoners were once required to exhaust the opportunities for state remedial action before federal habeas relief could be granted 28 usc 2254bc 1994 ed this exhaustion doctrine is principally designed to protect the state courts role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings under our federal system the federal and state courts are equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the constitution ex parte royall 117 us 241 251 1886 because it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for federal district court to upset state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct constitutional violation federal courts apply the doctrine of comity which teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereign with concurrent powers and already cognizant of the litigation have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter darr v burford 339 us 200 204 1950 rigorously enforced total exhaustion rule encourages state prisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts thus giving those courts the first opportunity to review all claims of constitutional error as the number of prisoners who exhaust all of their federal claims increases state courts may become increasingly familiar with and hospitable toward federal constitutional claims equally important federal claims that have been fully exhausted in state courts will more often be accompanied by complete factual record to aid the federal courts in their review rose v lundy 455 us 509 51819 1982 the aedpa

questions may be resolved more quickly if state prisoners initially bring their claims to state courts in some cases where state prisoner has mistakenly first sought relief in federal court operation

the waste of state and fede ral resources that now result when prisoner presenting hopeless petition to federal court is sent back to the state courts to exhaust state remedies it will also help avoid potentially burdensome and protracted inquiries as to whether state remedies have been exhausted in cases in which it is easier and quicker to reach negative termination of the merits of petition the act further provides that state shall not be deemed to have waived the exhaustion requirement or be estopped from reliance on the requirement unless it waives the requirement expressly through counsel this provision accords appropriate recognition to the important interests in comity that are implicated by the ex haustion requirement in cases in which relief maybe granted this provision is designed to disapprove those decisions which have deemed states to have waived the exhaustion requirement or barred them from relying on it in circumstances other than where the state has expressly waived the

assert claims unrelated in time and type to those found in the original petition do not relate back and are time barred72 state may waive the statute of limitations defense but its intent to do so must be clear and not simply the product of mathematical miscalculation73 the statute of limitations provisions initially presented novel problem for district courts faced with mixed petitions of exhausted and unexhausted claims before the aedpa district courts could not adjudicate mixed petitions but were required to first give state courts the opportunity to resolve the exhausted claims74 petitioners could then return to habeas for adjudication of any remaining exhausted claims as result of the interplay between aedpas 1year statute of limitations and lundy s dismissal requirement petitioners who come to federal court with mixed petitions run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims if petitioner files timely but mixed petition in federal district court and the district court dismisses it under lundy after the limitations period has expired this will likely mean the termination of any federal review75 nevertheless

court moreover even if petitioner had good cause for that failure the district court would abuse its discretion if it were to grant him stay when his unexhausted claims are plainly meritless and if petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay the district court shou ld not grant him stay on the other hand it likely would be an abuse of discretion for district court to deny stay and to dismiss mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious and there is not indication that the petitioner

v carrier supra in order the meet this actually innocent standard the prisoner must show that it is more likely than not that reasonable juror would convict him98 when the petitioner challenges his capital sentence rather than his conviction he must show by clear and convincing evidence that but for the constitutional error reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death

innocence wi thout some procedural error of constitutional magnitude permitted habeas relief chief justice rehnquist author of the opinion for the court finessed the issue by assuming without deciding that at some quantum of evidence of defendants innocence the constitution w ould rebel against his or her execution101 short of that point and cognizant of the availability of executive clemency newly discovered evidence of the factual innocence of convicted petitioner unrelated to any independent constitutional error does not warrant habeas relief102 96 reed v ross 468 us 1 16 1984 97 amadeo v

innocence made after trial woul d render the execution of defendant unconstitutional and warrant federal habeas relief if there were state avenue open to process such claim but because of the very disruptive effect that entertaining claims of actual innocence would have on the need for finality in capital cases and the enormous burden that having to retry cases based on often stale evidence would place on the states the threshold showing of such an assumed right would necessarily be ex traordinarily high the showing made by petitioner in this case falls far short of any such threshold 506 us at 417 102 claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence have never been held to state ground for federal habeas relief absent an independent constitutional violation occurring in the underlying state criminal proceeding where newly discovered evidence is alleged in habeas application evidence which could not reasonably have been presented to the state trier of fact the federal court must grant an evidentiary hearing of course such evidence must bear upon the constitutionality of the applicants detention the existence merely of newly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of state prisoner is not gr ound for relief on federal habeas corpus petitioner in this case is simply not entitled to habeas re lief based on the reasoning of this line of cases ie sawyer v whitley and other cases involving default for he does not seek excusal of procedural error so that he may bring an independent constitutional claim challenging his conviction or sentence but rather argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because newly discovered evidence shows that his conviction is factually incorrect the f undamental miscarriage of justice exception is available only where

federal habeas to raise novel legal issues by restricting for habeas purposes the retroactive application of the supreme courts decisions prior to teague when the court announced new rule concerning constitutional requirements binding in state criminal procedure cases it employed one of two approaches in some cases it simultaneously announced whether the new rule was to have retroactive or prospective applications in others it postponed that decision until subsequent case in either instance the court employed test first articulated in linkletter v walker 381 us 618 1965 to determine whether new rule should be applied retroactively under the test the court considered the purpose to be served by the new standards b the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards and c the effect on the administration of justice of retroactive application of the new standards 105 in teague the court adopted different approach borrowing from position espoused earlier by justice harlan106 under this view habeas is perceived as deterrent used to encourage state and lower federal courts to adhere to constitutional standards therefore novel constitutional interpretation or new rule should not be applied retroactively during federal habeas review of state convictions since state courts could only be expected to defer to those rules in existence when their consideration became final furthermore since it would be unfair to grant habeas continued of factual innocence 506 us at 400 404 quoting and adding emphasis to townsend v sain 372 us 293 317

retroactively to others similarly situated plurality of the court held that habeas corpus cannot be used as vehicle to create new constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants on collateral review under one of the two exceptions where retroactive application is permitted 489 us at 316 thus under teague and its companion penry v lynaugh 492 us 302 1989 new rule cannot be sought through federal habeas and new rule may only be applied retroactively for the benefit of habeas petitioners when 1 the new interpretation places certain kinds of primary private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe 489 us at 307 or places certain category of punishment for class of defendants because of their status or offense beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe 492 us at 329 or 2 the new interpretation significantly improves the preexisting fact finding procedures which implicate the fundamental fairness of the trial and without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished 489 us at 31213 in order to constitute new interpretation or new rule for purposes of the exceptions the interpretation must break new ground or impose new obligation on the states or federal government or to put it differently case announces new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendants conviction became final 489 us at 301 emphasis of the court decision may announce new rule for purposes of teague even if the court states its decision is dictated by precedent as long as split in the lower courts or some other source of authority provides ground upon which different outcome might reasonably have been anticipated 107 for the teague rule serves to validate reasonable goodfaith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions 108 the court has more recently indicated that the rules covered in the first exception the exception for rules that place certain conduct beyond proscriptive reach are more accurately characterized as substantive rather than procedural rules and thus not subject to the teague rule from the beginning109 the second exception available to new watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding like gideon v wainwright 372 us 335 1963 does not extend to cases less indispensible to fundamental fairness than gideon 110 the court observed in beard v banks that it has yet to rule on case that satisfied this second teague exception111 107 butler v mckellar 494 us 407 415 1990 108 sawyer v smith 497 us 227

the government moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that appeal had been expressly excluded in cases involving confederate sympathize rs held in military custody the court denied the motion because the military custody exception applied only to the expansion of habeas afforded by the 1867 act while mccardle called upon the preexisting habeas authority of the judiciary act of 1789 and set the case for argument ex parte mccardle 73 us6 wall 318 1868 but before the case could be decided on its merits congress repealed the law vesting appellate jurisdiction in the court 118 its jurisdiction to decide the appeal having been withdrawn the court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction ex parte mccardle 74 us7 wall 506 1868 in doing so however the court made it clear that the loss of its jurisdiction to hear appeals in habeas cases did not mean the loss of its ability to review lower court habeas decisions altogether119 the review available prior to the 1867 act remained available just as the court had described in its earlier mccardle case but though the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over judgments of inferior tribunals was not unknown to the practice of this court before the act of 1867 it was attended by some inconvenience and embarrassment it was necessary to use the writ of certiorari in addition to the writ of habeas corpus and there was

appellate jurisdiction vested in the court by the 1867 act the 1868 act did not repeal any of the provisions of the judiciary act of 1789 the courts earlier authority to review habeas cases from the lower federal courts through writs of habeas corpus aided by writs of certiorari remained available ex parte yerger 75 us8 wall 85 1869 the question as to the scope of congress control over courts appellate jurisdiction in habeas cases surfaced again when prisoner challenged the aedpas habeas limitations in felker v turpin 518 us 651 1996 in particular felker argued that the provisions of 28 usc 2244b3e which declared the appellate court determination of whether to authorize second or successive habeas petition was neither appealable nor subject to petition for rehearing or for writ of certiorari as before the court took offense to the limitation of habeas appellate jurisdiction since the aedpa does not repeal the courts authority to entertain petition for habeas corpus there can be plausible argument that the act has deprived this court of appellate jurisdiction in violation of article iii 2 518 u s at 66162 review remained possible under the original writ of habeas corpus after mccardle and yerger congress restored the courts jurisdiction to review habeas cases under less cumbersome appellate procedures in 1885 23 stat 437 once congress reopened more normal means of supreme court review in habeas cases recourse to the original writ of habeas corpus in the supreme court described in mccardle and yerger had been infrequent and rarely successful seen only as burdensome way station of the unartful and ill advised its best known chronicler urged its effective abandonment 121 yet it offered the court in felker precisely what it supplied in mccardle and yerger means of preserving supreme court review under circumstan ces where congress rather clearly intended to deny that possibility without forcing the court to address the question of whether congress efforts exceed its constitutional authority the supreme court in an opinion by chief justice rehnquist declared that although the act does impose new conditions on the courts authority to grant relief it does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain original habeas petitions felker v turpin 518 us at 658 just as mccardle and yerger declined to find repeal of 14 of the judiciary act of 1789 as applied to the court by implication felker declines to find similar repeal of 2241 of title 28 518 us at 661122 121 oaks the original writ of habeas corpus in the supreme court 1962 s upreme court review 153 2067 122 the symmetry is less than perfect however since mccardle and yerger found the dual authority in two distinct sources the judiciary act of 1789 and the act of 1867 while the court points to section 2241 as the contemporary source of both moreover while the nineteenth century congress purported to do more than withdraw appellate jurisdiction its twentieth century successor sought to curtail certiorari jurisdiction as well justice stevens concurrence identifies additional sources of review authority with the observation that the aedpa does not purport to limit our

refused to grant relief under its original writ authority because felkers claims satisfied neither the demands of the act nor those of the courts rule 20123 it stopped short of holding however that it was required to follow the acts standards in its original writ determinations whether or not we are bound by these restrictions of the aedpa they certainly inform our consideration of original habeas

the requirement that the original writ issue only upon exceptional circumstances the court did not say why nor did it indicate when such exceptional circumstances might exist on the other hand the courts denial makes it clear that mccardle and yerger notwithstanding legislative barriers blocking access to the more heavily traveled paths to review do not by themselves constitute the necessary exception circumstances it is interesting that the court sought refuge in the arcane confines of original habeas rather than acknowledging that the gatekeeper provis ion came within the congress power under the exceptions and regulations clause whatever limitations that power might otherwise be subject to given the expedited nature of the proceedings it may mean more than that time precluded the

comes w ithin the provisions of 28 usc 2254b to justify the granting of writ of habeas corpus the petitioner must show exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of the courts discretionary powers and must show that adequate relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court these writs are rarely granted reviewing petitioners claims here they do not materially differ from numerous other claims made by successive habeas petitioners which we have had occasion to review on stay applications to this court neither of them satisfies the requi rements of the relevant

the american revolution when parliament annually enacted suspension provisions to permit temporary imprisonment of the rebelling colonists without bail or trial for the duration of the year127 not to be outdone several continued the court of kings bench relying on some arbitrary precedents and those perhaps understood determined that they could not upon an habeas corpus either bail or deliver prisoner though committed without any cause assigned in case he was committed by the special command of the king or by the lords of the privy council this drew on parliamentary enquiry and produced the petition of right 3 cari which recites this illegal judgment and enacts that freeman hereafter shall be so imprisoned or detained but when in the following year mr selden and others were committed by the lords of the council the judges delayed for two terms to deliver an opinion how far such charge was bailable these pitiful evasions gave rise to the statute 16 cari c10 8 whereby it was enacted that if any person be committed by the king himself in person or by his privy council or by any member thereof he shall have granted unto him without any delay upon any pretence whatsoever writ of

suspension clause marks an outer limit of the authority of congress and the courts to adjust the procedures associated with the writ133 if as these authorities indicate the suspension clause enjoys organic qualities that permit it to expand and contract under various environmental circumstances several evolutionary stages of the modern writ deserve repeating first as part of the reconstruction after the civil war congress expanded federal habeas to make it available to state prisoners held in violation of federal law134 second by the early forties the court had completed its slow abandonment of the common law prohibition against use of habeas to attack conviction or sentence collaterally135 thereafter the court used an expanded habeas to help carry the commands of the bill of rights to the state criminal procedure136 beginning in the seventies the court announced series of doctrines calculated to eliminate unnecessary delay repetition and frivolity 137 the aedpa extended

violated the suspension clause the georgia attorney general and the solicitor general each denied that the suspension clause had been violated the court agreed it did not stop with the proposition that the suspension clause does not extend to convicted prisoners or any other prisoners ineligible for the writ under common law however but assumed for purposes of decision here that the suspension clause of the constitution refers to the writ as it exists today rather than as it existed in 1789 518 us at 66364 even under this relaxed standard it found any claim based on felkers case wanting the aedpas limitation on repetitious or stale claims was seen as variation of res judicata which in the area of habeas had been an evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage statutory developments and judicial decisions 518 us at 664 quoting mccleskey v zant 499 us 467 489 1991 the added restrictions which the act places on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary process and do not amount to suspension of the writ contrary to article i 9 518 us at 664 shortly after felker however the court narrowly construe d congressional efforts to restrict review of various immigration decisions and recognized that the courts retained jurisdiction to review habeas petitions with the observation that otherwise serious
