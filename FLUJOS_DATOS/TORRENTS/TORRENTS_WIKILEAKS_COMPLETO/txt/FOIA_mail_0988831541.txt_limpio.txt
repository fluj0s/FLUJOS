jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk mhughesltrrarizonaedu rbradleygeoumassedu pjonesueaacuk srutherfordvirginiaedu hi mike problem i am quite happy to work this stuff through in careful way and am happy to discuss it all with you i certainly dont want the work to be viewed as an attack on previous work such as yours unfortunately this global change stuff is so politicized by both sides of the issue that it is difficult to do the science in dispassionate environment i ran into the same problem in the acid rainforest decline debate that raged in the 1980s at one point i was simultaneous accused of being raving tree hugger and in the pocket of the coal industry i have always said that i dont care what answer is found as long as it is the truth or at least bloody close to it cheers ed hi ed this is fair enough and im sorry if my spelling out my concerns sounded defensive to you it wasnt meant to be that way lets figure this all out based on good careful work and see what the data has to say in the end were working towards this ourselves using revised methods and including borehole data etc and will keep everyone posted on this i dont in any way doubt yours and jans integrity here im just bit concerned that the result is getting used publically by some before it has gone through the gauntlet of peer review especially because it is whether you condone it or not being used as we speak to discredit the work of us and phil et this is dangerous i think there are some legitimate issues that need to be sorted out with regard to the standardization method and would like to see this play out before we jump to conclusions regarding revised estimates of the northern hemisphere mean temperature record and the nature of the mwp id be interested to be kept posted on what the status of the manuscript is thanks mike on wed 2 may 2001 edward cook wrote hi mike few quick points ed these wally seminars are selfpromoting acts on broeckers part and i think the community has to reject them as having any broader significance if broecker had pulled this w ray malcolm keith phil and tom around he wouldnt get away w such onesided treatment of the issue ive been extremely troubled by what i have heard here it appears that you are responding in way that is bit overly defensive which i regret i am not supporting broecker per and only explained in very detailed fashion the origin of the work by esper and and how it was presented to refute very unfair characterization of treering data in wallys perspective piece the fact that esper compared his series with jones briffa and mann et should not be viewed as an attack on your work it was never intended to be so but it is was clearly legitimate thing to do as i said i have control over broecker but it is unfair and indeed incorrect to start out by dismissing the special wally seminars as selfpromoting acts to say that is simply wrong he doesnt bring people in to only express support for his point of view or pet theory as you are implying so i suggest that you cool down bit on this matter it detracts from the scientific issues that should properly be debated here this is the only point on which i will defend broecker im also bit troubled by your comparisons w glacial advances etc and how these correlate w your reconstruction malcolm ray phil and others have been over this stuff time and again and have pointed out that these data themselves dont support the notion of globallysynchronoous changes you seem to be arguing otherwise and with regard to association w volcanic forcing tom has already shown that the major volcanic events are captured correctly in the existing reconstructions whether or not the longerterm trends are correct or not i am not arguing for globallysynchronous changes and never have to quote what i said about neoglacial advances some of the fluctuations in espers series correspond well with known histories of neoglacial advance in some parts of the nh note the use of the word some in that quote that is fair statement and why shouldnt i say it if it is true coincidently or not whether or not it argues for globallysynchronous changes is up to you i would never argue that everything happening on multidecadal time scales is phaselocked across the nh that would be silly thing to say but it is perfectly valid to point out the degree to which independent evidence for cold periods based on glacier advances appears to agree with largerscale indicator of temperature variablity i thought this is how science to supposed to proceed i also dont see your point about volcanic forcing i mentioned this purely in the spirit of the work of crowley and others to suggest that the esper series is probably capturing this kind of signal as well it has nothing to do with the issue of centennial trends in temperature you are reading far more into what i wrote than i ever intended or meant re the boreholes actually if toms estimates are correct and it is also correct that the boreholes have the lowfrequency signal correct over the past few centuries we are forced to also accept toms result that the socalled mwp at the hemispheric scale is actually even cooler relative to present than our result shows that was clear in toms presentation at the workshop so lets be clear about thattoms work and the boreholes in way support broeckers conclusion that the mwp was warmer than we have itit actually implies the mwp is colder than we have it tom please speak up if im not correct in this regard i am not saying that toms results are wrong and i am certainly not saying that broecker is right i merely described the results of new analysis of somewhat new set of long treering records from the extratropics my statement that the mwp appeared to be comparable to the 20th century does not imply nor was it meant to imply that somehow the 20th century temperature is not truly anomalous and being driven by greenhouse gases to quote from my email i would not claim and nor would jan that it exceeded the warmth of the late 20th century we simply do not have the precision or the proxy replication to say that yet note the use of the word precision this clearly relates to the issue of error variance and confidence intervals point that you clearly emphasize in describing your series also note the emphasis on late 20th century i think that most researchers in global change research would agree that the emergence of clear greenhouse forcing signal has really only occurred since after 1970 i am not debating this point although i do think that there still exists signficant uncertainty as to the relative contributions of natural and greenhouse forcing to warming during the past 2030 years at least note that i also tried to emphasize the extratropical nature of this series and it may be that the tropics do not show the same strength of warming but i do argue strongly that we do not have the highresolution proxy data needed to test for mwp in the tropics please correct if i am wrong here we are in the process of incorporating the borehole data into the lowfrequency component of the reconstruction the key difference will be that they are going to be calibrated against the instrumental record and weighted by the spatial coherence within the borehole data rather than what pollack has done i expect the results will be different but in any case quite telling fine ill let malcolm and keith respond to the issues related to the standardization of the esper chronologies though it immediately sounds to quite clear that there is the likelihood of of having contaminated the centuryscales w nonclimatic info having now done some work w chronologies in disturbed forests myself now in collaboration w dave stahle i know how easy it is to get lots of centuryscale variability that has nothing to do w climate i imagine the reviewers of the manuscript will have to be convinced that this is the case w what esper has done im very skeptical im also bothered that broecker has promoted this work prior to any formal peer review there are some real issues w the standardization approach and there is real stretch in promoting this as hemispheric temperature reconstruction i appreciate your skepticism and i hope that jan and i can convince you otherwise i also encourage you to continue getting your shoulders sore and hands dirty on treering sampling and analysis espers analysis is not perfect nor is anyone elses who works in this game but if espers series is wrong on century time scales then jones and briffa are wrong too if espers series is also wrong on interdecadal time scales then your series is wrong as well because on that time scale of variablity his series agrees very well with yours so i would be very cautious about declaring that espers series is in some sense invalid finally as i have said ad nausem i have control over what broecker thinks or does beyond presenting to him convincing case for the ability of certain treering series to preserve longterm temperature variability and again i also tried to emphasize the extratropical nature of this series please give break here finally what is the exact spatial distribution of the sparse data he used scott r drove home the point regarding the importance of taking into account spatial sampling in his talk at the workshop sparse extratratropical set of indicators matter how locallytemperaturesensitive they are will not unless youre very lucky w the locations be an accurate indicator of true n hem temp in general it will overestimate the variance at all timescales the true nhem temperature ie weighted largely by tropical ocean sst has much less variance than extratrpoical continents there may be large apples and oranges component to the comparisons you describe i know your argument and i am sensitive to it hence my emphasis on extratropical so dont look for disagreement on the importance of the tropical ssts to any estimate of nh temperatures but lets be honest here your reconstruction prior to roughly ad 1600 is dominated by extratropical proxies so in way you are caught in the same dilemma as all other people who have tried to do this weve shown that are reconstructions in continental extratropical regions have lots more variance and variability it is as we have all shown the averaging over many regions that reduces the amplitude of variability our regional reconstructions show far more significant warm and cold periods but they cancel out spatially understood but it is still unclear how this all happens as your reconstruction proceeds back in time with an increasingly limited and spatiallyrestricted set of proxies confidence limits that you place on your series is laudable and i agree to first order that the mwp in your series could easily have been cooler than what you show but it implicitly assumes that the estimates are equally unbiased or equally biased for that matter back in time i dont know if that is an issue here but i believe that the issue of bias using an increasingly sparse number of predictors scattered irregularly over space has not be investigated please correct if i am wrong here if legitimate argument were to be made that we have significnatly understiamted within the context of our uncertainty estimates the amplitude of the mwp at the hemispheric scale id be the first to accept it note that as phil et pointed out in their recent review article in science we do not dispute that temperatures eearly in the millennium within the uncertainty estimates may have been comparable to earlymid 20th centurysjust not late 20th century temperatures we are in agreement here see my earlier comments frankly though ed i really dont see it here we may have to let the peerreview process decid this but i think you might benefit from knowing the consensus of the very able group we have assembled in this email list on what esperyou have done of course i know everyone in this very able group and respect their opinions and scientific credentials the same obviously goes for you that is not to say that we cant disagree afterall consensus science can impede progress as much as promote understanding cheers ed comments or thoughts cheers mike at 1059 am 5201 0400 edward cook wrote ed heard some rumor that you are involved in nonhockey stick reconstruction of northern hemisphere temperatures i am very intrigued to learn about this are these results suggesting the so called medieval warm period may be warmer than the earlymid 20th century any enlightenment on this would be most appreciated tom thomas j crowley dept of oceanography texas am university college station tx 778433146 9798450795 9798478879 fax 9798456331 alternate fax hi tom as rumors often are the one you heard is not entirely accurate so i will take some time here to explain for you mike and others exactly what was done and what the motivation was in an effort to hopefully avoid any misunderstanding i especially want to avoid any suggestion that this work was being done to specifically counter or refute the hockey stick however it does suggest as do other results from your ebm pecks work the borehole data and briffa and jones largescale proxy estimates that there are unresolved i think inconsistencies in the lowfrequency aspects of the hockey stick series compared to other results so any comparisons with the hockey stick were made with that spirit in mind what jan esper and i are working on mostly jan with as second author is paper that was in response to broeckers science perspectives piece on the medieval warm period specifically we took strong exception to his claim that tree rings are incapable of preserving century time scale temperature variability of course if broecker had read the literature he would have known that what he claimed was inaccurate be that as it may jan had been working on project as part of his postdoc here to look at largescale lowfrequency patterns of tree growth and climate in long treering records provided to him by fritz schweingruber with the addition of couple of sites from foxtail pine in california jan amassed collection of 14 treering sites scattered somewhat uniformly over the 3070 degree nh latitude band with most extending back 10001200 years all of the sites are from temperaturesensitive locations ie high elevation or high northern latitude it is as far as i know the largest longest and most spatially representative set of such temperaturesensitive treering data yet put together for the nh extratropics in order to preserve maximum lowfrequency variance jan used the regional curve standardization rcs method used previously by briffa and myself with great success only here jan chose to do things in somewhat radical fashion since the replication at each site was generally insufficient to produce robust rcs chronology back to say ad 1000 jan pooled all of the original measurement series into 2 classes of growth trends nonlinear 700 ringwidth series and linear 500 ringwidth series he than performed independent rcs on the each of the pooled sets and produced 2 rcs chronologies with remarkably similar multidecadal and centennial lowfrequency characteristics these chronologies are not good at preserving highfrquency climate information because of the scattering of sites and the mix of different species but the lowfrequency patterns are probably reflecting the same longterm changes in temperature jan than averaged the 2 rcs chronologies together to produce single chronology extending back to ad 800 it has very well defined medieval warm period little ice age 20th century warming pattern punctuated by strong decadal fluctuations of inferred cold that correspond well with known histories of neoglacial advance in some parts of the nh the punctuations also appear in some cases to be related to known major volcanic eruptions jan originally only wanted to show this nh extratropical rcs chronology in form scaled to millimeters of growth to show how forest productivity and carbon sequestration may be modified by climate variability and change over relatively long time scales however i encouraged him to compare his series with nh instrumental temperature data and the proxy estimates produced by jones briffa and mann in order bolster the claim that his unorthodox method of pooling the treering data was producing record that was indeed related to temperatures in some sense this he did by linearly rescaling his rcs chronology from mm of growth to temperature anomalies in so doing jan demonstrated that his series on interdecadal time scales only was well correlated to the annual nh instrumental record this result agreed extremely well with those of jones and briffa of course some of the same data were used by them but probably not more than 40 percent briffa in particular so the comparison is based on mostly but not fully independent data the similarity indicated that jans approach was valid for producing useful reconstruction of multidecadal temperature variability probably weighted towards the warmseason months but it is impossible to know by how much over larger region of the nh extratropics than that produced before by jones and briffa it also revealed somewhat more intense cooling in the little ice age that is more consistent with what the borehole temperatures indicate back to ad 1600 this result also bolsters the argument for reasonably largescale medieval warm period that may not be as warm as the late 20th century but is of much greater significance than that produced previously of course jan also had to compare his record with the hockey stick since that is the most prominent and oftcited record of nh temperatures covering the past 1000 years the results were consistent with the differences shown by others mainly in the centuryscale of variability again the esper series shows very strong even canonical medieval warm period little ice age 20th century warming pattern which is largely missing from the hockey stick yet the two series agree reasonably well on interdecadal timescales even though they may not be 11 expressions of the same temperature window ie annual vs warmseason weighted however the treering series used in the hockey stick are warmseason weighted as well so the difference between annual and warmseason weighted is probably not as large as it might seem especially before the period of instrumental data eg pre1700 in the hockey stick so they both share significant degree of common interdecal temperature information and some but not much data but do not covary well on century timescales again this has all been shown before by others using different temperature reconstructions but jans result is probably the most comprehensive expression i believe of extratropical nh temperatures back to ad 800 on multidecadal and century time scales now back to the broecker perspectives piece i felt compelled to refute broeckers erroneous claim that tree rings could not preserve longterm temperature information so i organized special wally seminar in which i introduced the topic to him and the packed audience using samuel johnsons famous i refute it thus statement in the form of jan esper and i refute broecker thus jan than presented in very detailed and well espressed fashion his story and broecker became an instant convert in other words wally now believes that long treering records when properly selected and processed can preserve lowfrequency temperature variability on centennial time scales others in the audience came away with the same understanding one that we dendrochronologists always knew to be the case this was the entire purpose of jans work and the presentation of it to wally and others wally had expressed some doubts about the hockey stick previously to and did so again in his perspectives article so jans presentation strongly reenforced wallys opinion about the hockey stick which he has expressed to others including several who attended subsequent noaa meeting at lamont i have control over what wally says and only hope that we can work together to reconcile in professional friendly manner the differences between the hockey stick and other proxy temperature records covering the past 1000 years this i would like to do i do think that the medieval warm period was far more significant event than has been recognized previously as much because the highresolution data to evaluate it had not been available before that is much less so the case now it is even showing up strongly now in long sh treering series however there is still the question of how strong this event was in the tropics i maintain that we do not have the proxies to tell us that now the tropical ice core data are very difficult to interpret as temperature proxies far worse than tree rings for sure and maybe even unrelated to temperatures in any simple linear sense as is often assumed so i do not believe that they can be used alone as records to test for the existence of medieval warm period in the tropics that being the case there are really other highresolution records from the tropics to use and the teleconnections between long extratropical proxies and the tropics are i believe far too tenuous and probably unstable to use to sort out this issue so at this stage i would argue that the medieval warm period was probably global extratropical event at the very least with warmth that was persistent and probably comparable to much of what we have experienced in the 20th century however i would not claim and nor would jan that it exceeded the warmth of the late 20th century we simply do not have the precision or the proxy replication to say that yet this being said i do find the dismissal of the medieval warm period as meaningful global event to be grossly premature and probably wrong kind of like mark twains commment that accounts of his death were greatly exaggerated if as some people believe degree of symmetry in climate exists between the hemispheres which would appear to arise from the tropics then the existence of medieval warm period in the extratropics of the nh and sh argues for its existence in the tropics as well only time and an enlarged suite of proxies that extend into the tropics will tell if this is true i hope that what i have written clarifies the rumor and expresses my views more completely and accurately cheers ed dr edward r cook doherty senior scholar treering laboratory
