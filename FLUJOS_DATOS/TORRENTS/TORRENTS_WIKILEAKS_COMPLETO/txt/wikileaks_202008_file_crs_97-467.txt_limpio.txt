paper patricia wertman specialist in international trade and finance economics division summary in the wake of the mexican financial crisis the g7 industrial countries1 agreed at the halifax economic summit of june 1516 1995 to establish an emergency financing mechanism this proposal has ultimately evolved into the socalled new arrangements to borrow nab2 the nab however parallels and complements the gab which were established in 1962 while the proposed nab would become the facility of first recourse the gab remain in existence and are still available to be drawn upon more importantly the sdr 170 billion3 in existing financial commitments to the gab are counted as part of the total sdr 340 billion in financial commitments that comprise the nab background the mexican peso devaluation of december 2022 1994 stunned the international financial world ultimately it led to commitment by the united states to provide an unprecedented 20 billion financial support package to mexico it also raised variety of concerns regarding the functioning of the international monetary system itself chief among these issues is the ability of current international financial institutions most notably the international monetary fund imf the fund to cope with financial crises generated by the sudden movement of shortterm capital or portfolio investment socalled speculative or hot money 1 the united states japan germany france the united kingdom italy and canada 2 the nab are discussed in us library of congress congressional research service the imfs proposed new arrangements to borrow nab an

fluctuates on daily basis congressional research service the library of congress crs2 to deal with the potentially disruptive impact of shortterm capital flows the leaders of the g7 countries meeting at the halifax economic summit on june 1516 proposed to create an emergency financing mechanism by suggested doubling of the imfs general arrangements to borrow gab this proposal has ultimately evolved into the socalled new arrangements to borrow nab both the proposed nab and the already existing gab are arrangements of medium term credit lines that are available to the imf in the event of an international financial crisis the nab however parallel and complement the gab which were established in 1962 indeed existing commitments to the gab are calculated as part of the total sdr 340 billion that comprise the nab at sdr 170 billio the gab comprise half of the nab total stated another way the nab fulfill the g7 commitment to double the gab thus while the proposed nab would become the facility of first recourse the gab remain in effect and may still be drawn upon us participation in the nab requires congressional authorization and appropriation this report is intended to provide background information on the gab the need for which is likely to arise within the context of congressional consideration of the nab proposal gab basics purpose and use the gab are an arrangement of mediumterm credit lines in the amount of sdr 170 billion currently about 233 billion4 they entitle the imf to borrow currencies from 11 major industrial countries these include the g7 plus belgium netherlands sweden and switzerland which became gab participant in 1964 and fund member in 19925 an sdr 15 billion about 22 billion credit arrangement with saudi arabia is also associated with the gab it was negotiated in 1983 the circumstances that led to the currently proposed nab in some sense echo the currency turmoil that led to the creation of gab the gab were set up after considerable negotiation in january 1962 by decision of the executive board of the imf following the establishment of external currency convertibility by most european countries in 1958 and by japan in 1961 most restrictions on shortterm capital flows had been lifted in addition both the united states and the united kingdom the key currency countries in the bretton woods system of fixed exchange rates were experiencing balanceofpayments difficulties exchange rates therefore were under substantial pressure from shortterm speculative capital flows the gab were one of number of seemingly temporary measures taken to deal with these speculative flows6 today it is the emerging economies such as in latin america and east asia that have recently opened up making themselves vulnerable to sudden shifts in market sentiment 4 at the rate of 136928 per sdr as of april 10 1997 5 the original 10 participants in the gab gave rise to the socalled group of 10 which has in large measure controlled the imf and international monetary system the g7 is in essence rump group of this earlier group 6 another notable measure was the setting up of systematic currency swap lines by the federal reserve with other central banks mexico used its swap line during the 19941995 crisis crs3 thus the need to counter disruptive shortterm capital flows has reappeared as an issue for policymakers reflecting their history the gab are intended to provide the fund with supplemental resources to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system7 they are emergency resources they are also nonquota8 based financial resource of the fund as such they are fully under control of the participants and not the imf decisions to activate the gab are made by the participants upon the call of the managing director of the imf the gab are activated in cases of large drawings on the imf all gab drawings have been made by gab participants altogether the gab have been activated nine times since their inception in 1962 the united states was the last country to activate the gab when the fund borrowed from japan and germany to finance us reserve tranche purchase of sdr 777 million then about 10 billion in 1978 this was the only time the united states drew on the gab by comparison the united kingdom drew on the gab five times between 1964 and 1977 for total drawing of sdr 3246 million france drew on the gab in 1968 and in 1969 for total drawing of sdr 640 million italy drew sdr 90 million in 1977 since the imf is borrowing from gab participants the risks of failure to repay are borne by the imf as the financial intermediary any impairment of the imfs financial stability however would ultimately have to be dealt with by its shareholders including the united states interest is paid to gab creditors at the sdr interest rate which fluctuates reflecting the shortterm market rates of its constituent currencies the us dollar the german mark the japanese yen the french franc and the uk pound sterling during the week beginning march 17 1997 for example the sdr interest rate stood at 398 percent interest is accrued daily and paid quarterly the imf is required to pay back gab lenders within 5 years but may repay earlier at present the imf does not have any borrowings outstanding to the gab creditors the gab were initially put in place for 4year period they have however been repeatedly renewed so that they are in effect now nearly permanent as currently constituted the gab are now set to expire on december 25 1998 amendments to the gab require not only the approval of the imf executive board but more importantly of the gab participants the 1983 expansion 7 preamble gab 8 quotas or members capital subscriptions are the basic financial resource of the imf they determine borrowing privileges voting rights and any distribution of special drawing rights sdrs for more details on the financial structure of the imf see us library of congress congressional research service the international monetary fund short overview crs report 97228 by jf hornbeck crs4 originally totalling 60 billion9 the gab credit lines were somewhat increased by the addition of switzerland in 1964 and by an increase in japans credit line in 1976 in 1983 however the gab lines were substantially expanded their overall size was increased to the current level of sdr 170 billion about 233 billion from sdr 63 billion in addition individual credit lines were altered to reflect changes in the relative economic strength of participants as can be seen from table 1 on the next page the us share of the gab is presently sdr 4250 million about 58194 million or onequarter of the total until 1983 only the 11 countries participating in the gab could borrow from them in the wake of the 1980s third world debt crisis however the gab were expanded to enable nonparticipating fund members also to borrow under the gab fund calls upon gab resources on behalf on nonparticipants must however meet stricter criteria than those established for calls on behalf of participants the circumstances surrounding call to finance nonparticipant must meet two key requirements 1 they must represent threat to rather than just an impairment of the international monetary system and 2 the fund must face an an inadequacy of resources10 this latter condition is not requirement of the nab thereby making the gab relatively more difficult to draw upon than the nab when borrowing from the gab nonparticipants are also required to have an imf economic adjustment program in place finally in deciding to tap gab resources the imfs managing director must pay due regard to the potential borrowing needs of gab participants 9 the sdr was not created until 1969 prior to that time the share of each participant in the gab was stated in the us dollar equivalent of the participants currency rather than in sdrs 10 gab 21 b crs5 table 1 general arrangements to borrow

funds to enable us participation in the establishment of the gab in 1962 and in their expansion in 1983 were appropriated in practice funds provided to the imf under the gab are provided upon call that is notification by the fund to participant to make transfer to the funds account under its gab credit lines budget expenditure occurs therefore only as cash is actually transferred to the imf if transfer is made the united states receives an equal offsetting asset its loan to the imf in budgetary terms such offsetting transactions are treated as an exchange of assets as consequence they do not result in net budget outlays and they do not increase the federal budget deficit for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97467
