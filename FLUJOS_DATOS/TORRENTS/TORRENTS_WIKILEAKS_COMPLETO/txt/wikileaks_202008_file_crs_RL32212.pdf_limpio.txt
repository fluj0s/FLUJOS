analysis of issues concerning possible congressional acti on to reduce the number of positions to which the president makes appointment s with the advice and cons ent of the senate pas positions among other topics the report discusses the constitutional framework that guides congressional action in this area identifies potential congressional options and analyzes associated institutional and political considerations the constitution provides congress with considerable discretion over which officers of the united states will be in pas positions and wh ich may be appointed by the president alone the courts or agen cy heads at present more than 2000 highlevel officials across th three branches are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the appointment process includes presidential selection and nomination senate considera tion and formal pres idential appointment in general the number of pas positions has grown and the appointment process has gotten longer over the last three decades it is not clear however that the larger number is responsible for the ngthier process other factor s such as stricter vetting requirements also play role propone nts of reduction in the number of pas positions have suggested that it might lead to an improvement in the efficiency and performance of the senate conf irmation process and to decrease in the length of the appointment process but th is will probably be the case only if the positions removed from pas status are those for which ppointments consume the most time some argue that removing advice and consent requirements from such positions might have undesirable political and instituti onal consequences for congress recently enacted provision directs each federal agency head to submit pas position reduction plan to the president and congress congress might elect to make these plans the basis for future decisions concerning the reduction of pas positions alternative options for congress include maintaining the status quo creating commission to make recommendations for re ductions of pas positions establishing fast track procedure for these reduc tions reducing the number of positions by category or function distributing pas pos itions in proportion to agency size and delegating reduction choices to committees of jurisdiction in lieu of maintaining pas status for certain positions congre ss might continue to influence the appointment process by legi slatively establishing qualif ications or notification requirements for appointments to those positions congressional action on pas positions woul d involve number of institutional and political considerations for example participation in the appointment process through advice and consent gi ves senators influence

appoint ees are subjected the complexity and quantity of the paperwork that appointees are required to complete and submit and the procedural and political complications associated with some nominations during the senate conf irmation process2 rigorous studies have associated these perceived shortcomings of the process with longer vacancies confusion and embarrassment of nominees and

perceived problem s some of these reports have called for reduction in the overall number of pas positions for example in 1996 the twentieth century fund5 task force on presidential appointment s recommended that the number of all positions to which the president makes appointments including those requiring senate confir mation be reduced by third the task force further suggested that appointments to most advisory commi ssions and routine promotions of military officers foreign service officers and pub lic health services officers except those at the very highest ranks cease to be presidential appointments and cease to require senate c onfirmation6 in 2001 as part of proposal aimed at improving the process for making appointments to pas positi ons the presidential appointee initiative pai at the brookings institution also ca lled for reduction in the number of such positions rather than identifying which positions might be shed the pai focused on which appointments should continue to co before the sena it recommended that senate confirmation onl be required of appointme nts of judges ambassadors executivelevel positions in the departments and agencies and promotion of officers of the highest rank it further suggest ed reduction of political appointees by third such that pas positions would be limited to the assistant secretary level and above in each department and to the top three levels onl in independent agencies7 the 911 commission report included recommendation th at the senate should not require confirmation of n ational security team executive appointees below executive level 3 which could eliminate advice and consent requirements for among other positions most assistant secretaries with national security responsibilities8 one of the cochairs of the pai dvisory board former senator nancy kassebaum baker elaborated on the exp ected benefit of reduction in the number of pas positions for the conduct of senate confir mation business i am strong supporter of advice and consenti think we all arebut the application of the confirmation requireme nt now extends to many thousands of positions only relatively small number of

entitled the presidential appointments improvement act of 2003 13 pl 108458 section 8403ci think this proposal would lessen the time that would be taken by the time one arranges hearings the paperwork comes through there are number of appointments that then take up an enormous amount of time of the hearing committees so we think that simpler more focused set of confirmation obligations can only yield more efficient and more consistent performance of the senates confirmation responsibilities9 other observers have suggested that by reducing the number of pas positions the perceived backlog of appointments might be eased10 in essence critics of the presidential appointment pr ocess contend that appoin tments to pas positions are taking too long and that reduction in the number of these positions would lead to more efficient confirmation process in the senate and faster appointments to the remaining positions that are s ubject to advice and consent interest in reforming the pas appoin tment process and po ssibly reducing the number of pas positions led to the enactment of provision that directs each agency head to submit an advice and consent position reduction plan with specified contents to the president the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform during the 107th congress senator fred thompson introduced the presidential appointments improvement act of 2001 s 1811 which among other provisions would have required such plans11 the bill was referred to the committee on governmental affairs and subsequently reported to the full senate but it was not acted upon by the full senate during the 107th congress early in the 108th congress senator george voinovich introduced legi slation similar to

process and trends in the ngth of the appointment process and the number of pas positions this descriptive information is followed by an evaluation of the assertions discusse d above that reduction in the number of pas positions would likely lead to more efficient confirmation process in the senate and faster appointment overall process the last third of th report identifies potential congressional approaches to reducing the number of pas positions and analyzes the institutional and political considerations associated with each of these options ii the constitutional framework for the appointment of officers of the united states as part of its system of checks and balances the constitution provides general framework for the appointment of officers of the united states the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors othe r public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwis provided for and which shall be established by law but the congress ma by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments14 in 1976 opinion the comptroller general r easoned that this provision indicates that all officers of the united states are to be pas positions unless congress affirmatively delegates that authority15 in other words the defau lt appointment process under the constitution for such officers is presidentia l appointment with the advice and consent of the senate with regard to which positions would be considered offices under this clause the supreme court has held that any appointee exer cising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states is an officer of the united states and must therefore be appoi nted in the manner prescribed above16 congress may make any office of the united states pas position but only certain positions must be filled that way in deciding which officers must be in pas positions and which might be appointed by the president alone by the courts of law or by the heads of departments it is first necessary to determine the constitutional meaning of inferior officers in 1997 this term was given greater specificity by the supreme court in edmond v united states 17 at issue in this case was the validity of the appointment process for two civilian members of the coast guard court of criminal appeals initially the two were assigned to the cour t by the general couns of the departmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs5 18 ibid pp 655656 19 ibid pp 662663 20 ibid p 666of transportation later the secretar of transportation in his capacity as department head issued memorandum adopting the assignments as his own appointments the petitioners individuals who had been convicted by courtmartial in the court argued that the appointme nts were invalid on two grounds only one of which is relevant here they argued that judges of military courts of criminal appeals are principal not in ferior officers within the meaning of the appointments clause and must therefore be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate18 the opinion of the court turned in part on the courts distinction between principa l and inferior officers generally speaking the term inferior officer connotes relationship with some higher ranking officer or officers below the president whether one is an inferior officer depends on whether he has superior it is not enough that other officers may be identified who forma lly maintain higher rank or possess responsibilities of greater magnitude if that were the intention the constitution might have used the phrase lesser officer rather in the context of clause designed to preserve po litical accountability relative to important government assignments we think it evid ent that inferior officers are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the senate19 the court concluded that by reason of th supervision over their work exercised by the general counsel of the department of transportation in his capacity as the judge advocate general and the court of ppeals for the armed forces the judges of the coast guard court of criminal appeals were inferior officers under the appointments clause of the constitution20 they could therefore be appointed by the department head the courts opinion provides guidance that could assist congress in identifying which officers may be appointed through one of the nonpas processes it suggests that aside from officers in positions that the constitution specifically identifies such as ambassadors and judges of the supreme court the constitution only requires one layer of advice and consent positions in the hierarchy of each agency it indicates that appointees with pasappointed supe rvisors are inferior officers and that congress may therefore provide for appoi ntment by the president alone the courts of law or the heads of depa rtments based on the courts opinion an argument could be made that in the departments for example the constitution requires only that secretaries be subject to advice and consent on the other hand the courts opinion so suggests that any officer who does not have pasappointed supe rior cannot be an inferior officer and therefore must be appointed by the president with the dvice and consent of the senate therefore for example members of federal boards and commissions who exercise significant statutory authority and whose work is genera lly not directed or supervised by otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs6 21 for the purpose of appointing inferior officers the members of federal board or commission may be considered collectively h ead of department for example members of the public company accounting oversight board are appointed by the securities and exchange commission as whole 15 usc 7211 e4 this practice is in accord with the appeals court in silver v us postal service 951 f2d 1033 9th cir 1991 in which the court concluded that the ninemember us postal service board of governors constitutes the head of department and therefore may be charged by congress with the appointment of the po stmaster general an inferior officer 22 for listings of pas positions by senate committees of jurisdiction see crs report rl30959 presidential appointee positions re quiring senate confirmation and comm ittees handling nominations by henry b hogueofficers might be considered pr incipal not inferior officers21 if such board and commission members were considered principal officers it would follow that appointments to positions in this category could be made only with the advice and consent of the senate iii appointment methods for officers of the united states as the previous secti on indicates under the constitution presidential appointment with the advice and consent of the senate is just one of the ways in which officers of the united states may be appointed in the executive branch officers are appointed by the president w ith or without senate confirmation or by the department or agency head some appointments referred to as political appointments are made at the discretion of the appointing authority that is the president agency head or court ot her appointments referred to as career or competitive appointments are made through competitive process the executive leadership of the federa l bureaucracy consists of between 9000 and 10000 individuals of that nu mber approximately 3500 are political appointees often supporters of the presiden t or party loyalists and the balance are career members of the senior executive service ses the political positions fall into four categories pas presidential appointments not requiri ng confirmation pa positions noncareer ses and schedule c pos itions each of these categories is discussed below if c ongress removes position from pas status it may continue the position or its functions as anothe r kind of position congress may assign appointment authority to the president alone or direct that the position be filled by member of the ses if congress is silent on the matter agencies may create ses or schedule c positions to carry out the particular functions officers currently appointed through the advice and consent process22 each year the president submits more than 20000 nominations to the senate although these nominations include those to the highest unelected policymaking positions in the federal government the great majority are routine armed forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs7 23 see for example 14

government journal of public admini stration research and theory vol 8 oct 1998 pp 450497expressed concerns about the increasing number of political appointments in the federal bureaucracy in january 2003 for example the second national commission on the public service chaired by paul volcker recommended onethird reduction in such positions39 in recent years several gislative initiatives have proposed maintaining or reducing the num ber of political appointments40 in the department of transportation annua l appropriations measures for nine of the last 13 fiscal years statutory limits have been placed on the number of such positions41 the balance between political and career leadership positions reflects the value in the american government of both po litical accountability and neutral managerial competence whereas political appointments are typically made by the president and agency heads as means of pursuing particular policy agenda careerists are usually hired under the civil service system on the basis of merit to execute the laws in an unbiased manner public administrati on scholars and prac titioners have long recognized that this process of implementing laws is both political and administrative managerial expertis is necessary during implementation but accountability for the way in which the will of elected officials is carried out is also an important component of sound public administration if congress changes the appointment method for some pas positions the functions of the positions are likely to be placed either by congress the president or the agency in the hands of either career or political appointee since the appointee will longer need to be confirme d by the senate it could be argued that political official might be less accountable to congress than pas appointee would be what about careerists so have argued that career officials tend to be allied with congress while others have sugge sted that they respond to the political environment as whole42 consequently congress might opt to specify that certain functions be carried out by career officials on the other hand congress might elect to provide the administration with greater management flexibility by allowing more positions to be filled by the president alone or agency headshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs11 43 report of the task force on the confirmation process

the president has the authority to make nomination to position requiring confirmation but when making his selection he must consider how it will fare in the confirmation process the senate confirms most nominations but considering the history of nominations president can safely assume that his nominees will be approved routinely although the formal appointment process is the province of the president and the sena other concerned parties such as interest gr oups and other elected officials may attempt to influence the outcome at various stages by providing information to the decision makers and the media this is particularly the case for higher profile positions selection and nomination number of steps are involved in the pr esidents selection for most senate confirmed appointments first with the assistance of the white house office of presidential personnel the president select s candidate for the position generally the candidate then prepares and submits several

generally available one instance in which it is possible to collect this information for many positions58 however is at the beginning of new administration when many positions are vacated and f illed simultaneously g calvin mackenzie calculated that the aver age time from inauguration to confirmation for initial pas appointments grew from 2 38 months at the beginning of john f kennedys presidency to 853 months at the beginning of william j clintons presidency59 because of the inexperience of new presidential staff and the large number of appointments going through the system at the same time these average times for new administrations are probably longer than av erages of all appointment times would be httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs16 60 in addition at the time the department of

table 1 provides summary of the average length of time taken to nominate nd confirm initial appointees to pas positions in each of these departments the last column in table 1 shows the median numbers of days elapsed from enactment of the organic legisl ation to senate conf irmation the latter figures range from low of 77 days about 2¬Ω months to 352 days nearly year with the exception of the department of energy the median times grew longer from 1965 140 days to 2004 206 days this is consistent with reports suggesting that in general the appointment proce ss has grown longer nd more complex over the last 40 years often in response to individual incidents congress and presidents have increased scrutiny of potential appointees as insurance against scandals61 in addition to this trend the length of the process has been affected by particular circumstances in the case of the department of veterans affairs for example the organic legislation was signed into law in the last months of the reagan presidency and implemented at the beginning of the pr esidency of george h w bush the incoming president had authority to submit nomination until his inauguration which was 87 days after the billsigning in addition many tasks including multitude of other appointment s confronted the new ad ministration and this may have contributed to the relatively ngthy appointment process for the new department table 1 also shows that the time between enactment and nomination generally accounts for far greater pa rt of the appointment pr ocess than the time between nomination and senate confirmation the president generally takes much longer to submit nomination than does the senate to deliberate on the nomination this generalization is further supported by st udy of departmental appointments in 1981 and 1993 the report looked at the time re quired to fill pas positions in the first year of the reagan and clinton administrations it showed that on average the time the presidents took to submit nomination accounted for more than 75 of the total time from inauguration to confirmation62 this finding may not apply to nominations in general since at least two factors characteristic of the beginning of new administration should not affect other minations new president has lead time before his inauguration to begin the selection and vetting process on the other handhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs17 there might be bottleneck in the vetting process as the vari ous offices involved attempt to complete the investigation and clearance process for the

the united states of america note the table shows both the mean and median number of days the mean is the arithmetic average in order to calculate the mean number of days elapsed from enactment to nomination for example for each department the entries for all the positions in the department were added and the sum was divided by the number of positions the median is the middle number when the days elapsed entries for all the positions are arranged numerically although the mean is the more familiar kind of average the median is included because it diminishes the influence of few extreme entries for example if the president submits 10 of 12 nominations within 90 days three months and the remaining two within 540 days 18 months the mean elapsed time would be 165 days even tho ugh most nominations were submitted far sooner than that the median in this case would be 90 days which more clearly shows the time in general the president took to forward his nominations the figures shown

of the policymaking functions of particular offices and the perceived need for congressional influence in their leadership vii assessment of expected benefits of reduction in the number of advice and consent positions proponents of reduction in the number of pas positions have suggested that such reduction would be expected to yield more efficient and more consistent performance of the senates confirmation responsibilities65 and to reduce the overall the length of the appointment process improving the senate confirmation process would an improvement in the senate confirmation process result from reduction in the number of pas positions nearly all the potential gains in efficiency and performance probably woul d be found at the committee level since unless nomination is contr oversial confirma tion on the senate floor is usually accomplished by unanimous consent with minimal debate66 to varying degrees depending on the committee and the nominee committee activity related to nominations may include review of federa l bureau of investigation reports and executive personnel financial disclosure reports sf 278 collection and review of additional fina ncial and personal background information meetings with nominees and hearings committees usually follow more routinized procedures for lowerlevel nominations while spending more time reviewing and investigating highlevel nominees more closely conseque ntly if the senate were to consider only nominations to top policymaking positions the measured senate efficiency and performance might not noticeably improve if congress changed the appointment method for higherlevel pas positions howev er reduced workload might allow the senate to execute its confirmation responsib ilities more efficiently the senate also might incur costs how ever were the appointment method for higherlevel pas positions to be changed for example senators would lose the opportunity to review and pass on pres idential appointees qualifications and potential conflicts of interest senators also would lose the opportunity to use the confirmation process to infl uence policy with appoin tments to pas positions they may do this by not confirming nominee or by extracting commitment on somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs20 67 pl 108458 section 8403baction from nominee during the confirma tion process in addition senate committees might have greater difficulty obtaining testimony from appointees who have not been confirmed by the senate and the senates efficiency and performance in its oversight role might therefore d ecrease as noted above the senate usually gains commitment from the nominee during the confirmation pr ocess to respond to requests to come before its committees if advice and consent requirements were discontinued for some statele vel appointments such as u s attorneys and marshals some senators particularly those of the same party as the president might lose the opportunity to consult with the presiden t on suitable candidates for these positions shortening the appointment process would reduction in the number of pa s positions shorten the overall process for appointments to pas positions lthough the evidence discussed above suggests that both the number of pas positions and the length of the appointment process have grown in the past three decades it is not clear that the greater number has caused or contributed to longer ppointment process if congress were to reduce the number of pas positions doing so would of course shorten the process for those appointments that longer needed to go through the confirmation process it is unclear however whether or not the average length of the appointment process would be reduced for the remaining pas positions as previously discussed the process includes three stages selection and nomination which on average takes the longest period of time senate consideration and appoin tment which may take place at the pleasure of the president the appoi ntment process could be shortened if either the presidential vetting proce ss or senate cons ideration or both were shortened shortening selection selecting and investigating the background and finances of potential nominees ofte n takes considerable amount of time this process sometimes can be completed quickly for top nominees such as department secretaries when greater resources are committed to the task completion of the vetting process for most other nominees however usually takes longer if fewer people had to go through the process it might proceed more quickly for the remaining applicants if the appointees w ho were longer subject to the advice and consent of the senate still needed to be vetted by the white house just as many applications would need to go through the pipeline consequently it is unclear that converting some pas positions to other types of positions would reduce delays at the selection stage of the appointment process the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 included several provisions that might reduce some appointment process delays in the selection stage for example the law direct s the office of personnel ma nagement opm to provide each major party presidential candidate soon after his or her nomination with certain information concerning presid entially appointed positions67 access to such information allows the potential president to begin the selection process as much as half year before taking office httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs21 68 pl 108458 section 7601a 69 pl 108458 title iii 70 pl

amended the presidential transiti on act of 1963 to recommend that the presidentelect submit names of candidates for high level national security positions through the level of undersecretary for national security clearance as soon as possible after the presidential electi on and to require expeditious background investigations of these candidates among other things68 title iii of the act made governmentwide changes to the national security clearance process that are designed to consolidate and streamline this function69 because most presidential appointees are subject to this clearance process these changes may have an impact on the duration and difficulty of the selection stage of the appointment process in addition the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act contained provision that requires report from the office of government ethics oge regarding potential improvements to the financial disclosure process for executive branch employees70 similar report sent to congress by the office of government ethics in 2001 recommended changes to the ethics in government act71 to 1 reduce the number of valuation categories 2 shorten certain reporting timeperiods 3 limit the scope of reporting by raising certain dollarthresholds 4 reduce details that are unnecessary for conflicts analys is and 5 eliminate redundant reporting72 the findings of the newly ma ndated report might serve as basis for legislation that would streamline the financial disclosure process and thereby on average shorten the duration of the appointment process shortening senate consideration would reduction in the number of pas positions decrease the length of the senate confirmation process the most timeconsuming activities in this proce ss are the investigatory activities and preparation for hearings as discussed above committee investigations include the review of documents and reports collected during the selection and nomination stage as well as the collection and review of committeespecific personal and financial forms in some cases committees prepare and nominees complete individually tailored followup questionnaires as well preparation for and scheduling of hearings may also lengthen the average confirmation time if the positions removed from pas status were among those that involve significant investig ations or hearings their removal might result in shor ter appointment times on average congress also might opt to address any delays possibly resulting from investigations and the hearing process by increasing committee staffing or reducing the number of nominations that receive hearings although the average length of time that nomination is pending in the senate may be related to senate workload other factors may play more significant role policy differences either re lated or unrelated to par ticular nominations may lead senators to delay or block nominations through the use of holds or other procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs22 73 sen hillary rodham clinton remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 149 oct 27 2003 p s13248 74 see g calvin mackenzie the st ate

for actions by other senators or the president titfo rtat efforts to trade confirmation of one nomination for confirmation for nother packaging together several nominations74 efforts to gain policy commitment from nominee or need for more time to gain or review information on nomination in 2004 congress acted to hasten sena consideration of subset of nominations at the beginning of new ad ministration the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act expressed the nse of the senate about timetable for submission and consideration of highlev national security nominations during transitions under this timetable nomina tions to such positions should be submitted by the presidentelect to the senate by inauguration day and senate consideration of all such nominations should be co mpleted within 30 days of submission75 viii potential approaches to determining the appropriate number and distribution of pas positions the analysis in the preceding section suggests that decrease in the number of pas positions might ease the workload of senate committees facilitate faster average confirmation time and reduce the ove rall length of the appointment process it further suggests that these benefits could be contingent on which positions are converted to another appoin tment method the greatest effect could come from the conversion of higherlevel positions just the kind of positions that congress might be most reluctant to convert if congress elected to reduce the numbe r of pas positions for these or other reasons this activity could be considered as part of larger

given the potential impact of congressional decisions about the numbe r and distribution of pas positions how might congress go about making these terminations what institutional and political considerations are relevant in the decision making process what are some alternative ways for approaching this task institutional considerations although the presidents role has evolve d into that of chief manager of the federal bureaucracy congress has clear and l ongstanding role as comanager of the national administration76 the role of the senate in the appointment process is just one of the ways congress is involved in shaping the organization and activities of federal governmental entities and programs congress establishes departments and agencies and to whatever degree it chooses the internal organization of agencies congress through law also determines the missions of agencies defines the parameters of personnel sy stems provides funding through the appropriations process and ultimately determines thr ough the authorization process whether agencies and programs shall continue in existence congress also comanages the federal bureaucracy through its oversight role senators sometimes use confirmation hearings as one venue for conducting oversight when congress delegates the authority for the appointment of an inferior officer to the president alone or to an agency head it cedes some power over the federal bureaucracy to the executive in such case congress particularly the senate may have reduced influence over the selecti on of the individual and it gives up the opportunity to consider the individual s merits in ddition congressional committees may have greater difficulty obt aining testimony from an appointee who has not been confirmed by th senate as previously mentioned the senate usually gains during the confirma tion process commitment from the nominee to respond to requests to come before committees of the senate77 this commitment may

under most circumstances to obtain testimony an argument could be made that congress has the authority to call most officers with operational duties regardless of appointment status before its committees as practical matter however the commitment obtained at the time of confirmation may make this process easier for congress congress could strengthen its oversight ability by stipulating in law that all officers w ith operational responsib ilities are obligated to respond to congressional co mmittees of jurisdiction political considerations several participants in the political process including congress the president agency heads and interest groups have political stake in the arrangements by which the number and distribution of pas positions are determined congress although certain highlevel policymaking positions such as secretary and administrator are routinely subject to the advice and consent of the senate many subordi nate pas positions require c onfirmation because congress asserted its constitutional prerogative that is some members of congress saw need at some point to establish each pa s position as an advice and consent position thus it might be difficult to change the appointment method for such positions if the interest in asserting that prerogative is ongoing it could be argued that the confirmation process in general provides the senate with leverage during negotiations with the president over related and unrelated matters the perception that reducti on in the number of pas positions might reduce this leverage might add difficulty to the process of changing the appointment method for positions presently filled throug h the pas process it might also be perceived however that the reduction in the number of pas positions would be limited and that the remaining pas positions might provide congress with nearly the same level of levera ge as now exists if the appointment method for some positions were changed members of congress particularly sena tors might have less influence in the selection of appointees to these positions than they now enjoy the perception that congressional influence might be diminished in this way might lead to difficulties in selecting pas positions for reduction this might be partic ularly true for statelevel positions such as us attorney us marshal and district judge because of the significant role that homestate senators often play in their selection the president the president stands to ga in if pas positions are converted into political appointments by him alone or by agency heads political appointees of this type who do not need senate conf irmation could be more responsive and accountable to the president than they would otherwise be with their primary allegiance to the president or agency head they might be more likely to implement energetically the presidents management and policy priorities such appointeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs25 would not have made commitments to the senate during the confirmation process nor would they necessarily have devel oped relationships w ith senators and congressional staffers during the appointment process the administration would have more latitude in termining if and under what circumstances appointees would be permitted to testify before congressional committees this discretion would not be absolute however since cong ress would continue to have other points of political leverage such as the appropriations process agency heads although agency heads are aligned politically with the president they are likely to prefer where possible to have significant leeway in the selection of appointees to positions within their organizations this would permit them to exercise the greatest control over the implementation of policy and management goals in their agencies the white house often consults with agency leaders when making appointments to pr esidentially appointed positions if pas positions are to be filled through anot her appointment method however agency heads might benefit most when such positions are converted to noncareer ses positions to which individuals are appointed by the agency head interest groups various politically active groups seek to influence the selection of federal policymaking officials the political considerations for these groups are likely to vary depending on severa l factors to the degree that group is more strongly aligned with and has greater influence with one party or another it is likely to prefer that the appointment pr ocess be centered where its preferred party is in power because of the rights accorded the minority in the senate and the power of individual senators some interest groups might prefer the advice and consent process even if the party with which they are affiliated does not control the chamber senate allies c ould serve to check the appointment power of the president as the constitution contemplates the preference of an interest group for particular appointment method might be influenced so by the political advantage associated with certain level of visibility in some cases an interest group might prefer the greater visibility of senate hearings for nominee b ecause they might serve to highlight certain policy issues furthermore even if the preferred candidate of the group is not confirmed rejec tion in the senate can some times serve to galvanize the supporters of the policies of the reject ed nominee in other cases however an interest group might prefer to work behi nd the scenes at the agency level to support particul ar appointment options for congressional consideration option 1 maintain the status quo congress could maintain the current number and distribution of pas positions under this option the number of pas positions would not be systematically re duced and the primary means by which congress would determine which positions w ould be subject to advice and consent would be through the legislative process the present arrangements are firmly grounded in the constitution and provide institutional and po litical benefits to congress especially the senate arguably appointees who are confir med by the senate could be more responsive to congress than those who are not as noted above during confirmation most nominees agree to testify as requested before committees of congress makinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs26 78 as noted above the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 directs each agency head to submit an advice and consent position reduction plan with specified contents to the president the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform within 180 days of enactment pl 108458 section 8403csuch cooperation somewhat easier to obtain th an it would be otherwise in addition relationships may be built between the nominee and committee staffers or senators during the confirmation process relationships that may be helpful in resolving substantive issues arising at later date senators also may obtain during confirmation nominees commitment to particular action senators also may use the confirmati on process as vehicle for oversight nomination hearings offer an opportunity to review programs in depth under the present arrangements senators also gain political leverage through the use of holds for example that they can use during negotiations with the president or other senators senators enjoy as well signif icant influence in the appointment of home state officials eg us attorneys mars hals and district court judges when the president is of the same party finally continuation of the status quo would avoid the process of selecting positions to be filled through other ppointment methods which might prove politically difficult although continuation of the status quo ppears to offer many institutional and political benefits to senators there are potential drawbacks for the senate as noted at the beginning of this report commi ssions and task forces as well as some members of congress have been calling for changes in the appointment process the salience of this issue might grow as agencies submit statutorily required pas position reduction plans78 to the degree that the senate becomes identified with the problems in this process it could lose so prestige as an institution in addition the committee consideration process particularly for higherlevel nominations consumes significant time and resources that might be used for other important matters each of these drawbacks might be magnified if as has happened in the past the number of pas positions increases the status quo has disadvantages for the president as well the president is held accountable by the public and congress for the daytoday management of the federal bureaucracy sharing appointment power with congress may hinder the presidents ability to carry out management reforms as well as his political agenda if his appointees are accountable both to congress and to him option 2 create an advisory commission congress could create an advisory commission to study the number and distribution of pas positions and make recommendations on an agencybyagency basis for the reduction or increase of positions such an advisory commission might study from congressional perspective the pas position reduction plan s provided by agency heads or it might make an independent assessment without c onsideration of those plans congress then could consider the commissions recommendations and implement them as appropriate one benef it of this approach is that th subject could be studied outside of the immediate political process providing for more objective assessment of howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs27 79 see for example colton c campbell discharging congress government by commission westport conn praeger 2002 p 11 80 for further information on

might proceed in addition in th short term congress might be seen as responding to perceived problems with the appointment process furthermore when the commission reported its findings cong ress would retain c ontrol over which if any of the recommendations to pursue finally if congress did not act on the recommendations at the time of their release the report could remain available and provide basis for future action to change the appointment process the existence of report with recommendations however might provide political momentum that would favor cong ressional action79 there are several drawbacks to this option one common complaint about the creation of congressional commissions is that their findings are sometimes ignored or marginalized congre ss probably could create commission more easily than implement its recommendations because the institutional and political concerns associated with reduction in positions probably would still exist at the point of implementation congress might increase th likelihood of eventual implementation if the commission comprised highprofile members and if it were charged with considering institutional and political issues during its deliberations one further drawback to this option is that althoug h the commission would be removed from the immediate political process it might be vulnerable to outside influence from political leaders and interest groups this potentia l drawback might be mitigated by balanced representation of variety of interested parties including the president on the commission option 3 establish military base closuretype procedure congress could establish an expedited or f asttrack procedure to facilitate the selection of pas positions for reduction80 such procedure could be modeled on the one established by law during the 1980s and 1990s for military base closure and realignment81 this process was used severa l times in the 1990s and new round of base closures in 2005 was authorized by the fy2002 defense authorization act82 the current process involves the secretary of defense the president congress and commission whose members are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate so of the nominees are recommended by the speaker of the house the house minority leader and the senate majority and minority leadershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs28 83 joint resolution requires passage in both hous and the approval of the president and has the force of law congress may override presidential veto of joint resolution by twothirds vote of both chambersthe process in brief begins with the submission to congressional defense committees by the secretary of proposed and then final criteria to be used by the secretary in forming recommendations rega rding closure or realignment these criteria become final unless congress disapproves the secretary then submits recommendations based on these criteria to the commission following this the commission modifies the recommendations and submits them to the president who can either approve the recommendations as drafted and transmit them to congress or not approve them and explain his reas ons to the commission and congress under the latter circumstance the commission then sends the president revised recommendations for his approva l and transmission to c ongress or his rejection the only way congress can block implement ation of the recommendations at this point is to pass joint resolution of disapproval within 45 days of receiving them during that 45day period constraints on congressional activ ity included time limits on committee consideration time limits on debate and prohibition on amendments83 if congress were to develop similar procedure for reducing the number of pas positions it might include provisions specify ing among other things the following the role of the administration in the process the structure role and authority of commission the role of congressional committees the role of agencies including the role if any of statutorily mandated pas positi on reduction plans limits on debate and amendments and time limits on various portions of the process if congress were to pursue this option th procedure that was established would need to provide for legislative adoption of any recommended changes since advice and consent requirements unlike military bases are set in statute expedited procedures have sometimes proven effective in accomplishing goals that are politically difficult but important to congress the specifics of expedited procedures vary but while they generally include role for the president and for congress the provisions usually limit the ability of members to block the process once it is underway nonetheless congress as whole retains the power in the end to defeat objectionabl legislative proposals some observers of congress argue that the slow deliberative and selective nature of the legislative process acts as check against hasty and unwise laws most expedited procedures limit members rights to debate and amend legislation and thereby sidestep two of the hallmarks of congressional process in addition to frustrating members ability to address their individual concerns it could be argued that these limitations close off an important avenue of legislative refinement

congress senate committee on governmental affairs the state of the presidential appointment process hearings 107th cong 1st sess april 45 2001 washington gpo 2002 p 15 86 prior to 1952 number of positions in the bu reau of internal revenue including some 64 collectors of internal revenue were advice and consent positions following series of scandals president harry s truman submitted to congress reorganization plan abolishing these positions and establishing new positions unde r the classified civil service under the reorganization act of 1949 resolution of di sapproval from either house of congress would have defeated the plan such resolu tions failed to pass in both the house and the senate and the plan went into effect on march 14 1952 under the reorganization plan only the commissioner of internal revenue continued to be pas position 87 in 1952 president truman submitted reorgani zation plan for the bureau of customs but it was disapproved by the senate and did not go into effect in 1965 president lyndon b johnson submitted similar plan to congress and with neither the house nor the senate passing resolution of disapproval the plan went into effect on may 26 1965 under the reorganization plan 53 pas positions were elim inated and all positions in the bureau were put into the civil service the functions of the abolished positions were redelegated by the secretary of the treasury 88 prior to 1970 postmasters throughout the unite d states were appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate as part of the postal reorganization act that year congress established that the postmaster general would appoint postmasters in the continuedparticular this option would give the senate less contro l over the process than it now has or than it probably would have under some other options option 4 select categori of positions for reduction congress could opt to use categories such as military foreign service and public health officer positions judgeships ambassadorships and executivelevel positions when selecting which offices to continue as pas positions this is essentially the approach suggested by the presidential appointee initiative in one of its recommendations the congress should enact legislation pr oviding that senate confirmation only be required of appointments of judg ambassadors executivelevel positions in the departments and agencies and prom otions of officers to the highest rank 010 in each of the service branches84 in testimony before the senate committee on governmental affairs former director of the white house office of presid ential personnel robert j nash also recommended categories for reduction i also think we should consider reducing the number of parttime board and commission members who are confirmed by the senate examples could include the national endowment for the humanities and agencies that dont have security national defense those kinds of responsibilities85 this method has been used before for example collectors of internal revenue86 collectors of customs87 and postmasters88 were all converted from pas positions tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs30 88 continued competitive civil service the goal of this change was to establish meritbased management for the newly reorganized postal service in addition the change removed appointments to several thousand lowerlevel positions from the purview of the senate 89 the presidents reorganization authority wh ich was codified at 5 usc 901912 lapsed in 1984 and has not been renewed since see crs report rl 30876 the presidents reorganization authority review and analysis by ronald c moe 90 article ii section 2 cl 2competitive service positions during reorganizations of the agencies within which they resided two of these three reorganizations were accomplished through presidential reorganization author ity which is currently dormant89 the constitution uses categoriesamba ssadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court90to specify which positions must be filled through appointment by the president with the advice and consent of the senate congress might elect for example to remove categorically from pas status all military coast guard foreign service pub lic health or noaa officer appointments and promotions below the top ranks rem oving any one of these categories would greatly reduce the number of pas positions but probably lead to little loss of political and institutional benefit such an action might have symbolic as well as real impact and might build political momentum for further changes in addition it might lead to greater efficiency in carrying out promotions at agencies and in the armed forces retaining top officer positi ons in pas status arguably could provide congress with more focused and theref ore meaningful control and accountability than it has at present because of routinized approaches to th categories of nominations which are usually considered bloc this option may be least likely to have any impact on the issues of concern to commissions and task forcesnamely that the appointment process is too long and inefficient in addition some officer corps and other appointees may value senate c onfirmation as matter of tr adition or prestige and the use of alternative methods for such ppointments might have negative impact on morale option 5 reduce the number of positions by function congress could elect to reduce the number of pas positions according to the functions of the positions for example assistant secretar ies for policy might continue to be pas positions while assistant secretaries fo r public affairs coul d be appointed by departmental secretaries under the assumption that in general officers in programmatic positions exercise more po licymaking discretion than those in non programmatic positions congress might opt to require advice and consent for the former and not the latter some would argue however that there are few purely nonpolicymaking apolitical functions at the leadership levels of agencies for example an argument could be made that general counsels are staff positions that involve providing neutral legal advice from this point of view agency heads should be entitled to appoint neutral competent senior executives to ch positions but in some cases generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs31 91 john h trattner the 2000 prune book washington brookings institution press 2000 p 72 92 this includes presidential appointments not requiring senate confirmation and schedule c and noncareer ses appointme nts as described above 93 the department of education had 4572 employees and 17 pas positions while the department of defense had 670724 employ ees and 51 pas positions employment statistics are from us office of personnel management federal civilian workforce statistics employment and trends as of january 2003 washington aug 2003 p 13 pas position information is from crs report rl31346counsels may have considerab influence in the policy arena for ex ample offices of general counsel are often involve d preparing legislation commenting on legislation to omb conductin g regulatory and legislativ clearance defending the agency against legal challenges helping to draft agency testimony and briefing those who deliver it all of which involve policymaking discreti on approaches of general counsels range from providing information about whether or not action is legal to devising plans that will achieve the objective identifying risks and developing options for pursuing and obtaining policy goals91 option 6 distribute pas positions in proportion to agency size congress also could approach the effort to reduce the number of pas positions by attempting to distribute pas positions in relation to the size of each agency under this approach those depar tments with greater number of career employees and non pas political appointees92 would have greater number of pas positions the logic behind this option is that congress as co manager of the federal bureaucracy should have proportional number of accountable appointees throughout the agencies analogous to the span of control in traditional management hierarchies at present the distribution of pas positions across agenci varies widely for example as of january 2003 the department of educati on employed 269 people for every fulltime pas position while the partment of defense ratio was 13151 to one93 to the degree that pas appointees ar more accountable to congress this option might help to make accountability across the agencies more uniform it appears to be rational approach to administering the federal government if congress sees itself as co manager of the bureaucracy this method has potential drawbacks as well however first members may have particular policy areas of greater concern than others and may prefer to have more pas appointees in these areas in addition the interest in strong oversight and accountability might be stronger in some areas than others some arenas may be seen as more the province of the president and therefore congre ss may expect less direct accountability it should also be noted that this approach mig ht be more likely to result in an increase in the number of pas positions members might see the need for greater numbers of pas positions to mitigate high ratios and be reluctant to give up such positions where lower ratios already exist finally the workload for senate committees with jurisdiction over large departments such as the armed services committee could be greatly increased option 7 delegate selecti on of positions for reduction to committees of jurisdiction congress might ask congressional committeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs32 94 31 usc 504bwhich are likely to have the closest expe rience with particular positions to suggest which pas positions would be appropriate to appoint th rough another method this approach could provide more focused congressional control over the reduction process it would place the first step in the decision making process where it is likely to serve congresss institutional interests committees are familiar with oversight and accountability needs and might be most ab to assess where less direct control through the confirmation pro cess might be workable in addition proponents of reduction in the number of pas positions mig ht be more likely to get cooperation on the senate floor if committees have had significant input in to their areas of greatest concern this option has several potential drawbacks however first committees do not have an incentive to suggest significant reductions in the number of pas positions it could be argued that they would be gi ving up some authority while the only benefit might be possible reduction in workloa d second this approach has explicit avenue of input for the president an appr oach that is rational from the point of view of congressional committees might not yield an outcome that is rational from the point of view of the presid ents priorities or management goals finally it could prove difficult to determine target number of positions to convert for each committee and it might therefore be difficult to provide committees with specific targets some committees have jurisdic tion over many appoin tments others few option 8 establish restricti ons on appointments to certain positions congress could change the appoi ntment method for number of pas positions and then restrict the presidents appointment authority for some of those positions for example congress could speci fy in statute qualifications required for the holders of certain positions curre nt law includes number of examples of such requirements including the provisions for appointment of the controller at the head of the office of fede ral financial management the controller shall be appointed fro m among individuals who possess 1 demonstrated ability and practical experience in accounting financial management and financial systems and 2 extensive practical experience in financial management in large governmental or business entities94 alternatively congress could specify process for determining the appropriate qualifications for the position either appr oach could allow congress to retain some control over the qualities of the appointed individual while reducing the number of pas positions another way for congress to restrict the presidents appointment power might be to specify that he must appoint from among nominees submitted to him by particular organizations or offices fo r example the 11 members of the nuclear waste technical review board shall be appointed by the president from among the not less than 22 persons nominated by the national academy of sciences thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs33 95 42 usc 10262b 96 31 usc 304b1nominees in turn must meet number of qualifications including being eminent in field of science or engineering95 to the degree that congresss concern is to influence the qualifications of pas appointees and prevent unqualified people fro m being appointed this option offers possible way of doing so without goin g through the advice and consent process the option does not address other institutional and political concerns however including the potential loss of political leverage oversig ht and accountability option 9 require notification by president of some nonpas appointments congress could reduce the num ber of pas positions and require that the president notify appropriate members of congress eg leaders in each chamber relevant committee chairs upon appoi ntment of an individual to some or all of these positions the notification coul d be required to incl ude the qualifications of the appointee and the reasons for his or her selection notification period also could be specified this requirement would be similar to present statutory requirements for removal of incumbents from certain positions for example the us code provides that if the president dis misses the director of the mint the president shall send message to the senate giving the reasons for removal96 this option might mitigate the loss of congressional authority with regard to certain positions it would provide congress with an intermediate leve l of involvement in the appointment process for certain positi ons although senators might lose the opportunity to evaluate qua lifications before the appointment and the political leverage associated with the confirmatio n process for the particular position this approach could maintain greater level of accountability from the president for his appointment choices than would be th case if notification were required comparison of options the options delineated above reflect di fferent approaches to congressional determination of the numbe r and distribution of pas positions in the federal bureaucracy each balances the range of institutional and po litical considerations differently the first option maintaining th status quo is the default option since it continues the present appointment arra ngements it probably offers the least institutional and political risk for members particularly senators this choice may have political consequences however if observers blame congress particularly the senate for lengthening appointment pr ocess for increasing numbers of important positions already commissions such as those mentioned above have drawn attention to perceived shor tcomings in the appointment process for positions subject to senate confirma tion as noted above the sub mission of pas position reduction plans by agency heads as required by the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act might increase the salience of this issue if political momentum for changes to the appointment process grow s in the future congress might at some point have less political control over the reform agenda than it now has for this reason congress might benef it politically from reduction in the number of pashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs34 97 us constitution art i section 3positions even if the benefits to the appoi ntment process of such reduction are not clear it is unclear to what degree such benefits might offset the potential political drawbacks if congress opts to reduce the numbe r of pas positions functional or proportional distribution approach might best protect its institutional interests functional approach would llow congress to maintain greater role in and give closer attention to higherpriority func tions proportional distribution approach might lead to more uniform accountability to congress across departments and agencies alternatively it could be argued that committees with oversight responsibilities are in the best position to determine where congress needs the most accountability and that their recommendations should be given the greatest weight in reduction process any perceived ss of senatorial authority resulting from reductions under these methods might be mitigated by the establishment of restrictions or notification procedures for certain positions longer subject to advice and consent requirements the adoption of an expedited procedure might afford congress the least control over the process and serve its institutional interests least well the institutional interests of the president as managerinchief may be best served when positions involve political ppointments without the advice and consent of the senate and have associated qualifications or other restrictions political appointees who are not confirmed by the nate might be more responsive to the president than they would be if they were approved by the senate as well increased allegiance from such appointees might strengthen the presidents ability to take care that the laws be faithfully executed97 from this perspective any of the options that convert pas positions to positions involvi ng political appointments not subject to advice and consent would be preferable to the status quo the establishment of an expedited procedure might be the most preferred option if the president were accorded significant role in selectin g which positions should longer require senate confirma tion of nominees two of the options identified above address potential political challenges associated with pas position reductions first the reduction process might be centered in the committees so that committees would suggest lists of positions for consideration committees might be best ab to suggest which pas positions could be converted to nonpas status at the west political cost nonetheless it might prove too politically difficult in this way to select significant number of positions for conversion since senate committees have vested interest in continuing to participate in the confirmation of appoint ees to positions within their jurisdiction alternatively the political difficulties associated with selecting pas positions for reduction could be circumvent ed by centering the selec tion process outside congress in commission with or without an expe dited procedure although this method might be the most politically feasible op tion it arguably might have significant institutional costs as discussed abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32212crs35 if members of congress envision the reduction of the number of pas positions as first step toward comprehensive reform of the appointment process the magnitude of the reduction might not be as important as it would be if such reduction were viewed as an end in itsel f even if the reduction achieved did not significantly improve the functioning of the senate or reduce the length of the appointment process it might establish coalition of proponents of reform who could work together for further changes such an achievement also could serve to provide precedent and momentum for furt her pas position reductions or reform of various parts of the vetting process combination of approaches when institutional and political factors are considered congress might choose to develop process that combines severa l of the options above for example the initial process might involve group of re presentatives from various congressional committees so that political considerations could be incorporated the process might begin with categorization of the pool of pas positions into principal officers and inferior officers the former group w ould be exempt from the remainder of the process for constitutional reasons the re maining pool might be further categorized in other ways it could be divided into routine and nonroutine or fulltime and part time appointments for example these gr oups of positions could be further assessed along functional lines to see if there is common agreement that certain functions do not require the closest attention of congre ss positions also could be assessed by department and agency to determine wh ether congress would be weakened as an institution by decrease in the number of pas positions in particular organization in some cases the statutorily require d pas position reduction plans or further specified study by commission or task force might assist congress in its determinations if such process proved to be politically untenable congress might opt to create an expedited procedure for the reduction of positions for some of the positions with changed appointment met hods congress might establish statutory qualifications or other rest rictions on the presidents appointment authority in addition or instead congress might estab lish appointment notif ication requirements for newly converted positions this is just one example of the way the options discussed above might be combined whatever additional legislative action it might elect to pursue with regard to determining the number and distribution of pas positions in the federal bureaucracy congress might include sunset provision so that appointment provisions would revert to their preexisting status after some period of time unless congress acted to make the changes permanent if some members were uncertain about the impact of certain changes this provision could pr ovide trial period to allow congress to assess whether the benef its of the changes outweighed any drawbacks
