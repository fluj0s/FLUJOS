the itsa line cont lecture given on 21 august 1963 whats the date audience august 21st twentyfirst twentyfirst august ad 13 all right we could cover an awful lot of stuff here be very easy to do the main things in which you are involved at the present moment probably look far more complicated to you than they are im going to talk to you some more about the tone arm and the itsa line and forms of sessions things look to you lot more involved than they actually are sitting somewhere back of every thetans bank is some tremendous insecurity in which he believes implicitly that the universe is dangerous or that he himself is in danger or that he cannot live or survive as powerful being and whatever that state is and however that state is created originally is not particularly germane to this lecture but the discovery of the itsa line may look to you to be highly simple little thing perhaps even duplication of psychoanalysis after all they talked and if you didnt know anything about the itsa line you could draw all sorts of wild conclusions you see make the mistake of saying well its communication line and therefore any communication line is an itsa line and therefore if you let anybody talk about anything why he will get better we already know if you let fellow talk on an entheta line very long hell run his havingness out the bottom so the complexities of the itsa line are really quite something it sits on tremendous amount of technology but in itself is very simple to understand theres nothing much to understanding it if you understand it youd seeyoud see actions like this very readily and immediately and these actions would be something like this pc said ii dont know whether it waslets see now it wastwenty twenty twentyi guess about twenty years ago and the fellow said uhi dont know what he said but i know what i think about it i i i know that ii know i think it was big swindle of some kind or another and come to think about it i dont know whether i said that or he said that auditor it reads that he said it oh wait minute what happens at this point what occurred there exactly well you know at once what occurred if you know the itsa line the auditor put in the itsa with the meter leaving the pc in zone and area of insecurity now we say all right the line plot the line plot that tells the pc what items are in the gpm see just like that see so obviously we say well this to some degree puts in the itsa line for the pc well that could be said to but we get across the proposition of the lesser of two evils if youve ever seen pc wrapped around telephone pole with undisclosed charge from running gpm he knew not knot of or did not know any of the elements of you will use line plots if the thing is known line plot we will use it why because that was predesigned plot in the first place it was an otherdetermined designyou understand that somebody else determined the design whats important about it is the charge that is on it and whats important in the auditing is to get off the charge and get the pc to identify to his own reality that itsa see if the line plot you handed him on sheet of paper didnt agree with the thing he was running you will very shortly hear about it he can get wrapped around telegraph pole with great speed but thats shadow of putting in an itsa line isnt it thats shadow of putting in the itsa line with the pcbut necessary action now ill give you its similar borderline pc says oh its twenty years ago it was fifteenno its eighteeneighteen fourtwenty twenty two its twentytwo yeari think it was twentytwo year itit must have been twentyfivethirty twentyoneii dont know i dont know i just dont know when it was he quit see he quit cold what you going to do sit there with pc who has quit cold or are you going to say all right ill give you hand was it more than twenty years ago less than twenty years ago was it twenty years ago all right its more than twenty years ago is it more than twentyfive years ago less than twentyfive years ago less than twentyfive years ago you got some idea of it now yeah it was twentythree years ago or was it more than twentyfive less than twentyfive it was less than twentyfive twentythree twentythree im getting read here on twentythree yeah it was twentythree get that so you didnt totally put in the itsa line see you could start putting the itsa line in and the pc catches the ball put it almost totally in and the pc catches it see and get right onto the hour and the minute and the pc never caught it but at least you dont have something wrong dated and those are the gradients of putting in the itsa line and the last oneits little bit of lose to have to put it all the way in for the pc see all right now look at the length of time you and other fellows around have been stumbling around on this planet theres number of thousands of years and the number of thousands of years youve been in the marcab confederacy are quite numerous they probably run up to two or three hundred thousand years that youve been inside this system and let call to your attention never during that time could you put your foot on the first step of the road which led back to better life and some happiness and freedom see you couldnt get foot on that road at all all right right now you have technology you have map the map has got all kinds of blank spots in it but nevertheless theres the type of map it is dont you see and those are persuasions toward an itsa line and the only time you totally losethe only time you totally loseis when you have to put the whole itsa line in give somebody the pattern for goal all right he has to list for the actual goal in that sequence and find it and he has to list for and get the top oppterm to make it in order to fit the pattern and then hes got to fit the pattern together and this is an awful lot of itsa see well all right so youve got the preprinted pattern give him this and he just reads it off you understand this is less desirable but its still feasible all right now lets put it totally in lets put it totally in lets just hit him with lightning bolt so that he cant contact any of the facsimiles in it and we have medical psychiatry see the evil involved in this is putting in an itsa line in such way as to have self determinism power of choice left in the pc at all total wipeout of power of choice dont you see now you can fall short of that in various degrees little kid is going around see hes real unhappy about the whole thing hes real unhappy about life and hes walking around in circles and so forth and you say to him that is your bed well you havent really done very much for him but you have improved his state of mind or his peace see just to that degree you understand you say that is your bed nevertheless you have put in the itsa line he himself has not found out that it is his bed you see but look hes still very happy to have the bed now when we get down into pure unadulterated evil we get denial of the itsa line and we go into aberration creation of see this whole thing inverts and we get kucdeiofthat whole scale of means of perverting the itsa line now those means well include an inability to ever find anything an inability to reach anything and so forth well now medical psychiatry to amend what i was saying moment ago is of the inclination that it is better you see for nobody to have anything to do with anything see see that now look at that as an inversion thats an inversion of the fact now the aberration of this lineperversion of this itsa linehas to be very direct in order to be very aberrative you have to pervert the line you seejust outrightly put in something false or put nothing there you see and so on or inhibit very directly and you have to work at it it has to be worked at and so on given the slightest chance why the pc will start putting in his itsa line but what does he put his itsa line in on all right lets take freudian analysis he puts in his itsa line on childhood sexual incidents theyre not aberrative anybody get anyplace old papa freud did contribute something he said there was possibility great lets applaud him for that but he was putting the itsa line in in directions that didnt wind up with anything and then after he got through he put the line in totally the practitioner put the line in see he said the reason why you are aberrated now is we have finally found out that you had fetish going you had fetishism and actually your little brothers right shoe has aberrated your whole existence and that is whythat is why you are always talking about the feet on chairs you see and now weve got this all explained and you are better now thats all very fine but he didnt look at the hypnotic character of the statement you are better thats putting in the itsa line all right we got some guy walking around in circles out here lets take look at these various gradients of putting in the itsa line for somebody youll gradually see what im talking about and what im driving at here got some guy walking around in circles and man he doesnt know which way to turn hes got lumbosis and hes been aberrated by hearing of psychiatrist when he was young and hes got all kinds of things you see hes having hard timehaving hard time and you say something can be done about it well youve put in some variety of itsa line havent you and thats what you call hope factor and this guy very often responds to this and he feels much happier about this dont you see you see thatthat the hope factor then is to that slight degree putting in the itsa line see its not really much of an itsa line youre not sayingbut youre saying it is notit is not hopeless see youre sort of putting in negative line for him little bit there and you carry him along you see as we look at this problem well see that there are various degrees of putting in the itsa line for somebody see there are various degrees of this and these things vary from the very very evilwhich is to say hand guy pomegranate and say thats bomb see thats putting in false itsa line they vary from that up to awell making it impossible for him to put it in thats lower grade making it impossible for the person to put in an itsa line varies up to the little necessary actions necessary to begin the flow of the itsa line see and these little necessary actions are such as start of session and the basic intent is what makes the difference thats the first fundamental difference although this too can go too far but the basic intent is what makes the most fundamental difference do you intend to improve this persons itsaing ability or do you intend to knock it into cocked at which so it begins right there with the intention and that gives you the difference between the cowboys in the white hats and the cowboys in the black hats see and its right there man bang intention decrease this persons ability to itsacowboys in the black hats intention by some or any means to improve this persons ability to itsacowboys in the white hats thats good and evil defined in terms of the itsa line thats the difference between freedom and slavery thats the difference between making freemen and making slaves you make slaves by the intention to decrease the ability to put in the itsa line thats how you make slave and that gives you the whole textbook of how to make slaves right there complete with gold letters and chainpattern cover and the other way is to improve the persons ability to itsa in other words to identify to spot to find out and there we have that point from which we can separate the scientologist from the medico we can separate the decent civilizations from the lousy ones we can go right on through there this quarter of the universe by the way is suffering from an overdose of lousy civilization see thats what its suffering from it apparently has been recently conquered in recent times in the last few hundred thousand years but those who were conquered had already been their governmental actionshad already been set up for their own failure see theyd been set up to be conquered by using themselves mental technology which made slaves they implanted their own troops ohhohoho hohohoho ahahahahahahahah were going to plant somebody up to be loyal soldier to fight bravely to never give up his body so long as it is alive to be true to the empire were going to plant somebody are we remember every one of those items we put in to stick has to have ä negative item and that doesnt just cut it down 50 percent that puts it in the betrayal line it cuts it down enormously because some empire that would do this to somebody gets their support like giving them the itch see yeah well help the general out you know help him into the car so that he goes through the other side and falls out the opposite door you know its an accident you know when the planes take off half their motors dont run you know just theyre just running up against total sabotage because theyve already got slave empire and you may be able to force group by slavery and so forth into semblance of civilization but its only ever semblance theres never anything to which anybody freely wholeheartedly contributes it has strength it has power because remember 50 percent of the implant is dont be good soldier and then the fact that the implant occurred at all of course is enough to knock ones loyalty in cocked hat lets take an earlier and probably still extant organization the galactic confederacy eighty trillion years smooth as glass implanting interesting i dont know the exact length of the espinol confederacy but its probably something on the order of few hundred thousand years implantsno empire the figures read themselves rome died at the hands of her slaves thats for sure she was never conquered by the barbarians i know it looked very nice in the history books but the truth of the matter is who wanted to fight for rome you get through with war you come home you find out the slave civilization has already taken over the farms theres need for your production theres need for freeman there was pay to be freeman that was the reward and the pat on the back for having fought through the wars you see and it started going into civilwar situation and half of the roman empire was always fighting half of the roman empire i dont remember the exact name of the battle it doesnt occur to i read it in gibbon and its probably wrong in gibbon and got cluttered up on itits either messana or something like that but the reason the first barbarians got to rome was becauseshe didnt have very large numbers in her armies but forty thousand of her firstline troops lay dead at messala in civil war caused by unrest caused by slavery and they had firstline troops that was practically the entire callup of the empire and historians today trace back to that battle as the reason the barbarian was able to conquer the thing well you trace back the battle and you find the battle came because of civil war and we find out why the civil war came and it came by slavery the american civil war that destroyed one of the better agricultural areas of america and so forth was again battle about slavery one way or the other every time you have slavery you have trouble see you dont even have to be sentimental about it you dont have to be sentimental you can be terribly statistical you dont have to say its good or its bad or anything else you dont have to beat the drum for it or be person who wants to reform things or something like that just look at the statistics slavery never pays off thats it thats that its dangerous if anything is dangerous its slavery you dont suppose america would be having very much trouble right now with its race riots and 250 thousand negroes about to converge on washington and so forth if they hadnt kicked off this slavery and its very funny but the most involved people in american slavery were the bostonians used to have what they called the triangle trade theyd send ships loaded with rum down to africa use the rum to buy blacks as they referred to them use the whip and christianity on them to bring them back over and they traded in the blacks down around the west indies and so forth for sugar cane and they brought the sugar cane up to boston and they made rum and they shipped the rum to africa and they just had that worked out and practically the first families of boston are founded directly on slavery kennedy missed that he wasnt there at thatfamily wasnt in america at that particular time his family got out from underneath another type of slavery the landowner the absentee landlord the high ratesthis type of economic slavery and so forth and these things go back to roots in other words we have catastrophes in all directions we have the catastrophe of boston the catastrophe of kennedy weve got situation here whereby you trace world trouble and you trace it straight back to slavery im not trying to beat the drum for anything why do you think russia cant get its feet under itself and why is everybody having such hard time with the russians and why are the russians so silly as to evolve slave economy such as communism and so forth whats all this fuss well this fuss goes back to the idea in early russian history that man belonged to the land and when you sold the land you sold the man with it well the european civilization got out from underneath that two or three centuries before and russia has not yet got out from underneath that she is still carrying the burden of her past chains and therefore she cant think straight shes like trying to get pc to think in the middle of session you know cant do it thats little more touching picture than they actually are painting actually what i think is is the white russian prince and that sort of fellow you see he went back to the betweenlives area and he came back and he picked up body and became commissar i dont think theyve really changed their faces very much but the trouble with world affairs today is slavery the greatest empire earth ever had went down in the dust with slavery the british empire right now is having rough time and is staggering around because of its efforts to colonise and to do this and to do that and do something about this and to free man and not to free man and somehow or another to hold him in economic duress dont you seeand not let him free but then to let him free andyou know you got all this trouble down here in africa running around in one way or the other well thats the sort of trouble you get when you suddenly start taking the lid off something that has had the lid nailed down on for very long time you see and without anybody around who really knows much about it why we get those boys going back into slavery too first action of new african ruler is ordinarily to throw the whole opposition in jail because they are insufficiently enslaved by his regime you see this viewpoint this viewpoint now im not discoursing on this just because i have bee in my bonnet about it because i frankly couldnt care less as far as this planet is concerned itll never get out of any mess unless we get it out of that mess and im just using the situation just to show you the liabilities of slavery you always get lash backalways because thetan never gives up thats it he really never gives up hes lying there he might look awful quiet he might look terribly dead he might look like he doesnt interfere with anything you see but in actual fact he really never gives up hes got some trick you can put him in jail immobilize him wrap him all up in adhesive tape and electric cord and so forth and he gets even with you he sits there and thinks how hes right he even goes down to that point see he can hold that postulate clear on down through the lowest levels of unconsciousnessthat he was right well i think thats very interesting because if he ever gets out of it hell go on being right see if he ever gets out of it hell go on being right about what he was being right about before he got put in that state in other words the effort to dominate the effort to dominate and deny power of choice is the road that this universe walked toward the hell it became fearthe unlovely specter of fear stands ahead of all of those lets trace this out very carefully to survive all right very good this guy wants to survive whatever put him in the state of mind that he had to survive because this is your biggest piece of nonsense thetan cant possibly do anything but survive in fact its probably the trouble with him and thats certainly the trouble governments and things have with him thats the trouble the marcabians are having with him right now how to kill thetan is the biggest problem in this universe see its just not solvable they thought they had it all solved and we came along see they just never really are able to whip this problem how do you kill thetan well its not an elegant problem to whip now how can beingwho actually cant be struck at who cannot do anything but survive and cannot die who can pass through various lapses of 9t memory and that sort of thinghow can this being get into state of mind whereby hes concerned about survival well it takes quite lot of trickery to do that usually its on the extension of self into possession like making minion you mock mockup up and then you endow it with some life you see and then somebody comes along and starts to kick its head off so you protect it and you identify yourself with it or you construct civilization and identify itself with it and youre trying to get the civilization to survive so that eventually you get worried about your own survival you see the mistake which has to be made there that mistake actually has to be made directly before thetan gets worried about his own survival in other words he has to extend some type of line onto something that he feels cant survive and then identify himself with it to such an extent that he feels his own survival can be affected and this is your first step into aberration all right your next step forward from this is an elementary step because one is now worried about survival one resolves the problem of survival by domination this is not any kind of solution at all its lousy solution but it gets used and is probablythat which is not admired tends to persist that very definitely applies in this particular line because domination is probably the least admired thing in this universe and yet oddly enough is continuously successful but its really not successful so dominationdomination comes in here and we have thetan and thetan b and the way that thetan b is kept from destroying thetan as construction or civilization dont you see is by thetan dominating thetan b you see that is the formula by which this is arrived at so thetan to protect something he wants to have survive therefore seeks to dominate thetan b and then being in frame of mind where he feels he himself cannot survive then he just obsessively goes on and dominates thetans b c d f and g see but he overlooks the fact that if he dominates thetans b d f and g sooner or later thetans b d f and g in their turn are going to dominate do you see because weve set up causeeffect line and the best thing you know about causeeffect linewe may not know much about overtmotivator sequences we know all about the causeeffect line from which the overtmotivator sequence comes and the best thing about those things is that communication contains cause distance effect with intention and duplication and because of the duplication of the intention then any communication line will reverse thats the easiest thing communication line does is reverse because of course it has duplication on both ends its very easy for cause to become effect and effect to become cause because theres duplication in the communication line all you have to do is make slight mistake of which is cause and which is effect and you have the waiters which at one time through the last century served people in black tuxedosyou know the guests all wore black tuxedos and so forthyou have the waiters now wearing black tuxedos you see and you look at any custom as it comes along in this universe you are actually studying the causedistanceeffectduplication aspect of communication line its going to reverse well theres lots of ramifications whereby we protest and we do this and we do that but this fact of any custom you see on this planet at this timeyou could absolutely count on its having been the reverse custom at an earlier date now this makes an awfully broad statement but if you look into it youll see thats the ease you take the clothes today of women and the clothes today of men see well you dont have to look back very far to where you see that that one flipped you see and you look intointo almost any custom you can follow down and you will find out it slipped it went the other way to so the formula of communication and communication itself then is the most important factor in looking for aberration its very elementary why its cause distance effect with intention duplication the duplication factor then makes the c very easily look like the and the look like the c so of course the line can reverse around the other way to and we get all sorts of superstitions about overtmotivator sequences and we get all kinds of things of course thats factual but its simply based upon the nature of communication line we beat somebodys head in and we beat somebodys head in and we beat somebodys head in and we beat somebodys head in of course at cause you have the intention to beat somebodys head in and at effect we have somebodys head being beaten in thats pretty elementary and then one fine day we wake up with headache where did the headache come from well one slipped one slipped one made misidentification of the c and the on the line see it was quite accidental youre reading book by montaigne or something and it said and thy servant he is man too see something like this you know guy just you know just blah i dont even know if montaigne said that but you have to add these erudite points when you dont have your quotation dictionary handy besides i usually find out i can make up better quotations than they said anyhow i figure out their works were culled i used to work on the basis that if you wrote enough words youd say something clever and that saying things clever was usually solved in the field of philosophy by writing enough words see just by law of averages you would eventually be clever anyway fifty thousand monkeys writing for fifty thousand years apparently by accident would write all the books of the world and i think they did anyway you see what happens here now do you see theres switcheroo on these lines and you get what looks like an overtmotivator sequence and almost any pc you audit at the level of homo sapiens and so on has got this so switched that you can absolutely count on ow working but as ive often told you its not highlevel concept see its limited it only goes up so high because it depends upon this error of identification you see but you can always get case result by saying what have you done what have you done because youve freed up now some vicious communication line and its certain that he made misidentification from that point up see and so therefore we can free some somatics or something like that we can practically count on the fact that if some guy has got sore neck that if we just find out what sore necks he has caused we will eventually tear apart couple of facsimiles of some kind or another which will straighten it out and hell cease to have sore neck because he obviously had given somebody else sore neck you see if he has sore neck i mean its that elementary but what is this really based on its based on the misidentification of communication line because of the duplication factor in communication cant communicate without some duplication that duplication of course sneaks up you cant communicate at all without duplication well all right if communication is so dangerous why is any thetan communicating at all well he communicates because he wants to be oriented and were back to why he communicates he wants to be oriented of course i dontthen of course he takes his best tool getting oriented and proceeds to aberrate it by using it to dominate to do people in and to mess up things that he tries to identify with see he messes up his own communication line in other words he misuses his communication line now the communication line is there because hes lost and feels the need of orientation hence his desire for communication theres an insecurity back on along the line which causes him to use this communication line as i say we havent got the full answer as to why that is im just showing you what this comes from and that gives us directly the itsa line so dont regard the itsa line as lowlevel concept its actually scientology five its not scientology one but its used in scientology one and im sure will be used well for long period of time will also be used very blindly in many quarters but lets appreciate what were using were using the obsession to identify which lies back of the communication line but were using principle higher than communication coupled with communication in order to orient and rehabilitate thetan youve made full statement of processing at that moment see except for this one little fact is there anything else earlier that gave this guy an insecurity the original one in the absence of communication is somewhat hard to understand particularly at our states of ease see little bit hard to understand what the devil was it this guy you see isnt communicating he doesnt feel insecure he is not protecting anything he hasnt got any reaching going on he had real reason to reach and so forth how did anybody get to him you can figure out lot of answers to the thing and they all wind up with communication line mixed up in them and of course the moment communication line is mixed up in them you havent got the answer how did he originally feel the need of orientation and familiarization in order to be comfortable see how did he do this how was this done to anybody and how did he do it to anybody else and if so why so there is riddle still sitting there see there is riddle but we have the walkway back to the answer to that riddle and what youre walking on the line of ot is youre walking to the answer of that riddle and the funny part of it is when you put your foot on that which lies on the other side of all of the energy and all of the confusion and all of the overts and all the misidentification and everything elsewhich youre handling right now as cases and auditors seeright on the other side of that just as it took one step to get on the road it only takes one step at the other end of that roadway to suddenly go ot ot is gradient process for long period of time with sudden fantastic upsurge youll get shadows of that upsurge as youre processing somebody you havent made it yet but he all of sudden will do something peculiar hell do something very otishand the next fortyeight hours shake in his boots because you know haha bluuh guy starts to reach for the telephone and it leaps to his ear you know scares hell out of him next session youll spend processing it having happened but thats processable too these are just the lines up but the realization at the other end the solution to that riddle and any of its ramifications determines more or less the state attained in other words processing is the cure of having to be familiarized with things and having to itsa things and so forth the end product of processing is further need to have to do these things and as soon as one attains that further need to have to do one of these things one would find he would suddenly snap back to all of the power that he possibly could want at which moment he probably turns around and hes so mad at everybody because of that time he spent there being right that he rights the various wrongs that he was going to right and he probably will take dip at that point and then hell come back up again and there will be various curves and toboggans along on this road that will probably look very dizzy but thats okay so thats the way it is now were undoingwere undoing thenthis obsession to itsa by using it and because the dependency on it is so great youll never get bank taken apart as far as im concerned until it has been utilized to its full now selfdeterminism pandeterminism personal beingness personal power restored to the individual is done on the road of minimal help maximal recovery of selfdeterminismor maximal recover of selfability to itsa see thats up now as the case goes along its progress is measured directly and immediately by the degree that this is returned into the pcs hands therefore you could get fantastic number of engrams runnow let show you how you can mess this up seeyou get fantastic number of engrams run and fantastic number of gpms run and the pc would be foggy and wouldnt be much alert and so on oh you havent really harmed him youve slowed down the recovery in just this one way by every time the pc says uh let see theres picture here and i think its oh all right ill date it for you is it greater than hundred trillion years ago is it less than hundred trillion years ago was it hundred trillion years ago its less than all right is it greater than eighty trillion years ago less than eighty trillion its less than so forth and so forth the date is soandso and soandso and soandso and the pc says oh all right hmhm okay see see the nonsense involved in this thing and it just goes much more subtly see much more subtly you know i think i must have been one of the brobdingnagians little tiny head shake as one looks at the meter and sees that it didnt read on brobdingnagians but did read on lilliputians see and then oh well i didnt mean anything ihelping you out you actually have the identical problem that mother has auditor and some mamas solve it and some dont they help little roscoe to point where at twentyone little roscoe cant shovel soup into his gullet see of course theres an equal extreme the other way they dont help little roscoe to point where little roscoe at the age of twentyone shoots them puts cyanide in the soup see all of this is happy mean you see and it isnt constant one pc to the next thats what the trouble is because one pc requires more help than another pc because theyre at different levels of independence and you get pc who has very high level of independence and very deep level of aberration and of course youve got trouble i mean the guy cant walk and he keeps putting his feet in the stew and in the mud and everything else and you watch this guy caroming off into doors and it practically hurts you know oh ill do it ill do it and at that moment why spills the tureen over his head you see well thats all within the margin of an auditor thats where his ebb and play comes in is how much does it take to improve this guys independence and selfdeterminism how much does it take to improve his ability to know how much help does he need in order to know and youll find out thats varying quantity see heres this poor guy off the street he doesnt know which end the door is you know and hes helped enormously because you actually show him where the door is it makes him bit better you understand from there on he can find the door he can itsa the door from there on out see so you havent taken all of his itsas away from him all right well thats the extreme case but lets handle that extreme case wrong lets handle this just dead wrong we tell him he never can know where the door is see and lets build him special set of rails so that when he walks toward the door he runs into it and every time he walks around that particular end why hell collide with the door see well at this point of course you have exceeded the degree of in other words you havent helped him at all you have deteriorated his ability and what you want to do is take what ability you have that you find there dont you see and gradually uncreate any dependence that is created and the perfect formula is reduce it see give him all the help he needs to get along and then gradually reduce it that is always safe give him whatever help he needs to get along and then reduce itwhich makes something like 3n into about four or five different routines which is quite remarkable and eventually why he isnt even given line plot but thats getting pretty adventurous dont you see because he can get himself in more trouble without line plot its almost dirty trick to turn somebody loose into wildcat gpm before hes run few that are line plotted you know you can make pc fly but then the pc says i dont thinki dont think i dont think this sequence follows on through this way i think it cuts off someplace here something cuts off well follow your line plot follow your line plot the line plot give the next item the next item thats what i want next item yeah but next item well even if it was there the pc sooner or later is going to be right enough to convince you that it isntbecause you never let him find out now combining all of this nice sense of judgment is the extra bonus of your own flubs because you cannot reduce them to zero dont ever try dont ever go beating your brains out because you get caught in cross plays of communication where you didnt quite understand what the pc said when you thought you did dont you see and so you said then at that timethe pc is saying lets see what was that series we found it was lets see i think i found earlyearlier that such series we found and so on well you say well youve already found it you see its been found for several sessions and its 254 trillion years ago see and hes trying to find this date you see hes trying to reremember what the date is and youre just trying to get the series started see so you say well that wasthat oh youre talking about the 254trillionyearago series he says yeah yeah i guess so i donii doget the you see that isnt the point um and you finally let him stagger through this because youve see flicked his attention and slipped him the mickey with the wrong communication line because you didnt understand that wasnt what he was saying at all hes trying to find that lock incident that defended on the series and his communication being little bit blurry why hes not really communicating what he thinks he is communicating to you so you make mistake on it and because the pcs communication line is so often fogged up in session for an auditor then to do perfect job of handling the communication line is impossible because it depends upon the pcs articulation and communication being perfect sometime pc will say something to you like this well i suppressed my gains for this session and what do you do well is he giving you an itsa is he announcing catastrophe is he getting off suppression see does he want you to do something whats the intention of his communication well maybe he doesnt even know either and almost anything you answer to this youre going to be wrong see so dont go around in fear of being wrong and dont teach people to be afraid that theyre going to mishandle one of these lines because youre teaching them to be afraid of something thats going to be inevitable inevitable the pc all of sudden looks up and he gets stareyeyed look in his eye and he says say i dont think thats true youre running helatrobus implant you see and say i donti dont think thats true and you say well what he says that you know i just dont think it is well what do you do is he talking about the helatrobus implants probability not hes skipped into something whats happened here whats he collided with we dont know all right to ask him for more data than hes got is fatal auditing error so we ask him for more data than hes got and we are in trouble we dont ask him for the data he does have we are in trouble dont you see because these are the troubles of handling an indefinite communication line and troubles always originate the communication line at its source is indefinite so therefore the handling of it becomes situation so that just makes you have to get very slippy and you have to learn various things about the intention line which were not particularly discussing today do you want to tell about it hahahahacut your throat how do you put the pcs attention on anything how do you put his attention on chair you say chair dont you how do you put his attention on house you say house dont you how do you put his attention on date you say date dont you how do you put the pcs attention on the auditor you say auditor dont you do you want to tell about it clang out of session arc break house falling down everything going to pieces gains being wrapped up everything betrayedchrist what happened haha you in vain try to trace back anything you did naturally you tend to blame yourself for it well you in actual fact didnt do anything except inadvertently direct the pcs attention in direction where it wasnt going and give him sudden attention shift because of your misunderstanding of what the pc was talking about in the first place do you see the liabilities of this kind of thing so know how to do it right and do it right most of the time see thats the only thing you can expect and hope for all right this pc itsa line is going to get better to the degree that it is permitted to exist this doesnt mean to the degree that you let the pc talk necessarily it means the degree that you keep the pcs attention directed in directions where he can find things to identify in his bank and when hes found things in his bank to identify let him identify them he saysyou say all right now i want you to take look at that incident there that has the robots in it good all right thats fine all right and he says say yes i know theyre robots well id just say that was too corny for words see all right you keep up that sort of thing with pc very long and you tell him what he is looking at alwayssee it isnt 100 percent proposition there either you sometimes tell pc what hes looking at see you put his attention on the track to some incident that you know is there and he doesnt know is there well youre certainly giving him something to itsa arent you so youve given him something to itsa and hell start itsaing it happy as clam see but if you prevent his itsaing it after you have given it to him to itsa you will see gradual deterioration over period of intensivesnow not one session its long periodof his ability to identify youll see this deteriorating youre creating dependence on your metering you can create dependence on your recognition dependence on his confirmation as to whether or not hes right he says well i dont know if it was the cowboys in the white hats or the black hats and cow you look on the meter he will say look on the meter one of the ways an auditor gets this started is invalidating pcs data he invalidates the pcs data little bit andyou know tends to somewhat and sounds doubtful and the pc sounds thisand finally the pc will say look on the meter and the auditor cuts his throat and looks on the meter see its case of he should say well i believe you i dont have to prove it see if you dont believe look at the meter proper response is well i believe you go ahead tell what it dont look on the meter eventually youll get habit started whereby every time the pc wants to communicate anything to you he convinces you by showing you that it bangs on the needle and his itsa line will start deteriorating see this can be done in various ways thats confirming his itsa line which leaves him with positiveness it leaves him with sensitivity as to whats right and whats wrong well thats an ability that you are trying to improve and if you look on it as an ability that youre trying to improve and as the chief ability which is there to be improved in case you really wont make many mistakes on it your mistakes will be cut to minimum but if you look on case as something from which significances have to be removed in any way that they can be removed regardless of the selfdeterminism of the pc and regardless of his ability and regardless of his knowingness and his recognition and so forth oddly enough you will still make it but youve multiplied your time factor considerably time factor is going way upten to one something like that because youre deteriorating his ability now just auditing the pc in general youll see you will inevitably get an improvement of the ability by the removal of charge now if at the same time youre creating dependency to the degree that youre increasingyou see you can increase and decrease and whereby hes getting more track and more charge in his vicinity his actual potential of improvement is being cut back by his dependency on the itsa of the auditor see it improves anyhow but the auditor is cutting it back and hes just costing himself more auditing time more auditing time more auditing time more auditing time more difficulty more arc breaks more upsets theres many amany way many way by which all this can be handled in various ways see you have what you call an arc breaky type pc well now this pc probably has high degree of independence and probably has high degree of itsa ability already but possibly is bit swamped with charge see all right now we take this pc and we deteriorate his ability to itsa you see by creating dependency on the auditor you know by telling him everything by telling him everything you know that read that didnt read and so on of course the funny part of it istheres one other point of this i should mention in passingif you dont tell pc when an item is finally discharged in the early stages of running gpms hell leave items charged and the mechanics of the bank will cause him to bounce and arc break see so that again is one of these factors whereby youre putting in the itsa lineitsa discharge now but sooner or later the pc is going to start telling you when it is discharged well thats damn well when you better stop telling the pc that its clean do you understand you just better stop telling him at that point ah but youve got an interesting problem here maybe youve stopped telling him at the point where he still cant tell now youre going to have hell raised because youre going to have him stuck in incidents youre going to have ris live all over the place youre going to have his postulates live and so forth i think id start working on campaign on him well run it until youre very sure its flat is the kind of campaign id start running is get that item until youre very sure its flat all right he says thats flat okay say it again good fine youre right thats flat see and he all of sudden see i can tell you you know all right good good see fine and wean him and gradually dont check see dont check say all right i can depend on you because he can tell you eventually when its flat hell also get very bored with an item and leave it halfunflat you can sometimes make citizen out of him by letting him do so trouble is hes liable to have bounced and gone into something else now theres various problems involved here im not trying to tell you this is simple dont get so involved in the problems however that you miss the basic mechanics of the situation basic mechanics of the situation the pc is the one who is living with this bank and if he cant tell whats in it and so forth he cant live with it obvious i mean thats one of these ne plus ultra things youre unfortunately or fortunately not going to be at his side for the next two hundred trillion billion squillion years see youre not going to be there telling him whether it is gpm you see going to have to find this out for himself so sooner or later youre going to have to kick him off with regard to this bank the time to start is when you start auditing him you start auditing him why start weaning him dont increase his dependency decrease it give him all the help he needs but isnt that tricky statement how much help does he need well you know if he doesnt have line plots and design on the track and the concepts of life and that sort of thingif he doesnt have something like thathell never put his foot on the road at all and we know that if he doesnt have line plot for standard gpm that hes got to run and so forth we know hell wrap himself around telegraph pole man hell practically finish himself off by giving you wrong items and upsidedown items and missing items and so forth and the next thing you know why the penalty is much worse than the cure here see well where do we go well how much help do we give him well we give him all the help he needs how much help does he need well that is something you establish individually in each pc youre going to get ahold of some pc sometime or anotheryou know he possibly hasnt been down here long or he got here by accident or something of the sort and this pc cognites on the axioms knocks out the bank does change of space processing between your auditing room and the next building for while goes around and thanks you very much youre left with your jaw dropped because you havent had an opportunity to get your meter on and tested well dont feel so betrayed that you didnt get chance to audit you audited so there are various degrees by which you have to approach this problem and thats the difference of pcs now these very very arc breaky pcs sometimes get reputation for being arc breaky and they get very upset this way and so on its actually where their concept of their own independence is being invidiously cut up by people putting itsas in for them and the charge on the bank is too great so that they get into this stuff and theyll dramatize at the drop of hat and this is upsetting to them its more upsetting to them to dramatize but how did they dramatize they dramatized only because somebody put in the itsa line they were not able to so what do you do with such pc well pc whos routinely arc breaky must obviously have something wrong with the itsa line well he wasnt the result of auditing it was probably something that occurred before auditing because we are not in the business of aberrating people well it must have occurred in some aberrative area well you can do such thing as give them an eighteenbutton prepcheck on the itsa line simple now an eighteenbutton prepcheck is not thrown out by the itsa line because the eighteen buttons are the select choice very best grade straightfromtheocean itsas you realize that prepcheck is almost the perfect series of itsas most powerful buttons so theyre most powerful itsas in existence since the beginning of the universe since your beginning of travail has anything been suppressed wonder how long that would run but thats an itsa because he must have itsad by suppressing so youre getting off the crisscross see if he suppressed it then he can itsa it if you get the suppression off then he can itsa these are almost perfect itsa lines the prepcheck actually comes into its own but very interesting about prepcheck you can prepcheck the itsa line see on that that takes the cake man now you take one of these very arc breaky pcs that has very great reputation for being arc breaky and you put the itsa line into some comprehensible thing very often if you just explain to them what the itsa line is and prepcheck it youll be better off than trying to redefine something because you wont then be prepchecking the itsa line but this takes some doing an auditor has always got to be able to interpret the auditing command and clarify the auditing command so that the pc knows what it is one of the best ways to clarify an auditing command like recall an arc break is explain an arc break and give it to him because you use any other word youll run into some gpmalmost certain to run into gpms arc break is contained in gpm and therefore is totally nonbackground word see give him new word new symbol all right so you say itsa linewell youryour recognition of things your consideration of things what you think life is all about your opinions you know somebody says whats cat and you say its fourlegged animal i mean your right to do that you know go on go on explain it any way you want prepcheck the itsa line or get some other designation for it but prepcheck it and youll be very fascinated that the pc who is the arc breaky pc is not really arc breaking because of auditing and bypassed charge this pcs itsa line is cut right here and now as his most colossal ptpby something else nothing to do with auditing ill give you marvelous example of how somebodys itsa line is cut right here and now hes on this planet isnt he if he tries to get off he hits the betweenlives area his itsa line is cut because he cant itsa anything else in the universe he can look at the stars but he cant tell what condition theyre in see hes the prisoner on the island who looks toward the mainland longingly so his itsa line is cut see theres all kinds of ways of cutting the itsa line dont you see reason to dream them all up for the pc put in prepcheck on his itsa line youll be astonished hell make some case progresssudden case progress and cease to be arc breaky other ways of attacking this same problem sometimes give us the very very fascinating and interesting aspect of somebody who has found that the arc break is solution to some problem so he solves the problem by arc breaking theres various ramifications but he normally runs into this when you prepcheck the itsa line you have big piece of understanding here its big new whole piece of understanding its new piece of the jigsaw puzzle which has fitted into place and made citizens out of most of the center pieces and has shown us that theres just this little few out here on the edge of how come guy had to identify and familiarize himself in order to feel alive or secure how come guy got into an obsessed necessity to itsa that little piece is about the only piece missing right now and its up here in the corner and its missing just to this degree you show problem very shortly later ill show you the answer thank you very much
