general of the united states or his designee2 as of this writing the department of justice task force established in january 2002 to investigate all the matters that have arisen from that collapse3 has obtained its first criminal indictment in the enron matter on march 7 2002 charging obstruction of justice by arthur andersen llp in alleging that the accounting firm intentionally destroyed documents sought by the securities and exchange commission relating to andersens audits and consulting work for enron4 because of various allegations of the purchase by enron of favorable government treatment or access through large and continuing campaign contributions to elected officials and political parties and the extensive lobbying efforts by the enron corporation and those affiliated with enron or with the accounting firm arthur andersen there have been various public calls for an independent counsel special prosecutor or special counsel to conduct the criminal investigation and prosecution of the enron matter on behalf of the united states rather than the regular department of justice personnel it has been noted in this context that the attorney general of the united states has already recused himself from personal participation in the enron matter because of the extent of political campaign contributions that the attorney general had received from those associated with the enron corporation5 and that the entire houston office of the united states attorney has been recused from the enron investigation because of personal or family ties to the enron corporation its officers or employees6 in light of these and other alleged connections and personal communications among the enron corporation its officers and highly placed persons in the bush administration it has been argued that the public interest particularly the need for public confidence in the thoroughness and impartiality of the governments investigation and prosecution of the enron matter requires an investigation which is independent of the ultimate control and direction of the president and his personally appointed officials in the department of justice7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21198crs3 7

department of justice note that specific allegations of wrongdoing by anyone in the bush administration visavis the enron corporation have been made it is noted that without such specific allegations independent counsel would have been automatically triggered even under the expired independent counsel statute there is presented in the current fact situation therefore it is argued issue of the inherent conflict of interest of having an administration control an investigation of itself since there are such allegations being investigated against anyone in the administration absent such conflict of interest there is missing the principal justification that had given rise to the original special prosecutor and later named independent counsel legislation in the aftermath of the watergate scandal and the investigations that followed under that law8 independent counsel law expiration independent counsel or special prosecutor as those terms have been used since 1978 may now be appointed by an independent judicial panel upon the request of the attorney general to investigate or prosecute matter on behalf of the united states9 the provisions of law which had authorized the appointment of such independent counsels originally enacted in the ethics in government act of 1978 were not reauthorized by congress and expired after june 30 199910 since the laws expiration new independent counsels can be requested by the attorney general to be appointed by nor may such counsels be appointed on its own accord by the special threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals although independent counsels appointed before the laws expiration in 1999 were expressly allowed to finish their investigations11 under the former independent counsel law the mechanisms for appointing counsels would have been triggered when the attorney general received specific and credible information alleging that certain highlevel officials in the administration had committedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21198crs4 12 28 usc 591a b and c 13 although the former statute was phrased in mandatory terms shall apply the decision to seek the appointment of an independent

independent counsel under constitutional separation of powers principles morrison v olson supra at 693694 14 28 cfr part 600 6001 to 60010 64 fed reg 3703837044 july 9 1999serious federal offenses or when the attorney general determined that an investigation of allegations of violation of federal criminal statute by any person would create personal financial or political conflict of interest for the department of justice to investigate or prosecute12 thus while addressing the conflict of interest inherent in an administrations investigation of one of its own members was the principal purpose of the statute the law also provided socalled catchall provision added in 1983 to allow the attorney general to request an independent counsel for anyone whether or not the person was in the presidents administration when the attorney general perceived conflict of interest for the department of justice to investigate or prosecute the matter it is possible that congress could reauthorize the independent counsel law or provisions of law somewhat similar to the former independent counsel law to instruct the attorney general to seek the appointment of an independent counsel named by an impartial thirdparty panel under certain circumstances13 it may be noted in this regard that the independent counsel law had in fact been allowed to expire previously for period of time in 1992 the law expired when it was not reauthorized in the 102nd congress it was not until the publicity of the socalled whitewater matter and the allegations concerning the presidents and first ladys possible involvement in the arkansas land deal that congress eventually reauthorized the law again in 1994 special counsels and department of justice regulations when the independent counsel law expired after june 30 1999 the attorney general promulgated specific regulations concerning the appointment of outside temporary counsels in certain circumstances14 such personnel appointed by the attorney general from outside of the department of justice to conduct investigations and possible prosecutions of certain sensitive matters or matters which may raise conflict of interest for justice department personnel are to be called special counsels these special counsels are appointed by are answerable to and may have their prosecuto rial or investigative decisions countermanded by the attorney general the special counsels under these regulations have therefore by express design less independence from the attorney general and the department of justice than did the independent counsels under the ethics in government act of 1978 or the special prosecutors appointed by the attorney general for the watergate matter one special counsel has thus far been appointed under the new regulations that is former senator john danforth appointed by attorney general reno on september 9 1999 to be special counsel to investigate the branch davidian incident near waco texas to determine if there had been any

exist other extraordinary circumstances and when in light of these conflicts or circumstances the attorney general finds that it is in the public interest to appoint such counsel15 the most significant departures in the special counsel regulations from the former statutory independent counsel schemes are that 1 the attorney general and not an independent body such as the threejudge panel actually names the person who is to be the special counsel 2 the attorney general and not an outside panel establishes and defines the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the special counsel 3 the general jurisdiction of the special counsel is limited to the specific matter referred to him or her and not also to related matters as well as collateral offenses arising out of the investigation which interfere with the investigation 4 the special counsel is subject to all the notification and review and approval provisions of the internal department of justice procedures policies and practices but may circumvent certain review and approval procedures by consulting directly with the attorney general 5 the attorney general must be notified concerning significant actions that the special counsel is to take and may countermand any proposed action by the special counsel 6 appeals of cases by the special counsel must be approved by the solicitor general of the united states presidential political appointee and 7 justice department regulations provide that special counsel may be removed by the attorney general for misconduct dereliction of duty incapacity conflict of interest or for other good cause including violation of department policies while the statute provided that independent counsel could be removed by the attorney general for good cause physical or mental disability ad hoc special counsels or special prosecutors in addition to the current justice department regulations for special counsels the attorneys general of the united states have on several occasions in the past exercised their own general discretion and authority to directly name and appoint special prosecutors or counsels to handle selected investigations or prosecutions for the department of justice on behalf of the united states such special prosecutors or counsels are selected and named personally by the attorney general under the existing general statutory authority of the attorney general to direct the activities and functions of the department of justice to delegate authority to employees and to appoint staff including special attorneys16 it is thus possible in theory although unlikely in practical political sense particularly in light of the absence as of this writing of evidence of any particular government corruption in the enron matter17 that despite the current justice department regulations on special counsels the attorney general could issue new watergatestyle regulations to appoint special prosecutor with significant autonomy and independence of action from the

coverupof the breakin of democratic party headquarters in the watergate office complex the regulations under which these special prosecutors were appointed provided great deal of autonomy to their investigations and prosecutorial decisions and provided for removal only for gross improprieties18 in 1994 subsequent to the expiration of the independent counsel statute in 1992 and before the statutes reauthorization later in 1994 attorney general reno had appointed special counsel or regulatory independent counsel robert b fiske jr with autonomy and authority similar to the statutory independent counsels to investigate the whitewater allegations concerning the possible involvement of president clinton and the first lady19 other recent examples of special attorney general appointees have included the appointments by attorney general barr of special counsels nicholas bua 1989 to investigate the socalled inslaw affair which involved allegations that certain high level justice department officials had stolen software from small computer company malcom wilkey 1992 because of the unique circumstances and sensitivities of the matter to conduct preliminary review of the alleged abuses of the house bank by members and officers in the house of representatives20 and frederick lacey 1992 to conduct preliminary investigation of any wrongdoing by the justice department or the cia concerning an illegal loan to iraq from the atlanta branch of an italian bank banca nationale laroro21 these special counsels were appointed at time when the independent counsel statute was in force and had been criticized by some as an attempt by the attorney general who had expressed philosophical opposition to the independent counsel statute to avoid the appointment of an independent counsel by the threejudge panel22 these special counsels were intended to conduct only what would be considered preliminary reviews of the matters and reported to the attorney general without conducting any prosecutions of their own other special appointments have included the socalled backup independent counsels appointed by the attorney general during the independent counsel statutes
