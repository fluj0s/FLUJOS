africa the african growth and opportunity act and beyond introduction all of us share common vision for the future of africa we look to the day when prosperity for africa is built through trade and markets president george w bush to delegates at the african growth and opportunity forum in mauritius january 15 2003 as reflected in the above statement by president bush key element in us policy toward africa is the potential benefit from improved commerce between the two regions this interest in increasing bilateral commerce began after the end of the apartheid era in south afri ca in the early 1990s in 1993 congress approved the end of antiapartheid restrictions and later that year commerce secretary ron brown led business delegation to south africa with the end of apartheid president clinton instituted numerous measures to help the region and increase us trade nd investment there in 1994 he announced 600 million aid and investment package for south africa in 1997 he proposed the partnership for economic growth nd opportunity in africa which offered different levels of economic benefits to countries in subsaharan africa ssa depending on their economic reform measures at the

continuedperspectives on the subsaharan african economy historical perspectives the historical pattern of contempor ary africas economic growth provides insights to help understand africas curre nt economic situation and policy options between 1960 and 1973 which is the peri od immediately following independence in most african countries economic growth was reasonably strong in much of sub saharan africa ssa the subsequent two decades were however period of stagnation or decline for most countries3 the causes of africas slow and stagnant economic growth have been source of debate among deve lopment economists analysts have cited poor governance po litical instability geographic features and historical conditions such as colonialis m as different reasons for africas economic malaise whatever the underlying cause africas slow growth and stagnation have been attributed to slow accumulation of both human and physical capital dependence on single commodity exports low produc tivity growth and pressures from high population growth rates4 most african countries expe rienced sharp decline in their growth trends at some point between 1973 and 1980 followed by persistent stagnation until the early 1990s average ssa percapita gdp reached its minimum point in the mid 1990s and still had not recovere d to 1970s levels in 20055 high economic growth volatility is common feature in ssa countries historical trends recent world bank study finds that ssa has experienced more growth volatility than other regions resulting in dampened investments and obscuring periods of good performance for some countries this volatility has been cau sed by conflict poor governance and fluctuating world commodity prices the au thors of the study contend that reducing volatility is at least as important as promoting growth6 recent data demonstrate that many african countries have made m odest recovery since about 1994 but the growth rates for the remainder of the 1990s tended to remain far below the first post colonial phase7 for the four decades as whol ssas average per capita income growth of 09 percent lagged behind that of other developing countries by 15 and approximately 3 below that of the high performing african botswana and mauritius economies8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31772crs4 8 continued httpwwwworldbankorgwbiattackingpoverty

african c ountries 22 countries exhibited reasonably robust growth before the long period of stagnation the remaining 14 either experienced sharp gr owth fluctuations or showed persistent stagnation at growth rates below 15 percent throughout the last three decades in this study the high growth rates achieved by botswana and mauritius stand out9 the consequence of the long period of stagnation for large number of african economies combined with high population gr owth rates is that little or progress has been made in raising the standards of living in these countries many african countries have experi enced decrease in the standard of living10 between 1960 and 1994 out of 35 ssa countries for which compar able data exist 16 suffered at least 20 loss in income per capita measured in 1985 constant us dollars most of the losses were registered after 197511 in contrast to ssa developed countries have sustained remarkably steady per capita gr owth of approximate ly 2 for about 100 years and some newly industr ializing countries have maintained income growth rates above 3 for nearly three decades thus enabling them to gain significant ground on the industrialized countries12 current perspectives economic growth forecast according to the world bank subsaharan africas resilient economic growth perfo rmance over the past decade suggests that it may have achieved milestone in its quest for sustained growth ssas economic performance from 1995 to 2005 reverses the collapses in 19751985 and the stagnations in 1985199513 its growth has averaged 40 between 2000 and 2005 compared with less than one percent dur ing the early 1990s in 2006 gdp expanded by 56 in ssa also the growth seen in the current period is less volatile and more evenly distributed among afri can countries than in the past twentytwo countries out of total 48 subsaharan african c ountries have had average growth rates of 4 or greater during the past five years as compared with only four countries in the first half of the 1990s in 2006 half of th ssa countries experienced growth of 5 or more this improved economic perform ance may reflect many factors including better governance increased trade flows

investment and growth challenges despite the regions improved economic performance the economic challenges facing africa remain enormous african countries are vulnera ble to volatile weather conditions commodity prices and political events in parts of the tinent many economies in africa depend on one or two commodity exports which leaves them vulnerable to exogenous factors they are also said to generate too little savings and attract too little investment according to the economic commission for africa africa must devote at least 25 of its gdp to investment to achieve sustainable growth17 yet world bank figures indicate that gross domestic inves tment public and private in africa only accounted for 19 of gdp in 200518 net foreign direct investment fdi at 113 billion was the

absolute amount per capita sh are 291 per head or debt service as percentage of export earnings 6 its debt burden has been considered onerous because of its high ratio of debt to income23 africas total debt was equal to 66 of its income in 2002 as of late 2007 africa s total debt stood at about 20 of its income24 this debt reduction is reportedly the result of debt relief initiatives by the
