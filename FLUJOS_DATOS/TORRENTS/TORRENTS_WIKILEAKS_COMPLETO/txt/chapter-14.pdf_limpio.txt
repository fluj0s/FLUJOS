the section 20 5 of the then public accountants and auditors act at that stage many of the syndications operated as trusts that had raised funds from the public in contravent ion with section 30 1 of

companies act with regard to the disclosure of remu neration paid to the auditor36 the most common reason for nonadherence stems fr om the fact that other services provided by auditors re not specified and the practice is not to show amounts p aid under separate headings this information is vital to as sessing auditors independence and the companies reliance on outsiders the auditor to provide certain services 37 although payments for other services are discl osed by sharemax syndication companies being audited by act solutions it is common cause that act solutions co ntinue to provide other services to sharemax as promoter one of these other services is to act as expert w itness for sharemax in its court case against in that resp ect act audit solutions director jacques van

exploded in th faces of the profession internationally and in south africa as various major audit failures became public knowledge46 the trigger for the 1997 confrontation was the publ ication of the 12th draft of the proposed accountancy profession act which was issued by the public accountants and aud itors board paab the deadline for comments was set for 7 february 199747 gloeck had completed his doctoral thesis48 in 1993 at the age of 37 his doctoral research gave impetus to fu rther research and together with jager and at times ther colleagues various critical research reports were

events that followed t he knowledge base of accounting and the claims to expe rtise of its practitioners have increasingly been shaped out side of the law the process is generally referred to as th system of selfregulation the proposed accountancy profession act in its current form seeks the ultimate form of self regulation and takes the concept which is currently under wor ldwide scrutiny and criticism to new heights53 it seems as if the proposed accounting profession act disregards worldwide trends of increased accountab ility and reassessment of certain aspects of selfregulatio n this is

professors had caught th attention of the nel commission who was investigati ng the collapse of masterbond gloeck was called as an exp ert witness85 few days later gloeck was informed by the nel commission that paab had requested copy of his testimony86 asking for the evidence in itself was not strange but the nel commission had by then been operational for three years and had heard shocking evidence about the role auditors had played without paab ta king any interest in what was happening there the transcribed version of gloecks evidence87 ran into 47 pages and covered wide range of topics several r esearch reports some mentioned above and his doctoral the sis were handed in as evidence during his evidence the other services provided by audit firms featured strongly and gloeck was asked whether providing these would compromise an audit firms independence gloeck rep lied if the auditor renders other services or wishes t render other services and he makes presentation of how well he can do that and you know in terms of normal practices auditors or firms are requested to make presentations as to the extent and the expertise and so they have to convince management that they are the correct or the proper persons to be appointed if that would happen in the morning at any specific day and the auditor would be told look this afternoon we will decide on this the board wi ll decide on this and we will let you know tomorrow the auditor might in the aft ernoon find something during the course of his audit that involves fraud in management i cannot see how the auditor can keep an independent mind k nowing that the board who is now supposed to tell about their fraudulent activities how he can do that knowing that the board will also sit and deci upon whether to grant their special job for him or not so i think the in dications are that the auditor 85 synopsis op cit p 3 prof gloeck testified on thursday 5 june 1997 before the nel commission 86 ibid p4 87 nel

essence synopsis of the issues gloeck and jager had researched through much of their academic lives and should have contained surprises for the paab having exhausted the option of joining his ghostly accomplice for tea and discussion with the rector van vuuren wasnt really in position to set his sight s as high as die skip90 for second time in few months instead he compromised by writing letter to gloe cks colleague prof herman jager who was at the time director of the school for accountancy training ou must be aware of this article and informed about its tents the board paab is upset and concerned about the state ments and allegations now been sic made in the public d omain91 van vuuren asked jager whether his school associ ated itself with or distanced itself from gloecks artic he also wished to know who the chairperson and members of t he schools advisory council were92 the latter question was loaded jager and gloeck would soon find out why jager stressed that research and the publication thereof was an integral part of any academic staff members job academics take responsibility for their own researc h they dont publish on behalf of department or specif ic university93 therefore your request that the school must either associate or disassociate itself from the article i n question is irrelevant94 88 ibid p 11760 89 gloeck prof dieter audit industry needs independent

previously the advisory council had met twice yea r and had only consisted of accounting and audit practiti oners95 the new panel included representatives of student b odies education departments public sector researchers nd publications information technology and the accoun ting profession itself96 if your board identifies specific problems in the article under question i will refer it to the division who advises on the accounting profession jager also named the persons in question of which only one was charte red accountant among others the panel included an auth ority on literature who had previously served on the comm ittee and who had adjudicated several literature awards97 now van vuuren had to show his hand first he demonstrated his disregard98 for the schools diversely composed panel with the exception of mr van der l aan the board paab has at this stage basis to talk wit h the members of your panel99 van der laan was the only chartered accountant on the panel slowly paabs agenda became transparent the natio nal educational fund committee recently met to consider financial allocations to participating universities in the meantime the board has indicated that it would

it was time to organise another tea party in die skip the board paab will officially ask the rector for an appointment and i will keep you updated on the matter101 earlier scheepers and van zyl had encouraged gloeck and jager to communicate with paab and other parties in line with this gloeck urged van vuuren to formulate the problems he was experiencing alternatively he was invited to visit the school and to discuss them with gloeck and members of the various research teams102 but van vuuren indeed had his sights on the next aparty in die skip this matter has now reached proportions which need to be dealt with by the board and your rectorate he blamed attacks on his personal integ rity for his unwillingness to talk with researchers103 although thorough read of gloecks letter couldnt identify any such attack and van vuuren didnt reply to an invitation by gloeck to point out such an attack present at the highpowered teaparty at die skip104 were van zyl viceprinciple prof chris beer the an of the faculty of economic and management sciences prof chris thornhill the chairman of paab herman wessels va n vuuren and jager gloeck was not invited for tea 105 van vuurens secret accomplice during the previous meet ing was not invited either paab reiterated its earlier threat of legal action against the university of pretoria andor individual researcher s the question was posed whether the researchers and in particular gloeck would be able to afford law suit s running into millions106 paab unashamedly advocated censorship and closed s ociety philosophies by stating it was not content with the fact that research reports landed in the hands of financial j ournalists 101ibid 102 letter from prof dieter gloeck to lucas van vuure n 7 august 1997 103 letter from lucas

found such articles to tally unacceptable107 more guests attended the next teaparty at die skip five weeks later however it would appear that van zyl was not present the university was represented by beer thornhill jager and gloeck this time the sa in stitute of chartered accountants saica was also represented in the person of its deputy executive graham terry with v an vuuren and wessels representing paab108 saica and paab were clearly on the same wavelength and intent on curtailing freedom of expression terry t old the meeting that saica members were paying the subventi ons and since the training of accountants and auditors had been transferred to saica the subventions would shortly become matter to be dealt with by saica directly109 wessels made the big jannie kruger110 statement according to him paab didnt wish to apply censorship but th good name of the profession needed to be protected and there was therefore need to scrutinise publications111 wessels went on to suggest that committee or some thing similar manned by members of paab and saica be set up and that this committee would review and scrutinize the research reports and certain other publications ema nating from the school112 the pinnacle of this attempt to kill off independen t thought was the suggestion that researchers should be acco untable to the proposed committee quite suspiciously it w as suggested by the accounting moguls paab and saica that only publications of the university of pretoria wou ld be scrutinized113 107 ibid 108 ibid p 6 109 ibid 110 jannie kruger was south africas chief

by the end of october 1997 these documents were delivered to the school of accountan cy the school had had copy of the rules on record since 1995 the cover pages of both the 1995 and the 1997 docum ents stated the following these rules and regulations of the national educat ional fund were approved by the board on 7 august 1995 and replace all previ ous resolutions regarding the fund114 this clearly created the impression that there were amendments to the rules after 7 august 1995 curiou sly the 1997 version had the following paragraph inserted in it once department is participating and subvented department the members of that department will be required to act in such manner so as to not to bring the profession in disrepute where nef co is of the opinion that the profession has been brought into disrepute due to actions of such department or members of that department nefco wil l have the right to withhold any or all such subventions previously agr eed115 shortly afterwards colleague of jager and gloe ck prof marius koen was route to conference of the international federation of accountants in paris 2 6 october 1997 he raised the matter of withholding the subv entions with the educational director of paab ms chantyl m ulder she also served on the subvention committee116 mulder told him that paab hoped that by withholding subventions for the whole department this would cre ate peer pressure resulting in the audit researchers taking low profile117 shortly afterwards gloeck challenged wessels in l etter during the mentioned meeting 16 october 1997 you stated that paab received numerous complaints fro m 114 public accountants and auditors board national education fund rules and regulations 7 august 1995 115 ibid par 84 it is unclear at what meeting of n

regional societies 118 in view of the above i urge paab to make available to the exact and full details of these complaints so as to allow to study them verify them for correctness chec k the accuracy and validity of the evidence presented and to allow to challenge or to refute them through presentat ion of evidence argumentation and if necessary to obtai n legal advice in respect of allegationscomplaints against me119 lateron in the same letter gloeck challenged wesse ls directly your firm coopers lybrand also feat ures in our reports this fact alone raises the question wh ether you can be seen to be completely independent and objective in your assessment of our research120 shortly before in letter to marcus jager and gloeck pointed out that an open climate free of intimidat ion and suppression was not prevailing their letter follow ed paab publication entitled transformation of the registered accountancy profession where consultation process was outlined among others it entailed the appointment of judge of the high court secretariat public foru ms and invitations to the public to comment121 jager and gloeck summarized the events of the preceding months and informed marcus that they wer hesitant to participate in the proposed process in fear of further actions by paab and saica they then reques ted we would therefore be grateful if you as patron of the democratic process proposed in shaping the new accountancy and auditin g acts could provide assurances that participation in the processes will be free of intimidation restriction punitive measures and other covert pre ssures122 118 letter from prof dieter gloeck to herman wessels chairman of paab 7 november 1997 119 ibid 120ibid 121 letter from proff herman jager and dieter gloe ck to gill marcus

happened in prec eding weeks the schools proposals as to how the subventi ons should be allocated to individual lecturers was dis cussed and approved123 marcus private secretary howard veale replied to g loeck and jagers letter saying that the deputy minis ter was most concerned at what appeared to be actions mos t prejudicial to free and open debate and contrary to the interest of the public124 veale revealed that marcus had requested that the allegations be investigated by mr justice corbett former chief justice and adv selby baqwa125 shortly afterwards the meeting with the parties was arranged for 21 vember 1997126 present at the meeting held at the financial servic board fsb were judge corbett adv baqwa van vuuren wessels mr waya also from paab jager and glo eck mr gumede of the fsb kept the minutes127 the minutes were in many ways summary of events i n preceding months the meeting was nevertheless remarkable because paab abandoned its earlier stanc to withhold its subvention for the school of accountan cy furthermore it was agreed among the parties that t here will not be any hindrance to the free and open presentat ion of views at the forum128 further correspondence took place between jager and judge corbett about an idea being mooted to establi sh 123 synopsis op cit p 7 124 letter from howard veale private secretary to gil l marcus to proff herman jager and dieter

available the details of paabs complaint further discussions on this matter wou ld serve purpose and as far as i am concerned the matter is closed129 subsequently wessels paid visit to gloeck in ord er to speak about paab members perceptions created by ur articles in the lay press130 wessels told gloeck that he had sidelined himself and that he would soon not be abl to do research in south africa i can publish my research internationally gloeck rebuffed dont be so sure about that we are everywhere w essels warned in yet another letter gloeck pointed wessels to the report of the nel commission which had been published few w eeks earlier the masterbond report has introduced new perspec tive to our opposing viewpoints longer can one talk of allegations incorrect facts and other deterrents the report is factually based verdict and an alarming one our research until now only reported the transgression s and nonadherences by auditors we could not elaborate on why they had be committed the masterbond report has changed that and i am sure u have also read the detailed account of the commissions findings131 shortly after these events van vuuren retired the school of accountancy closed at the end of 2001 jager bec ame head of the department of auditing and gloeck pro fessor in the same department gloeck also heads research unit focusing on audit ing and accountability the departments
