review of mann et the paper is generally well written i recommend acceptance subject to minor revisions i will leave it to the editor to check that most of my comments have been responded to minor comments 1 line 32 of abstract change known to presumed or some other word the nh temperature trends are not known instead we have good estimates 2 could emphasize in the first paragraph of the introduction that most of the satgst comparisons are discussed in the context of models 3 the long sentence encompassing lines 74 to 79 could be reworded to make it easier for readers i had to read this several times to get the meaning perhaps split it into two and dont begin with the if 4 p85 add global average to mean radiative forcing changes the next sentence gives the important information 5 the sentence extending over p91 to 94 could usefully do with reference 6 the reason the difference in trends between 21 and 12 on pp 101102 is because you are talking about the global average this point is made little higher but it could be repeated 7 p111 can you restate what the question is it wasnt obvious to at this point 8 p132 presumably the 10m sat values from gisse do not have any effect as youll be using anomalies from modern reference would be worth stating this 9 p142 reducing sea level by 40m 9ky bp ago the land surface is now higher in this simulation compared to those later in the sequence simple lapse rate calculation would make this simulation 024Âºc cooler than the later ones 10 p151155 i was going to suggest map of the boxes in some supplementary information but map sort of appears in figure 1 it might be worth mentioning that here 11 p159 can you state the modern preindustrial period you are using 12 in the discussion in pp180186 the sat peak over the holocene compared to gst is broader flatter one that has slight peak about 3k years ago 13 reference to the inverse perspective on p188 would be useful 14 the long sentence encompassing pp193198 could again be useful split to enable easier reading 15 p233 other models would be useful but my guess would be that none have run similar set of experiments 16 p247 remove in 17 the likelihood that seasonal trends differ from annual ones has been discussed in number of papers at least for the last 1000 years it would be useful pointing out that the seasons neednt follow the annual average especially in the context of the seasonally and latitudinally different forcing that took place useful reference for the recent millennium would be jones et 2003 jones pd briffa kr and osborn tj 2003 changes in the northern hemisphere annual cycle implications for paleoclimatology j geophys res 108 4588 doi1010292003jd003695
