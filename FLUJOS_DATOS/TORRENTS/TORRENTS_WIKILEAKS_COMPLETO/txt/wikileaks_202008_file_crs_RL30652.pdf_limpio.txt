between israel and jordan and israel and egypt since 1994 when jordan and israel signed peace treaty congress and the clinton administration also undertook several initiatives designed to assist the jordanian economy these initiatives included increased levels of foreign assistance debt forgiveness and the qiz program in addition to covering traditional reductions in barriers to trade in goods and services the fta also deals with other issues that became part of the us trade policy agenda during the clinton administration such as intellectual property rights iprs ecommerce and labor and environmental standards the inclusion of labor and environmental standards within the text of the fta has provoked disagreement between those with differing visions of what should be included in future us ftas the volume of bilateral trade between the united states and jordan throughout the 1990s was consistently modest many top jordanian exports to the united states already enter the united states dutyfree through various programs and cereals the top us export to jordanalready face low or zerolevel tariff rates therefore free trade agreement is unlikely to have an immediate and dramatic impact on the volume of bilateral trade however jordanian exports of textiles and apparel to the united states as well as us exports to jordan of various commodities that face moderately high

bilateral free trade agreement fta1 eventually leading to reciprocal dutyfree trade in goods the united states and jordan conducted three main rounds of negotiations before signing the fta on october 24 2000 the first round took place in washington during the week of june 26 2000 and was headed by then united states trade representative ustr charlene barshefsky and jordanian deputy prime minister and minister of state for economic affairs dr muhammad alhalayqah the second and third rounds were held in amman jordan during the week of august 1 2000 and in washington during the week of september 11 2000 respectively during the october 2000 summit meeting at sharm alsheikh egypt king abdullah reportedly expressed to president clinton his desire to conclude the negotiations as rapidly as possible2 soon after the two negotiating teams completed their talks and the fta was signed on october 24 20003 according to the agreement the ftas entry into force is subject to the completion of necessary domestic legal procedures by each party the clinton administration submitted the agreement to the 107th congress on january 6 2001 and bills to implement the fta were introduced in the

the volume of bilateral trade has increased steadily reaching more than 207 billion in 2000 representing more than fourfold increase in total bilateral trade5 in 1996 congress amended the united statesisrael free trade area implementation act through the gsp renewal act of 1996 pl 1042346 this legislation expanded the geographic scope of the usisrael fta in two ways first it extended the fta to cover goods produced or manufactured in the west bank and gaza strip by providing palestinian exporters with dutyfree access to the us market congress hoped that such peace dividend would strengthen the palestinian economy and thereby reinforce support for the peace process the extension of the usisrael fta to the west bank and gaza strip has had modest impact on direct palestinian exports to the united states in 1995 there were such exports but by 2000 the united states directly imported 48 million of palestinian goods7 these figures might understate the actual amount of palestinian exports to the united states in recent years because of israels continuing role in heavily intermediating palestinian trade with the rest of the world in other words some palestinian goods may be exported indirectly to the united states via israel and therefore appear in usisraeli bilateral trade statistics second pl 104234 also granted the president additional proclamation authority to

march 29 2001 egypt has yet to express interest in participating in the qiz program probably because it entails level of arabisraeli economic cooperation that egypt would prefer to engage in only after the conclusion of comprehensive regional peace although egypt for the time being has decided not to participate in the qiz program some analysts have suggested egypt as potential candidate to be one of the united states next free trade partners8 some members of congress have expressed interest in this idea as well on august 4 2000 26 senators sent president clinton letter urging him to negotiate an fta with egypt that would form the basis for middle east free trade region that would include israel the west bank and gaza strip jordan and egypt9 on november 1 2000 45 representatives sent president clinton similar letter while the conclusion of ftas with jordan and egypt could form the basis for wider middle east free trade region with the united states negotiations for such an intraregiona l zone would probably be politically unfeasible until comprehensive regional peace is achieved congressional interest in the jordanian economy in the early 1990s before jordan and israel achieved substantive progress on their bilateral track of the peace process congress did not undertake any largescale initiatives to assist the jordanian economy us foreign assistance to jordan was limited largely due to us concern over jordans refusal to join the usled coalition against iraq during the 19901991 gulf war however after jordan and israel signed the washington declaration which terminated the state of belligerency between jordan and israel on july 25 1994 and peace treaty on october 26 199410 congress and the clinton administration took number of initiatives intended to benefit the jordanian economy these steps have included increasing the level of bilateral economic and military assistance provided to jordan forgiving jordans debt to the united states and establishing qualifying industrial zones qizs in jordan and israel the primary congressional motivation behind attempting to improve the jordanian economy has been to provide jordan with peace dividendan economic reward designed to demonstrate the benefits of peace to jordanian population that has sometimes criticized and protested its governments pace and depth of normalization of relations with israelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30652crs4 in recent years one of the most visible aspects of congressional interest in the jordanian economy has been in the realms of foreign assistance and debt forgiveness in the wake of the washington declaration president clinton promised king hussein that he would work towards forgiving jordans debt to the united states congress responded with subsidy appropriations mainly in fy1994 and fy1995 that forgave the equivalent of roughly 700 million of jordanian debt to the united states beginning in fy1996 congress agreed to increase first military and then economic assistance to jordan in fy1999 and fy2000 at the request of the clinton administration congress also earmarked 300 million for jordan in its supplemental appropriations for

updated march 29 2001 usjordan fta letters and legislation some members of congress began to consider the idea of negotiating us jordan fta seven years ago in the immediate aftermath of the signing of the july 1994 washington declaration then house majority leader richard gephardt sent president clinton letter urging him to expand the usisrael fta to include countries that sign comprehensive peace agreements with israel the letter was co signed by an additional 42 representatives11 however both in congress and in the clinton administration the idea of establishing usjordan fta lay dormant for the most part until king abdullah ii ascended the jordanian throne upon the death of his father king hussein in february 1999 and made the usjordan fta one of his top priorities the high priority that king abdullah has attached to economic reform in general and to the usjordan fta in particular helped to rekindle congressional interest in this issue toward this end between march and may 2000 over 45 members of congress sent president clinton letters12 urging him to enter into negotiations for an fta with jordan as soon as possible in these letters members provided several interrelated rationales for supporting usjordan fta 1 it would strengthen bilateral relations and express the united states appreciation for jordans role in furthering the middle east peace process and actively cooperating in international counterterrorism activities 2 it would promote economic growth in jordan and regional economic cooperation thereby enhancing stability and security in jordan and the middle east and 3 it would assist in further promoting economic reform and liberalization in jordan about month after formal usjordanian negotiations on the fta began on july 17 2000 bipartisan group

environmental impact studies prior to the signing of the agreement the clinton administration expressed its support for usjorda n free trade agreement fta in terms similar to those employed by members of congress who urged the president to undertake this initiative the clinton administration viewed the fta as potential catalyst to sustained economic growth in jordan providing its people with longawaited peace dividend which in turn would reinforce support for the peace process then united states trade representative ustr charlene barshefsky recently stressed the link between economic growth and regional peace stating that the fta can be step toward the creation of future middle east which is peaceful prosperous and open to the world whose nations work together for the common good

imports us production or us employment usitc arrived at this conclusion after conducting 16 qualitative industry sector analyses of us exports to and imports from jordan by running partial equilibrium analyses in which tariffs levels were hypothetically reduced to zero and all other factors influencing levels of trade flows were held constant usitc concluded that had zerolevel tariffs been in place in 1998 us exports to jordan would have increased in three sectors under this model us exports of cereals other than wheat would have increased by 14 or 29 million us exports of electrical machinery would have increased by 104 or 22 million and us exports of machinery and transportation equipment would have increased by 39 or 48 million usitc also predicted that the fta will likely lead to an increase in us imports of textiles and apparel from jordan however usitc did not run partial equilibrium analysis for this jordanian export sector and therefore was unable to quantify the potential increase though usitc concluded that the overall impact of the fta on the us economy will be negligible it did infer that the fta could occasion modest increase in bilateral trade the office of the ustr through the trade policy staff committee tpsc is also conducting an environmental impact study of the usjordan fta this environmental review responds to new us commitment to factor environmental considerations into the development of its trade negotiating objectives embodied in executive order 13141 issued by president clinton on november 16 199919 some view this executive order as the clinton administrations response to criticisms of the environmental effects of united states trade policy expressed before and during the november 1999 seattle round of the world trade organization wto talks coincidentally violent confronta tions between the police and protesters in seattle curtailed the agenda of the wto talks forcing jordans accession to the wto to be deferred until april 200020 many individuals and groups concerned with the nexus between trade and environmental issues watched the usjordani an negotiations with great interest since their results could serve as model for future us trade negotiating strategy on environmental issues in september 2000 the ustr released draft environmental review of the proposed usjordan fta21 in this draft review the ustr stated that the us government usg expects that the fta with jordan will not have any significant environmental effects in the united states while it is conceivable that there may be instances in which

manufacturers importers and marketers of textile and apparel products accounted for the plurality of public comments received by the ustr six of seventeen public comments filed on the economic aspects of the fta primarily dealt with textiles and apparel while another one secondarily dealt with these sectors as well the interest that us textile and apparel companies have shown in the usjordan fta is unsurprising since these sectors could prove to be the largest potential area of growth for jordanian exports to the united states under an fta some of these textile manufacturers such as bctc corporation and certain members of the american apparel manufacturin g association aama have recently invested in jordans qualifying industrial zones qizs and therefore have an interest in expanding jordanian textile and apparel access to the us market those supportive of greater jordanian textile and apparel access to the us market tended to urge the ustr to adopt the usisrael fta rulesoforigin

the jordanian private sector responded enthusiastically to the idea of the usjordan fta for instance the jordanian american business association jaba surveyed prominent business leaders from both

that foreign direct investment into jordan will increase and that the fta will help expand this into multiple sectors from textiles to technology and from financial services to tourism26 however jaba also noted that some of those surveyed worried that an fta could lead to an expanded level of us imports that could have detrimental impact on jordans manufacturing sector some also expressed concern that jordans reorientation of its trade relations toward the united states and toward europe with the signing of an eujordanian partnership agreement could come at the expense of its trade relations with neighboring countries in the immediate aftermath of the signing of the fta several prominent jordanian private sector personalities including the president of the union of jordanian chambers of commerce the vice president of the amman chamber of commerce and the chairman of the administrative council of the amman chamber of industry welcomed and endorsed the fta27 selected provisions of the

be volatile domestic political issue in jordan since the government began to lower food subsidies in the context of its structural adjustment reform program31 therefore the free trade agreement is likely to have only marginal impact on the volume of us cereal exports to jordan and on cereal pricing for jordanian consumers since tariffs on leading cereal exports are already zero

mineral and petrochemical production textiles and apparels were jordans second leading worldwide industrial export roughly 50 million in 199432 since 1994 the textile and apparel sector has become an even more important part of jordanian manufacturing since several american israeli and other multinational textile and apparel firms have relocated some of their operations to jordan both within and outside the context of the qiz program however only few firms have qualified their products for qiz status therefore most of the jordanian textile and apparel industry still faces fairly substantial tariffs when exporting to the united states general phasingout of these tariffs within the context of an fta would presumably increase jordanian nonqiz textile and apparel exports to the united states foreign direct investment fdi in jordan although usjordan fta might not have large and immediate impact on the volume of bilateral trade in goods and services many predict that the fta could substantially increase foreign direct investment fdi in jordan both from the united states and from the rest of the world in the context of an fta multinational companies seeking greater us market access could relocate some of their operations to jordan in order to take advantage of its eventual dutyfree access to the united states in addition us companies that currently import inputs or finished products from other countries could reroute their purchases to jordanian suppliers in order to reduce production or import costs stemming from tariffs already some us foreign and multinational companies have relocated their operations to jordan in order to benefit from the qiz program thereby attracting larger amounts of fdi to jordan usjordan fta could promote similar pattern

congressional sources who said that one of the aims of the usjordan fta is to reduce jordans economic dependence on iraq the apparent rationale for reducing this dependence is to make it easier to maintain the sanctions regime against iraq by alleviating the economic dislocations that these sanctions have caused to countries like jordan friendly to the united states muwafiq harb free trade agreement between the united states and jordan will be signed before the end of the month alhayat october 8 2000economic reform in jordan since ascending the throne in february 1999 king abdullah has made economic reform top governmental priority as result jordan has undertaken number of structural adjustment reforms within the past year for instance in the context of its accession to wto membership in april 2000 jordan harmonized its general sales tax gst rates on domestic and importe d goods amended its customs law and enacted new legislation protecting intellectual property rights iprs in july 1999 and april 2000 jordan also lowered tariff levels further liberalizing its trade regime outside the realm of trade jordan has begun to corporatize some public sector companies in preparation for their eventual privatization public sector telecommunications and cement companies in addition to companies in other sectors have been partially or wholly privatized as well37 jordans accession to the wto combined with free trade agreement with the united states will likely increase the momentum for further economic reforms in jordan political implications should congress and the jordanian parliament agree to the fta jordan would become the first independent arab country to have concluded an fta with the united states this would be interpreted by many as sign of the strength of usjordan bilateral relations and of the importance that the united states attaches to this relationship the usjordan fta would also be interpreted as demonstration of the united states confidence in and approval of king abdullahs leadership in general and of his economic reforms in particular in addition the fta could modestly reorient jordans trade pattern towards the united states and therefore implicitly away from iraq if as result of the fta jordan could generate substantial export revenue s from the united states it could eventually decrease its reliance on iraq as major trading partner38 if the fta results in significant peace dividend through increased levels of foreign direct investment fdi and exports potentially leading to job creation and sustained economic growth support for the peace process within jordan could increase in addition this could provide tangible proof to other countries in the region that the peace process can yield economic benefits for their
