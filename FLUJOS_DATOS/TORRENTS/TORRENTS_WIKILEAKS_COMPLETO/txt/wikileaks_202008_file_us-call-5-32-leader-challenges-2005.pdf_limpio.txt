in the military the transition from garrison to combat is significant change in environment which results in an increased stress common human emotions of fearambiguity and uncertainty contribute to

components for federal service highlights these differences andcreates challenges to overcome key differences are property accountability promotionsfinance and legal affairs the challenge is greater with the national guard because they are stillcontrolled by each states regulations while federalized training brigades trained primarily on stability operations and support operations prior to deployment during mission readiness exercise mre some commands stated that the mres wereoutstanding because they immersed their soldiers in the contemporary operating environmentothers felt that the

units are conducting ad hoc training as time and mission requirements permit todevelop driving skills in some cases mission requirements are such that drivers are beginningoperations without receiving training and must develop these skills as operations are beingconducted this significantly increases the risks associated with convoy operations unity of command and information operations are areas

maneuverbattalions giving them each areas the size of west virginia conducting operations in an ao ofthat size mandates decentralized operations with clear understanding that leaders cannot beeverywhere at once brigades and battalions executed virtually all operations by allocating resources to subordinate units and giving guidance this required trust at every level of command battlefield circulationbecame essential for the brigade and battalion commanders to ensure subordinates wereexecuting operations within the commanders intent in nonlinear operations commanderunaccustomed to trusting his subordinates can stifle initiative and while ensuring perfection of afew missions far fewer missions will be successful than by giving guidance providingresources and trusting subordinate leaders to accomplish the missions assigned effectivecommanders placed themselves into operations where their presence would be combatmultiplier commanders stated that every level of leadership was working above their pay grade companies were not used to running their own motor pools handling their own communicationproblems or regularly gathering their own intelligence

companies companiestactically controlled tacon elements of the afghan national army ana and iraqi armyworking sidebyside with them on many operations flexibility was identified as critical musthave characteristic of leaders in current and future operations flexibility and adaptability can be developed during deployment in junior leadersthrough stretch assignments stretch assignment is tasking above the normal span ofcontrol for leader that enables him to exercise supervised decision making and directiveauthority in the execution of task this occurs in an environment where mistakes can belearned from and are not considered life or injurythreatening stretch assignments can occurwith the explicit intent to develop junior leader or simply as byproduct of environmentalpressures junior leaders are regularly given stretch assignments in oef and oif due simply tothe vast ao given to brigade and subordinate units senior leaders cannot be aware of all thedetails of their ao and manage all missions being conducted by their subordinate commanders although these assignments are supervised to some extent junior leaders are permitted the latitude to develop their own approaches and make mistakes along the way supervising leaderscan then use the mistakes as training opportunity to point out other courses of action that wouldbe more successful as well as key features of the task situation that should be attended to in thedecisionmaking process ultimately the use of these types of taskings and assignments asdevelopmental tools enables junior leaders to assume the responsibilities of more senior leaderswith detriment to unit effectiveness in accomplishing the mission utilization of stretch 24 for official use onlyoef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iir assignments intentionally or not is permitting the army to grow the adaptive and flexible leaders required for success in current and future operations in oif companies are regularly assigned an ao covering one hundred square miles or more and typically containing several large villages or towns personnel limitations forced companycommanders to delegate authority for planning and executing operations in villages and towns tothe platoon level generally retaining control of resources and oversight at the company levelthis breadth of assignment is comparable to the ao and mission scope handled by battalion orbrigade at the combat training centers ctcs the units interviewed made extensive use of the after action review aar process the aar process typically focuses on detailed examination of what happened during the execution of amission to identify areas that can be further strengthened for the unit and to identify changes inenemy tactics techniques and procedures ttp which are used to improve future operationsthis information is usually distributed within the company with regular updates of significantevents and information passed up to higher levels eg battalion andor brigade one aspect ofmission execution that does not typically receive as much attention is the ontheground decisionmaking of the mission leaders when junior leaders are assigned missions and tasks for purposes of leader development it is equally important to review the actions executed the what and decisions made the whyduring the mission it is quite possible for mission to be entirely successful with decisionmaking by the junior leader that is not optimal likewise it is entirely possible for mission tobe only partially successful even with optimal decision making by the junior leader assuringthat the junior leader is examining his own decisionmaking process as well as the course ofaction chosen provides multiple avenues for development of the junior leader it also helps thejunior leader focus on the decisionmaking processes being used not just the actions executedduring the mission this approach better enables leader flexibility and adaptability in futuremissions this will also enable leaders to better prepare for and plan future missions currently neither officer education system oes nor noncommissioned officer education system ncoes

costlyto local civilians than simply replacing or repairing whatever was damaged or stolen the policeforce provided little to the community however once the us forces began living and workingwith the local police the local community started to see that the new police station wasproviding service and the police station started to become an intelligence gathering metropolisin the area the officers stated that caring about the job they were doing and critical outofthebox thinking skills were what enabled them to be successful there was not cookie cutter solutionfor their mission they improvised adapted and just did it with the resources they had one redeployed battalion commander had his junior officers write an officer professional assignment on leadership junior leaders were required to answer four questions what was the biggest lesson you learned downrange about leadership how do you rate against the leader attributes in fm 22100 fm 722 military leadership what is your greatest strength and greatest weakness what is your greatest disappointment and greatest success of the deployment the premier question was what was the biggest lesson you learned about leadership during the deployment answers varied but theme of four common lessons easily became apparent 26 for official use onlyoef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iir enforce the standards the ultimate test of leader is whether his subordinates enforce standards on their own leader cannot do everything himself and will be ineffective if hetries trust your instincts many junior leaders commented that their gut feeling was usually the right course that should have been taken there is little margin for error between right andwrong if something is wrong there is excuse for not fixing it whether the decision ispopular or not include subordinates in mission analysis and planning developing subordinates so they can accomplish the mission on their own is the most important thing leader can docurrent operations even at the company and platoon levels required decentralizedplanning and execution leaders are most effective when they include subordinates in theprocess being leader never stops when in charge take charge and accomplish the mission to the best of the units ability knowledge and competence do not necessarily equate toleadership ability there is certain quality some leaders possess that causes soldiers towant to follow them several junior leaders had similar responses about what makes an effective or ineffective leader effective leaders motivated their subordinates provided clear mission statementsintent guidance and fostered an environment that allowed subordinates to learn from theirmistakes ineffective leaders micromanaged their subordinates and provided unclear mission statementsintentguidance insightslessons learned the size of aos and scope of brigade battalion and company operations in oef and oif necessitate pushing resources guidance

their own flexibility and adaptability in junior and midlevel leaders can be developed through supervised stretch assignments developing subordinates so they can accomplish the mission on their own is the most important thing leader can do aars should focus both on the actions executed during mission the decisionmaking processes used and the decisions reached by the mission commander to better

in some combat zones some sections of country are able to beginreconstruction even while other areas are still in combat as progress has been made in both the afghanistan and iraq theaters the focus of operations has shifted from combat toward stability and support one critical aspect of stability operations andsupport operations for which soldiers do not typically receive adequate preparation is civilmilitary operations cmo examples of these types of missions in the afghanistan theaterinclude medical assistance humanitarian assistance and civil affairs and reconstruction effortsin afghanistan the provincial reconstruction teams prts are civil military organizationcurrently headed by military commander and include several us nonmilitary agencies egdos department of agriculture us agency for

and industrial power during the transition from strictly combatoperations to phase iv operations focused on stability and support for the host nation it isincreasingly common for the military to be working with civilians from other us agencies unity of command is the armys preferred method for achieving unity of effort the optimum command environment has one commander over all forces however the gwot fought in oifand oef requires the capability of joint interagency and multinational jim organizations inorder to accomplish the mission although joint and some multinational military organizationshave unity of command interagency and civil military organizations do not civilians are not inthe military chain of command and cannot necessarily be ordered to do anything interagencyand civil military organizations must operate on basis of unity of effort whereas pure militaryorganizations typically operate on basis of unity of command for official use only 29oef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iirunity of command is not possible in this environment therefore commanders must achieve unity of effort through cooperation and coordination among all elements of the force even ifthey are not part of the same command structure the integration of civilian governmental agency representatives into the prts in afghanistan is clear example of commanders achieving unity of effort in civil military organizations in onecommand brigade commander was able to utilize the expertise of usaid representative tovet reconstruction projects advise on which projects were best suited in scope to themilitarysourced funds available vice usaid or other sourced funds and coordinatereconstruction projects so that the military was not duplicating efforts by other agencies andorganizations the brigade commander in effect integrated this usaid representative into hisstaff and regularly depended on advice from usaid to assure maximum effectiveness of theprts operating in the brigade ao the commander also received input from the usaidrepresentative on measures of effectiveness for the prts specifically because there is directive authority for military command of the civilian organizations interpersonal skills such as communication negotiation and persuasion arecritical as the commander seeks to achieve synchronization trust coordination

theimportance of nonkinetic operations of the six combined joint task force76 cjtf76objectives for oef two were kinetic lethal and four were nonkinetic nonlethal these fournonkinetic objectives were

information operation io cells and prts continuously worked cmo projects it became apparent that prts wereresourced for cmo projects however some of the various s5 and io cells were somewhat outof the

efforts in afghanistan transportation captain assigned to the s3 volunteered to focus on io efforts although he did not have background in io or cmo at that time he took the initiative and tried to learn whathe could about io and cmo he created network to include the prt and cj9 to vet his ideasand aid in resourcing his projects he noted that within his ao one was focusing on io orcmo although prt colocated with him on the base could be of assistance if requested 30 for official use onlyoef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iir this captain was very positive and really enjoyed his job he felt that he was making difference he had started an afghan education extension program on variety of topicsincluding grape farming midwifery and basic sanitation some of these programs were in theform of lectures while others were produced on videotapes all however were done by afghaninationals the program was supported by the local governor and maintained the flavor ofafghanis supporting afghanis with the us in the background these programs were verypopular with local nationals local officials and the mullahs this captain was also in contactwith consulting firms with support from usaid to identify some economic developmentopportunities for the local afghanis these opportunities included carpetrug production raisinsfrom their delicious grapes drying apricots nuts cattle production rose oil and the possibilityof creating marble industry increasingly the responsibility for participating in cmo is being pushed to more junior officers eg company commanders and platoon leaders in oef and oif are increasingly involved incmotype missions the challenge is that the institutional training system does not beginproviding this education until field grade levels the reality on the ground is this training mustbegin sooner in oes woes and ncoes formal education training and opportunities to exercise these skills are necessary for leaders to be prepared to effectively lead and participate in these cmo prior to deployment leaders shouldtry to ensure that their junior leaders have adequate opportunities to acquire the knowledge andskills necessary to

to interact with local nationals on regular basis for variety of reasons the iraqi and afghani cultures differ from american culture inimportant ways that leaders and soldiers should know however there are often similaritiesbetween cultures that have been observed as well to address the need for an understanding offoreign cultures that will be encountered in theater cultural awareness training has beeninstituted in most predeployment training cycles although this training may be adequate toprovide some basic knowledge on specific aspects of the iraqi and afghani cultures there areseveral areas in which leaders can build basis for understanding most cultures not just thecultures of the specific theaters in which the army is currently operating several leaders noted that when dealing with iraqis or afghanis it is most important to generally treat them as you would like to be treated with dignity and respect these leaders noted that thespecific details of arabic culture that were taught in the cultural awareness training were lessimportant all three of the leaders interviewed stated that the cultural awareness training they received was too basic the training had saudi focus and centered on how to treat the dominantarabmuslim male the example of not showing or facing the soles of your feet to muslims keptcoming up one of the leaders discussed this point with local official and he stated that he wasnot offended by an american sitting with his legs crossed exposing the sole of his foot the localofficial acknowledged that americans had different culture and that both cultures needed tounderstand one another the leaders stated the cultural awareness training was probably goodenough for someone having limited contact with local nationals more importantly theycommented that the army should focus on interpersonal skills treat someone how you wouldwant to be treated or how person should be treated it was noted that the iraqis had lot of misconceptions about america and truly thought that the hollywood portrayal of our nation violent cop shows was the norm one of the local policeofficers actually brought his wife in to be seen by the male american medic at the police stationfor dog bite this action showed the trust and respect that permeated throughout the policestation trust and respect must be accompanied by sternness it quickly became apparent thatweakness was easily exploited the leaders commented that this trust and respect was carried over during raids conducted with the iraqi police iraqi army and us soldiers when searching house women and personalproperty were respected soldiers and iraqi police had the senior male show them around thehouse and had him move furniture and items as they cleared the rooms this respect migrated totrust on one occasion the raid did not provide anything however the male of the householdwent to the police station two weeks later and provided actionable intelligence all based on therespect he was shown during the raid the operation showed him that the americans were notthere to tear his house apart and that the iraqi police were actually providing public service 34 for official use onlyoef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iir one of the leaders noted that understanding the social structure in village and finding out who has the power to make decisions and who does not is as important as knowing what might offendsomeone other leaders reported that an understanding of government structures both in generaland specific to the theater would be very helpful cultural awareness training does not addressthese issues social structure both formalized in government and the informal social structure in village are important hints about how coalition leaders should interact with local nationals to be mosteffective some villages may be more devout than others and this will show up in several waysincluding behavior of local nationals and the social structure of the village in some areas of iraqthere are some of the same issues with drinking and driving that america has even thoughdrinking alcohol is forbidden in islam this was one example of part of the predeploymentcultural awareness training that if taken as an absolute for all of iraq and afghanistan would bewrong in some villages the tribal chiefs have more power than the local mullah however inother villages the reverse may be true when the mullah religious leader possesses the mostpower leaders can expect the local culture to be more devoutly islamic and the culturalawareness training to be more applicable leaders noted that general education to develop the knowledge and skills related to understanding social structures would be more helpful than the specific cultural awarenesstraining some leaders pointed out that there are important nonverbal cues and behavior that canhelp you figure out who the important people are in village or when someone is annoyedfrightened or nervous most importantly learning about nonverbal communication and thesocial concepts that make up culture eg social bases of power and importance of socialrelationships will provide leaders with basis to better understand any culture in which they areoperating not just the specific cultures of current theaters in operation iraqi freedom oif joint coordination centers jcc have been established in companylevel areas of operation ao the jcc is staffed by both coalition and iraqi nationalforces and serves the purpose of coordinating joint iraqicoalition response to incidents as theyarise and provides formal avenue for information sharing leaders have identified information sharing as one of the key hurdles to the success of the jcc concept because information is one base of power and social power is very important in iraqisociety coalition leaders have found that local iraqi officials tend to resist sharing informationwith other iraqi officials or even with coalition leaders if other iraqi officials might overhear theconversation or otherwise have access to the information this tendency undermines theprincipal purpose of the jcc coalition leaders should be aware of this tendency and work withiraqi representatives in the jcc to see the utility of sharing information with all members of thejcc even to the extent of developing ttp and standing operating procedures sops for thejcc to support information future operations will continue to require leaders to regularly interact with local nationals developing leader education programs of instruction that help leaders understand cultures thatthey will encounter will enable cultural awareness training for specific theater to effectively bea combat multiplier in terms of their effectiveness interacting with local nations most important for official use only 35oef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iirbasic interpersonal skills and practices eg treat everyone with respect and dignity will go long way toward effective operations in foreign cultures insightslessons learned cultural awareness training is very important however interpersonal skills blended with little respect were just as important recognizing basic social cues eg sources of power can help leaders understand the local culture and be more effective working with local nationals leaders should understand that cultural awareness training will not always be applicable to local operating environment depending on social structure and other factors iraqi and afghani people understand american soldiers do not know everything about their culture and are typically forgiving of our lack of knowledge dotmlpf implicationsleadership and education oes and ncoes should emphasize the development of basic

consistently understand the commandersintent particularly at the company level some companylevel leaders noted that they knew whatthe brigade commanders intent was but that it did not seem very applicable to their ao giventhe situation they were facing on the ground one reason for this disconnect may be the widelyvarying conditions in theater with some companies and battalions largely or exclusivelyconducting stability operations and support operations and others conducting almost exclusively combat operations based on the presence of anticoalition forces in their aos the commanders intent which is focused more on nonlethal reconstruction objectives may not seem to make much sense to units focused primarily on combat operations another barrier to effective communication of commanders intent is the modular assembly of units immediately prior to or during deployment deploying units often fall under new commandheadquarters with which they have habitual relationship when this condition exists unitsbegin from ground zero to build relationships both on the command and staff levelunderstanding the new commanders vision and his intent takes time to be fully understood

preventing the education receivedfrom being of maximal use it was noted by several leaders that ncos were attending pldcbncoc and ancoc after they had already been in leadership positions for which thoseschools are directly relevant for example soldiers were attending pldc after being promotedto sergeant and assigned as team leader they reported that they had gained most of theknowledge and

leaders felt it was especially important to keep tabs on themorale of units that were deployed away from the main operating base this was done byvisiting the remote units as often as is practicable frequent phone calls and emails morale was more directly related to leader actions than facilities or comfort items available to the soldiers however the use of morale welfare and recreation mwr

new situations squad leaderswere often required to be platoon sergeants and team leaders must often fill squad leaderpositions the aars which followed each mission were an opportunity for leaders and soldiersto examine the strengths and weaknesses of the unit and improve ttp leaders fostered development in subordinates through stretch assignments stretch assignments were taskings above the normal accepted spanofcontrol for leader of thatposition or rank these assignments enabled junior leaders to exercise decisionmaking anddirective authority in the execution of task while supervised they normally were conducted inan environment where mistakes were learned from and were not considered life threatening 56 for official use onlyoef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iir although these assignments were supervised junior and midlevel leaders were permitted the latitude to develop their own approaches and make mistakes along the way supervising leaderswere able to use the mistakes as training opportunity to point out other courses of action thatmight have been more successful as well as key features of the task that should have beenaddressed in the decisionmaking process ultimately the use of these types of taskings asdevelopmental tools allowed junior and midlevel leaders to successfully assume theresponsibilities of more senior leaders with detriment to unit effectiveness an essential method in leader development was lieutenants being mentored by noncommissioned officers ncos the relationship between platoon sergeant and new platoon leader was oneof the most critical observed platoon leaders were typically brand new officers with littleexperience in contrast platoon sergeants were typically seasoned ncos with great deal ofknowledge and experience in order to maximize the effectiveness of the platoon the platoonsergeant mentored the new platoon leader in variety of areas platoon leaders and senior ncosinsisted that one of the most critical areas was the differences between the roles of the platoonleader and the platoon sergeant particularly with regard to planning and execution of tasks itproved to be prudent for new lieutenant to listen to the guidance from an nco who had moreexperience several ncos mentioned frustration with new lieutenants who came into the unitand changed policies without taking the time to understand why things were done certain waythe ncos were not expecting the lieutenants to keep things the way they were they just wantedthe lieutenant to take some time to understand the unit policies and get to know the people beforemaking drastic changes units in which the lieutenants were willing to learn and take advantageof an ncos knowledge had successful missions and appeared to have higher unit morale insightslessons learned lieutenants who took the time to listen to guidance from their ncos learned about the unit and built solid relationships among the unit leadership junior soldiers perspective on problems was often better than their seniors perspective because of the junior soldiers proximity to the problem serious consideration of innovations by subordinates was way for leaders to develop junior leaders

standards morale was directlyaffected when leaders set unrealistic standards unit who patrolled continuously throughoutoef while pulling guard shifts in between patrols had morale issues when senior leader whonever left for patrols told them to clean their body armor upon return because it was dirty thesoldiers had the feeling that the leader was interested in superficial matters such as the dustinessof their armor and not safety soldiers who did not know what to do in situation looked to the nearest leader for guidance soldiers looked to their leaders to display confidence and calm in the most difficult situationssoldiers followed their leaders example when circumstances were difficult they expectedpositive motivation from their leaders morale was highest in units where leaders shared thehardships and risks of their soldiers leaders who endured hardships equal to or greater thantheir subordinates gained respect and had positive influence on morale when it appeared tosoldiers that leaders took advantage of things not available to all morale declined accompanying soldiers on missions led to credibility when setting standards because soldiers knew that the leader was not asking them to do anything he or she was not willing to do manyleaders were concerned about being either too lax with discipline or alternatively stressingdetails soldiers saw as irrelevant which lead to soldiers not taking the leadership seriouslyleaders found they got better idea of what standards were realistic and developed credibilityby accompanying soldiers on missions leaders priorities change during combat deployment most found it easier to get to know their soldiers because they spent so much time with them some leaders indicated because theyfocused more on the mission priorities changed regarding discipline safety and complacencythe general consensus among senior nco leadership was that what constituted discipline ingarrison was not what constituted discipline during deployment to combat zone some thingsthat were issues in garrison such as making bunk having pressed uniform or wearingunauthorized sunglasses became less important to leaders as they became more focused onmissionrelated issues such as weapons safety vehicle maintenance and correctly wearing bodyarmor and kevlar conversely some lower ranking soldiers and young ncos felt the leadershipcared less about soldiers during the deployment while this appeared related to the change inmission focus by the leadership it seemed to be more result of leaders not being involved inexecution of the mission with the soldiers soldiers did like to be told what to do by leaders whonever left the wire leaders informed soldiers how established standards contribute to mission success this made enforcement of the standards easier morale was directly related to the soldiers knowing theexpectations of their leaders information dissemination was critical soldiers wanted to knowwhat was going on leaders of units with apparent high morale used nonverbal communication for official use only 61oef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iircoaching teaching mentoring development of trust teamwork and counseling as tools to lead their soldiers one important part of information dissemination was the commanders intentsoldiers who understood the commanders intent adapted their plans but remained within theintent one soldier stated not one mission during their whole deployment went as planned itwas critical that all soldiers understood the commanders intent to ensure the overall missiongoals were met many leaders discussed ways in which their commanders intent was presentedto soldiers some leaders had subordinates backbrief them while others observed rock drills andrehearsals without disrupting them to see if the plan was consistent with the intent soldier complacency was an ongoing issue for leaders leaders determined that to avoid complacency they had to be proactive about things such as wearing seatbelts clearing weaponsand wearing kevlar and body armor correctly soldiers saw weapons clearing and safety beltwearing as steps taken to avoid something that rarely occurred anyway as one leader put itsoldiers do what they know will be checked on leaders who stressed safety had to be willingto follow through with actions of spot checking those safety points when leader talked aboutsafety issues but checked up on something else neither task was done well by the soldiers itwas up to all soldiers of all ranks to ensure that complacency did not consume their fellowsoldiers one leader stated for every negligent discharge or other accident there was an ncojust as culpable in some units ncos found soldiers becoming complacent after months of being deployed this led to many of them not taking safety precautions seriously one platoon sergeant took copy ofthe army times and cut out the section listing all military members killed in iraq andafghanistan over certain period of time he cut out each name and had formation with someof his complacent soldiers he distributed the casualty names evenly among the group andmoved the formation to the base of hill adjacent to the forward operating base fob he ledthe group from the base to the top of the hill and once at the top the platoon sergeant had eachsoldier read one of the names he was distributed once complete the element walked back to thebase of the hill and started over again this process took most of the day until all names had beenread at the end of the day the platoon sergeant explained how lucky his soldiers were to bealive more complacency issues arose another option some leaders used for complacency reduction was crosstraining soldiers into different roles within combat patrol units eg swapping one of the dismounts with the gunnerand requiring patrol mission commanders to vary tactics routes and times to break up theroutine aspects of the patrol others included rotating sector assignments for combat patrols androtating mission assignments when possible eg rotating squads among fob security quickreaction force qrf and combat patrol mission assignments on weekly or biweekly

importancethan they previously experienced during combat they will be responsible and held accountablefor issues that they may perceive as being nonmission relevant in garrison that they were able toignore during combat eg uniform cleanliness and unauthorized equipment for most units operational tempo in garrison was not nearly as high as during deployment where tasksmissions and the associated responsibility were pushed down to lower levels due to thenumber of mission requirements in garrison the lessened operational tempo and associatedmission requirements resulted in junior leaders not being given the responsibilities to which theywere accustomed during deployment upon redeployment back to home station all units conduct some form of reintegration training to help soldiers transition

predeployment training subtopic 2 individual readiness training predeployment training for units was described by leaders as uneven at best leaders were challenged to ensure timely appropriate training for their units all units receive some sort oftraining prior to deployment to oif and oef training consisted of basic soldiering skills suchas weapons qualification and land navigation and specific issues such as ied awareness trainingand cultural awareness training the weapons refresher training was seen as redundant but adequate the ied training was often seen as dated and wrong the cultural awareness training was found to be full of inaccuracies bysoldiers who had been deployed previously to muslim country one unit received trainingdesigned for unit deploying to afghanistan while they were actually deploying to iraq leaderswere aware that predeployment training may be dated inaccurate or wrong and were prepared toprovide additional training to soldiers once in theater leaders stated that the army should ensure that personnel administering the predeployment training have the appropriate applied experiences and that the training be as accurate as possible some training such as the basic soldier task of probing for mines proved of little value in theater the block of instruction received was sufficient however the practical exercises provedof little value each individual soldier was required to probe for mines which took over onehour for most of the soldiers the time wasted on the practical exercise of this training couldhave been better utilized for other training use of lessons learned from theater would haveallowed the trainers to know that few soldiers have probed for mines since the beginning of oefand oif each soldier completed individual readiness training irt prior to deployment some soldiers in the unit did not take the training very seriously due to their mechanics mos upondeployment and as result of shortages of personnel in critical jobs the vehicle mechanics werereorganized to conduct dismounted patrolling outside of the forward operating base uponarrival of additional forces the mechanics were again reorganized to become detention facilityguards normally military police function these soldiers and their leaders learned thatwarrior ethos tasks have to be taken seriously by all personnel during training the army has saying that soldiers should train as they fight however soldiers were often issued new gear after they deployed some of the gear affects the soldiers ability to performtheir duties for example some soldiers explained that when dressed in full battle rattle suchas the interceptor body armor kevlar helmets and knee and elbow pads motion was restrictedand took some getting used to in order to effectively use their weapon while soldiers trainedwith some protective gear many soldiers were issued new versions or additional gear oncedeployed other equipment such as weapon sights andor lights mounted on weapons were seenas hindrance when first issued since they interfered with weapon aiming and made it necessaryto conduct weapon zeroing again soldiers stated that they often were not given

receiving new sights various leaders indicated there was confidence in soldiers ability to properly load radios using the automated network control device for tactical secure communications in

fitness training should be emphasized by leaders at all levels prior to and during deployment to oif and oef to help prevent nonbattle injuries the iraq environment wasparticularly harsh during the summer months with daytime high temperatures ranging wellabove 100 degrees fahrenheit these extreme temperatures increased the risk of heat injuriesoverall as well as decreased the effective time before physical exhaustion set in for soldiersone means to mitigate this is to increase physical activities prior to deployment althoughphysical fitness was regular focus of active duty units reserve and national guard units wereoften not able to maintain focus on physical fitness to the degree of active duty units given theextensive use of reserve and guard units in both areas of operation it was critically important forreserve and guard units to incorporate strong focus on physical fitness during mobilizationtraining prior to deployment there were many differences between what units were taught in predeployment training and what soldiers learned once they were in theater soldiers felt that much of the predeploymentcultural training proved not to be totally true the units learned many different cultural lessonsonce they arrived in theater units were taught that during ramadan the people would fast sun uptill sun down many units found this custom was practiced by minority of the people theyreported seeing change in the populations eating and drinking habits during ramadan othercultural tactics techniques and procedures ttp adopted by units in specific areas included expect local men to lie during questioning muslim women seem to be more forthright during questioning when the safety of their children is involved members of tribe will often blame different tribe even if there is evidence sunnis blame the shiites and kurds and viceversa depending on the source single source information can often deteriorate local relations 70 for official use onlyoef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iir cultural awareness training did not cover issues that are common between the iraq and the american cultures although cultural awareness training covered wide variety of topics manyof these areas while useful were never used for example the training stressed never showingthe bottom of your foot to an iraqi however after discussion with leaders at different levels itwas learned that the iraqis never worried much about the bottom of soldiers foot theexplanation was simple the iraqis knew we did not know everything about their culture thesame as they do not know much about our culture many areas of cultural awareness that came into play were never presented in cultural awareness training soldiers were continuously trained on the islamic culture but found many of thesepractices did not apply many soldiers discussed how the importance of praying was emphasizedin training but for an entire year in iraq they only saw few people pray drinking alcoholicbeverages is prohibited in iraq but drunk driving was found to be common in the countryprostitution was also more common than expected in another instance the local nationalsstarted widespread celebratory fire with rifles outside base the base security force assumedthe base was under attack after an alert and reaction to the incident it was found that the iraqipeople were celebrating their countrys victory in soccer game none of these areas wascovered in cultural awareness training and would have been useful insightslessons learned predeployment training should cover cultural similarities and differences iraqi people are much more forgiving of our lack of knowledge on their culture than originally expected warrior ethos tasks have to be taken seriously combat

some units had too many vehicleaccidents or negligent discharges which demanded extra training other units were assigned amission different than their habitual mission or for one it had not trained many units wereassigned equipment other than that which they were trained on units constantly had replacementsoldiers arriving that they must bring up to speed on the units ttp weapons and the localenvironment there are two main safety concerns in oifoef weapons and driving both were managed by specific training of soldiers as well as training replacement soldiers as part of their initialintheater training two schools of thought described the reasons for accidental discharges lack of training and personal complacence accidental versus negligent two specific units will serve as examplesboth units had at least two negligent discharges however the commander of each unitbelieved they occurred for different reasons the first unit had its negligent discharges occurwithin the first two months of deployment and attributed it to the fact that soldiers were not usedto carrying handling loading or clearing their weapons the commander believed that if anegligent discharge occurs because of lack of training it is leader issue after the seconddischarge the following sop was put into place one could clear their own weapon andthen team leader or nco verified that the weapon was clear and b soldiers were givenquarterly refresher training on functions check and the clearing of weapon the soldiersbecame proficient over time and with the sops in place further accidental discharges wereexperienced it was also noted and more strictly enforced that the base policy was to clear allweapons before soldier entered the base so clearing barrels around the dining facilities andmost other places were removed negligent discharges were reduced base wide the commanderof the second unit believed that any discharge was negligent discharge the commander statedthat the unit went through such an extensive multiple weapons familiarization qualification andlive fire training that his soldiers were proficient and must maintain their vigilance whenclearing their weapons therefore he considered negligent discharges result of complacency driving was an often mentioned safety concern one safety office distributed mandatory annual safety training requirements and provided monthly safety advisories before winter began thesafety office mandated all units conduct winterization training to include winter safety coldweather injuries cold weather vehicle operations

driving tactics advanceddriving techniques found in theater were not being adequately trained prior to deploymentdrivers in theater are required to use more aggressive driving tactics than they are permitted inpredeployment training and exercises to address this units are conducting ad hoc training astime and mission requirements permit to develop these driving skills in their soldiers in somecases mission requirements are such that drivers are beginning operations without receiving for official use only 79oef and oif leader challenges initial impressions report iirtraining and must develop these skills as operations are being conducted this significantly increases the risks associated with conducting convoy operations in theater until drivers have hadadequate time to develop more aggressive driving skills many units developed intheater training because they were transformed into another type of unit altogether in one instance the mission directed one intheater unit to convert some subunitsfrom armor cavalry or artillery to motorized infantry these new infantry units did not meetmodification tables of organization and equipment mtoe requirements and had to be issuednew equipment and then train themselves on the newly issued equipment for example oneweapons system not authorized on the artillery or the cavalry mtoe was sniper rifles andrelated equipment also the unit did not have any trained snipers special forces operationaldetachment located on the same forward operating base fob provided sniper instruction to theunit the artillery commander selected the forward observers to act as the sniper element thesoldiers in all units did not routinely train with close combat optics and night vision sightsweapons qualification and proficiency increased over time the armor and cavalry soldiers hadto learn slightly different skills for dismounted and mounted operations in high mobilitymultipurpose wheeled vehicle hmmwv the artillery soldiers had steeper learning curvenormally the ncos would have had the most tactical expertise but in this case the lieutenantsrecently graduated from the basic course had more experience in infantry skills than the ncosthe lieutenants provided team and squadlevel training to the units some units also provide intheater training by way of internet resources communities of practice such as httpsquadleadercom httpplatoonleaderarmymil andhttpcompanycommandarmymil were useful to gain access to broad set of knowledge andexperience this assisted in developing ttp and sops to address unanticipated mission andsituational requirements for example the s3 for hospital stated that the unit had highpercentage of local national child burn victims they were not prepared for approximately twoyears before another unit at the same hospital noted that specific bandage could be used onburn victims and only needed to be changed once week fortunately someone in the unitcanvassed center for army lessons learned call product and made this discovery thisreduced their work load while still providing exceptional burn care the s3 also noted in thesame aarlessons learned that the hospital required additional pediatric ventilators for childcare again this requirement lesson was lost and could have better prepared the unit for propermanning requirements another use of the internet was the posting of information regarding new or unfamiliar equipment for example upon one units arrival at fob it needed additional training on armybattle command systems abcs the only additional training facility was at the main basethe unit sent one individual back to the base for additional training upon completion of trainingand return to the fob additional unit training was conducted using train the trainer concept andthe contractor at the main base set up an additional web site resembling an internet site it wasreferred to as mcslight for dummies the unit found this additional training useful tocomplement the train the trainer program already initiated it provided the unit with tool totroubleshoot the systems for problems they encountered upon arrival in theater another unitfound it

lifeanddeath decisions regarding their soldiers once redeployed to garrison the leaders faced difficult transition they faced situation where they had less daytoday contact with their soldiers the lessened contact made it harder forleaders to detect issues with their soldiers and they only faced issues when they had become aserious problem the decisions made by junior leaders in garrison were often significantly lessimportant than the decisions made during deployment they were responsible and heldaccountable for issues in garrison that were perceived as being nonmission relevant in combateg uniform cleanliness and unauthorized equipment for most units operational tempo in garrison was not nearly as high as during deployment in combat tasksmissions and the associated responsibility was pushed down to junior leaders dueto the shear number of mission requirements in garrison the lessened operational tempo did notrequire pushing responsibilities down to the lower

particularly those who had been promoted to leadership position for the first time during deployment senior leaders tooksteps to prepare their junior leaders for this transition by highlighting the expectations andresponsibilities of junior leaders in garrison environment the general consensus among senior nco leadership was that what constituted standards in garrison was not what constituted

halfday blocks over seven days with the remainder of the time on those days dedicated to allowing soldiers and families to adjust to thesoldier coming home this seven day training period began immediately on arrival back to homestation moreover spouses were invited to attend most training sessions with their soldiersfollowing the seven days of training soldiers continued on with normal work

endstrength to deploy without plusups from other units or the individual ready reserve irr program this made their mission analysisand predeployment training even more critical one of the best things reserve units did for their mission analysis was to coordinate with the outgoing unit through predeployment site survey pdss this survey included visit to thesite by combination of staff officers company commanders and the battalion commander orexecutive officer this visit occurred after the initial unit had been in theater for at least sixmonths visit from the unit in theater to the units predeployment training site was useful ingaining last minute insights into the mission it was also helpful if the unit in theater forwardedtheir after action reviews aars to the followon unit to the extent possible leaders ascertained what types of missions were required in the area of operations ao to which they were to be deployed once identified these missions were trainedto the point of task proficiency for the soldiers who would execute them although many unitswere training on theaterspecific operations prior to deployment often this training was notsufficient to achieve task proficiency one former battalion commander statedbefore your unit is mobilized get soldiers that have just returned from theater to visit your unit when my battalion mobilized for oif the most valuable training

operations weapons proficiency on multiple weapons systems first aid and realistic andpractical cultural awareness training former battalion commander offered the following insights on some of the training issuesonce you get to theater it is more difficult to get on weapons firing range more difficult to get ammunition and more difficult to test fire your weapons bring all your crewservedweapons and night sights if you dont have crewserved night sights try to hand receipt themfrom combat arms units in your ao you will not be issued them in iraq imagine trying to fire a50cal at night with pvs7s that is what many convoy escorts in theater have to do haveeveryone in your unit fire all crewserved weapons at least familiarization fire you neverknow who might be designated to provide convoy escort gun truck duty get your hands on allthe ammo you can do day and night fire with those night sights you just obtained make surethere is headspace and timing gauges another critical reason for firing as many rounds statesideas possible is that range availability in iraq is very limited also at many locations you do notget to test fire your weapons before you leave the wire the more confidence you have beforeyou get to iraq the better recommend practicing assembly and disassembly until you can do itblindfolded during battle assemblies or home station trainup take your weapons into darkroom and practice everyone in your unit should go through combat lifesaver training i did this with my cav troop before desert storm there is reason we cant do it in the reserves now especiallywith all the medical assets available in the reserve component be aggressive and set up thetraining i cant tell you how many unit commanders in iraq told they wish their entire unitwas combat lifesaver qualified dont wait until you arrive in theater to try and do it units arehaving hard time just getting few soldiers to the training and getting recertification done iniraq is challenge as well if you can get number of your soldiers to higher level medicaltraining that is huge bonus for example if you know you will be mobilized in six monthsarrange for group of your soldiers to get first responderems training with your local firedepartment or technical college you probably have someone in your unit that can do the trainingalready remember this is different war css combat service support convoys for exampleroll down the road without any medics anywhere nearby combat lifesavers only do you wantto bet your troops lives on newly schooled combat lifesaver trying to put an iv in for only thesecond time in hisher life that brings up another great point soldiers in theater say topractice ivs more than once during combat lifesaver training all commanders stressed

foraccidental discharges lack of training and personal complacence the issue was accidentalversus negligent both units observed had at least two negligent discharges however thecommander of each unit believed they occurred for different reasons if negligent dischargeoccurred because of lack of training then it was leader issue the unit interviewed had itsnegligent discharges occur within the first two months of deployment and attributed it to the factthat soldiers were not used to carrying handling loading or clearing their weapons thecommander believed that the issue was lack of training qualification versus proficiencybecame theme for the unit after the second discharge the following sop was put into placesoldiers were not allowed to clear their own weapon they traded with buddy and then annco verified the weapons were clear soldiers were given quarterly refresher training onfunctions check and the clearing of weapon soldiers became proficient over time they morestrictly enforced the base policy which was to clear all weapons before soldier entered thebase with this policy clearing barrels around the dining facilities and most other places exceptthe passenger terminal were removed negligent discharges were reduced base wide thecommander of the second unit believed that any discharge was negligence the commanderstated that the unit went through such an extensive weapons
