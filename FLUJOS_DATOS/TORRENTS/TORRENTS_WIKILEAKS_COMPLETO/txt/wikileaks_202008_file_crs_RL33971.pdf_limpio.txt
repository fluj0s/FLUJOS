paul w parfomak and peter folger resources science and industry division january 17 2008 abstract congress is examining potential approaches to reducing manmade contributions to global warming from us sources one approach is carbon capture and sequestration ccs capturing co2 at its source eg power plant and storing it indeﬁnitely eg underground to avoid its release to the atmosphere common requirement among the various techniques for ccs is dedicated pipeline network for transporting co2 from capture sites to storage sites in the 110th congress there has been considerable debate on the capture and sequestration aspects of carbon sequestration while there has been relatively less focus on transportation nonetheless there is increasing understanding in congress that national ccs program could require the construction of substantial network of interstate co2 pipelines s 2144 and s 2191 would require the secretary of energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such network of pipelines s 2323 would require carbon sequestration projects to evaluate the most costeﬃcient ways to integrate co2 sequestration capture and transportation s 2149 would allow sevenyear accelerated depreciation for qualifying co2 pipelines pl 110140 signed by president bush on december 19 2007 requires the sec retary of the interior to recommend legislation to clarify the

secretary of the interior to recommend legislation to clarify the issuance of co 2 pipeline rightsofway on public land that ccs and related legislation have been more focused on the capture and storage of co 2 than on its transportation reflects perception that transporting co 2 via pipelines does not present significant barrier to implementing largescale ccs notwithstanding this perception and even though regional co 2 pipeline networks already operate in the united states for enhanced oil recovery eor developing more expansive national co 2 pipeline network for ccs could pose numerous new regulatory and economic challenges there are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements economic regulation utility cost recovery regulatory classification of co 2 itself and pipeline safety furthermore because co 2 pipelines for eor are already in use today policy decisions affecting co 2 pipelines take on an urgency that is perhaps unrecognized by many federal classification of co 2 as both commodity by the bureau of land management and as pollutant by the environmental protection agency could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future ccs implementation but also to ensure consistency of future ccs with co 2 pipeline operations today in addition to these issues congress may examine how co 2 pipelines fit into the nations overall strategies for energy supply and environmental protection if policy makers encourage continued consumption of fossil fuels under ccs then the need to foster the other energy options may be diminishedand vice versa thus decisions about co 2 pipeline infrastructure could have consequences for broader array of energy and environmental policies

long been concerned about the impact of global climate change that may be caused by manmade emissions of carbon dioxide co 2 and other greenhouse gases1 congress is also debating policies related to global warming and is examining range of potential initiatives to reduce manmade contributions to global warming from us sources2 one approach to mitigating manmade greenhouse gas emissions is direct sequestration capturing co 2 at its source transporting it via pipelines and storing it indefinitely to avoid its release to the atmosphere3 this paper explores one component of direct sequestrationtransporting co 2 in pipelines carbon capture and storage ccs is of great interest because potentially large amounts of co 2 emitted from the industrial burning of fossil fuels in the united states could be suitable for sequestration carbon capture technologies can potentially remove 8095 of co 2 emitted from an electric power plant or other industrial so urce power plants are the most likely initial candidates for ccs because they are predominantly large singlepoint sources and they contribute approximately onethird of us co 2 emissions from fossil fuels there are many technological approaches to ccs however one common requirement for nearly all largescale ccs schemes is system for transporting co 2 from capture sites eg power plants to storage sites eg underground reservoirs transporting captured co 2 in relatively limited quantities is possible by truck rail and ship but moving the enormous quantities of co 2 implied by widespread implementation of ccs technologies would likely require dedicated interstate pipeline network in the 110th congress there has been considerable debate on the capture and sequestration aspects of carbon sequestration while there has been relatively less focus on transportation nonetheless there is increasing understanding in congress that national ccs program could require the construction of substantial network of interstate co 2 pipelines the carbon dioxide pipeline study act of 2007 s 2144 introduced by senator coleman and nine cosponsors on october 4 2007 would require the secretary of energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such network of co 2 pipelines the americas climate security act of 2007 s 2191 introduced by senator lieberman and nine cosponsors on october 18 2007 and reported out of the senate environment and public works committee in amended form on december 5 2007 contains similar provisions sec 8003 the carbon capture and storage technology act of 2007 s 2323 introduced by senator kerry and one cosponsor on november 7 2007 would require carbon sequestration projects authorized by the act to evaluate the most costefficient ways to integrate co 2

public land sec 7147 legislative focus on the capture and storage components of direct carbon sequestration reflects perception that transporting co 2 via pipelines does not present significant barrier to implementing largescale ccs even though regional co 2 pipeline networks already operate in the united states for enhanced oil recovery eor developing more expansive national co 2 pipeline network for ccs could pose numerous new regulatory and economic challenges as one analyst has remarked each of the individual technologies involved in the transport portion of the ccs process is mature but integrating and deploying them on massive scale will be complex task the question is how would the necessary pipeline network be established and evolve 4 thorough consideration of potential ccs approaches necessarily involves an assessment of their overall requirements for co 2 transportation by pipeline including the possible federal role in establishing an interstate co 2 pipeline network this report introduces key policy issues related to co 2 pipelines which may require congressional attention it summarizes the technological requirements for co 2 pipeline transportation under comprehensive ccs strategy it characterizes these requirements relative to the existing co 2 pipeline infrastructure in the united states used for eor the report summarizes policy issues related to co 2 pipeline development including uncertainty about pipeline network requirements economic regulation utility cost recovery regulatory classification of co 2 itself and pipeline safety the report

sequestration is to produce concentrated stream of co 2 for transport and storage currently three main approaches are available to capture co 2 from largescale industrial facilities or power plants precombustion which separates co 2 from fuels by combining them with air andor steam to produce hydrogen for combustion and co 2 for storage postcombustion which extracts co 2 from flue gases following combustion of fossil fuels or biomass and oxyfuel combustion which uses oxygen instead of air for combustion producing flue gases that consist mostly of co 2 and water from which the co 2 is separated6 these approaches vary in terms of process technology and maturity but all yield stream of extracted co 2 which may then be compressed to increase its density and make it easier and cheaper to transport although technologies to separate and compress co 2 are commercially available they have not been applied to largescale co 2 capture from power plants for the purpose of longterm storage7 g22g155g138g151g156g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 pipelines are the most common method for transporting large quantities of co 2 over long distances co 2 pipelines are operated at ambient temperature and high pressure with primary compressor stations located where the co 2 is injected and booster compressors located as needed further along the pipeline8 in overall construction co 2 pipelines are similar to natural gas pipelines requiring the same attention to design monitoring for leaks and protection against overpressure especially in populated areas9 many analysts consider co 2 pipeline technology to be mature stemming from its use since the 1970s for eor and in other industries10 marine transportation may also be feasible when co 2 needs to be transported over long distances or overseas however many manmade co 2 sources are located far from navigable waterways so such scheme would still likely require pipeline construction between co 2 sources and port terminals rail cars and trucks can also transport co 2 but these modes would be logistically impractical for largescale ccs operations 6 intergovernmental panel on climate change special report carbon dioxide

transported by pipeline to porous rock formation that holds or previously held fluids where the co 2 would be injected underground when co 2 is injected over 800 meters deep in typical storage formation atmospheric pressure induces the co 2 to become relatively dense and less likely to migrate out of the formation injecting co 2 into such formations uses existing technologies developed primarily for oil and natural gas production which potentially could be adapted for longterm storage and monitoring of co 2 other underground injection applications in practice today such as natural gas storage deep injection of liquid wastes and subsurface disposal of oilfield brines also provide potential technologies and experience for sequestering co 211 three main types of geological formations are being considered for carbon sequestration 1 oil and gas reservoirs 2 deep saline reservoirs and 3 unmineable coal seams the overall capacity for co 2 storage in such formations is potentially huge if all the sedimentary basins in the world are considered12 the suitability of any particular site however depends on many factors including proximity to co 2 sources and other reservoir specific qualities like porosity permeability and potential for leakage g7g161g146g156g157g146g151g144g561g23g495g21g495g561g5g17 g344g561g18g146g153g142g149g146g151g142g156g561 the oldest longdistance co 2 pipeline in the united states is the 225 kilometer canyon reef carriers pipeline in texas which began service in 1972 for eor in regional oil fields13 other large co 2 pipelines constructed since then mostly in the western united states have expanded the co 2 pipeline network for eor these pipelines carry co 2 from naturally occurring underground reservoirs natural gas processing facilities ammonia manufacturing plants and large coal gasification project to oil fields additional pipelines may carry co 2 from other manmade sources to supply range of industrial

potential ccs policies is still evolving but so far initiatives have focused more on developing capture and sequestration technologies than on transportation specific legislative proposals in the 110 th congress reflect the current perception that co 2 capture probably represents the largest technological hurdle to implementing widespread ccs and that co 2 transportation by pipelines does not present as significant barrier while these perceptions may be accurate industry and regulatory analysts have begun to identify important policy issues related specifically to co 2 pipelines which may require congressional attention g5g17 g344g561g18g146g153g142g149g146g151g142g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g5g21g561 although any widespread ccs scheme in the unit ed states would likely require dedicated co 2 pipelines there is considerable uncertainty about the size and configuration of the pipeline network required this uncertainty stems in part from uncertainty about the suitability of geological formations to sequester captured co 2 and the proximity of suitable formations to specific sources one recent analysis concludes that 77 of the total annual co 2 captured from the major north american sources may be stored in reservoirs directly underlying these sources and that an additional 18 may be stored within 100 miles of additional

onsite transportation and relatively small number of longdistance pipelines only subset of which might need to be interstate pipelines other analysts suggest that captured co 2 may need to be sequestered at least initially in more centralized reservoirs to reduce potential risks associated with co 2 leaks17 they suggest that given current uncertainty about the suitability of various onsite geological formations for longterm co 2 storage certain specific types of formations eg salt caverns may be preferred as co 2 repositories because they have adequate capacity and are most likely to retain sequestered co 2 indefinitely as geologic formations are characterized in more detail and suitable repositories identified co 2 sources can be mapped against storage sites with increasing certainty the current uncertainty over proximity of sources to storage sites however implies wide range of possible pipeline configurations and wide range of possible costs whether ccs policies ultimately lead to centralized or decentralized storage configurations remains to be seen however pipeline requirements and storage configurations are closely related 2007 study at the massachusetts institute of technology mit concluded that the majority of coalfired power plants are situated in regions where there are high expectations of having co 2 sequestration sites nearby18 in these cases the mit study estimated the cost of co 2 transport and injection to be less than 20 of total ccs costs however the study also stated that the costs of co 2 pipelines are highly nonlinear with respect to the quantity transported and highly variable due to physical and political considerations19 another 2007 study at duke university concluded that geologic sequestration is not economically or technically feasible within north carolina but may be viable if the captured co 2 is piped out of north carolina and stored elsewhere20 there are also significant scale economies for large integrated co 2 pipeline networks that link many sources together rather than single dedicated pipelines between individual sources and storage reservoirs21 as congress considers ccs policies it may examine the relationship between co 2 reservoir sites and pipeline requirements g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 economic regulation of interstate pipelines by the

interchanging traffic with other pipelines or transportation modes22 if interstate co 2 pipelines for carbon sequestration are ultimately to be developed it will raise important regulatory questions in this context because federal jurisdiction over hypothetical interstate co 2 pipeline siting and rate decisions is not clear based on their current regulatory roles two of the more likely candidates for jurisdiction over interstate pipelines transporting co 2 for purposes of ccs are the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the surface transportation board stb23 however both agencies have at some point expressed position that interstate co 2 pipelines are not within their purview as summarized below24

the authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities 25 ferc is also charged with extensive regulatory authority over the siting of natural gas import and export facilities as well as rates for transportation of natural gas and other elements of transportation service ferc also has jurisdiction over regulation of oil pipelines pursuant to the interstate commerce act ica26 although ferc is not involved in the oil pipeline siting process as with natural gas ferc does regulate transportation rates and capacity allocation for oil pipelines 27 jurisdiction over rate regulation for pipelines other than water gas or oil pipelines resides with the stb decisionally independent regulatory agency affiliated with the department of transportation28 the stb acts as forum for resolution of disputes related to pipelines within its jurisdiction parties who wish to challenge rate or another aspect of pipelines common carrier service must petition the stb for hearing however there is ongoing regulatory oversight although co 2 pipelines are not explicitly excluded from ferc jurisdiction by statute ferc ruled in 1979 that they are not subject to the commissions jurisdiction because they do not transport natural gas for heating purposes29 likewise the icc in 1980 concluded that congress intended to exclude all types of gas including co 2 from icc regulation after making the initial decision that it likely did not have jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines the icc did conclude that the issue was important enough to institute proceeding and accept comments on the petition and our view on it 30 after the comment period the icc confirmed its view that co 2 pipelines

the two federal regulatory agencies that generally speaking have jurisdiction over interstate pipeline rate and capacity allocation matters appear to have rejected explicitly jurisdiction over co 2 siting and rates and there is legislative or judicial history to suggest that their rejections were improper at the time absent federal authority co 2 pipelines are regulated to varying degrees by the

iccs 1980 disclaimer of jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines other evidence indirectly suggests the possibility that interstate co 2 pipelines could still be considered subject to stb jurisdiction for example an april 1998 report by the general accounting office gao32 stated that interstate co 2 pipelines as well as pipelines transporting other gases are subject to the boards oversight authority the stb reviewed th gaos analysis and apparently did not object to this jurisdictional classification33 furthermore although the stb is the successor to the now defunct icc the stb conceivably could determine that its jurisdiction is not governed by the iccs decision in the co 2 matter indeed the supreme court has ruled that federal agencies are not precluded from changing their positions on the issue of regulatory jurisdiction according to the court an initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone on the contrary the agency to engage in informed rulemaking must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on continuing basis 34 accordingly regulation of co 2 pipelines for ccs purposes by the stb or by ferc for that matter under existing statutes remains possibility g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g20g138g157g142g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 if ccs technology develops to the point where interstate co 2 pipelines become more common and if ferc and the stb continue to disclaim jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines then the absence of federal regulation described above may pose policy challenges in particular with many more pipeline users and interconnections than exist today complex common carrier issues might arise 35 one potential concern for example is whether rates should be set separately for existing pipelines carrying co 2 as valuable commercial commodity eg for eor versus new pipelines carrying co 2 as industrial pollution for disposal furthermore if rates are not reviewed prior to pipeline construction it might be difficult for regulators to ensure the reasonableness of co 2 pipeline rates until after the pipelines were already in service if co 2 pipeline connections become mandatory under future regulations such arrangements might expose pipeline users to 31 cortez pipeline companypetition for declaratory ordercommission

federal agencies claim regulatory authority with respect to co 2 pipeline construction potential builders of new co 2 pipelines do not require and could not obtain federal approval to construct new pipelines likewise federal regulators claim eminent domain authority for pipeline construction and so cannot ensure that pipeline companies can secure rights of way to construct new pipelines by contrast companies seeking to build interstate natural gas pipelines must first obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from ferc under the natural gas act 15 usc 717 et seq such certification may include safety and security provisions with respect to pipeline routing safety standards and other factors 36 certificate of public convenience and necessity granted by ferc 15 usc 717fh confers eminent domain authority the statebystate siting approval process for co 2 pipelines may be complex and protracted and may face public opposition especially in populated or environmentally sensitive areas as the national commission on energy policy ncep states in its 2006 report37 recent developments notwithstanding most new energy projects are s till regulated primarily at the state level and public opposition remains inextricably intertwined with local concerns including environmental and ecosystem impacts as well as in some cases complex issues of property rights and competing land uses in some cases upstream or downstream infrastructure requirementssuch as the need for underground carbon sequestration sites may generate as much if not more opposition than the energy facilities they pport at the same timeand despite recent moves toward consolidated oversight by ferc or other regulatory authoritiesfragmented permitting processes nonstandard permitting requirements and interagency redundancy often still compound siting challenges securing rights of way along existing easements for other infrastructure eg natural gas pipelines electric transmission lines may be one way to facilitate the siting of new co 2 pipelines however existing easements may be ambiguous as to the right of the easement holder to install and operate co 2 pipelines questions may also arise as to compensation for landowners or easement holders for use of such easements and as to whether existing easements can be sold or leased to co 2 pipeline companies38 related issue is whether state condemnation laws which are often used to secure sites for infrastructure deemed to be in the public interest allow for co 2 pipelines to be treated as public utilities or common carriers this issue also arises on federal lands managed by the bureau of land management blm new co 2 pipelines through blm lands potentially may be sited under right of way provisions in either the

drinking water through its authority under the sdwa from potential endangerment as result of underground injection of co 2 in anticipated ccs pilot projects epa s assertion of authority under sdwa for underground injection of co 2 during ccs pilot studies may contribute to uncertainty over future classification of co 2 as commodity or pollutant conflicting classification of captured co 2 as either commodity or pollutant has important implications for co 2 pipeline development for example classifying all co 2 as pollutant not only would contradict current state and blm treatment of co 2 for eor but might also undermine an interstate commerce rationale for ferc regulation of co 2 pipelines on the other hand classifying all co 2 as commodity would create other policy contradictions for example in regions like new england where eor may be impracticable under either scenario legislative and regulatory ambiguities would ariseespecially for an integrated interstate co 2 pipeline network carrying mixture of commodity co 2 and pollutant co 2 resolving these ambiguities to establish consistent and workable ccs policy could likely be an issue for congress

overall annualized pipeline transportation and storage costs of approximately 5 per metric ton of co 246 if co 2 sequestration rates in the united states were on the order of 1 billion metric tons per year at midcentury as some analysts propose annualized pipeline costs would run into the billions of dollars furthermore because most pipeline costs are initial capital costs upfront capital outlays for new co 2 pipeline network would be enormous the 2007 duke study for example estimated it would cost approximately 5 billion to construct co 2 trunk line along existing pipeline rights of way to transport captured co 2 from north carolina to potential sequestration sites in the gulf states and appalachia47 within the context of overall co 2 pipeline costs several specific costrelated issues

costs for natural gas pipelines and to lesser extent petroleum product pipelines in most cases these comparisons appear appropriate since co 2 pipelines are similar in design and operation to other

surge in demand for new co 2 pipe in competition with demand for natural gas and oil pipelines may exacerbate the trend of rising prices for pipeline materials and could even lead to shortages of pipe steel from north american sources as consequence the availability and cost of pipeline steel to build such co 2 pipeline network for ccs may be limiting factor for widespread ccs implementation g5g152g156g157g561g20g142g140g152g159g142g155g162g561 in states where traditional rate regulation exists construction and operation of co 2 pipelines for ccs could raise questions about cost recovery for electric utilities under state utility regulation if for example co 2 pipeline is constructed for the exclusive use of single power plant for on site or nearby co 2 sequestration and is owned by the pow er plant owners it logically could be considered an extension of the plant itself in such cases the co 2 pipelines could be eligible for regulated returns on the invested capital and their costs could be recovered by utilities in electricity rates alternatively such co 2 pipeline could be owned by third parties and considered nonplant asset providing transportation service for fee in the latter case the costs could still be recovered by the utility in its rates as an operating cost two complications arise with respect to pipeline cost recovery first because utility regulation varies from state to state eg some states allow for competition in electricity generation others do not 54 differences among states in the economic regulation of co 2 pipelines could create economic inefficiencies and affect the attractiveness of co 2 pipelines for capital investment second if co 2 transportation infrastructure is intended to evolve from shorter standalone intra state pipelines into network of interconnected inter state pipelines pipeline operators wishing to link co 2 pipelines across state lines may face regulatory environment of daunting complexity without coherent system of economic regulation for co 2 pipelines whether as commodity pollutant or some other classification developers of interstate co 2 pipelines may need to negotiate or litigate repeatedly issues such as siting pipeline access terms of service and rate pancaking the accumulation of transportation charges assessed by contiguous pipeline operators along particular transportation route it is just these kinds of issues which have complicated and impeded the integration of individual utility electric transmission systems into larger regional transmission networks55 g5g17

transportation via pipeline it should be noted however that much of the existing co 2 pipeline network in the united states for eor has been established with the benefit of federal tax incentives although current federal tax law provides special or targeted tax benefits specifically to co 2 pipelines investments in co 2 pipelines do benefit from tax provisions targeted for eor they also benefit from accelerated depreciation rules which apply generally to any capital investment including petroleum and natural gas nonco 2 pipelines for example the internal revenue code provides for 15 income tax credit for the costs of recovering domestic oil by one of ne qualified eor methods including co 2 injection irc 54 in marketbased states cost recovery may affect electricity markets 55 for

for percentage depletion allowance under irc 613b7 prior federal law both tax and nontax also provided various types of incentives for eor which stimulated investment in co 2 pipelines in particular oil produced from eor projects was exempt from oil price controls in the 1970s development of co 2 pipeline infrastructure in the 1980s benefitted from tax advantages to eor oil under the crude oil windfall profits tax law which was in effect from march 1980 to august 1988 although there were never incentives explicitly for co 2 pipelines under federal tax and price control regulation in the 1970s and 1980s it is clear that co 2 pipeline infrastructure development benefitted from these regulations in ccs environment where some captured co 2 is valuable commodity but the remainder is not establishing similar regulatory incentives for co 2 pipelines becomes complex one initial proposal in s 2149 would allow sevenyear accelerated depreciation for qualifying co 2 pipelines constructed after enactment sec 4 as debate continues about the economics of co 2 capture and sequestration generally and how the federal government can encourage ccs infrastructure investment congress may seek to understand the implications of ccs incentives specifically on co 2 pipeline development

associated with co 2 pipelines including the uncertainty about future materials costs and cost recovery some analysts anticipate that co 2 network for ccs will begin with shorter pipelines from co 2 sources located close to sequestration sites larger co 2 trunk lines are expected to emerge to capture substantial scale economies in longdistance pipeline transportation according to the 2007 mit report it is anticipated that the first ccs projects will involve plants that are very close to sequestration site or an existing co 2 pipeline as the number of projects grow regional pipeline networks will likely evolve57 it is debatable however whether piecemeal growth of co 2 pipeline network in this way presumably by individual facility operators seeking to minimize their own costs would ultimately yield an economically efficient and publically acceptable co 2 pipeline network for ccs weaknesses and failures in the north american electric power transmission grid which was developed in this manner may be one example of how piecemeal uncoordinated network development may fail to satisfy key economic and operating objectives as an alternative to piecemeal co 2 pipeline development some analysts suggest that it may be more cost effective in the long run to build large trunk pipelines when the first sites with co 2 capture come on line with the expectation that subsequent users could fill the spare capacity in the trunk line in addition to lower perunit transport costs for co 2 such an arrangement would smooth out potentially intermittent co 2 flows from individual capture sites especially discontinuously operated power plants provide greater buffer for overall co 2 supply fluctuations and generally allow for more operational flexibility in the system58 planning and financing such co 2 trunk line system would present its own challenges however as another analysis points out implementation of backbone transport structure may facilitate access to large remote storage reservoirs but infrastructure of this kind will require large initial upfront 56 unfortunately for eor investors while this tax credit is pa rt of current federal tax law its phaseout provisions mean that presently it is not availablethe cred it is zerodue to high crude oil prices 57 ibid mit 2007 59 58 john gale and john davidson transmission of co 2safety and economic

human body during ordinary respiration so it is commonly perceived by the general public to be relatively harmless gas however at concentrations above 10 by volume co 2 may cause adverse health effects and at concentrations above 25 poses significant asphyxiation hazard because co 2 is colorless odorless and heavier than air an uncontrolled release may accumulate and remain undetected near the ground in lowlying outdoor areas and in confined spaces such as caverns tunnels and basements61 exposure to co 2 gas as for other asphyxiates may cause rapid circulatory insufficiency coma and death62 such an event occurred in 1986 in cameroon when cloud of naturallyoccurring co 2 spontaneously released from lake nyos killed 1800 people in nearby villages63 the secretary of transportation

the pipelines and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa 64 although co 2 is listed as class 22 nonflammable gas hazardous material unde r dot regulations 49 cfr 172101 the agency applies nearly the same safety requirements to co 2 pipelines as it does to pipelines carrying hazardous liquids such as crude oil ga soline and anhydrous ammonia 49 cfr 195 to date co 2 pipelines in the united states have experienced few serious accidents according to ops statistics there were 12 leaks from co 2 pipelines reported from 1986 through 2006none resulting in injuries to people by contrast there were 5610 accidents causing 107 fatalities and 520 injuries related to natural gas and hazardous liquids excluding co 2 pipelines during the same period65 it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these accident data because co 2 pipelines account for less than 1 of total natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines and co 2 pipelines currently run primarily through remote areas

carbonic acid in co 2 pipelines some have also suggested the use or conversion of existing nonco 2 pipelines such as natural gas pipelines to transport co 275 coordination of us co 2 pipeline policies with canada with whom the united states shares its existing pipeline infrastructure may also become consideration finally the potential impacts of co 2 pipeline development overseas on the global availability of construction skills and materials may arise as key factor in ccs economics and implementation g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 policy debate about the mitigation of climate change through some scheme of carbon capture and sequestration is expanding quickly to date debate among legislators has been focused mostly on co 2 sources and storage sites but co 2 pipelines are vital connection between the two although co 2 transportation by pipeline is in some respects mature technology there are many important unanswered questions about the socially optimal configuration regulation and costs of co 2 pipeline network for ccs furthermore because co 2 pipelines for eor are already in use today policy decisions affecting co 2 pipelines take on an urgency that is perhaps unrecognized by many it appears for example that federal classification of co 2 as both commodity by the blm and as pollutant by the epa potentiall could create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future ccs implementation but also to ensure consistency between future ccs and todays co 2 pipeline operations in addition to these issues congress may examine how co 2 pipelines fit into the nations overall strategies for energy supply and environmental protection the need for co 2 pipelines ultimately derives from the nations consumption of fossil fuels policies affecting the latter such as energy conservation and the development of new renewable nuclear or hydrogen energy resources could substantially affect the need for and configuration of co 2 pipelines if policy makers encourage continued consumption of fossil fuels under ccs then the need to foster the other energy options may be diminishedand vice versa thus decisions about co 2 pipeline infrastructure could have consequences for broader array of energy and environmental policies g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
