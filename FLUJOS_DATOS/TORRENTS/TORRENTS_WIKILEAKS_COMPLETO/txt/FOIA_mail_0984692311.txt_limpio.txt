from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to mannvirginiaedu srutherfordvirginiaedu subject re verification results date thu mar 15 163831 2001 mike scott ive redone the verification against instrumental temperatures for 18561899 previously id used 18561900 but ive now realised that 1900 is not part of the verification period the pattern correlation 1 gave it away so ive now stopped in 1899 it makes virtually difference to the quasihemispheric series and their correlations what it does affect is the gridbox by gridbox temporal correlations since i was previously using one perfect value at the end of each series so the correlations are mostly bit lower now though still fairly good i think theres reasonable area with r 03 signal to noise should increase fairly dramatically if some kind of regional averaging were done ive outlined the boxes that actually have chronologies in them theres not enough instrumental data to verify the more northern ones but the european and usa ones do well r in range 05 to 09 the more distant oceanic regions are bit poorer excep the northern indian ocean so thats it for the verification for the moment ive compared the 14041855 ie preinstrumental reconstruction with the briffa et and osborn et reconstructions correlations are all quite high 07 to 085 for the quasihemispheric series while the pattern correlations average around 06 the boxbybox temporal correlations show many boxes with r in the range 06 to 10 indicating little sensitivity to the method used one notable feature of the latter results is that theres less agreement in the boxes that actually have trees than those dont theres two different interpretations of this that im working on which seem equally possible more later i was going to send the time series and maps from this comparison but ive just realised that im using anomalies from two different baselines 196190 for ours 190160 for regem so the variance explained and the time series arent right thatll have to wait till friday now tim
