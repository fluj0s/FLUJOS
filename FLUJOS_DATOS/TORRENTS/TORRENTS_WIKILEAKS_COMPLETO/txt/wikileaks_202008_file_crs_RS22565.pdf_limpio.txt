protected more than 449000 acres throughout the united states authority fo r fpp expires september 30 2007 although demand to participate in fpp continues to grow exceeding available funding there are concerns about how the program has been imp lemented among these concerns are land use limitations and the federa l governments contingent right on land under fpp funded easements during the 109th congress several bills were introduced to amend the fpp statute and to raise program funding but legislation was not enacted similar legislation may be considered in the 110th congress and in the anticipated 2007 farm bill debate this repor t will be updated as events warrant background the farmland protection pr ogram fpp also called the farm and ranch land protection program or frpp is voluntary fe deral program that pr ovides funding toward the purchase of conservation easements from farmers and ranchers to limit conversion of farmland to nonagricultural us under fpp landowner sells the development rights to hisher property thereby limiting certain types of uses or preventing development from taking place on the land while still allowing th owner to retain other ownership rights including the right to farm the program provi des matching funds to state tribal or local governments and nongovernmental organizations working with established farm and ranch land protection pr ograms in partnership with the us department of agriculture usda the program is managed by usda s natural resources conservation service nrcs fpp was initially authorized in section 388 of the federal agriculture improvement and reform ac t of 1996 pl 104127 and wa s reauthorized through fy2007 and amended in section 2503 of the farm security and rura l investment act

levels nd expanded eligibility under the program eligibility the original fpp statute identifie s eligible lands under the program as land with prime unique or other productive soil2 the 2002 farm bill expanded the types of eligible land under the program to include cropland rangeland grassland pastureland and forestland that is part of an agricultural ope ration along with other types of land resources the 2002 farm b ill also expanded the types of tities eligible to participate in the program to include indi an tribes and qualifie d nonprofit organizations operated for conservation purposes to qualify under fpp as outlined by usda3 the land offered must be part or all of farm or ranch and mu st 1 contain prime unique or other productive soil or historical or arch aeological

agricultural pr oduction and 8 be owned by an individual or entity that does not exceed the adjusted gross income agi limitation4 land that cannot be converted to nonagricu ltural uses because of existing deed restrictions or other legal constraints is not eligible for fpp other requirements two main issue areas unde r the program have raised concerns by major stakeholders including land use limitations and requirements pertaining to the federal governments c ontingent right under the program land use limitations on farm and ranch land under fppfunded easements extend beyond the basic restriction against nonagricultu ral development construc tion inside the easement area is generally prohibited and any new farm st ructures need nrcs approval structures including phone towers and wind turbines ar generally considered nonagricultural and would not be allowed subdivision of the land is prohibited impervious surfaces are also limited inside the easement area and may not exceed 2 of the fpp easement area as further promulgated by usda in july 2006 rulemaking5 such restrictions are generally regarded by usda as consistent with language in the fpp statute describing the program for the purpose of protecting topsoil by limiting nonagricultural uses of the land and as consistent with usdas characterization of fpp as an agricultural soils protectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22565crs3 6 16 usc 3838i 71 federal register 42567 july 27 2006 in the notice usda states that conversion of the soils conflicts with the clear purpose of the

use limitations are often perceived by landowners as creating additional and in some cases conflicting restrictions to easement terms already developed and used by some established state local and private protection programs7 2004 informal survey of northeast and mida tlantic state and local farmland protection agencies conducted by the american farmla nd trust aft shows that states use variety of strategies to mana ge new construction on protected lands some states already have specific policies regarding impervious surfaces8 all of the agencies surveyed by aft expressed some concern about us das 2 impervious surface limit respondents in pennsylvania claimed the 2 limit may affect future fpp participation in that state public comments submitted to usda show that some conservation organizations including the new jersey conservation foundation and the nature conservancy continue to support limiting th level of impervious surf aces on fppfunded easements language in the fpp statute instructing nrcs to purchase conservation easements or other interests in eligible lands9 has been interpreted to mean that the federal government retains contingent right in fppfunded conservation easements usda clarified this position in july 2006 rulemaki ng identifying the federal government as grantee coholder on fppfunded easemen ts and outlining the need for possible requirements including additional easement nd title review and indemnification for federal acquisition of real property10 to date nrcs has not exercised its enforcement rights or taken title to any fpp lands however these requirements have been perceived by some as adding levels of bureaucracy and burdensome admini strative requirements which may discourage some farmers from participating in fpp11 funding before 2002 authorized funding for the program totaled 35 million for the purchase of conservation easemen ts on 170000340000 acres the 2002 farm bill authorized funding for fpp as

under the borrowing authority of usdas commodity credit corporation and is not subject to annual appropriations however in recent ears annual agriculture appropriations acts have included language limitin g fpp spending to below the authorized amounts12 actual spending for fpp totaled 112 million in fy2005 and 74 million in fy2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22565crs4 13 usda farm bill forum farm

over the past decade this has paid for fpp easements on approximately 449000 acres on 2290 farms in all states except mississippi the total cumulative easement value of this land is estimated at 11 billion13 states with the greatest overall fpp spending are maryland 30 million new jersey 27 million penns ylvania 26 million california 22 million and massac husetts 21 million14 figure 1 shows fy2006 allocations by state and illustrates that most fpp funds are allocated among the northeastern states and california which are states with the ol dest and most active programs among the reasons why some states may have more limited participation are lack of qualified state conservation program difficulty obtaining matching funds less experience with acceptance of or interest in efforts to protect farmland using easements perceived burdensome administrative requirements and restrictive land use limitations and backlog of unfunded applications under current funding levels source usda nrcs at httpwwwnrcsusdagovprogramsfrpp survey of landowners participating in fpp conducted by the university of nebraska15 shows high level of satisfaction am ong current program participants most of whom have continued to farm on their land the survey shows that 97 of surveyed landowners have at least part of their f pp land in agricultural production roughly half figure 1 fy2006 fpp allocations to stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22565crs5 of those surveyed were smallersized farm s with reported total gross farm sales under 100000 per year the survey shows that nearly threefourths of surveyed owners either believe they have definitely made the right decision to participate in the program or would recommend fpp without rese rvations to other landowners usda reports that demand for the prog ram exceeds available funding by about 300 based on the number of unfunded applications in 2005 there were 542 unfunded applications for fpp easements covering about 127800 acres at an estimated federal cost of 263 million this backlog is up from 2004 when ther were 216 unfunded applications covering about 48000 acres at cost of 101 million in 2005 the number of unfunded fpp acres ex ceeded 10000 acres each in montan florida and colorado see figure 2 states with the most unfunded f pp requests were pennsylvania south carolina connecticut west virginia and vermont source usda nrcs httpwwwnrcsusdagovprogramsfrpp the university of nebraska survey also gives some indication that fpp may be achieving its intended goal of limiting c onversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses among those surveyed 56 reported that th eir fpp land would have been vulnerable to development within year of closing on th easement about 34 of those surveyed received offers to sell their land within year of closing on the easement 36 report their land is located within onehalf mile of public sewer or water line which could have facilitated conversion of the land to nonagricultural uses issues for congress despite growing backlog of potential fpp participants and high level of satisfaction among current pr ogram participants there ar still certain concerns about program implementation particularly follo wing the 2002 farm bill with respect to figure 2 fy2005 fpp unfunde d applications acreshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22565crs6 16 see aft farm and ranch lands protection

address easement valuation among other suggested changes usdas policy manuals and rule making documents for th 2007 farm bill debate aft and the national association of state partments of agriculture nasda are recommending further statutory changes to fpp in part to address concerns about current land use limitations and the fe deral governments propert interest on fppfunded easements aft and nasda also recommend threefold increase in funding to 300 million annually to expand the program and address the backlog of unfunded applications16 the principal program change recommende d by aft and nasda is to establish block grant program for qualified state or local entities they define such entities as having wellestablished record working with conservation easements at least three years of operation and holding easements on at least 10 properties the capacity to monitor and enforce these easements and ade quate financial resour ces for nonqualified entities the program would ope rate as under current law nasdas proposal currently recommends that 80 of funding be distribut ed to qualified entities afts proposal does not set minimum or maximum percentage current land use restrictions would be further addressed in recommended changes authorizing state and local entities to determine their own criteria nd priorities and to use th eir own terms and conditions for conservation easements under fpp thus defe rring such decisions to the state and local level usdas role as grantee cohol der would be further addressed by adding statutory language stating that the federal g overnment would not hold an interest in the property except in easement purchased by nonqualified entities and by clarifying the governments role to facilitate and fund the program aft also proposes that existing statutory language pertaining to protecting topsoil be eliminated possible questions raised by these proposal s include what would the details of an fpp grant program such as program requirements and quantitative criteria to evaluate qualified entities look like how would gran t program encourage br oader participation of land with prime unique or other productive soil rather than strictly favoring states with longstanding established programs in the northeast and in california would nrcs need additional personnel to handle the add ition of grant progra m for qualified entities along with the existing program for nonqualif ied entities how would monitoring and oversight of the easement be enforced w ho would assume responsibility for the property in cases where the qualified entity defaults or fails to comply with the terms of the easement these and related questions may be raised in anticipated farm bill debate during the 109th congress several bills were in troduced to amend the fpp statute and to raise program funding none was enact ed but similar legisla tion may reemerge in the farm bill debate two bills kind hr 6064 and santorum s 3720 sought to enact the program changes recommended by af t and nasda hr 6064 would also have raised authorized program funding to 300 million per year through fy2013 other fpp legislation introduced in the 109th congress included proposals to raise funding to 300 million per year through fy2012 pombo hr 6193 and proposals to amend fpp but not covering the types of changes curren tly proposed by aft and nasda holden hr
