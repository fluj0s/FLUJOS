18th march 2008 statement of michael mannion i have tried my best to depose and assist in the cause of justice but the following events have dissuaded to come forward till now that i was under fear that in case i deposed i might be severely assaulted by the persons who have committed the crime on scarlett that i might be falsely implicated by corrupt police officers of anjuna ps who now stand suspended that on 23rd february 2008 i was advised by adv jos peter dsouza from mapusa that to secure my life and liberty i must lie low or immediately leave goa until he instructed to return i contacted the british high commission in mumbai and was directed to approach the indian authorities and assist the matter with my deposition in fear of my life i have had miserable time i find it hard to believe that it is so difficult for witness to depose on the facts seen by him in civilised society i sincerely hope that an adequate structure is created where witnesses can depose without fear even though i have suffered lot in my attempts to come forward and assist justice my heart is with fiona mackeown whose loss is irreplaceable
