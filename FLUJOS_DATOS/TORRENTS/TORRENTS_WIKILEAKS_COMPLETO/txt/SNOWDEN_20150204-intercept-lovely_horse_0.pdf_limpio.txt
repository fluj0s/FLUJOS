horse from gcwiki jump to navigation search lovely horsejpg lovely horse2jpg lovely horse is tcp task order 144 initiative as part of cdo formerly ndist and the cyber theme towards developing open source capability so far we have worked towards making structured datasets available on the high side for analysts to use this data is available within happy trigger we are now looking towards making use of more unstructured information blogs forums twitter lovely horse seeks to experiment with provision of an indexed repository of unstructured information that can be used to push content of interest to individual analysts via variety of mechanisms the initial lovely horse prototype can be accessed from here see below for more details see also bird seed contents 1 problem statement 2

visualisation and access 4 your thoughts edit problem statement analysts are potentially missing out on valuable open source information relating to cyber defence because of an inability to easily keep up to date with specific blogs and twitter sources accessing these resources involves using specific jedi terminals or reading up at home we need to make this information available to analysts on the high side at their normal terminals however there is balance to be found analysts dont have the time to spend hours and hours reading through loads of blogs in addition we dont want this repository to be yet another tool that analysts have to access this information needs to be incorporated into existing workflows we need to find way to index this information so that analysts only get relevant subset of this information pushed to them edit initial prototype we are working with jtrig to make use of the existing birdstrike architecture for capturing tweets from twitter we are also working with cisa around techniques they are developing to capture blog content both of these obviously take time and are slower burn objectives in the meantime we are running an initial prototype where twitter and and subject to legalsecurity approval blog content is manually scraped and uploaded to gcdesk this content is accessible by way of personalised rss feeds individual users can choose their preferences in terms of which twitter accounts and blogs they want to follow and personalised rss feed is generated automatically for them to which they can subscribe this can be used by anyone and can be accessed from here your personal rss is linked from the lovely horse website as stated previously this is manual update at the moment and will initially be maintained on best endeavours basis hopefully roughly daily once the birdstrike architecture comes on line this will be updated in real time for any requests for new twitter feeds you wish to be able to subscribe to please get in touch edit current sources currently were bringing in the following list of twitter accounts to request new ones please submit your requests with brief justification via the suggestion box on lovely

development concept the rest of this page is constituted from ideas that we currently have about lovely horse edit team it will be delivered by tcps to144 team edit sources initially we need to identify series of sources we currently have list of around 60 blog and twitter sources that have been identified by cdo analysts and cyber defence experts from detica and most of these have been approved for collection by mpleg information will arrive in unstructured information articles in the context of blog an article would be post on twitter an article would be tweet blog sources these sources have currently been approved by mpleg see approvals spreadsheet in discover httpwwwsecureworkscomresearchblog httpwwwsecureworkscommediablog xssnipercomblog

targetedemailattackstublrcomtwitter sources the advice from mpleg on this issue is that provided the accounts you are selecting for acquisition meet the criteria as agreed in the approvals spreadsheet ie those of academics specialising in the identification and investigation of vulnerabilities and malware there is need to seek authorisation for each individual twitter account our selection of twitter sources is currently as listed above but will undoubtedly increase over time further potential sources of interest are found at computer_security_news_and_views edit processing initially these articles get processed into three components edit content the content will be the full textual content of the article this will be stored as some sort of clob in database edit metadata we would strip metadata from the article such as authorsource datetime of submission and used this to update source directory information about the individual sources for example author number of articles in lovely horse average usefulness rating see feedback mechanism tags of subject matter linked with this source see indexing edit index this is the important bit the aim is to index the unstructured information so that it can be linked back to an analysts particular interest as enrichment to an existing investigation the proposed idea is to make use of tagging defining indexing as identifying keywords each article would be tagged with information that had been extracted from it these tags could be ip addresses domains or any text string from within the content of the article effectively these tags are the output of entity extraction and this list of tags would then be associated with that article similarly lists of tags are associated with individual analysts to define their specific interest set edit how to generate pot of tags we would need pot of tags that becomes our entity set which were extracting from new articles coming in how to generate this pot of tags simple idea would be to regex for ip addresses and domains to start off with could index every capitalised word in blog title could get analysts to provide list of keywords they are specifically interested in could we extract keywords from existing analyst toolsets for instance do analysts tag investigations within palantir analysts should be encouraged to tag articles they read there is potential to link this entity extraction initiative in with corporate entity extraction tools that may provide more sophisticated matching could try and analytically identify tags whole articles could be tokenized and word count generated if particular term appeared say 4 or 5 times in the current week but not last week then maybe thats new trend in which case we should add this term to the pot of tags edit feedback mechanism important to allow analysts easy ability to appraise usefulness of information analysts should be able to like content from whichever interface theyre accessing the content if an analyst likes particular article tags from that article are automatically added to their personal tag list articles can have usefulness rating assigned to them generate some metric on the lines of number of likesnumber of views articles that have usefulness rating over specific threshold could be pushed to all analysts an average of the usefulness ratings across all articles from one source can be used to appraise different sources almost becomes crude confidence factor in the information should i trustact upon this information edit visualisation and access need to be different ways analysts access and view this content palantir as enrichment to existing investigations similarly to the current enrichment helper any articles that had tags which are entities within the investigation are flagged up the content should then be viewable in human readable format within palantir alerts analysts should be alerted when new article is tagged with tag from their interest set how should this alerting happen email rss feed general search there should be lovely horse front end that can be used for analysts to search across the whole repository would want to investigate tools that can provide googlelike searching need to investigate mera peak nsas lexhound may need to be timeframe element in the enrichment content that is 2 years old may not be relevant poc redacted mail edit your thoughts
