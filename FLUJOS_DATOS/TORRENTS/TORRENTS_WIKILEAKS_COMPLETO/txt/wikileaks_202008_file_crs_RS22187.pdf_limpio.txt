during the 20012003 period us cotton exports accounted for 40 of world trade while us cotton subsidies averaged 3 billion per year in late 2002 brazil major cotton export competitor expressed its growing concerns about us cotton subsidies by initiating wto dispute settlement case ds267 agains t specific provisions of the us cotton program on september 8 2004 wto dispute settlement pa nel ruled against the united states on several key aspects of us cotton programs discussed belo w this ruling was appealed by the united states and on march 3 2005 wto appellate body ab upheld the panels ruling

httpwwwfasusdagovexcreditsdefaulthtm the wto dispute settlement panels recommendation in their ruling against the united states the wto panel and the ab identified two subsidy types prohibited and actionable each subsidy involves different type of response and different time table for implementation1 under the wtos agreement on agriculture prohibited subsidies are treated with greater urgency than actionable subsidies in particular they are given shorter time frame for compliance prohibited subsidies two us programs were found to operate as prohibited subsidies step 2 payments and export credit guarantees step 2 payments were part of special cotton marketing provisions authorized under us farm program legislation to keep us upland cotton competitive on the world market2 step 2 payments were made to both exporters and domestic mill users to compensate them for their purchase of us upland cotton which tends to be priced higher than the world market price step 2 payments were deemed wtoillegal because they were paid only to users of us cotton ie they discriminated against foreign cotton by encouraging the use of domestic products over imported products and becau they were unscheduled ie xport subsidies applied to commodities not liste d on countrys wto schedule or made in excess of the value listed on the schedule3 usdas export credit guarantee pr ograms gsm102 gsm103 and scgp underwrite credit extended by private us ba nks to approved foreign banks for purchases of us agricultural products by foreign buyers4 gsm102 covers credit terms up to three years while gsm103 covered longer credit terms up to 10 years the supplier credit guarantee program scgp in sured shortterm open account financing designed to make it easier for exporters to sell us food produc ts overseas the wto panel found that all three export credit programs effectively f unctioned as export subsidies because the financial benefits returned to the government by these programs failed to cover their long run operating cost furthermore the panel f ound that this exportsubsidy aspect of export credit guarantees applies not just to cotton but to all recipient commodities that benefit from us commodity support programs in othe r words so long as the credit guarantees act as an implicit export subsidy only us program crops that ve export subsidies listed in their wto country schedule are eligib for us export credit guarantees the ab recommended that the united states withdraw its prohibited subsidies by july 1 2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22187crs3 5 as defined in article 1 of the wtos agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures 6 for more information on the peace clause and its role in this dispute see crs report rl32571 background on the usbrazil wto cotton subsidy dispute by randy schnepfactionable subsidies any subsidy may be challenged in the wto ie is actionable if it fulfills the wto definition of subsidy5 and is alleged to cause adverse effects to the interests of other wto members in particular pricecontingent payments ie payments dependent on changes in curre nt market prices including marketing loan provisions step 2 payments market loss payments and countercyclical payments ccp were identified as contributing to serious prejudice to the interests of brazil by depressing prices for cotton on the worl d market during the marketing years 19992002 the panel recommended that the united states take appropriate st eps to remove the prejudicial effects of actionabl subsidies or to withdraw the subsidies entirely the ab upheld the original panels recommenda tion and added deadline of september 21 2005 for their removal such actionable subsidies were previous ly afforded some protection under the socalled peace clause article 13 of the wtos agreement on agriculture however the wto panel reviewing the cott on case found that the united states was in violation of its peace clause spending limit such that brazils dispute settlement case could proceed6 the panel ruled that neither production flexibility contract pfc payments under the 1996 farm bill nor dir ect payments dp under the 2002 farm bill qualify for the wtos green box exemption as decoupled payments due to planting restriction on fruits vegetables and wild ri ce on program base acres as result pfc and dp payments were counted against th us peace clause limit see the role of congress section at the end of this repor t for discussion of related 2008 farm bill provisions us response to the panel ruling after losing its appeal the united states announced that it intended to fully comply with the panel recommendations in july 2005 usda instituted temporary fix for its export credit guarantee programs to make the fees charged by the programs more risk based higher fees were needed to ensure that the financial returns of these programs fully cover their longrun operating costs thereby eliminating their subsidy component in addition the ccc stopped accepting applica tions for payment guarantees under gsm 103 these efforts were formalized in the 2008 farm bill pl 110234 sec 3101 which eliminated the gsm103 and scgp prog rams and removed 1 cap on fees that could be charged under the gsm102 program on august 1 2006 the step 2 cotton program which was authorized by th 2002 farm act pl 107171 sec 1207 was eliminated by provision sec 1103 in th deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109 171 the administration likely felt that suffi cient program changes had been enacted to fully comply with the actionable subsidies portion of the wto ruling

information on the status of doha negotiations see crs report rl33144 wto doha round the agricultural negotiations by charles hanrahan and randy schenpfexpired brazil first requested july 4 2005 authorization from the wto to impose 3 billion in countermeasures against the prohib ited us subsidies this value corresponds to 1 step 2 payments made in the thenmostrecentlyconcluded marketing year 20042005 and 2 the total of exporter pplications received under the three export credit guarantee programs for all unscheduled commodities and for rice for the then mostrecent fiscal year 20047 to achieve 3 billion in retaliation brazil proposed to suspend tariff concessions as well as ob ligations under the wto agreement on trade related intellectual property rights and the general agreement on trade in services the united states objected to the amount of brazils propos ed sanctions and requested wto arbitration however the united states and brazil reached procedural agreement temporarily suspending arbitration proceedin gs concerning the prohibited subsidies second as the september 21 2005 deadline to address the actionable subsidy ruling expired brazil charged that the united st ates had neither taken nor announced any specific initiative for the pricecontingent programs deemed to cause prejudicial impact to brazils trade interest brazil then requested authorization from the wto to impose countermeasures valued at 1 billion as reta liation against the actionable programs once again the united states requested wto arbitration over the level of the proposed sanctions again the united states and braz il reached procedural agreement thereby temporarily suspending further arbitration proceedings on the actionable subsidies the suspensions were likely intended to permit policy reform to occur in less confrontational forum under either the theno ngoing congressional bate on an extension or revision of us farm legisl ation as current farm law was set to expire in 2007 or the ongoing doha negotiations brazil requests compliance panel initially brazil showed willingness to permit the us legislative process motivated by the 2007 expiration of us farm programs and the prospects of successful doha round of trade negotiations8 to bring us farm programs into compliance with the wto ruling even if this process extended well beyond the deadlines established under the wto dispute settlement ruling however on august 21 2006 brazil requested the establishment of wto compliance panel to review whether the united states had fully complied with the pane l and ab rulings on december 18 2007 the wto compliance panel released its final report ruling that the united states had not fully complied with the march 2005 wto ruling agai nst certain us cotton support programs in february 2008 the united states appealed the compliance panels ruling in june 2008 wto appellate body ab publicly re leased its final report upholding the compliance panels ruling that the united states had not fully complied with the march 2005 wto ruling the ruling against the unite d states could necessitate further us farm program changes or if further changes are forthcoming clear the way

brazil will likely resume arbitration over the value of sanctions authority requested by brazil to be completed within 60 days the us response to the wto cotton ruling is being watched closely by developing countries particularly by consortium of four african cottonproducing c ountries that has submitted its own proposal to the wto calling for global agr eement to end all pr oductionrelated support for cotton growers of all wtomember countries9 role of congress when confronted with negative wto di spute settlement ruling country has essentially five options to choose from liminate the subsidy reduce the subsidy to diminish its adverse effect revise the program function to reduce the linkage between the subsidy and the adverse effect referred to as decoupling pay mutually acceptable compensatory payment to offset the advers effects of the subsidy or suffer the consequences of trade retaliation ultimately congress is res ponsible for passing farm program legislation that complies with us commitments in international trade agreements the united states would appear to have already complied with most if not all of the abs recommendation concerning pr ohibited subsidies by liminating the step 2 gsm103 and scgp programs and by removing the fee cap on gsm102 credit guarantees ie by eliminating the subsidy component of export credit guarantees however some questions remain as to what extent the 2008 farm bill pl 110234 has addressed the serious prejudice charge related to pricecontingent subsidies instead of eliminating or reducing program triggers the 2008 farm bill appears to offer higher levels of price and income support that potentially could aggrav ate the perception if not the reality of serious prejudice in the mark etplace several of the pr oposed changes are specifically relevant to the brazil cotton case but also germane to the broader issue of program vulnerability to wto challenge10 for example the enacted 2008 farm bill11 extends the countercyclical paym ents ccp program and current marketing loan provisions sec tions 1104 and 1201 of pl 110234 raises both target prices and loan rates for several commodities while only lowering marginally the targ et price for upland cotton sections 1104 and 1202 offers producers the choice subject to 30 reduction in marketing loan rates and in lieu of 100 of ccp nd 20 of direct payments of revenuebased support option under th average crop revenue election program acre section 1105 with potentially higher peracre revenue guarantees for several crops than under the previous 2002 farm bill and creates new cottonuser paymen t of 4 cents per pound section 1207 this payment appears similar to the wtoillegal step 2 payment excepthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22187crs6 12 see crs report rl34351 brazil and canadas wto cases against us agricultural support by randy schnepf that cotton from all origins not just domestic sources is eligible for the payment since the united states imports very little cotton most payments would still likely go to domestically sourced cotton as result this subtle technical loophol might ultimately be subject to wto challenge but would not be pa rt of the current wto cotton case finally the 2008 farm b ill does not address the issue rrounding the disqualification of direct payments from the wtos green box exclusion as decoupled payments due to the planting restriction on fruits vegetables nd wild rice on program base acres instead direct payments are extended with change to the current planting restriction except for small pilot program on 75000 acres in ven states pl110234 sec 1107 this retention of the status quo has important wto implications as both canada and brazil have recently initiated wto cases against th united states charging that the united states has exceeded its total limit for the ggregate measure of support ams on several occasion in recent years if direct payments are included in the ams calculation12 additional uncertainty arises from the ong oing doha round of trade negotiations where successful conclusion could potentially mitigate or end brazils interest in continuing its case against the us farm programs both agriculture committees house and senate of the 110th congress will likely continue to monitor developments in the wto cotton case and the doha negotiations as well as the aftermath of the compliance panels final ruling
