technology policymaking primer summary scientific and technical knowledge and guidance influences not just policy related to science and technology but also many of todays public policies as policymakers seek knowledge to enhance the quality of their decisions science and technology policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for and encouragement of scientific and engineering research and development the use of scientific and technical knowledge to enhance the nations response to societal challenges and the education of americans in science technology engineering and mathematics science and engineering research and innovations are intricately linked to societal needs and the nations econom in areas such as transportation communication agriculture education envir onment health defense and jobs as result policymakers are interested in almo st every aspect of science and technology policy the three branches of government executive congressional and judiciary depending on each branchs res ponsibility use science and technology knowledge and guidance to frame policy i ssues craft legisl ation and govern the science and engineering community however is not represented by one individual or organization on matters of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance its opinions are consensusbased with groups of scientists and engineers coming together from different perspectives to debate an issue based on the available empirical evidence in th end consensus is achieved if there is widespread agreement on the evidence and its implicati ons which is conveyed to policymakers policymakers then determine based on this knowledge and other factors whether or not to take action and what actions to take if there are major disagreements within large portions of the community however consensus is not yet achieved and taking policy actions in response to concern can be challenging several organizations when requested by the federal government or congress provide formal science and technology po licy advice federal advisory committees congressionally charte red honorific organizations and federally funded research and development corporations in addition many other orga nizations and individuals international intergovernmental organizations policy institutesthink tanks the public professional organizations disciplinary societies universities and colleges advocacy special interest industry trade ssociations and labor also provide their thoughts these organizations may agree on the scientific nd technical knowledge regarding an issue but disagree on what acti ons to take in response as their values on proposed policy may differ polic ymakers may be overwhelmed with an abundance of information from these organizations despite these challenges scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can provide policymakers with an opportunity to make their decisions based on the best information available along with other f actors they might take into account such as cultural economic and other values so th at societal and economic benefits are enhanced and losses are mitigatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34454contents overview of

analysts as cornerstone of thi nking about science and technology st policy decisionmaking science and technology policy is concerne d with the allocation of resources for scientific research and technical development it includes government encouragement of science and technology as the roots of strategy for industrial development and in economic growth but it also includes the use of science in connection with problems of the public sect or because of the close association of basic research with higher educati on this aspect of science and technology policy is difficult to separate from over all educational policy and from scientific and technical workforce policy1 because science and technical knowledge and guidance influences public policy decisionmaking on many other issues some think that science and technology policy does not need to be separate field of inquiry2 others however view st policy as different from other public policy issu areas these differences include the rapidity of change in science and technolog novelty of many issues in science and technology scale complexity and interdependence among technologies irreversibility of many scien tific and

constitution itself in 1787 when the congress was given power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the excl usive right to their respective writings and discoveries4 at the request of president washingt on congress passed its first science and technology policyrelated act regarding patents in 17905 these actions led to todays patent and trademark office pto the constitution also identified the utility of scientific and technical policy guidance in the sense of congressional power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures6 this is the origin of todays national institute s of standards and technology nist in addition the constitution stated that capitation

and technology policy has four facets science for policy technology for policy policy for science and policy for technolog y11 these facets cannot be easily separated but can help provide framework to better understand the policy decisions that policymak ers are addressing in given situation this in turn can reflect how policymakers consider the policy advice they are given by the scientific and technical community science for policy and technology for policy are when scientists engineers and health professionals see box 1 provide analysis knowledge and data to inform policymakers with the goal of enhancing their ability to make wise decisions this scientific and technical guidance is available for almost any public policy arena classic example is global climate change policymakers debate questions such as at what point actions if any should be ta ken to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions if action is taken what are the possible impacts of global climate change on the united states and other countries if policym akers decide to take action what policy steps could the united states take to mitig ate greenhouse gas emissions or to adapt to global climate change policymakers ar the ones who decide what steps should be taken to manage these risks they can base their decisions on the guidance provided to them by the science engineering and health communities in contrast policy for science and policy for technology are when policymakers take actions that influence the st community or the actions in which they engage such as research12 or stbusiness related activities eg patent law in the casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34454crs4 12 continued by deborah d stineof climate change for example these same policymakers make decisions such as the degree to which the federal government s hould invest in clima change related research whether or not to establish programs and organizations that set priorities for this research and what technologies fede ral agencies should i

americans cons ider medicine to be the most scientific followed by biology physics and engineerin g economics and sociology both social sciences are not considered to be as scien tific as these fields although about 50 of americans consider these social sciences to be either very scientific or pretty scientific about 40 of americans consider them not too scientific or not at all scientific the

and technology policy was on science for policy and technology for policy of particular importance was scientific and technical advice related to public health agriculture and geography president jefferson for example commissi oned the lewis and clark expedition to explore the western united states that opened trade in the far northwest and made significant scientific findings in the life sciences13 as the nation grew scientific and technical knowledge became important for issues related to the military and issues related to the welfare state such as care for the needy and universal education and liter acy in general research was supported primarily through the philanthr opy of wealthy individuals14 during the civil war however research became pa rt of the militarys mission and

college system focusing on agricultural research 1862 and the weather bureau 1870 providing telescope for the naval obse rvatory and supporting polar explorations and surveys of the western united states15 issues began to arise regarding how science should fit into the fe deral governments structure as result in 1884 congress set up joint commission made up of three members each from the house and the senate chaired by senator w b allison the allison commission discussed proposals for department of science and nationa l university as well as the need for the government to coope rate not compete with universities and concerns about duplication in the nd the allison commission affirmed the utility of federal funding of science but did not recommend separate department or any other actions16 at the beginning of the 20th century prior to world war i additional issues became the focus of the nations sc ience and technology policy including conservation medicine and public health and numbe r of additional science organizations were established in the federal government eg food and drug administration in addition the first indus trial research laborat ories and largescale mechanized industry were started world war i brought about dditional application of science and technolog to weapon development17 during the period between world war i and through world war ii the role of the application of research to provi technology for both military and economic purposes became evident longer were philanthropists the primary sources of funding for research and development rd instead it was the federal government this lead to fundamental change in the relation between the fe deral government and the st community this policy for technology focused on areas such as weaponry communications and medical needs such as surgical innovations during this period the capabilities of science and technology were widely recognized due to the use of chemicals aircraft mechaniz ed weapons radar and othe r technological applications in world war ii as result president franklin d roosevelt established the office of scientific research nd development 1941 the ma

his report bush indicated that scientific progress was essential for the war against disease for national security and for the public welfare the report also recommended that the federal government should undertake responsibility for renewing th nations scientific talent to respond to these needs bush proposed new federal agency that would accept ne w responsibilities for promoting the flow of new scientific knowledge and the development of scientific talent of our youth this recommendation eventually led to the establishment of the national science foundation nsf today science and

most industries use science and technology to some degree ten industries have been identified by the oecd as having strong linkage to science and technology oecd organizes these industries into two

sometimes different perspectives of th science and technology community and policymakers regarding science and technolog policy this section also discusses different perspectives on fede ral funding of research po licy for science and science for policy and policy for technology and t echnology for policy the perspectives identified here may arise regardless of the issue being discussed whether it be energy transportation agriculture or science itself science and technology community and policymakers number of criteria may determine the utility of scientific and technical knowledge and advice to policymakers thes include whether or not this advice is relevant disinteres ted and credible22 conflicts can occur if these criteria are not met further the st community and polic ymakers can on occasion view science and technology policymaking quite differently for example while the st community tends to have longtime horizon policymakers must often make decisions very quickly based on the available knowledge see box 2 sometimes the reverse occurs in these situations the st community may believe decision is needed quickly due to the nature of th risk involved while the policymaker is concerned about the political and econo mic implications of taking the action recommended by the st community the st community may also believe that the knowledge they communicate should be the primary factor influencing policymakers decision while the policymak er believes they need to take into consideration other factors they believe are qually important one analyst identifies four different degrees of interaction between scientists and policymakers from interaction to s ubstantial interaction these include the pure scientist seeks to focus only on facts and has interaction with the decision maker the science arbiter answers specific factual questions posed by the decision maker the issue advocate seeks to reduce the scope of choice available to the decision maker the honest broker of policy options seeks to expand or at least clarify the scope of choice available to the decision maker23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34454crs10 many would contend however that the r eality of st policymaking is such that there is clear delineation as outlined here rather the interaction of scientists engineers and health professionals with policymakers is mix of each of these categories scientists engineers and health professionals like any other us citizen also advocate for action on policies related to the st community itself or promote their personal views for example members of the st community are recipients of federal funding for research employed by universities or colleges impacted by higher education policy work for industries infl uenced by tax policy and often have general interest in the quality of science engineering technology and mathematics stem education at the k12 level relative to future education and workforce needs scientists and engineers may also have personal preferences with regard to public policies that may influence their political action on issues such as climate change stem cell research or others box 2 science the interaction with policy scientific knowledge is dynamic changing as new information becomes available in this sense science does not reveal truth so much as produce the best available or most likely explanation of natural phenomena given the information available at the time in many cases analysis of data may give an estimate of the degree of confidence in the explanation moreover scientific conclusions naturally depend on the questions that are asked the scientific method has at its heart tw values that are strongly implied but not often stated 1 transparent approach in which both new and old data are available to all parties and 2 continuing effort to update data and therefore modify and even reject previously accepted hypotheses in light of new information together transparency and updating are the cleansing mechanisms that gradually sweep away scientific misunderstandings and errors sine qua non for scientific advancement decisionmakers usually seek to affect how the world ought to or should be science provides one source of input for ma king policy decisions that balance diverse considerations source excerpted from crs report rl32992 the endangered species act and

held by various entities in various ways for example junior researchers may favor risktaking wh it comes to research funding while at the same time supporting set aside programs designated for

ons consortium project on the history and sociology of st sta tistics working paper 30 2005 at httpwwwcsiiccapdfgodin_30pdfscience for policy can be contentious because it informs policy discussions where there are sometimes disagreements as to what policy actions should be taken if any due to the societal and economic implications the same scientific paper may be viewed in different ways depending on the perspectives of the advocate sometimes there are differing views as to the degree of consensus among the st community on particular issue alternatively minority in the st community may have strong beliefs rega rding the scientific and technical evidence on an issue that do not agree with the majority as result when science for policy issues are discussed in political setting strong views can emerge on both sides of an issue policy for technology and technology for policy the us bureau of economic analysis has estimated that if rd were treated as investment it would have accounted fo r 5 of real gross domestic product gdp growth between 1959 and 2004 and 7 betw een 1995 and 200426 stanford university hoover institution study found that if us students performed in science and mathematics education at level comparable with the worlds leaders us gdp would increase27 as result policymakers are often interested in the innovation process both policy for technology and technology for policy particularly the relationship between science engineerin g economics educa tion and job creation28 in the case of policy for technology perspectives on given policy may differ because of differing views of the innovati on model one perspective of innovation policy based on the lin ear model of innovation29 leads some policymakers to believe that it is inappropriate to use federal resources to invest in technological development rather private resources should be used to invest in this portion of the innovation process as private entities will receive the returns on investment an alternative perspective is that research and innovation can be so interrelated that it is not possible to separate the two polic ymakers with this perspective on

presented in th is report some would contend that the barriers illustrated in the model are not concrete but porous research can easily move from one category to another as illustrated by the pasteur example mentioned earlier for example there is little distinction sometimes between basic research applied research development and co mmercialization ther may not be much difference for example in biotechnology research conducte d at university or at small company funded by venture capital as result some policymakers belie ve that in knowledge based economy federal investment in rd s hould be

related societal and economic goals some contend that fe deral investment should not stop at the point just before prototype and product technological development34 this some believe is particular ly important as in global economy foreign firms are as easily able to capture the results of federal investment in research as us firms35 on the other hand some policymakers expr ess concerns that investing in rd in sector closely linked to industry or for that matter at any stage of technology commercialization may result in the federal government picking winners and losers for example although some believe that federal inves tment in information technology rd has resulted in benefits for the country and helps by setting industry standards others be lieve that federal i nvestment in

that same science and engineering community76 as supreme court justice stephen breyer states the practice of science depends on sound law law that at minimum supports science by offering the scientist breathing space within which he or she may search freely for the truth on which all knowledge depends it is equally true that the law itself increasingly requires access to sound science this need arises because society is becoming more depe ndent for its wellbeing on scientifically complex technology so to an increasing degree this technology underlies legal issues of importance to all of us we see this conclusion illustrated throughout the legal system77 the us supreme court has determin ed when judges should assess the reliability of the scientif ic methodology and reasoning that

administrative law judges and arbitrators in identifying highly qualified scientists engineers and healthcare professionals to rve as scientific experts81 the judiciary system can also influence science and technology in science the courts are involved with two types of cas those involving charges of scientific misconduct such as research with human s ubjects and those related to religious or moral opposition to particular ki nds of scientific research or the teaching of science such as biotechnology research or the teaching of evolution in schools82 judiciary activities related to tec

this area is supreme court decision to allow patenting of genetically engineered microorganism83 what organizations provide science and technology advice to policymakers the amount of scientific and technical knowledge and data produced by the st community can be sometimes be overwhelming given the nature of the scientific and engineering research enterprise which relies on system of peer review and replication organizations that pr ovide scientific nd technical advice to policymakers can help provide an overview and synthesis of scie ntific and technical knowledge and data and provide their view of consensus of the st community the science and engineering community however is not represented by one individual or organization on matters of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance its opinions are consensusbased with groups of scientists and engineers coming together from different perspectives to debate an issue based on the available empirical evidence in th end consensus is achieved if there is widespreadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34454crs30 84 for more information see crs report rl30260 federal advisory committees primer by stephanie smithagreement on the evidence and its implicati ons if this occurs the knowledge is conveyed to policymakers so they can deter mine among other factors whether or not to take policy actions in response if there are major disagreements

and colleges advocacy special interest industry trade associations and labor also provide their thoughts see figure 5 these organizations may agree on the scientific and techni cal knowledge but disagree on what actions to take in response on an st policy as their values on proposed policy may differ for example there may be agreement that action needs to be taken in response to concerns about climate change but proposed policy respons may range from calls for additional research to emission reductions to gasolin tax if the groups agree on general policy response such as emission reducti on they may still disagree on the best way to achieve that goal these organizati ons described below use variety of mechanisms including papers reports and events to convey information to

current science and technology policy decisionmaking process this primer on st policy decisionmakin g provides an overv iew how science and technology influences policy and how policy influences st policy the report also describes the major sources of know ledge and advice for policymakers in surveying this landscape it is perhaps wort hwhile to also reflect on the opportunities and challenges facing the current st policy decisionmaking process science and technology policy decisi onmaking is both democratic and decentralized in other words many or ganizations and individuals representing wide array of ideas and opi nions participate in st policy decisionmaking one organization or individual is viewed as speak ing on behalf of the entire scientific and technical community either inside or out side the federal government each freely offers sources of knowledge and advice this provides policymakers with an overwhelming amount of information and it can be challenging to sort through it all to determine which information is the most germane to particular issue or decision communication between policymakers and the science and engineering community can also be challenge due to fundamentally diffe rent perspectives regardless of the issue in addition the science and engineering community may find it challenging to recognize that the information they provide is only one factor in policymakers decision process which can include cultural economic and other values another challenge is that many federa l government agencies can simultaneously influence st policy issue agencies often have overlapping roles that can influence assessments of risk allocati on of responsibility problemsolving and patterns of participation117 for example federal decisionmaking regarding

critics of the current st policy d ecisionmaking process say it can be challenging to make logical and consistent policies as each of these federal agencies may assess the risk of given policy from different perspec tive without unified assessment119 there are many organizations and individuals in congress the judicial branch state and local governme nts and outside of government such as industry advocacy groups think tanks and others who also offer their thoughts on any given st policy as result this diversity leads some experts to believe that st policy decisions can not be ma coherently nd consistently further some critics say th at public policies do not always reflect what is known about science and technology and neither policymakers nor the public have sufficient understanding to make appropriate decisions120 reliance on experts may help policymakers make decisions but some express concerns that the experts themselves are unable to separate their personal bias sufficiently to provide an independent analysis of the situation for example on climate change so have expressed concerns that some scientists are unable to separate their personal beliefs regarding public policy when providing the results of their research to policymakers121 in addition experts do not always agree with one another due to the inherent uncertainty in science as result policymakers may find it challenging to obtain sufficiently clear answer for decisionmaking policymakers must often decide whether to make choice on current assessment of the cost s and benefits of ta king action based on imperfect information or to await additional scientific and technical information moreover while scientific knowledge and technological development is changing constantly the same is not always true of public policy as result policies developed number of years ago may not reflect the latest scientific and technological knowledge finally critics say that accountability fo r political decisions can also be challenge122 the decentralized nature of st policy decisionmaking can make it challenging to separate sources of advice and make those providing advice accountable for example member of congress may rely on presidential appointee who in turn relies on his or her sc ience and engineering staff that staff may develop their opinion based on federal advisory committees and experts outside the federal government who in turn rely on peer reviews of the work of individual scientists and engineers who are not able to be held accountable to the public for public policies based on th eir knowledge and guidancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34454crs45 despite these challenges scientific and technical knowledge and advice has the potential of being useful in making decisi ons related to public policy policymakers have an opportunity to make their d ecisions based on the best knowledge and guidance available along with the other fact ors they must take into account perhaps one way to recognize the value of scien tific and technical knowledge and guidance in the policymaking process is to think of the many countries in which policymakers must make decisions with limited scientific and technical advice an intuitive sense can only go so far in such situations wh ile scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can help policymakers assess the potential risk and benefits of decision they make so that societal and economic benefits are enha nced and losses are mitigated
