the environment intergovernmental affairs and labor environment most members of the trade policy and environment committee agreed that the environment nd public participa tion provisions were acceptable however they noted that the usoman fta lacks some environmental provisions which have appeared in othe r agreements and which would have been appropriate examples of such provisions are the extensive public participation framework from the central america free trade agreement cafta and some basic environmental provisions which ppeared in the ftas with chile and singapore25 intergovernmental affairs the intergovernmental advisory policy committee in principle supported the tr ade liberalization objectives of the agreement however the committee stressed the need for trade agreements to continue to respect the authority of state and local governments to regulate in areas under their jurisdiction they also stresse d the need for ongoing consultations with subfederal governments26 labor the labor groups are the most vocal critics they argue that potential losers from the agreement would be workers in oman who would miss out on the opportunity to be more fully protected by labor standards othe r implied losers would be us workers for whom the agreement does little to level the playing field main arguments against the fta offered by labor interests are concentrated primarily on two basic issues weaknesses in the agreement and weaknesses in omani laws and enforcement for which the agreement does not adequately compensate weaknesses in the agreement labor critics point out that the trade act of 200227 requires us negotiators to seek provisions that treat us principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to both 1 the ability to resort to dispute settlement and 2 the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures and remedies however critics argue the agreement does not do this further theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33328crs12

countries under the generalized system of preferences gsp june 15 2005 source ustr webs ite at http wwwustrgov argue the fta is step backward from protections offered oman under the generalized system of preferences not all labor provisions are treated equally the usoman fta identifies three basic bor commitments for partner countries 1 commitments to comply with ilo standards 2 commitments to enforce their own labor standards 3 and commitments to not derogate from those standards in order to attract trade and investment however critics argue only the second of these three commitments is enforceable through the dispute resolution procedures of the usoman fta this treatment they argue contrasts with provisions of the usjordan fta which makes all three commitments forceable through the dispute resolution process28 unequal treatment of labor compared to most nonlabor provisions second there are different dispute resolution procedur for labor and nonlabor eg intellectual property vi olations for labor and envi ronmental violations the potential penalty for the one labor and environmental vi olation failure to enforce ones own laws that is open to the dis pute resolution

practices 2004 finds in the area of right to organize and bargain collectively that om ani law does not provide workers with the right to form or join unions but does permit them to form representation committees with the goal of taking care of their interests the lac reports that where representation committees exist however they are by law not authorized to discuss wages hours or conditions of employment31 country reports for 2005 adds an unofficial estimate that 25 represen tation committees representing 91 of employees in the private sector have b een registered since 2004 and reports that provisions of the law apply to omani women and foreign workers as well as omani men32 right to strike furthermore according to country reports for 2004 the omani law does not address strikes or explicitly provide for the right to collective bargaining however it reports that the 2003 omani labor law removed 1973 prohibition on strikes and details pr ocedures for dispute resolution country reports for 2005 also indicates that while labor unr est was rare there were four reported strikes during the year the most significant one closed the largest seaport for two days33 prohibition of forced or compulsory labor country reports for 2004 also finds that the omani law prohibits forced or compulsory labor including that of children country reports for 2004 further notes that ev though the protections of the 2003 omani labor law apply equally to foreign and domestic workers at times foreign workers who account for 80 of pr ivate sector workforce and 50 of all workers in oman were placed in situ ations amounting to forced labor country reports for 2005 echoes the finding that some situations amounted to forced labor and adds that employers sometimes withheld documents that would release workers from employment contracts and allow them to change employershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33328crs14 without such documents foreign worker must continue to work for his current employer or become technically unemplo yed and consequently candidate for deportation country reports for 2005 further reports that many foreign workers were not aware of their right to take such disputes to the labor welfare board which in most cases released th worker from the service c ontract without deportation awarded compensation for time worked under compulsion reimbursed the

from the agreement committee republicans including chairman chuck grassley joined democrats in voting for the conceptual amendment the committee then unanimously approved the usoman draft implementing bill as amended35 any amendments passed by committee during the mock markup process are advisory in nature rather than obligator the administration responded that while they would consider the amendment they d some concerns first they argued the amendment might fall outside th scope of the provision in the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 sec 2103b3ii requiring that any new statutory language be necessary or appropriate to implement the trade agreement36 second the administration argued sec 307 of the tariff act of 1930 already prohibits the importation of rchandise produced in whole or in part through prison forced or indentured labor including by those who voluntarily entered into employment but were later subject to facto slave working conditions in response to the administrations argu ment senator conrad pointed out that sec 307 of the tariff act of 1930 may not be applicable to apparel produced under slave labor conditions in oman this he argued is because apparel is longer made in great quantities in the united states and sec 307 does not apply to goods produced under forced or indentured labor if those goods are not domestically produced in quantities that meet the consumption mands of the united states37 third the administration argued that the amendment may be unnecessary because fta language requiring oman to enforce its own labor laws which prohibit forced labor is strong enough or enfor ceable enough to discourage or affect its practice in addition the administration pointed out oman has approved core laborhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33328crs16 38 ibid

dismantling of vessels operation of marine railways for drydocking maritime surveyors except cargo marine wrecking of vessels for scrap and shift classification societies some in congress argue that the provi sion excluding the above activities from the us governments right to adopt or maintain any measure should be removed from the agreement because it poses potentia l security risk to the

provision those arguing that the provision excluding certain activities from the us right to adopt or maintain any measure shoul d remain in the agreement argue that43 it complies with most favore d nation treatment obligations basic obligation of free trade agreements such as the usoman fta is the obligation subject to specified exceptions to treat service suppliers and investors of other parties less favorably than the united states treats its own service suppliers and investors this provi sion meets those requirements provision exists in other ftas this provision is already included in other agreements including the north american free trade agreement nafta the dominican republiccentral america fr ee trade agreement and ftas with australia bahrain chile and morocco omani companies already have this right proponents argued that omani companies are presumably already able to acquire contracts for and perform these services currently there are us laws that prevent either an omaniowned company or any other foreignowned comp any from contracting with port owners to perform landside aspects of port activities in the united states44 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33328crs19 coast guard protection exists the us coast guard and customs and border protection play an integral role in ensuring security at us ports and nothing in the agreement amends or diminishes the authority of these agencies omani companies are current ly interested in us port operations while oman already provides mark et access to us service suppliers and investors the ustr is not aware of any omani companies that are currently involved in any us port operations or that might be interested in such operations in the future however if they were the essential security exception would fully protect the united states according to proponents if an omani company were to express such interest in the future the essential security or national security exception explained below could arguably be invoked to fully protect us national security needs the united states could deny fta benefits to owne rs of shell operation to businesses whose owne rs were nationals of countries subject to us sanctions or to an potential investment pursuant to the essential security exception described below if nonomani persons set up an enterprise in oman that was merely shell ie that was engaged in substantial business activities in oman and that enterprise sought to make an investment in the united states the fta contains specific language that would arguably permit the united states to deny the ftas investmentand services related benefits to that enterprise moreover even if the enterprise set up in oman had substantial business activity in om an the united states could deny fta benefits to it if its owners were nationals of countries subject to us sanctions finally the us government retains the authority to block any potential investment pursuant to the essential security exception described below the essential security exception offers protection chapter 21 of the usoman fta contains several excep tions to the agreement article 212 addresses essential secu rity and provides that nothing in the agreement shall be construe d to require party to furnish or allow access to any information which it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests or b to preclude party from applying measures it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations for the maintenance or restoration of international peace or secur ity or the protection of its own essential security interests an essential security exception has been included in all us trade agreements dating back to the 1947 general agreemen t on tariffs and trade gatt the united states among other countries has consistently interp reted this language worded similarly to article 21 of the usoman fta to be selfjudging and therefore that national security matters are not appropriate for adjudication in third party dispute settlement mechanism in ot her words under these provisions it can be argued that nothing in an agreement can prevent the united states from applying measures that it considers necessary for the protection of essential security interests moreover proponents will argue that revi ew of national security claims byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33328crs20 45 crs general

continuously monitor foreign investment in the united states to ensure against threats to national security and cfius review could still be performed at the discretion of cfius while it is theoretically possible for oman to bring legal challenge to the actions of the united states before thirdpa rty tribunal proponents argued the united states would appear to be on solid legal grounds for asserting not only that the panel does not have the legal authority to determine the validity of such matter but also that the inconsistent measure is permitted and justifiable given the broad self judging language of the national security exception47 arguments against the provision those arguing that the exception provi sion of annex ii should not have been included in the usoman fta argue th at such provision could pose serious threat to congress ability to ensure the security of us port infrastructure specific arguments against the provision are as follows48 the specific commitments in annex ii raise significant national security concerns opponents argue this is because language in annex ii regarding landside port operations introduces new rights of establishment for foreign companies to own sensitive us infrastructure these fta provisions arguably subject us laws or policies whether enacted by congress the executive or the states that restrict foreig n ownership to challenge in dispute resolution andor to suit under the investorstate enforcement provisions the united states will be required to offer oman the right to bid to operate at us ports the very

agreementabout which congress expresse d national security concer ns during the dubai ports world debate annex ii language goes beyond us commitments in the wto generally the service sectors to which the right to establish for foreign companies applies in these ftas is the same as the service sectors that the united states agreed to in the 1994 wtos general agreement on trade in services gats however opponents argue the oman fta adds to the us commitments by specifically including or by not specifically excl uding landside operations of ports opponents also argue that the wt text and practice says that national security claims are theoretically reviewable the reason for this they argue is that neither the gatt agreement nor the fta expressly exempts these provisions from review by an international tribunal49 under annex ii the united states may not ban enterprises of party from owning and operating covered services nor can either country limit the number or size of such services or require specific forms of ownership ie require us partners or require that it be nonprofit organization if the united states took action to deny company its new right to establish

are not heard in us courts but in threeperson trade tribunals under procedures agreed to in ar ticle 20 of the fta in these cases each country in the dispute may select one judge from its country and these two tribunalists would choose third judge from list of trade experts provided by each country in such scenario judg with narrow trade expertise and perspective including nonus individua ls would

would be adjudicated by united nations or world bank tribunalists who would be empowered to second guess national security cla im and possibly order the us government to pay the foreign company for its lost future profits51 if the us were to raise an essential security exception after cfius review an fta panel would likely deny the exception if the us were to raise the essential secur ity exception included in chapter 21 article 212 as defense before trade tribunal and cfius review had been completed without finding of security threat s in the case of dubai world ports opponents argue there is doubt that an fta pa nel would not permit use of the ftas essential security exception to excuse consequent government action that interfered with the fta investor right to establish port operations if cfius review predetermined that an acquisition were not in the national security interests of the united states this would not terminate an fta claim however the converse is not necessarily true if cfius review did determine that an acquisition were not in the national security interest of the united states opponents ar gued this would not terminate an fta claim this is because the fta sets out procedures for responding to validly raised claims thus even with cfius review it is argued that the united states would still be required to respond in united na tions or world bank tribunal essentially requiring litigation on the essential security defense outcome of congressional vote on the fta and potential consequences if it had failed to pass oman joins four other mefta countries with ftas and the proposed mefta is now onequarter of the way complete an agreement with oman could be pathway to create private sector jobs for omans burgeoning population and gateway to more openness in the middle east if congress had not approved the us oman fta any one of number of things could have happened on one hand oman could ve just continued trading with the united states as usual on the other hand oman could have looked elsewhere to countries such as china russia or india for support in diversifying beyond the production of oil which c ould run out in roughly 1520 years in addition had the usoman fta not been approved there might have been broader implications for example oman has been letting the united states use several military facilities while many argued that it would have been be in omans interest to continue to cooperate with the united st ates military oman might havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33328crs23 been tempted to put further
