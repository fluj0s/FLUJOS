government spendi ng including funding for research and development rd debate is ongoing in the 109th congress over how much to spend on various rd activities see next issue but mo re fundamental question is why the government invests in rd at all rather than relying on the private sector universities and ot her nonprofit groups traditionally the governments role in rd funding is to meet the mission requirements of the federal departments and agencies included is support for basic research that work undertaken to gain knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of nature the payoff for basic research is generally long in coming the results may be unmarketable and the rewards often diffused among many users making private s ector investment less likely however as stated in the analytical perspectives accompanying president bushs fy2006 budget request rd is critically important for keeping our nation economically competitive and it will help solve the challenges we f ace in health defense energy and the environment p 61 as part of the american competitiveness initiative announced by the president in the 2006 state of the union address

devel opment of new products processes and services for the commercial marketplace is primarily private sector activity the government may get involved for certain limited purposes federa l support is often provided for those efforts that typically have been determined to be necessary for the national good but which ca nnot or will not be financed by industry government also plays role in structuring the environment in which business decisions are made and thereby influences private sector beha vior direct federa l funding tax policies and the existence of government markets fo r certain technologies including defense public health and information technology related goods have helped influence resource allocations in the business community according to the national science foundations science and engineering indicators 2006 appendix table 45 in 2004 the latest year for which data are available industry funds accounted for 64 of us rd while the government financed 30 of the total spending with the remaining 6 provided by universities colleges and other nonprofit institu tions industrial support for rd is concentrated on development rather than on research activities the government encourages private investment in rd thr ough direct measures such as the research and experimentation re tax cred it see crs report rl31181 and through indirect measures including ownership of intellectual property and cooperative rd activities discussed below under technology development issues the myriad effects of federal rd spending highlight the importance of decisions

represents 26 increase over the estimated 1337 billion that was approved in fy2006 as in the recent past the fy2007 increase over the fy2006 estimated fundi ng levels is due to significant funding

budgeting and priority setting issues 109th congress government performance and results act gpra and the presidents management agenda the government performance and resu lts act of 1993 gpra pl 10362 is intended to produce greater efficiency effectiveness and acc ountability in federal spending and to ensure that an agencys programs and priorities meet its goals it also requires agencies to use performance meas ures for manageme nt and ultimately for budgeting recent actions have required agencies to identify more precisely rd goals and measures of rd outcomes as underscored in the presidents management agenda beginning in fy2001 and in each year thereafter the bush administration has emphasized the im portance of performance measurement including for rd in memorandum dated june

the fy2006 and fy2007 r d budget guidance which reiterated the importance of performance assessment for rd programs respectively omb m0423 and omb m0518 as in recent years section 5 of ombs analytical perspectives budget of the us government fy2007 discusses requirements for agencies to use omb criteria to measure research outcomes focusing on relevance quality and performance rd performed by industry is to meet additional criteria relating to the appropriateness of public investment dem onstrate capability to measure benefits and identify decision points to transition th activity to the private sector the administration assessed some rd programs by use of the program assessment rating tool part which uses the omb rd criteria and other measures part results for 102 rd programs were used when making fy2007 budget decisions ombs analytical perspectives volume reports that 29 programs were judged effective 41 were moderately effective commentators point out that it is difficult to define priorities for most research and to measure the results quantitatively or qualitatively since research outcomes cannot be defined well in advance and often take long time to demonstrate as result some say they have little confidence that rd performance measures can be used to recommend budget levels and suggest that congress may not use such measures as much as the administration congress may increase attention to using rd perfo rmance measures in authorizations and appropriations as disc retionary spending becomes constrained interest continues in monitoring the part process as well as in the administrations budget and perform ance integration initiative and in implementation of gpra in the 109th congress the house government reform committee has approved hr 185 to provide statutory mandate for partlike reviews it is similar to hr 3826 which the committee reported favorably in the last congress also in the 109th congress the administration has proposed to create sunset commission which would require performance reviews and automatic program termination unless programs were reauthorized bills reflecting the administrations proposal have been introduced s 1399 hr 3276 hr 3277 hearings were held in september 2005 on the two house bills there are also proposals in the 109th congress to create accountability commissions hr 2470 and s 1155 some in congress are

quality act was enacted in december 2000 as section 515 of the treasury and general government appropriations act for fiscal year 2001 pl 106554 the act required omb to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the quality objectivity utility and integrity of informa tion disseminated to the public it also required agencies to issue their own information quality guidelines and to establish administrative mechanisms that allow ffected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that they believe does not comply with omb guidance ombs february 2002 final guidance notes that iqa applies to virtually all federal agenci and defines information as any communication or representati on of knowledge such as facts or data in any medium or form the guidelines define dissemination as any agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public omb indicated that quality encompasses elements of utility objectivity and integrity and said agencies can generally presume that data are objective if they have been subject to an independent peer review process in december 2005 omb provided congress with report on the implementation of the iqa during fy 2003 and fy2004 the report said the agencies received only 85 substantive iqarelated correction requests during those two fiscal years but noted that the agencies received many other requests that were similar to those received before the iqa of the 85 requests 45 were initially denied by the agencies of these 28 were subse quently appealed with 13 of those appeals denied by the end of fy2004 some of th denied correction requests were handled through other means eg treating them as comments on proposed rules and omb noted that many of the denials were based on reasonable interpretations of information omb indicated that the correction requests came from all segments of society and said there was evidence that the iqa had affected the pace of rulemaking comments from omb and othe rs suggest several possible areas for improvement of the iqas implementation major test of the iqa may be whether agencies denials of information correction requests are subject to judicial review in march 2006 the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the act does not permit judicial review two district courts had previously reached similar conclusion nd the department of justice issued brief stating that the iqa does not permit judicial review the us chamber of commerce has indicated that it plans to ask congress to provide for

capable scientific and technological workforce the bureau of labor statistics reports that science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 214 from 2004 to 2014 compared to growth of 13 in all occupations during the same time period it is anticipat ed that approximately 65 of the growth in science and engineering occupations will be in the computerrelated fields faster than average growth is expect ed in the life sciences social science and the science and engineeringrelated occupa tions of science ma nager simultaneous with predictions of the future scientific workforce are data reporting decline in the number of students seeking degrees in certain fields while 318 of the undergraduate degrees awarded are in scie nce and engineering compared to degrees in all fields the percentage has declined or been static in the past several years due in part to the impending retiring scientific and engineering workforce there is growing concern by many in the scientif ic community industry researchdriven federal agencies and congress about the production of the nations science mathematics engineering and technical personnel the demographics of the science and engineering workforce have been the subject of debate the demographics of the nation have been changing with more than 25 of the us population composed of certain minorities blacks hispanics and native americans as group these minorities have traditionally been underrepresented in the science and gineering disciplines compared to their proportion of the total population anothe r underrepresented group in the sciences is women group that comprises 508 of the population together these groups comprise what some may call new majority while minorities have increased their share of degrees awarded in the past 10 years poor preparation in science and mathematics is said to be major fa ctor limiting the appeal of science and engineering to many in these groups in addition large number of blacks hispanics and native americans lack access to many of the more rigorous college preparatory course offerings several pieces of legislation ve been introduced during the 109th congress to address the reported needs in science and mathematics ducation some of the bills have been signed into law pl 109 163 the national defens authorization act of 2006 has among other things made pe

continues to be of concern enrollment of us citizens in graduate science and engineering programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students in those programs in many institutions foreign graduate students on temporary visas comprise 40 to 50 of some science and engineering programs in addition to the number of foreign st udents significant number of university faculty in the scientific disciplines are foreign and foreignborn doctorates are employed in large numbers by industry httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32837crs8 many in the scientific and engineering communities maintain that to compete with countries that are rapidly expandi ng their scientific and technological capabilities the united states needs to bring in those whose skills will benefit society and will enable us to compete in the newtechnology based global economy individuals supporting this position believe instead of limiting the number of foreign students the conditions under which fore ign talent enters us colleges and universities and the labor for ce should be more carefully scrutinized and controlled to address any security concerns furthermore there are those who contend that the underlying concern of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs is not necessarily that there are too many foreignborn students but that there are not enough us students the debate on the presence of foreig n students in graduate science and engineering programs and the workforce has intensified as result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 concerns have been expressed about certain foreign students receiving education and training in sensitive areas in addition there has been increased discussion about the access of foreign scientists and engineers to rd related to

for biosecurity information technology management for the department of homeland security one of the biggest challenges facing the department of homeland security dhs is the ongoing effort to consolidat the computer and communications systems of the 22 agencies that comprise the department in many respects dhs functions as virtual department c onnecting new and existing agencies into network that capitalizes on their knowledge assets to f acilitate information sharing and enhanced communication organizationally this involves breaking down the stovepipes that have previously separated the agenci and developing an encompassing organizational culture that promotes cooperation and information sharing technologically this involve s integrating existing systems and infrastructures while simultaneously infusing new technologies as they become available rigorous oversight of these activities is continuing in the 109th congress critical variable that will contribute to the success or failure of these objectives is the development and implementation of an enterprise architecture for the department an enterprise architecture serves as blueprint of the business operations of an organization and the t echnologies needed to carry out these functions it is designed to be compre hensive and scalable to account for future growth needs as the department moves forward with its enterprise architecture plans it will encounter several issues its enterprise ar chitecture is being used to identify common functions and eliminate redunda ncies among its component agencies this requires making choices between competing system s and reallocating resources and staff accordingly in doing so dhs will need to improve the interoperability of its systems as well by selecting common data fo rmats equipment and processes this in turn would enable dhs to carry out its information sharing responsib ilities as described in the homeland security act and the national intelligence reform act of 2004 since some of these information sh aring initiatives involve agencies and organizations at the federal state and local levels as well as agencies within the department additional coordination with these extern partners is necessary to ensure the smooth flow of information nd compliance with security procedures other oversight issues congress is consid

oversight data mining involves the use of data analysis tools to discover previously unknown valid patterns and relationships in large data sets in the context of homeland security data mining is often viewed as potential means to identify terrorist activities such as money transfers and communications and to id entify and track individual terrorists themselves such as through travel and immigration records data mining is carried out in both the private and public sectors some common uses include detecting fraud assessing ri sk and measuring and improving program performance while data mining represents substantial advance in the type of analytical tools currently available some of the homeland security data mining applications represent significant expansion in the quantity and scope of data to be analyzed compared to earlier efforts since september 2001 there have been number of initiatives to use data mining to identify potential terrorists andor terroristrelated

nations economic growth experts widely accept that techni cal progress is responsible for up to one half the growth of the us economy and is one principal driving force for increases in our standard of living historically industrial expansion was based on the use of technology to exploit natural resources t oday such growth tends to be founded on scientific discoveries and engineering knowledge and is even more dependent than before on the development and use of technology technology can drive the economy because it contributes to the cr eation of new goods and services new industries new jobs and new capital it can expand the range of services offered and extend the geographic distribution of those rvices the application of technologies also can contribute to the resolution of those national problems that are amenable to technological solutions technological progress is achieved th rough innovation the process by which industry provides new and improved pr oducts manufacturing

mission requirements of the federal department s and agencies the government also supports work in areas where there is an identified need for research primarily basic research not being performed in the private sector basic research that work undertaken to gain knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of nature is the foundation of many important new innovations howe ver the payoff for basic research is generally long in coming the results may be unmarketable and the rewards often diffused among many users yet while basic research is usually performed with little certainty that it will pr oduce goods and services in the future it appears that there is significant relationship between the conduct of basic research and increases in productivity federal funding reflects consensus that while basic research is important for innovation the rate of return to society as whole generated by investments in this activity is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by any one firm performing it it is estimated that the social rate of return on rd spending is over twice that of the rate of return to the inventor ideas often can be easily imitated the knowledge associated with an innovation dispersed and adap ted to other products andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32837crs18 processes this it is argu ed often leads to underinvestment in research by the

gene ral public to be improved or modified as the user wishes in contrast closed source or proprietary programs which comprise the majority of the softwa re products most commonly used are those whose source code is not made available and can only be altered by the software manufacturer some examples of open s ource software include the linux operating system and apache web server software the use of open source software by the federal government has been gaining attention as organizations continue to search for oppor tunities to enhance their information technology it operations while containing costs for the federal government and congress di scussion over the use of open source software intersects several other issues including but not limited to the development of homeland security and egovernment initiatives improving government information technology management practices strengthening comput er security and protecting intellectual property rights in the 109th congress the discussion over open source software revolves primarily around information secu rity and intellectua l property rights however issues related to cost and quality are also of interest for proponents open source software is often viewed as means to reduce an organizations dependence on the softwa re products of few companies while possibly improving the security and stability of ones computing infrastructure for critics open source software is often viewed as threat to intellectual property rights with unproven cost and quality benefits so far there appear to be systematic analyses available that have conclusively assessed security issues for closed source versus open source software in practice computer security is highly dependent on how an application is configured maintained and monitored similarly the costs ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32837crs28 implementing an open source solution are dependent upon factors such as the cost of acquiring the hardwaresoftware inves tments in training for it personnel and end users maintenance and support costs and the resources re quired to convert data and applications to work in the new computing environment consequently some computer experts suggest that it is not po ssible to conclude th at either open source or closed source software is inherently more secure or more cost efficient the growing emphasis on improved information security and critical infrastructure protection overall will likely be an influential factor in future decisions on whether to implement open source solu tions the rapidly changing

federal government invested more in this area in the late 1960s federal research in desalination and ot her saline water c onversion activities exceeded 100 million in 2000 dollars annually increasing federal funding for desalination research raises questions such as what should be the respective roles of federal agencies academ ic institutions and the private sector in conducting research and commercializing the results nd should federal research be focused on basic research or promoting the use of technologies biomedicine issues national institutes of health nih budget organization and management issues the national institutes of health nih the primary medical research agency of the federal government is facing challenges in number of areas that may interest the congress in the budgetary arena the pa st three years have been time of rapid transition from period of marked growth in the nih appropriation to the current climate of restrained domestic discretionary spending over fiveyear period congress doubled the nih budget from 136 billion in fy1998 to 271 billion in fy2003 after fy2003 growth slowed to belo w the rate of inflation and the final fy2006 appropriation represente d drop in funding for the first time since fy1970 the fy2007 request was for level budget at 285 billion house and senate appropriators have proposed chan ging the amount only slightlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32837crs38 since the doubling the extramural re search community has expressed its concerns about the lack of growth in th nih budget asserting that sustained funding is necessary to maintain s upport of research grants keep young investigators in the pipeline and capitalize on the momentum of discoveries in both basic and applied research nihs fy2006 grant funding po licies involved cutbacks in grant budgets and in numbers of grants tight competition for new awards and possible postponement of some large projects previous ly anticipated including clinical trials prospects for fy2007 are similar advocates warn that research advances on the major chronic conditions that burden our so ciety such as h eart disease cancer stroke and diabetes may be slowed ot her commentators advise that coping with the reality of budget constraints will re quire nih and the research community to rethink some of their traditional approaches to planning and organizing research the resources of the doubling years have spu rred development of unifying concepts of fundamental biology and unde rstanding of disease processes that formerly were thought to be unrelated scientific leaders in and out of nih urge critical examination of the best ways to transfor m knowledge into medical applications and allocate resources into the most criti cal priorities for return on the publics investment key factor in such rethinking is consideration of nihs organizational structure which has expanded markedly over time along with the growth in the budget the agency consists of 27 semi autonomous institutes and centers loosely coordinated by the central office of the director as new entities have been created by congress each with its own mission budg et staff review office and other bureaucratic apparatus the costs and complexities of administering the enterprise have multiplied further nih wishes to emphasize culture of interdisciplinary teamwork but many observers fear th at the present structure of multiple independently operate d institutes may undermine impor tant initiatives in cross disciplinary research especially in fields such as neurosciences to address these issues nih has been increasingly emphasizing an effort termed the nih roadmap for medical research httpnihroadma pnihgov launched in september 2003 the roadmap has identified critical scientific gaps that may be constraining rapid progress in biomedical research and which one institute can tackle alone nih wide priorities and initiatives have been developed in three broad areas focusing on new paths to biological discoveries more interdisciplinary research and improving clinical research congress has been s upportive of the goals of the roadmap and of nihs efforts to improve the management of its research portfolio including creation of new office to concentrate on cuttingedge transinstitute research the office of portfolio analysis and strategic initiatives

hearings and discussions on draft reauthorization bill have considered questions such as nihs stewardship of its resources the relative roles of the nih director and the institu tes and the optimum alignment of budgetary accounts organizational structure and st atutory authority possible proposals for change include giving the nih directors office more planning involvement and budgetary control

some other areas of concern whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32837crs39 congress might consider include improving public reporting of research results enhancing public access to scientific journal articles and exploring ways to shorten the process for young researchers to beco independent inves tigators nih has taken steps to address each of these issues an ongoing oversight issue is nihs imp lementation of new conflictofinterest regulations depending on the level of their positions nih scientists and other employees are subject to restrictions on their financial holdings and their ability

embryonic stem cell research embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body and may have the potential to treat dical conditions such as diabetes and parkinsons disease human embryonic stem cells are derived from very early embryos 5daysold that were created by in vitro fertilization ivf either for infertility treatment or for research purposes work on human embryonic stem cells is controversial as some oppose such res earch because the process of removing the stem cells destroys the embryo another potential source of embryonic st em cells involves cloning the nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by th nucleus from mature body cell such as skin cell the cell created via cloning is allowed to develop fo r five days and then the stem cells are removed stem cells derived from cloned embryos may offer the best hope for understanding nd treating disease although south korean scientists had announced the creation of cloned human embryos and isolation of human stem cells from cloned embryos an investiga tion in december 2005 found that the results had been fabricated major setback fo r the field these developments and the unsubstantiated announcement by clonaid in december 2002 of the birth of cloned child have contributed to the contr oversy over research on human embryos one impediment to human stem cell research is the dickey amendment which has been added to each labor hhs and education appropriations act from fy1997 through fy2006 it prohibits hhs from usin g appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or fo r research in which human embryos are destroyed as result federal funds cannot be used for most forms of human embryo research including the isolation of new stem cell lines or the cloning of human embryos for any purpose in august 2001 president bush announced that for the first time federal funds would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells but funding would be limited to existing stem cell lines the national institutes of healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32837crs40 nih has established the human embryonic stem cell registry which lists stem cell lines eligible for use in fe derally funded research lthough 78 embryonic stem cell lines are listed only 22 are currently availabl subsequently th debate has centered on whether the number of cell lines allowe d under the bush policy are sufficient to permit us research to remain internationally competitive in this very important new technology scientists are concerned bout the quality longevity and availability of the 22 stem cell lines for variety of r easons many believe research advancement requires new embryonic stem cell lines the bush administration established the presidents council on bioeth ics in november 2001 to c onsider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedi cal innovation in july 2002 the council released its report on human cloning which unanimously recommended ban on reproductive cloning and by vote of 10 to 7 fouryear moratorium on cloning for medical research purposes the council released second report on the issue monitoring stem cell research in january 2004 in may 2005 the house passed hr 810 c astle which would allow federal support of research that utilizes human em bryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from human embryo thus negating the current policy that limits funding to stem cell lines in existence as of august 2001 only excess ivf embryos that the individuals seeking fertility treatments have determined will not be impla nted and will be discarded are eligible for stem cell derivation written consent is required in july 2006 the senate passed hr 810 along with two other bills s 2754 which requires the developm ent of alternatives to embryonic stem cells and s 3405 which addresses the use of tissue from later stage embryo or fetus the house passe d s 3405 but did not pass s 2754 president bush vetoed hr 810 the first veto of his presidency and signed s 3405 an attempt in the house to override the veto of hr 810 was unsuccessful action on hr 1357 weldon which passe d the house in the 107th and 108th congresses but stalled in the senate is also possible the bill bans the process of cloning as well as the importation of any product derived from an embryo created via cloning it bans not only reproductive app lications but also research on therapeutic uses which has implications for stem cell research advocates of the legislative ban say that allowing any form of human cloning research to proceed raises serious ethical issues and will inevitably lead to the birth of baby that is human clone critics argue that the measure would curtail medical research and prevent americans from receiving lifesaving treatments created overseas legislation that bans only human reproductive cloning has also b een introduced on december 20 2005 the

the 2005 nasa aut horization act pl 109155 congress expressed its support for the vision but st ressed that nasa needs to maintain balanced program that incl udes aeronautics and science the vision also calls for the space shuttle fleet to be retired in 2010 retiring the shuttle without another vehicle to replace it would make the united states dependent on russia to take american cr ews to and from the international space station iss until the new crew exploration vehicle cev is available later than 2014 according to nasa some argu that the shuttle should be retained until the cev is available while others wa nt to retire it as soon as possible either because of safety concerns or so that its funding can be redirected to other parts of the vision others worry that placing fixed termination date on the shuttle system may create schedule pressure like the pressu re that contributed to the february 2003 columbia disaster see crs report rs21408 nasa officials have indicated that nasa plans to complete its use of the iss by 2016 moreover under the original vi sion the only us research conducted on the iss would be that needed to fulfill the vision by supporting human health
