from stefan rahmstorf rahmstorfpikpotsdamde to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject comments on briffa last millennium date thu 13 jan 2005 191525 0100 cc jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed dear keith youve done great job on the touchy subject of the last millennium which is central to our whole chapter my comments to that are threefold 1 if you could shorten the text somewhat it could become more powerful 2 some small edits comments are in the attached doc 3 i propose some improvements to the figures as follows fig 1a the land temps seem to go off plot temperature scale needs to be extended we need break between panels and the rest since its different time scale on the x axis fig 1c also has one curve going off the top panels 1bd might run the time axis up to 2010 or so else the important rise at the end is hidden in the tickmarks and less obvious than it should be the legends need to say what the baseline period zero line of yaxis is hard to find this in the axis label this baseline should be the same for all curves ie 19611990 fig 2d says 19011960 its not ideal to have different one as compared to fig 1 also is it true surely the storch curve is not shown relative to this baseline its way above it aligning it like this could lead to the dangerous misunderstanding that storch suggests much warmer medieval time compared to everyone else which of course is not the case i hope this helps cheers stefan stefan rahmstorf wwwozeanklimade wwwrealclimateorg xflowed attachment converted ceudoraattachbriffa_ed_sr doc attachment converted ceudoraattachgoosse_et_al_2005pdf
