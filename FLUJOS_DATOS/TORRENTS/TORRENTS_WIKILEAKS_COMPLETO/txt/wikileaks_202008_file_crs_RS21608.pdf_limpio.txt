opposed recent efforts by th environmental protection agency epa to enforce nsr on existing powerplants in particular utilities have argued that modifications to their facilitie s reflect current maintenance practices and therefore are not modifications under the meanin g of the clean air act caa on august 27 2003 the epa issued final rule1 on clarifying the definition of routine maintenance

consumption specifications without having to undergo nsr as stated in the rule by not imposing time limitation on permi ssible replacement activities the erp equipment replacement provision allows replacement activities to be driven by consideration of economic efficiency rather than artificial regulatory constraints3 the decision is highly controversial critics see the new regulation as permanently grandfathering older more polluting facilities from ever having to meet the clean air standards required of newer plants in oc tober 2003 12 states and several major cities petitioned the dc circuit court of appeals to review the rule4 in december 2003 threejudge panel of the dc circuit court of appeals i ssued summary order blocking implementation of the rule until it can make final dete rmination the court accepted the states argument that they would suffer irreparable harm if the rule was implemented and that the states also showed lik elihood of success when the case is heard5 the controversy has also led to cong ressional initiatives on september 28 2005 the house energy and commerce committ ee approved hr 3893 which would among other things amend the clean air act to codi fy by reference the new definition however the provision was removed from the bill before house passage october 9 20056 background to new source review the caa requires preconstruction review of and permit for almost any modification of an air polluting source or any major new source this preconstruction review process called nsr is triggered for any new source that potentially could emit 100 tons annually less in some areas of any criteria air pollutant and by any modification of an existing source that w ill cause significant increase in annual emissions the specific nsr requirements fo r affected sources depend on whether the sources are subject to prevention of signif icant deterioration psd or nonattainment provisions7 if covered by psd the source is re quired to install best

many utilities will not use the term life extension to describe th eir spending on old power plants even though extended life is one of the major goals of the spending program the reason for the aversion to the term lies in the 1970 clean air act that federal law requires all power plants constructed after august 1971 to restrict emissions of air pollu tants such as sulfur dioxide plants built prior to 1971 are exempt which includes most of the early candidates for life extensions the problem is that the law also says that grandfathered plan ts can lose their exemption if they are modified or reconstructed in major way and emission of proscribed pollutants are increased p 21 13 robert g presnak and bock h yee life extension the benefits are real power engineering december 1993

or change in the method of operation of sta tionary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted section 111a4 in subsequent regulations issued in 1975 with respect to nsps epa defined modification as any physical or operational change that resulted in any increase in the maximum hourly mission rate of any controlled air pollutant8 epa regulations also stated that any replacement of existing components that exceeded 50 of the fixed capital costs of building new facility placed the plant under nsps regardless of any change in emissions9 with the advent of national ambient air quality standards nonattainment provi sions part d psd provisions part c and nsr in 1977 different approach to defining modification was appropriate as the focus was shifted from enforcing nsps emission rates to achieving attainment and compliance w ith psd in promulgating regulations for the psd and non attainment programs epa define d significant increase in emissions in terms of tons per year emitted by major source for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the threshold is 40 tons per year10 facilities exceeding that th reshold are subject to nsr fundamental to the debate on nsr enforcem ent with respect to existing facilities is the notion of routine maintenance in promulgating implementing regulations epa exempted certain activities from the definition of physical or operational change among those activities exempted was mainten ance repair and replacement which the administrator determines to be routine for source category11 in addition increases in production rates that do not involve capital expenditures do not constitute modification responding to this situati on utilities began to spread out their life extension efforts in an attempt to make them fit into their routine maintenance schedules12 the term life extension has fallen out of the professional literature13 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21608crs4 14 for current view of managing existing facilities see jason makansi rehab get the most from the existing asset base power june 1999 pp 3040 15 67 federal register 8029080314 december 31 2002 see crs report rl 31757 clean air new source review policies and proposals by larry parker commonly used term currently is rehabilitation program14 by spreading out the life extension efforts and integrating them into facilities operation and maintenance schedules the distinction between modification and routine maintenance is effectively blurred and arguably eliminated rehabilitation programs utilities initiated in the 1980s nd continuing to the present have dramatically reduced the aging process of coalfired facilities the issue is whether this activity violates the modification definition of nsr if routine maintenance is defined in terms of average industry main tenance practice at the time of the 1970 or 1977 clean air act amendments then strong case can be made that it is major components are being replaced or upg raded that would not have been under average industry maintenance practices of that time yet if routin maintenance is interpreted to mean industry practices currently then one can argue that rehabilitation has become routine over the past 20 years and t hus does not represent modification this is fundamental to the way one views epas new definition of routine maintenance if one believe s that epas routine maintena nce exemption as enunciated in the 1970s was limited and not license to rehabilitate existing facilities then one would conclude that many of the industrys maintenance ac tivities of the last 20 years go beyond what nsr allows this perspec tive challenges the ad ministrations argument that its nsr revision will reduce emissions be yond that required under current law the viewpoint that applying the nsr requirement to rehabilitation projects would reduce emissions is consistent with the enforcemen t initiative of the clinton administration for which the bush administration has stated support in contrast if one believes that an exem ption for routine maintenance is appropriate and should be defined in terms of current industry practices then one would conclude that the potential threat of nsr and the installati on of bact or laer prevents owners from making costeffective improvements in the overall performance and efficiency of their existing facilities thereby foregoing opportunitie s to conserve energy this perspective that nsr discourages energy efficiency is reflected in the bush administrations revisions to routine maintenance proposed in december 200215 and promulgated in august 2003 discussion as finalized epas definition of routine maintenance will permit current utility rehabilitation practices to conti nue without the threat of triggering nsr the changes to the definition of routine maintenance are focused on energy policy considerations not environmental considerations epa contends the changes will have significant impact on emissions epas logic for the ne w definition contains three partshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21608crs5 16 68 federal register 61256 october 27 2003 17 68 federal register 61257 october 27 2003 18 68 federal register 61259 october 27 2003 19 67 federal register 80302 december 31 2002 argument restated in final rule pp 61264 5 october 27 2003 20 carol m browner administrator remarks prepared for delivery clean air enforcement press conference washingt on dc november 3 1999first epa believes nsr should apply wh activities involve the total replacement of an existing entire process16 however the final rule with its 20 cost trigger with time constraints would in ffect permit activities that w ould replace the entire process over time at least for power plants as stated in the final rule data indicate that most typical replacement activities will fall within the 20percent threshold17 second epa believes modifi cation includes any activity that upgrades facility beyond its original maximum fuel use design parameters but upgrading an existing unit to its original specifications even if act ual emissions increase is allowed an equipment replacement that improves process units efficiency and thereby enables the unit to return to its design parameters can quality as rmrr routine maintenance repair and replacement even if current actual emissions increase as result18 third while epa believes th at complete reconstructi on should not be allowed it also believes that the breadth of exclusion permitted by any definition of routine maintenance is irrelevant in terms of reducing powerplant emissions in qualitative discussion of utility behavior and the potential emissions impact of narrow definition of routine maintenance epa states narrow rmrr exclusion that is clearly established is not expected to achieve significant reduction in historic emission levels and might even lead to area wide emissions increases most facilities would ta ke lawful steps to avoid having to obtain an nsr permit that would impose strict lim itations even when replacements would be found under this narrow exclusion to be nonroutine19 if the breadth of definition does not aff ect emissions it is not clear why it matters whether utility can completely reconstruct facility or why 20 threshold is better than 50 threshold if epas concerns ar primarily energy policy driven and focused on providing industry with clear parameters simple cost trigger without any functional restraint is well within the rationales presented in epas final rule these perceptions of nsr contrast strong ly with those held during the clinton administration in announcing series of nsr suits in 1999 the epa administrator stated that controlling the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from these plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction respectively in these pollutants20 based on her statement this would reduce so2 emissions by 187 million tons and nox emissions by 063 million tons also given the widespread nature of life extension efforts it is reasonable to assume that further reductions would be achieved as other utilities either installed bact or retired their offending facilities it would appear that very

final rule epa dismisses this scen ario using the argument identified above epa also notes that there are other clean air act programs particularly title iv that control sulfur dioxide emissions from powerpl ants indeed the current epa argues that title iv results in net reductions in mission from nsr actions because any reductions achieved could be sold under the title iv allowance program to other facilities in fact however epa has resolved this problem in all of its settlements under its enforcement by requiring the utility to retire the so2 allowances freed up22 the rules issuance and subsequent stay by the court has enge ndered debate hr 3893 as introduced by representative bart on contained provision that would have amended the clean air act to codify the ne w regulations for all industrial sources in addition hr 3893 would also have extended to all industrial categories the nsr provisions exempting existing power plant modifications that do not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any regulated pollutant ho wever these provisions were removed from the bill before the house pa ssed it on october 9 2005 potential senate action on such provisions is uncertain
