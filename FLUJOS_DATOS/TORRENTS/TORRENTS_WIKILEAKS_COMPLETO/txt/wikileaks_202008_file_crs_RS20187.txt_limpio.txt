of defense report the security situation in the taiwan strait robert sutter senior specialist foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the 106th congress is being called on to consider legislation on us support for taiwans military defense needs based in part on congressionallymandated us defense department dod report released in february 1999 on the security situation in the taiwan strait to respond to number of inquiries crs has prepared this brief analysis of the 28page dod report the dod report provides an authoritative and straightforward review of the status and short term outlook of military forces on the peoples republic of china prc and taiwan sides of the taiwan strait it concludes that the dynamic equilibrium has not changed in the last 20 years on the other hand although the dod report has language that can be interpreted to support change in us military support for taiwan much of the reports discussion suggests that taiwans defensive edge may be eroding as it faces increased prc ballistic and cruise missile and air defense capabilities and an increased ability to carry out naval blockade against taiwan this crs report will not be updated for coverage of taiwan issues see the discussion and selected readings in taiwan crs issue brief 98034 for photocopy of the dod report please call the inquiry section at 77500 and ask for lrs991975 introduction the 106th congress is being called on to consider legislation on us support for taiwans military defense needs the department of defense dod released congressionallymandated unclassified report in february 1999 on the security situation in the taiwan strait hconres 56 passed house march 23 1999 and sconres 17 passed senate april 12 1999 refer to the defense department report in urging greater us support for taiwans defense against military buildup by the peoples republic of china prc opposite taiwan s 693 introduced march 24 1999 also refers to the findings of the department of defense report in laying out many specific steps to be taken congressional research service the library of congress crs2 by the us government in order to shore up taiwans security in the face of the prc military buildup1 crs has been asked by members and staff for brief analysis of the lengthy about 28 pages single spaced defense department report this crs report provides an assessment noting some of the strengths of the dod report while discussing at greater length four areas of perceived limitation or shortcoming that are relevant to current congressional concerns those interested in obtaining photocopy of the dod report may call the inquiry section at 77500 and ask for lrs991975 strengths of the department of defense report the dod report provides an authoritative comprehensive and straight forward review of the status and short term outlook of military forces on the peoples republic of china prc and taiwan sides of the taiwan strait2 it looks in considerable detail at salient weapon systems and other military hardware on both sides it also pays close attention to the two sides efforts in upgrading software such as information and electronic warfare and it discusses strengths and weaknesses in the military leadership education training and morale of the fighting forces on both sides against this backdrop it examines the broader defense strategy and war planning of the prc and taiwan and reviews in particular how the prc might use its military forces to carry out operations against taiwan four specific options for the prc are noted blockade missile strikes air superiority and amphibious invasion the report explains why the likelihood of such operations is not high now given the october 1998 resumption of highlevel dialogue across the strait and efforts by both sides to avoid provocative military exercises or other activity in the strait following the crisis caused by the prc provocative military exercises there in 1995 and 19963 limitations and perceived shortcomings of the department of defense report some of the following issues relate to the reports limited scope defined by congressional mandate the report does not address several policy issues as well as seemingly relevant military issues outside its original scope additionally some observers would challenge the findings and conclusions of the report from other perspectives 1 the report treats the cross strait military balance narrowly it does not for example discuss how conflict in the area could involve other powers notably the united states and japan many analysts believe the united states would become involved in 1 for review of recent legislation on taiwan and us arms sales to taiwan based on the taiwan relations act pl 968 and three usprc communiques dealing with taiwan see taiwan crs issue brief 98034 updated regularly there is also classified version of the dod report which presumably is available from the defense department for those with appropriate clearances 2 the status of taiwans military is often overlooked by nongovernment western specialists 3 for background see also taiwan recent developments and us policy choices crs issue brief 98034 updated regularly crs3 conflict in the taiwan strait and prc military planning for taiwan contingency reportedly assumes the united states would be involved4 us interest in peace and stability in east asia and the western pacific is repeatedly noted as basic pillar of american policy in the region the deployment of 100000 us forces in the region is justified by this interest5 moreover the taiwan relations act codified us interest in stability in the taiwan area and noted that the united states would view with grave concern possible disruptions there6 meanwhile the japanese government the main us ally in asia shares us interest in regional stability it eschews any explicit statements about the security situation around taiwan though its interest in this neighboring area is thought to be very keen7 2 the report focuses narrowly on prc military options to use force against taiwan it tends to treat these options ie blockade missile strikes air superiority and amphibious invasion separately many other specialists judge that beijings approach to using forceif carried outwould be much more sophisticated and multifaceted integrating numerous political as well as military options8 thus they see the prime prc goal in these circumstances as intimidation of taiwans political leaders they believe the prc might use force in order to coerce the taiwan leadership to come to terms on taiwans reunification with the mainland acceptable to the prc the use of force could follow sliding scale of escalating military pressure or perhaps involve all areas ie blockade air superiority missile attack amphibious invasion at once and presumably would be combined with political overtures to taiwan for settlement on prc terms and diplomatic and other international moves designed to keep the united states and other powers out of the conflict the prc leadership is not seen as likely to use military force to destroy taiwan rather it is thought that it might use military force in ways that do the least damage to taiwan and prc interests in order to get taiwan leaders to give in to prc demands over reunification and other sensitive issues military pressure against taiwan could include c lowlevel intimidation military exercises weapons displays confrontations at sea or in the air and various kinds of covert subversion c naval blockade or interdiction efforts amphibious invasion of off shore islands c limited missile andor air attack against taiwanese territory or strategic targets c full scale attack 4 see among others hans binnendijk and ronald montaperto strategic

china council of advanced policy studies paper no24 november 1998 crs4 as result these specialists tend to see the key variables in this situation as the prc leaderships willingness to escalate the use of force their effectiveness in keeping the united states and other powers from intervening in the conflict and the taiwan government leadership and peoples willingness to continue to resist rising prc pressure these critical variables are not examined in this report 3 the report can be interpreted in different ways regarding us military support for taiwan9 those us policy makers in congress and the administration who are cautious about giving greater us military support for taiwan may read the reports introduction which notes that the security situation in the taiwan strait remains calm with threat of imminent hostilities10 as indicating remedial action by the united states as far as added military support for taiwan is required to counter the opposing view that chinas rising military power poses growing threats to taiwan requiring greater us military support for the island these policy makers could cite the first paragraph of the conclusion of the report which states the dynamic equilibrium of prc and taiwan forces in the taiwan strait has not changed dramatically over the last two decades11 some us policy advocates argue that even if there is growing prc military threat to taiwan the appropriate us response is not to add us military support for taiwan12 they believe that it is in the us best interests to try to calm the cross strait situation by persuading and even pressuring the two sides to ease tensions establish confidence building measures and move toward accommodation they judge that more us military support for taiwan has the added disadvantage of exacerbating usprc relations over this sensitive question raising the prospect of renewed confrontation in the taiwan strait something they seek to avoid on the other hand the bulk of the findings in the report when considered against the backdrop of past assessments of the military balance in the taiwan strait13 can be read by us policy makers in congress and the administration who favor greater us military support for taiwan as buttressing their position they could make several major points c changed strategic environment the main strategic obstacle to possible prc use of military force against taiwan in the later 1970s and early 1980s was the soviet union prc leaders were focused on the strategic danger posed by the ussr its active fleet in the western pacific its alliance relationships with vietnam and india and its bases in vietnam any use of force against taiwan would not only have diverted chinese military resources needed to confront the soviet threat but also would have provided the ussr with an opportunity to make gains elsewhere along chinas periphery if the prc were distracted in taiwan since the end of the cold 9 the debate on us military support

military threat along its periphery14 c ballisticcruise missile threat the report reviews in considerable detail the growth in numbers and improvement in accuracy of prc ballistic and cruise missiles for possible use against taiwan15 beijing had much less capability in the 1970s and 1980s the report also makes clear that taiwans ability to defend against this kind of threat has not kept pace with prc advances posing major strategic vulnerability for taiwan this vulnerability affects taiwans need to maintain air superiority in order to thwart blockade and fend off an amphibious invasion see discussion below c air superiority the report makes clear that taiwans air superiority visavis prc forces is eroding in the 1970s and 1980s pla air forces were so backward that beijing chose not to use them in its world war i style military attack against vietnam in 1979 using mainly artillery and infantry taiwan air forces had markedly superior airtoair missiles and overthehorizon radars to compete with antiquated prc fighters that had to rely on lineofsight engagement although taiwan fighters were outnumbered it was assumed by us specialists that they would be able to pick off incoming prc fighters before they got close enough for engagement and quickly return to base to refit and fight again in this way air superiority would be maintained allowing taiwan aircraft the ability to counter prc blockade or amphibious invasion16 the dod report makes clear that taiwan longer has the advantage in air to air missiles meanwhile the increased accuracy of ballistic and cruise missiles means that prc forces could destroy taiwan airfields making it harder and perhaps impossible for the very capable but outnumbered taiwan jet fighters to resupply and fight again losing air superiority would mean that taiwan would not be able to use its air force to counter prc blockade andor amphibious invasion c blockade taiwans air superiority and prc backwardness persuaded us analysts in the 1970s and 1980s that beijing would not be able to execute successful military blockade of taiwan17 in particular it was thought by analysts at that time that interdicting shipments to the eastern part of the island would be particularly difficult for prc forces in contrast the current dod report states that taiwans military forces probably would not be able to keep the islands key ports and sea

communications slocs open in the face of concerted chinese military action taiwans small surface fleet and four submarines are numerically insufficient18 to keep pace with growing prc military advances in the post cold war security environment that allows beijing to focus primary military attention on taiwan contingencies these us advocates of greater military support for taiwan could conclude c the us needs to press the prc to curb its military buildup focused on taiwan contingencies or face us countermeasures to redress the balance in the taiwan strait c countermeasures could include providing more advanced airtoair missiles for taiwan fighters support for stronger taiwan defenses against growing cruise and ballistic missile threats from the prc and support for the taiwan efforts to thwart prc blockade eg better antisubmarine aircraft submarines for taiwans navy of course as noted above other us policy advocates would draw different implications for us policy they may see growing prc military threat to taiwan as requiring stronger us efforts to try to calm the cross strait situation by persuading and pressuring the two sides to ease tensions establish confidence building measures and move toward accommodation from their perspective more us military support for taiwan could have the added disadvantage of exacerbating usprc relations over this sensitive question raising the prospect of renewed confrontation in the taiwan strait something they seek to avoid 4 conditions for prc use of force the report notes circumstances under which the prc has claimed it would use force against taiwan those are taiwan declaring independence foreign intervention in taiwan and taiwan developing nuclear weapons it does not note other circumstances in which the prc might use force against taiwan on january 28 1999 the leading prc official in charge of policy toward taiwan vice premier qian qichen said that if taiwan were to hold referendum on its future it would be playing with fire and would bring disaster to taiwansuggesting for the first time in authoritative prc leadership statements that taiwan holding referendum might be grounds for prc use of force19 meanwhile recent chinese rhetoric against possible us support for missile defense system in taiwan also suggest particular sensitivity that some analysts believe could result in prc use of force20 18 dod report p 23 19 qian qichen on reunification xinhua january 28 1999 20 china and us missile defense proposals reactions and implications by robert sutter crs report rs20031 january 28
