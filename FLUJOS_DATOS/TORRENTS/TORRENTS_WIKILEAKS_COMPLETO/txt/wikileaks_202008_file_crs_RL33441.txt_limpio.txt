of recent executive branch reorganization actions and related management initiatives it reviews the relevant plans and preparations of presidentelect barack obama as the new administration transitions to assuming management of the executive branch briefly examined as well are the organization and management efforts of the most recent regimes president george w bush came to office from campaign which had emphasized efficiency in government particularly through the use of information technology but revealed plans for executive branch reorganization the clinton administration had conducted an active effort at reinventing government spearheaded by national performance review npr announced shortly after the 1993 inauguration the npr produced series of reports proposing various organizational and operational reforms number of major npr recommendations were awaiting implementation when the 1994 congressional elections resulted in republican majority control of both houses of the 104th congress republican congressional leaders had unveiled contract with america reform plan in late september 1994 its core principles regarded the federal government as being too big spending too much being unresponsive to the citizenry and perpetuating burdensome regulations at the conclusion of the 104th congress both the president and republican congressional leaders could claim some victories in downsizing government but department was eliminated and only few small agencies were abolished following his 2001 inauguration president bush announced plans to address number of management problems in the federal government then in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 911 terrorist attacks the organization of the federal government for maintaining homeland security and combating terrorism became major consideration for both the president and congress establishment of the office of homeland security in october 2001 as coordinating entity was an important first step followed by the creation of department of homeland security during the final weeks of the 107th congress oversight of the initial operations of the new department was primary matter for the 108th congress which in the closing months of 2004 implemented many of the recommendations of the national commission which had investigated the circumstances of the 911 attacks at the outset of the 110th congress president bush did not indicate any plans for major reorganization within the executive branch however the restoration of presidential reorganization plan authority appeared to remain of interest to the bush administration but congressional action was taken in that regard similarly the recommendations of the help commission to overhaul the organization and management of the foreign assistance program hr 1 hr 1684 s 4 s 547 remained on the legislative agenda as the 100th congress came to close this report will be updated as events warrant contents most recent developments 1 background and

mccain nor senator barack obama the principal contenders for the presidency indicated any plans for reorganizing the executive branch if elected see below some independent views in this regard began to appear prior to the national party conventions businessman stanton anderson and attorney herb fenster finding it doubtful than an executive branch organized to fulfill the needs of population of 80 million 1900 or 150 million 1950 can effectively serve population of 300 million 2000 or 570 million 2100 called for comprehensive review of the structure and components of the executive branch each departmental and agency function and the interactions or lack thereof among them needs review there is single shortcut to correcting organizational sprawl each piece function and role must be examined to conduct this review and examination they proposed joint commission with membership from the three branches nongovernmental organizations public service organizations industry and academia should be created by the next president they added however that candidates running for the presidency should begin to discuss the need for complete reorganization of the federal government1 while neither senator mccain nor senator obama revealed any reorganization plans during the presidential campaign both alluded to program reviews with view to efficiency economy and effectiveness when accepting the nomination to be the presidential candidate of the democrats obama pledged to go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with 20th century bureaucracy to some observers this undertaking was reminiscent of the mission of the national performance review npr launched during the clinton administration creating government that works better costs less moreover serving as advisers to the obama campaign were david osborne the author of reinventing

budget omb is seen as vehicle for conducting such reviews3 when accepting the republican nomination for president he called for changing the way government does almost everything from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children all these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war we have to catch up to history and we have to change the way we do business in washington he also said my administration will set new standard for transparency and accountability4 several days later his vice presidential running mate alaska governor sarah palin indicated that government reform was one of three areas she would focus on with mccains agreement during his presidency5 in terms of institutional changes it was reported several weeks prior to his becoming presidentelect that obama would likely create national technology czar with broad authority to develop policy elevating hightech issues to the cabinet level in major recalibration of the governments approach to regulating the communications sector6 that prospect was reiterated after the election with much speculation about the role of such czar where the office would be located and who would be appointed to fill the position7 candidate obama also indicated he would reestablish the national space council 19881993 which was chaired by the vice president and was located within the executive office of the president eop8 among other eop institutional changes reportedly under consideration among transition assistants for presidentelect obama

program review that he had pledged to perform as candidate would be conducted by orszag and omb the objective being to eliminate programs that do not work12 background and analysis for well over century the structure and program responsibilities of the federal executive branch including all of the departments and agencies were determined by congress in the aftermath of world war i however with the rise of the new public administration profession and growing sentiment for attaining efficiency and economy in government came efforts to strengthen the presidents management ability in 1932 the chief executive was statutorily authorized to issue executive orders proposing reorganization within the executive branch for purposes of reducing expenditures and increasing efficiency in government13 reorganization order became effective after 60 days unless either house of congress adopted resolution of disapproval when president herbert hoover submitted 11 different reorganization orders in 1932 all were disapproved by the house of representatives on the grounds that his newly elected successor franklin d roosevelt might have different reorganization ideas president roosevelt did submit number of reorganization orders pursuant to revised and extended version of the 1932 statute which expired automatically in 1935 some major actions taken in these orders included creating procurement and disbursement divisions in the treasury department establishing an enlarged national park service in the interior department and making the farm credit administration an independent

reorganization plan submitted to congress became effective after 60 days unless both houses of congress adopted concurrent resolution of disapproval in his initial reorganization plan president roosevelt created the executive office of the president an enclave for entities immediately assisting the chief executive such reorganization authority renewed periodically dozen times between 1945 and 1984 with slight variation remained available to the president for nearly half century at different junctures qualifications were placed upon its exercise for example reorganization plans could not abolish or create an entire department or deal with more than one logically consistent subject matter also the president was prohibited from submitting more than one plan within 30day period and was required to include clear statement on the projected economic savings expected to result from reorganization modification of the presidents reorganization plan authority was made necessary in 1983 when the supreme court in the chadha case effectively invalidated continued congressional reliance upon concurrent resolution to disapprove proposed plan15 under the reorganization act amendments of 1984 several significant changes were made in the reorganization plan law16 any time during the period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of congress following the submission of reorganization plan the president might make amendments or modifications to it within 90 calendar days of continuous session of congress following the submission of reorganization plan both houses must adopt joint resolution which unlike concurrent resolution becomes law with the presidents signature central issue in the chadha case for plan to be approved this amendment however continued the presidents reorganization plan authority only to the end of 1984 when it automatically expired17 neither president ronald reagan nor president george h w bush requested its reauthorization president william clinton also did not seek its renewal although his national performance review recommended this course of action in september 199318 the national strategy for homeland security released by president george w bush in july 2002 recommended the restoration of reorganization plan authority to allow reconfiguring portions of the executive branch to better combat terrorism and maintain homeland security19 in his fy2003 budget message president bush had 14 53 stat 561 15 ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 16 98 stat 3192 17 see 5 usc 901912 1988 18 us office of the vice president from red tape to

homeland security washington continued crs5 indicated that his administration would seek to reinstitute permanent reorganization authority for the president to permit expedited legislative approval of plans to reorganize the executive branch20 however draft legislation was subsequently offered in this regard when the national commission on the public service presented its report in january 2003 one of its recommendations was to give the president expedited authority to recommend structural reorganization of federal agencies and departments21 congressional interest in possibly restoring the presidents reorganization plan authority was evidenced with an april 3 2003 hearing on the matter by the house committee on government reform but soon faded22 in the absence of reorganization plan authority the president may propose executive branch reorganizations to be realized through the constitutionally prescribed legislative process the departments of energy education veterans affairs and homeland security were established in this manner this approach however does not incorporate actionforcing deadlines or required final congressional vote on proposed reorganization plans that are thought to expedite the consideration of reorganizations the president might attempt minor reorganization such as establishing small temporary entity within the executive office of the president by issuing directive such as an executive order attempting more ambitious reorganizations through presidential directive if not ultimately found to be illegal may incur congressional displeasure and subsequent legislative and fiscal reaction as result of the absence of reorganization plan authority more recent reform efforts to improve the efficiency and economy of government operations have emphasized management improvements of both governmentwide and specific program variety including applications of information technology that some have characterized as electronic government reinventing government by the clinton administration an ambitious effort at realizing executive branch reorganization and management reform was launched by president clinton at the outset of his administration when on march 3 1993 he initiated national performance review npr to be conducted under the leadership of vice president albert gore jr six months later on september 7 the initial npr

management reforms several proposals addressed executive reorganization including one for congressional restoration of presidential reorganization plan authority during the 12 months after the initial npr report was issued its recommendations were implemented by 22 presidential directives several enacted bills and various agency actions anniversary reports marking progress in implementing npr recommendations were issued in september of 1994 1995 and 1996 the last of these indicated that 43 of the nprs initial 833 agency action items were completed and 42 were in progress and that 38 of its initial 430 management systems action items were completed and 49 were in progress of an additional 187 agency recommendations 19 were completed and 62 were in progress as of january 1996 the executive workforce had been reduced by nearly 240000 in addition almost 2000 obsolete field offices had been closed and approximately 200 programs and agencies had been eliminated as of september 1996 said the report savings of about 974 billion have been ensured through legislative or administrative action according to the report of the original 108 billion in savings projected in 1993 about 734 billion had been realized23 the clinton administration renewed its reinventing government effort in midjanuary 1995 with phase 2 of the npr which was detailed in the presidents fy1996 budget shortly thereafter in late february the president announced new regulatory reform proposals including pagebypage review of federal regulations to determine those that were obsolete replaceable by private sector alternatives or better administered by state and local government he also proposed to abolish the interstate commerce commission icc and reconstitute the federal aviation administrations air traffic control services as wholly owned government corporation the elimination of the icc was subsequently realized in december 1995 certain functions of the commission were transferred to the surface transportation board newly established within the department of transportation by the icc termination statute24 with the convening of the 105th congress the reinvention effort entered another new phase emphasizing improved service delivery use of partnerships and communitybased strategies to solve problems not big government and techniques for improving performance in time of diminishing resources including the use of performancebased organizations as reflection of this third revamping the npr known heretofore as the national performance review became the

unnecessary politicization of government reform two other analysts were also critical of the npr effort25 few months later in september gao report concluded that the npr reinvention effort had been largely successful with more than 90 of key clinton administration recommendations having been fully or partly implemented the report was based upon review of 72 npr recommendations by 10 federal agencies which found that 33 of them were fully implemented and another 30 were partly implemented26 reorganization during the bush administration during his campaign for the presidency texas governor george w bush emphasized efficiency in government particularly through the use of information technology but revealed plans for reorganizing the executive branch the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 911 however prompted various structural changes particularly in the areas of homeland security and intelligence organizing for homeland security major objective of restructuring was to realize governmental arrangements resulting in more efficient economical and effective homeland security reinstatement of the presidents reorganization plan authority was proposed and legislation to create department of homeland security dhs was introduced and subsequently enacted27 working with white house proposal unveiled on june 6 2002 the house completed action on the dhs legislation in late july the senate did not begin work on counterpart measure until after the august recess and then was slowed by debate on various amendments final legislation reached the presidents desk in late november the primary issue for congress and the president was determining the program composition and administrative organization of the new department in the course of mandating dhs this overarching consideration broke down into series of lesser more finite issues not the least of which were threshold questions concerning the value of the new entity president bush contended that his proposal did not constitute an expansion of the federal government but merely consolidated existing programs within more efficient and effective management structure however neither the presidents proposal nor the principal congressional bills made use of definition of the concept of homeland security to guide the component composition of the new department moreover whole agencies were proposed for transfer to

functions and programs for possibly more appropriate administration elsewhere other than in the new department there were as well those who doubted that merely rearranging programs within new department would truly improve the nations defenses against terrorism others maintained that matter how well management and operating arrangements were finetuned the effectiveness of the department and its leadership could not be legislatively guaranteed and still others wondered aloud who would be willing to serve for very long in the leadership of such department some initially criticized the presidents proposal as an inadequate response to what they viewed as intelligence failures suggesting that in the context of considering the components of the new homeland security department the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the federal intelligence community particularly the central intelligence agency cia should not escape scrutiny two fbi units the national domestic preparedness office and the national infrastructure protection center would have been transferred to the new department under the presidents plan and ultimately were in the bill that was signed into law the criticism however suggested that those developing the presidents plan had not given adequate consideration to the prospect of transferring or restructuring fbi and cia counterterrorism responsibilities others questioned why the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the drug enforcement administration and the nuclear regulatory commission were not included gao among others noted that because the concept of homeland security had not been defined certain organizational management and budgetary decisions cannot currently be made consistently across agencies28 in creating the new department congress had the responsibility for determining the appropriate administrative structure for the secretary to manage with efficiency economy and effectiveness an organization of some 170000 employees many of whom would be working in field facilities composed of diverse units with shared responsibility and partnership with state and local governments as well as the private sector key consideration was the secretarys span of control over the operations of primary divisions and internal agencies together with such broad departmental functions as human and information resources management budget setting and financial management under the bill initially adopted by the house the secretary of homeland security might have had as many as 15 senior officials of the department reporting directly to him or her or more if the assistant secretaries actually had this relationship under one senate version of the legislation 17 senior officials seemingly would have been reporting directly to the secretary ultimately the statute mandating dhs placed most of the entities and functions transferred to the new department within four primary directorates for border and transportation security emergency preparedness and response science and 28 us general accounting office homeland security key elements to unify efforts are underway but uncertainty remains gao report gao02610 washington june 2002 p 2 crs9 technology and information analysis and infrastructure protection the coast guard and the secret service were excepted from this arrangement and given independent status within the department the heads of these six components along with upwards of 12 assistant secretaries and approximately 14 other senior officials appeared to report directly to the secretary in general the administrative framework statutorily established for the department supported strong vertical management structures while being somewhat weak in detailing horizontal working arrangements among headquarters divisions and internal agencies the presidents proposal contained provision authorizing the secretary of homeland security in regulations prescribed jointly with the director of the office of personnel management to establish and from time to time adjust human resources management system for some or all of the organizational units of the department which shall be flexible contemporary and grounded in public employment principles of merit and fitness the provision raised various issues concerning staffing requirements such as adequate numbers of personnel and planning for the replacement of retiring staff hiring particularly direct hiring which would not involve traditional guarantees of being meritbased and free of political influence and lacked preference for veterans and pay particularly pay parity or equity for employees who are performing similar jobs civil service protections and collective bargaining rights for department workers were among the most contentious issues surrounding the establishment of the department of homeland security ultimately the statute mandating the new department largely supported the presidents position on these matters upon signing the homeland security act into law on november 25 2002 president bush transmitted pursuant to section 1502 of the statute his reorganization plan for the department of homeland security this document set deadlines for the transfer of agencies programs and functions to the new department and specified related agency consolidations reorganizations or streamlinings dhs became operational on january 24 60 days after its statutory mandate was signed into law that same day tom ridge the presidents homeland security adviser and director of the office of homeland security ohs was sworn in as the secretary of homeland security reorganization of border agencies was announced by secretary ridge on january 30 formulation of the department of homeland security took major step on march 1 when in accordance with the presidents reorganization plan some three dozen agencies and programs were transferred to the new department ultimately all such transfers were completed by september 30 2003 the future of ohs which had been created by presidential directive in response to the 911 terrorist attacks came into question in late july 2003 when house appropriators in their report on the departments of transportation and treasury and independent agencies appropriations bill 2004 revealed that the bush administration had changed the office of homeland security account to one for the homeland security council the current council is mandated by the homeland crs10 security act of 200229 the report questioned the role of ohs saying it is not clear what work remains that cannot be effectively performed by the department of homeland security the account change apparently also implied the shift of 66 staff from ohs to the council which the report questioned given the existence and support of the department of homeland security the committee cut the presidents request of 83 million for the council to 41 million30 the full house approved the recommended amount in the senate counterpart bill appropriators recommended 83 for the council the amount requested but placed the funds in separate account31 conferees on the consolidated appropriations act 2004 hr 2673 which included funding for agencies of the executive office of the president made recommendation of funds for ohs but did propose 72 million for the homeland security council in the white house office account the house agreed to the conference report on december 8 and adjourned sine die the senate completed action on the legislation on january 23 2004 and the president signed the

center nctc and national intelligence director nid to replace the current director of central intelligence it also suggested establishing other national intelligence centers for example on counterproliferation crime and narcotics and china and folding the responsibilities of the homeland security council into the national security council35 during the august 2004 recess several house and senate committees began hearings to explore the commissions recommendations legislative efforts to implement the 911 commissions recommendations began in earnest when congress reconvened after labor day meeting with congressional leaders on september 8 to discuss reforming and strengthening the federal intelligence services president bush endorsed establishing an nid who among other considerations would have been located within the executive branch but not within the executive office of the president would not have served in the cabinet would have received national foreign intelligence program funds and allocated them as apportioned by omb to the intelligence community would have supervised the nctc and would have had role in the appointment of any individual to

on the road ahead for dhs witnesses included the dhs acting inspector general and management experts from the brookings institution council on foreign relations heritage foundation and rand corporation several major organization and management issues were discussed and two reforms in particular appeared to enjoy some support particularly from senator susan collins the committees chair and senator joseph lieberman the panels ranking minority member these reforms which had been discussed in december 2004 heritage foundation report dhs 20 rethinking the department of homeland security38 included 1 eliminating the dhs management directorate and under secretary for management but relocating the chief management officers to the office of the deputy secretary and 2 establishing an under secretary for policy who would be assisted by unified policy planning staff it was thought that the first reform would eliminate an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and otherwise strengthen the roles of the chief management officers and that the second reform would bring unity to dhs through the development of proactive strategic homeland security policy and plans indications were that these reforms among others would be considered for inclusion in subsequent legislation reauthorizing dhs programs within the jurisdiction of the senate committee at the hearing some consideration was also given to merging the departments bureau of customs and border protection cbp and bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice39 the prospect of merging cbp and ice was the subject of march 9 2005 hearing by the subcommittee on management integration and oversight of the house committee on homeland security among those testifying was one of the coauthors of the heritage
