from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to mannpsuedu subject re quick note on tar date sun apr 29 195316 2007 mike your words are real boost to at the moment i found myself questioning the whole process and being often frustrated at the formulaic way things had to be done often wasting time and going down dead ends i really thank you for taking the time to say these kind words i tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the ipcc which were not always the same i worried that you might think i gave the impression of not supporting you well enough while trying to report on the issues and uncertainties much had to be removed and i was particularly unhappy that i could not get the statement into the spm regarding the ar4 reinforcement of the results and conclusions of the tar i tried my best but we were basically railroaded by susan i am happy to pass the mantle on to someone else next time i feel i have basically produced nothing original or substantive of my own since this whole process started i am at this moment having to work on the env submission to the forthcoming uk research assessment exercise again instead of actually doing some useful research anyway thanks again mike really appreciated when it comes from you very best wishes keith keith at 1814 29042007 you wrote keith just quick note to let you know ive had chance to read over the key bits on last millennium in the final version of the chapter and i think you did great job obviously this was one of the most if not the most contentious areas in the entire report and you found way to in my view convey the the science accurately but in way that i believe will be immune to criticisms of bias or neglectyou dealt w all of the controversies but in very evenhanded and fair way bravo i hope you have an opportunity to relax bit now looking forward to buying you beer next time we have an opportunity mike michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone 814 8634075 503 walker building fax 814 8653663 the pennsylvania state university email mannpsuedu university park pa 168025013 1httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 2httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa references 1 httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm 2 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
