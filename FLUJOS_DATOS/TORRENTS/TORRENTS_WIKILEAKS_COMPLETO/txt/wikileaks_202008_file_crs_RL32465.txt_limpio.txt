expanded dialogue on missile defense this next steps in strategic partnership effort compliments an ongoing bilateral defense policy group forum as well as joint military exercises counterterrorism cooperation and variety of us assistance programs for india while usindia economic and commercial ties have grown significantly in recent years they still are viewed as being far smaller than is both possible and desirable due in large part to what the united states sees as excessive regulatory and bureaucratic structures in the indian economy the united states has lauded indias recent efforts to reform its once quasisocialist economy although there continues to be us concern that movement has been slow and inconsistent1 the sea change in usindia relations after the cold war accelerated after march 2000 visit to india by thenpresident clinton and became even more apparent in the wake of september 2001 and indias offer of full cooperation with usled counterterrorism efforts much of the progress in bilateral relations came through us engagement with centerright coalition government in new delhi led by former prime minister vajpayee in may 2004 this coalition was ousted by surprise resurgence of the indian national congress hereafter congress which now leads centerleft coalition that includes the support of communist parties despite the new governments appointment of indian officials associated with indias nonalignment policies of the past and with sometimes vocal criticism of us foreign policy early indications are that the congressled coalition will make major changes to indias economic foreign and security policies the united states likely will closely monitor new delhis future approaches to economic reform relations with neighboring pakistan including the unresolved kashmir issue defense posture and weapons proliferation and human rights protection 1 see statement of assistant secretary of state christina rocca before the house international relations

overview india is federal republic of more than one billion inhabitants the bulk of executive power rests with the prime minister and his or her cabinet the indian president is ceremonial chief of state with limited executive powers most of indias prime ministers have come from the countrys hindispeaking northern regions and until 2004 all but one had been uppercaste hindus2 the 543seat lok sabha peoples house is the locus of national power with directlyelected representatives from each of the countrys 28 states and seven union territories smaller upper house the rajya sabha council of states may review but not veto most legislation and has power over the prime minister or the cabinet national and state legislators are elected to fiveyear terms the previous national election was held in october 1999 although indias political stage is crowded with numerous regional and castebased parties recent years have seen an increasingly dyadic battle between two major parties that vie for smaller allies in system that now requires coalitional politics party has won national election outright since 1984 since 1998 the bharatiya janata party bjp had led ruling national democratic alliance nda coalition of more than 20 parties working under the leadership of prime minister atal bihari vajpayee the october 1999 lok sabha elections solidified the bjps standing the key opposition party during this time was the congress party3 during april and may 2004 india held fourphase national election to seat new lok sabha the nda called elections six months early in an apparent effort to capitalize on perceived momentum from positive economic news and from three convincing statelevel victories over congress in december 2003 some 380 million indians cast ballots at nearly 700000 polling stations when results were announced on may 13 nearly all observers and participants including prime minister atal vajpayee were surprised by the upset defeat of the nda and by simultaneous resurgence of the congress party led by sonia gandhi the italianborn widow of former prime minister rajiv gandhi which had forged strategic and unprecedented alliances with powerful regional parties on may 18 gandhi stunned her supporters by declining the position of prime minister in new united progressive alliance upa coalition government instead nominating her party lieutenant oxford educated economist manmohan singh for the job as finance minister from 1991 1996 singh was the architect of major indian economic reform and liberalization efforts on may 22 the widelyesteemed sikh became indias firstever nonhindu prime minister poll results also were notable for the bestever showing of leftist alliance led by the communist party of india marxist which won total of 62 seats nearly all 2 hindus account for about 82 of indias population but muslim minority of some 145 million about 13 gives the country muslim population second only to indonesias sikhs and christians each account for about 2 of the population 3 in 1999 the bjp and its allies won 296 lok sabha seats while congress and its allies took 134 key nda members mostly ethnolinguistic regional parties include the aiadmk of tamil nadu the telugu desam party of andhra pradesh the akali dal of punjab the shiv sena of maharashtra and the trinmool congress of west bengal crs3 of them from west bengal and kerala although this left front is not part of the new upa government it is supporting the upa from outside investor fears that new coalition government including communists might curtail or halt indias economic reform and liberalization process apparently led to huge losses in the countrys stock markets bombays benchmark sensex index lost 11 of its value on may 17 the secondlargest daily loss ever and the value of indias largest companies reportedly declined by some 40 billion over seven days with state owned businesses slated for public sale taking the greatest hits market recovery began after congress party leaders offered assurances that the new government would be progrowth prosavings and proinvestment4 numerous analysts weighed in on the meaning of the complex electoral results long tradition of antiincumbency was only partly apparent in 2004 as many states reelected sitting parliamentarians it also is notable that the bjpled coalition received slightly more total votes than did the congressled alliance however huge reversals for the incumbent ndaallied telugu desam party of the andhra pradesh state as well as for the bjp which fell from 181 seats in parliament to only 138 were seen by many as evidence that indias rural poor were not persuaded by the ndas india shining campaign that sought to highlight the countrys economic gains andhra pradeshs capital hyderabad has been touted as an information technology boomtown5 it may be that voters found the nda insufficiently attentive to the core issues of bijli sadak pani power roads water and voiced rejection of neoliberal economic reforms that were seen to benefit indias middle and upperclasses only6 other analysts saw in the results rejection of the hindu nationalism associated with the bjp just days after december 2002 state election victory in gujarat the bjps president declared that his party would duplicate the gujarat experience everywhere as it represented mandate for the hindutva ideology7 sonia gandhis foreign origin had become key point of criticism for these groups and it is likely that her decision to pass on the prime ministership was in part result of her not wanting to become subject of controversy as hindu nationalist groups had threatened to launch nationwide protest campaign if she took the prime ministership it also is widely held that gandhis action was driven by perceived interest in establishing circumstances in which her rahul who ran for and won parliamentary seat for the first time this year can assume the family dynasty mantle later in the decade8 4 myles neligan

political stage for 45 of its first 56 years of independence but did not hold the prime ministership after may 1996 never before had congress been out of power in new delhi for such long period although it continued to hold power in 11 states after 1998 congresss national leader was rajivs widow the italianborn catholic sonia gandhi who took to politics only with reluctance factors in the decline of support for congress included neglect of its grassroots political organizations by the leadership perceived lack of responsiveness to such major constituent groups as muslims and lower castes the rise of regional and issuebased parties and allegations of widespread corruption involving party leaders gandhi herself while enjoying the loyalty of most party leaders came under fire for allegedly poor campaign skills and for her foreign origins in the wake of three surprise statelevel losses in december 2003 gandhi called on indias secular forces to close ranks in resisting the bjps development emphasis insisting that it was merely cover for the bjps ongoing agenda of hatred and divisiveness motivated by belief that secular forces would hang together or be hanged separately congress began actively seeking alliance partners9 many analysts had argued that gandhi represented net liability for the party10 longrunning and contentious debate that likely was settled by the outpouring of affection for her in may 2004 still some analysts are concerned that gandhis significant and extraconstitutional influence bodes poorly for the future stability both of the upa and of the congress party itself11 the new prime ministers top four cabinet ministries home external affairs defense and finance are being headed by congress stalwarts bharatiya janata party the bjp

rashtriya swayamsevak sangh rss or national volunteer force responsible for the outbreaks of serious communal violence in which mosque was destroyed at ayodhya and some 3000 people were killed in antimuslim rioting in bombay and elsewhere while in power the bjp worked with limited success to change its image from rightwing hindu nationalist to conservative and moderate although antimuslim riots in bjprun gujarat in early 2002 again damaged the partys national and international credentials in general terms the bjp has comprised moderate wing focused on governance and development and hardline wing more concerned with emotive issues related to hindu nationalism former pm atal vajpayee is viewed as the leading moderate while former deputy pm and current bjp parliamentary leader lal advani fronts the hardline faction advani who steered the bjps 2004 electoral strategy has widely been viewed as heirapparent to vajpayee but advanis close ties to the rss and vishwa hindu parishad vhp or world hindu council and past involvement in communal conflict especially the 1992 destruction of the babri mosque and ensuing violence have denied him the widespread popularity enjoyed by vajpayee12 because the bjp did not play the hindutva card in recent state elections its impressive december 2003 victories in three of four contested states were viewed as triumph of the politics of development associated with vajpayee still national election results were widely viewed as serious blow to the hindu nationalist project13 bjp leaders attributed their setback to complacency and overconfidence hindu nationalists blamed the ndas defeat on an alleged betrayal of the hindutva cause by the bjp one top leader called for the creation of new party to look after the interest of hindus bjp leaders such as advani equate hindutva with nationalism14 the longstanding rift between moderates and hardliners came to the fore in june debate over the possible removal from power of the controversial chief minister of gujarat bjp notable narendra modi vajpayee himself suggested that modi should go but he was swiftly rebuked by the rss chief in sign that the bjp is likely to maintain more hardline position while in opposition15 12 in june 2003 indias central bureau of investigation filed conspiracy charges against advani and seven others for their role in the mosques destruction and rioting that killed more than 3000 but in september court ruled that advani would not stand trial 13 harish kare bjp sweeps hindi heartland hindu madras december 5 2003 bjp dilutes nationalist

coalition holds about 11 of all lok sabha seats communist parties have in the past been bitter rivals of the congress in these states but mutual commitment to secularism appears to have motivated their cooperation against the bjp in 2004 early alarm was sounded that the influence of communists in new delhi might derail indias economic reform efforts however indian industrial leaders have sought to assure foreign investors that left front members are not cubastyle communists but can be expected to support the upa reform agenda the communist chief minister of west bengal has himself actively sought corporate investment in his state16 regional parties the power of regional and castebased parties has become an increasingly important variable in indian politics the most recent poll

and increasing employment he also emphasizes that privatization is not part of upa ideology and that major public sector concerns will not be sold off the appointment of harvard educated lawyer and

interests even if the pace of privatization and labor reform efforts may slower the upas first budget released on july 8 generally was lauded by indian industrial groups as progressive and forwardlooking19 the budget calls for major increase in defense expenditures up 27 percent over the previous year both prime minister singh and his new external affairs minister career diplomat natwar singh have given indications that their initial foreign policy focus will be on indias immediate neighbors this may mean deeper diplomatic engagement in the sri lankan conflict along with more energetic efforts to assist the nepali government in its struggle with communist rebels perhaps most significantly the indiapakistan peace initiative begun in april 2003 suffered apparent damage from

political figures statements about the necessity of preventing repeat of the communal violence seen in gujarat in 2002 have encouraged those who hope that secularist leftleaning government will do
