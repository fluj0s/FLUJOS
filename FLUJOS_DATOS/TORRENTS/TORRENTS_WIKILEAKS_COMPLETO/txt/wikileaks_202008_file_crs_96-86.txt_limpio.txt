specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division women and minorities in senior management positions are underrepresented compared to their fraction of total employment the term glass ceiling has developed to describe the barriers that women and minorities are thought to encounter as they advance up the organizational ladder this explanation for the relative scarcity of women and minorities in upper management positions was explored by the us department of labor dol1 and by the glass ceiling commission2 dols office of federal contract compliance programs continues to conduct the glass ceiling audits of government contractors that it initiated in the mid1990s nontraditional candidates for management jobs congressional interest in the issue of sex or racebased employment inequities has included equal opportunity to enter nontraditional occupations 3 nontraditional occupations typically are defined as those in which certain groups are underrepresented relative to their

corporations found that 119 of corporate officers in 1999 were women4 although this was up from 87 in 1995 the figure remains well below womens share of all workers in the 340 firms from which both gender and raceethnicity data were obtained 13 of corporate officers were minority women with the number of women holding top corporate positions ie chief executives chairmen vice chairmen presidents chief operating officers or executive vice presidents at fortune 500 firms doubling between 1995 57 and 1999 114 their share grew from 24 to 515 some think that men disproportionately hold senior management positions because there are few women and minorities with sufficient relevant work experience and educational credentials employed in midlevel pipeline positions it is argued that as women and minorities increase their share of feeder positions and thereby create more diverse pool of qualified candidates organizations will voluntarily promote more members of the two groups proponents of this viewpoint contend that government therefore need not oversee firms promotion practices other individuals believe that attitudinal and organizational barriers exist which inhibit the advancement of nontraditional candidates as discrimination is perceived to be limiting opportunities for upward mobility among women and minorities these observers think that firms should actively pursue ways to shatter the glass ceiling and that the government should assist firms in their efforts federal activity the findings of the dol and the glass ceiling commission largely supported the latter point of view the commission recommended that the government lead by example strengthen enforcement of antidiscrimination laws improve data collection and increase public disclosure of diversity data for senior corporate positions the office of federal contract compliance programs ofccp has continued to conduct glass ceiling reviews of federal contractors it performed 36 in fy1998 and 40 in fy1999
