management of seniorlevel executives prior to the establishment of the ses opm lacked systematic plans for identifying recruiting and developing senior executives and for determining which executives were or were not doing good job3 major features of the ses among several main features of the ses there are two key concepts on which the ses is based4 guided by the notion of pay for performance the ses offers its members tradeoff in return for the opportunity to earn greater financial rewards ie salary bonuses presidential rank awards through out standing job performance executives give up some of the usual job security associated with the civil service the second concept is that rank resides in the person not the position this concept facilitates r eassignment of executives to functions or positions where they are needed the ses consists of four categories of appointees car eer limited term limited emergency and noncareer and two types of positions career re served and general5 career appointees make up the largest gr oup within the ses 6118 in fy2001 compared to 265 noncareer and 243 limited appointees the total number of positions authorized for each fiscal year is determined by the office of personnel manage ment in consultation with the office of management and budget omb entry into the ses is open to both civ il service employees and noncivil service employees though more than 30 of ses positions may be filled by individuals who do not have the requisite experience in the ci vil service each new appointee must have hisher executive qualifications certified by an independent qualifi cations review board the five executive core qualifications were updated by op m in september 19976 two major tools of performance manageme nt are the annual performance appraisal which must be conducted at least annually for each member of the ses and the compensation system career appointees who r eceive rating of fully successful or better are eligible for lumpsum

certification is for two years but opm with the concurrence of omb may terminate an agencys certification at any time the cap for senior executives employed by an agency that fails to receive or

associa tionsponsored survey of ses members was completed in 199917 the major issues facing the ses are pay compression retirement and succession planning pr oliferation and mobility pay compression pay compression is an ongoing problem for members of the ses as ses pay rates climb due to increases determined by the president and in the absence of significant increases in executive schedule salaries whic h as noted above are the caps for ses pay the base pay rates for the six ses pay levels move closer together the es5 and es6 levels have the same base pay rate 134000 when loca lity pay rates are added the top three pay levels are the same 142500 in all locality pay ar eas in 20 localities the top four pay levels are the same amount in houston angeles new york and san francisco five pay levels are the same amount there is concern that the pay compression problem and the belief that salaries for senior executives are inadequate might affect recruitment and retention efforts the presidents fy2004 budget contains proposal to change the ses pay system which if enacted could help to alleviate pay compressi on the presidents proposal through amendments to sections 5304 5382 nd 5383a and c of title 5 would raise the cap for base and locality pay to level ii of the executive schedule repl ace the six rates of basic pay with rang of rates ie one pay band18 raise the cap on basic pay to level iii of the executive schedule and allow for adjusting the pay of senior executive more than once in any 12month period as pr ovided in regulations prescribed by opm the proposal also states that the pay of senior executive c ould not be reduced as result of these changes during the first year they take effect the minimum rate of basic pay would not change19

the end of fiscal year 2005 opm estimates that 45 of those eligib will retire in the sixyear period between fiscal years 1999 and 2005 the impact on agencies and occupation series will vary for example 82 of the career ses members in the department of veteran affairs will be eligib to retire by the end of fy2005 while the figure is 65 each for the environmental protection agency and the nuclear regulatory commission the projected loss of senior ex ecutives to retirement suggests according to the gao report that succession planning should be priority among executive agencies however responses by ses memb ers to the 1999 survey suggest that number of agencies have not instituted fo rmal succession planning programs proliferation numerous agencies government corpora tions intelligence activities administrative law judges and foreign service positions are excluded from the ses agencies that have their own cadres of senior executives include the federal bureau of investigation the drug enforcement administration the centra l intelligence agency the federal election commission and the office of the comptroller of the currency21 statutory exclusions acknowledge that some positions do not meet the criteria for s enior executive that some agencies do not meet the definition of executive agency or that in the case of intelligence activities the nature of the work precludes membership in governmentwide executive corps other agen cies or agency components may be excluded from the ses if they have applied for and received waiver that allows them to establish and maintain their own group of senior executives22 for example the national security council having received statutory waiver pursuant to 5 usc 3132c has established its own cadre of senior executives separate from the senior executive service segmenting the executive corps in this manner gives agencies latitude in managing their toplevel executives as the pay compression probl em has worsened establishment of an independent executive cadre appears to have allowed affected agencies to increase the salaries of their senior executives regardless of the base pay rate of level iv of the executive schedule for example the maximum salary for senior executives at the federal aviation administration is 154700 the maximum salary for individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20303crs6 23 5

the status of the ses mobility prior to the creation of the ses move ment of toplevel ex ecutives gs16 through gs18 within and between agencies was mpered by procedural and organizational obstacles consequently one of the major f eatures and strengths of the ses was to be executive mobility the expectation was that intraagency ie reassignment and particularly interagency ie transfer mobility in helping executives gain broad base of experience and knowledge would benefit members of the ses and the agencies that employ them the number of local and ge ographic reassignments was highest in fy1982 when 1399 executives were reassigned in fy2002 the most recent year for which figures are available only 657 executives were reassigned24 the number of geographic and local transfers to another agency is even smaller the highest number of transfers in any one year was 149 in 1980 in fy2002 3825 financial burdens associated with relocation constitute set of obstacles peculiar to geographic reassignments and transfers whereas ses stakeholders rejected an opmproposed mobility requirement there is support for voluntary mobility consequently op m is focusing on ways to encourage and facilitate mobility especially interagency transfers among s appointees one of opms initiatives is the senior opportun ity and resume syst em soars website26 soars is an online job center where ses
