sidebyside comparison of current law and two versions of hr 4 108th congress summary the 108th congress did not complete action on legislation to reauthorize the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf instead adopting shortterm extensions the latest extension funds the program through march 31 2005 though welfare reauthorization failed to receive final action bill hr 4 did pass the house and substitute measure was reported from the senate finance committee the differences in the two bills highlight some of the contentious issues in the reauthorization debate the housepassed and senate finance committee bills were very similar in terms of how they would continue funding under the tanf program both bills would have extended basic tanf funding at current levels 166 billion for the 50 states the district of columbia and the territories through fy2008 and extended supplemental grants provided to 17 states through fy2007 both bills also would have provided new categorical grants for marriage promotion activities the major difference in the funding provisions of the two bills was how they provided extra contingency recessionrelated funding to the states the house bill essentially extended the current law fund that provides matching grants to states that experience high and increased unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads the senate finance committee bill eliminated the requirements that states expend additional money to access contingency funds and instead based extra funding on the cost of increased caseloads for states that meet revised unemployment or food stamp caseload criteria the two bills would have substantially revised tanf work participation standards that states must meet or be subject to financial penalty under current law 50 of tanf families with an adult or minor household head must participate though the 50 rate is reduced by caseload reductions that have occurred since welfare reform both versions of hr 4 would have raised this standard to 70 though under both bills the standard could have been reduced through credits though the credits differ between the two bills they also both eliminated separate 90 participation rate requirement for twoparent families both bills would have raised the minimum hours required of family members to be considered full participants though the house raised them more than did the senate finance committee bill the bills also differed in the activities countable toward the participation standards the house narrowed the list of activities countable requiring recipients to spend at least 24 hours in work community service or work experience programs except for short usually three month period when states may define what counts as activities themselves the senate finance committee bill kept all activities on the current law list and also allowed states to count activities on an expanded list for three months six months in some circumstances both bills

list of tables table 1 comparison of current law with hr 4 as passed by the house and as reported by the senate finance committee tanf provisions 8 tanf reauthorization sidebyside comparison of current law and two versions of hr 4 108th congress introduction the 108th congress did not complete action on legislation to reauthorize the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf instead it and its predecessor the 107th congress adopted shortterm funding extensions since the original funding authority for tanf expired on september 30 2002 the latest shortterm extension funds the program through march 31 2005 the house of representatives did pass bill in february 2003 hr 4 and the senate finance committee reported an amended version of the legislation in october 2003 though the full senate took up the bill in late march 2004 the measure was setaside in that chamber after motion to limit debate on the bill failed to receive the required 60 votes on april 1 the lack of final action in the 108th congress means that welfare reauthorization is likely to again be topic in the 109th congress this report describes both the housepassed and senate finance committeeapproved versions of welfare reauthorization legislation in the 108th congress the differences in the two bills highlight some of the contentious issues in the reauthorization debate before the bill was pulled from the senate floor the senate did approve one amendment to the bill which would have added 6 billion over five years for child care funding to total of 7 billion in child care funds above current law levels for the five years there were approved amendments to the senate finance committee bills tanf provisions summary of the similarities and differences between the two bills the bills had many similarities with both extending basic funding at current levels through fy2008 and incorporating president bushs proposal to provide categorical marriage promotion grants they both also raised tanf work participation standards though the two bills differed in terms of how much more work would be required and what activities count toward the participation standards this report provides comparison of the tanf provisions of hr 4 as it passed the house and was reported from the senate finance committee it does not address nontanf provisions of both bills such as revisions to the child care and crs2 development fund child support enforcement abstinence education and transitional medicaid funding provisions the housepassed and senate finance committee bills had very similar funding provisions the major difference in the funding provision between the two bills was that the senate finance committee bill would have completely revamped the tanf contingency recession funds while the housepassed bill would have made relatively minor revisions to the fund basic funding the 1996 welfare reform law entitled states to basic tanf block grant equal to peak expenditures in the pre1996 welfare programs during the fy1992 to fy1995 period it also established maintenance of effort moe requirement that states continue to spend at least 75 80 if state failed tanf work participation requirements of what they spent in these programs in fy1994 the mid1990s were the period when cash welfare caseloads were at their peak both the basic tanf grant and the moe are legislatively fixed they did not change when cash welfare caseloads declined in the mid and late1990s nor did they increase when caseloads in some states increased during the recent economic slump neither the basic tanf block grant nor the moe have been adjusted for inflation both the housepassed and senate finance committee versions of hr 4 would have continued both the basic block grant and the moe at their current funding levels without inflation or caseload adjustment through fy2008 supplemental grants during the consideration of legislation that led to the 1996 welfare law fixed funding based on historical expenditures was thought to disadvantage two groups of states 1 those that experience relatively high population growth and 2 states that had historically low grant levels relative to poverty in the state therefore additional funding in the form of supplemental grants was provided to states that met criteria of high population growth andor low historic grants per poor person supplemental grants have been provided to 17 states alabama alaska arizona arkansas colorado florida georgia idaho louisiana mississippi montana new mexico nevada north carolina tennessee texas and utah in fy2003 supplemental grants totaled 319 million both the housepassed and senate finance committee bills would have continued supplemental grants for the same 17 states at the fy2003 funding level through fy2007 unlike other grants which expire in fy2008 contingency funds the fixed basic grant under tanf also led to concerns of inadequate funding during economic downturns tanf includes contingency fund which is designed to provide extra matching grants to states that meet criteria of economic need based on unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads and have state expenditures in excess of their fy1994 level the two bills differed substantially in their revisions to the tanf contingency fund the housepassed version of hr 4 essentially would have continued the fund crs3 on existing rules with some relatively minor modifications allowing some additional state spending to count toward meeting the fy1994 funding level threshold and modifications to increase grants for states that qualify for funds for only part of the year the senate finance committee bill fully revamped the contingency fund it would have eliminated the requirement that states increase expenditures from their own funds above the regular tanf moe level and eliminated the matching requirements it added new financial requirement that unspent tanf balances be below certain threshold to qualify for contingency funds the finance committee proposal would have based contingency grants on portion of the estimated cost of increased cash assistance caseloads the senate finance committee bill would have also revised the criteria of economic need for state uses of grants and program requirements federal tanf grants and moe funds can be used for wide range of benefits services and activities to assist low income families with children and to further tanf goals of reducing outof wedlock births and promoting twoparent families tanf grants can also be transferred to other block grant programs up to 30 of the grant can be transferred to the child care and development fund ccdf and to the social services block grant though the limit on transfers to ssbg is set at 425 though annual appropriations have restored the ssbg transfer limit to its original limit set in the 1996 welfare law of 10 within the overall 30 limit federal tanf funds may also be used as the state match for federal reverse commuter grants if the program benefits welfare families both bills would have set the ssbg transfer limit permanently at 10 however the house bill would have raised the overall transfer limit to 50 the senate finance committee bill would have retained the current law 30 transfer limit both bills included provisions to ease some rules regarding use of tanf funds both the housepassed and senate finance committee versions of hr 4 would have allowed states to use carryover tanf funds for any tanf benefit and service current law restricts the use of carryover funds for the provision of assistance narrowed the definition of assistance to exclude all child care and transportation aid tanf funds spent on assistance trigger certain program requirements such as work requirement time limits assignment of child support payments and data reporting requirements under current regulations child care and transportation aid for nonworking families is counted as assistance and triggers these requirements the bills would have eliminated such aid from the definition of assistance freeing nonworking families who receiving only child care or transportation aid from these requirements crs4 work requirements both the housepassed and senate finance committee bills substantially revised tanf work participation requirements that apply to both the states and to individuals they both raised work participation rates that states must meet from the current laws standard of 50 to 70 raised the required hours of working to receive full credit and provided partial credit for participating families that do not meet the full credit standard and revised the list of activities however the bills differed in how they did these three things both bills also incorporated the bush administrations universal engagement proposal which requires states to develop selfsufficiency plan for all tanf adult recipient to monitor progress toward that plan the house passed bill also required states to end benefits full family sanction for families that fail to comply with work participation rules participation rate standards current law requires states to have specified percentage of their families with an adult recipient or minor head of household participating in creditable work activities the current participation standard is 50 states are subject to an additional participation rate standard for twoparent families currently 90 the participation rate standards may be reduced for caseload reduction not attributable to policy changes that have occurred since before enactment of welfare reform fy1995 this caseload reduction credit has had large effect on participation standards reducing the standard considerably from its statutory rate in fy2002 the standard was reduced to 0 for 21 states both the housepassed and senate finance committee bills raised the work participation standard for all families to 70 by fy2008 and eliminated the separate standard for twoparent families both bills also would have revised the credits that reduce these standards from their statutory rate ie reduce the 70 standard to lower rate but they did so in different ways the housepassed bill revised the current caseload reduction credit so that caseload change is measured from more recent year rather than the prewelfare reform caseload level of 1995 ultimately caseload reduction would have been measured based on the most recent four years the house bill also included provision to give an additional credit to states that achieved caseload reduction of 60 of more from fy1995 to fy2001 the senate finance committee bill retained the current caseload reduction credit for fy2004 and fy2005 but beginning in fy2006 would have replaced the caseload reduction credit with credit for employed welfare leavers the bill would have also capped all credits against the participation standard so that the minimum effective rate standard would have been 10 in fy2004 20 in fy2005 30 in fy2006 40 in fy2007 and 50 in fy2008 hours standards current law requires that family be considered participating only if it participates for minimum number of hours per week in month under current law 20 hours is required for single parents with preschool crs5 child under the age of six and 30 hours is required for other families higher hours are set for the purposes of the twoparent work participation rate both the housepassed and senate finance committee bills raised the hours standards the housepassed bill incorporated 40hour workweek standard for full credit but would also have provided partial credit for families with at least 24 hours of participation special lower hour standard would have been provided for single parents with preschoolers the senate finance committee bill also raised the hours standard for full credit but by less than proposed in the housepassed bill single parents with preschool child would have been given full credit for participation at 24 hours per week and other single parent families would have been given full credit at 34 hours per week partial credit for single parent families would have been provided at 20 hours per week higher hours requirements would apply to twoparent families creditable activities current law lists 12 activities that may be counted toward tanf work participation standards the bulk of countable participation is in subset of core activities focused on work timelimited job search countable for six weeks in fiscal year 12 weeks if criteria of economic need is met time limited vocational educational training 12 months in lifetime and community service and work experience in meeting the general 30hourperweek standard hours in educational activities are countable only for families who are also participating in at least 20 hours per week of core activities postsecondary education other than that considered vocational educational training does not count toward current law federal tanf work participation standards both bills would have revised the list of countable activities but in very different ways the housepassed bill would have narrowed what counts as core activity by removing job search and vocational educational training from that list except for limited period of time see below the house bill would have required that families participate for at least 24 hours per week in work community service or work experience programs to be counted toward the states standard for three months in 24month period four months in the case of an educational program states would have been allowed to define activities that count toward the standards these activities would have included job search and vocational educational training or other types of activities eg english for speakers of other languages classes substance abuse treatment or treatment for victims of domestic violence states would also have been allowed to determine the activities for which hours would count above the 24hourperweek standard the senate finance committee bill retained the current law list of activities including keeping timelimited job search and vocational educational training as core activities however it provided states with options to allow recipients to participate in an additional set of activities for three months in 24month period in the case where that participation is in rehabilitative activity another three months of rehabilitation would have been allowable if combined with core work activity the senate finance committee bill would also have allowed these additional activities and job search and vocational educational training to count without regard crs6 to their usual time limits to count for hours above 24 hours per week spent in core activities the senate finance committee bill also allowed states to have up to 10 of their caseload enrolled in special program of two or fouryear undergraduate education or vocational educational training this program is modeled after the parents as scholars program that has operated in maine using tanf moe funds marriage promotion grants current law allows states to use tanf funds for any activity reasonably calculated to achieve tanf purpose one of the statutory purposes of tanf is to end dependency of needy parents on government benefits and one of the stated means to end such dependency is marriage another of the statutory purposes of tanf is to promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families promoting marriage is currently allowable use of tanf funds both the housepassed and senate finance committee versions of hr 4 would have carved out special marriage promotion grants from existing tanf funding both bills included 100 million in competitively awarded matching funds for states territories and tribes for marriage promotion activities the bills would have allowed states to use other federal tanf funds or state funds as the match for these new marriage promotion grants both bills also would have provided an additional 100 million for research and demonstrations the housepassed bill required that these funds be used primarily for marriage promotion the senate finance committee bill required that 80 of these funds be used for marriage promotion marriage promotion activities listed in both bills were public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and skills needed to increase marital stability and health education in high schools on the value of marriage marriage education and marriage and relationship skills programs for nonmarried parents or expectant parents premarital education on marriage for engaged couples marriage enhancement and marriage skills training for married couples divorce education programs and marriage mentoring programs programs to reduce the disincentives to marriage in needbased programs could only have been funded from these grants if offered in conjunction with other marriage activities the language of the two bills was similar though the finance committee bill had additional language requiring that organizations familiar with domestic violence issues be consulted in developing marriage promotion projects and language to clarify that marriage promotion activities are to be voluntary other provisions both the housepassed bill and senate finance committee bill would have made additional amendments to tanf provisions regarding state plans data reporting tribal tanf programs and other provisions of tanf law these provisions are included in the detailed bill comparison table shown below the crs7 housepassed and senate finance committee versions of hr 4 also included amendments to the child care and development fund child support enforcement the abstinence education program and transitional
