policy domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33785runaway and homeless youth demographics and programs summary there is single definition of the rm runaway youth or homeless youth however both groups of youth share the ri sk of not having adequate shelter and other provisions and may engage in harmfu l behaviors while away from permanent home these two groups also include thr ownaway youth who are asked to leave their homes and may include other vulnerabl youth populations such as current and former foster youth and youth with mental health or other issues the precise number of homeless and ru naway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility and overlap among th populations determining the number of these youth is further complicated by th lack of standardized methodology for counting the population and inc onsistent definitions of what it means to be homeless or runaway estimates of the hom eless youth exceed one million estimates of runaway youth including thrownaway youth youth asked to leave their homes are between one million and 17 million from the early 20th century through the 1960s the needs of generally unspecified problem of runaway and homel ess youth were handled locally through the child welfare agency juvenile justi ce courts or both the 1970s marked shift toward federal oversight of programs that help youth w ho had run afoul of the law including those who committed status offe nses ie running away in 1974 congress passed the runaway youth act of 1974 as title iii of the juvenile justice and delinquency

shelter counseling and after care services to runaway and homeless youth under age 18 and their families while the transitional living program is targeted to older youth ages 16 to 21 youth who use

they often endure far more negative outcome s than their romanticized counterparts from an earlier era without adequate and safe shelter runawa and homeless youth are vulnerable to engaging in highrisk behaviors and furthe r victimization youth who live away from home for extended pe riods may become removed from school and systems of support that promote positive development they might also resort to illicit activities including selling drugs and prostitution for survival congress began to hear concerns bout the vulnerabilitie s of the runaway population in the 1970s due to increased awareness about these youth and the establishment of runaway shelters to assist them in returning home since that time congress has authorized services to provi support for runawa and

individuals under age 18 who absent themselves from their home or legal residence at least ove rnight without the permission of their parents or legal guardians9 although these current policy definitions are distinct youth can be homeless and runaways the american medical asso ciations council on sc ientific affairs argues that the distinctions between the two groups are artificial and may be counterproductive their report on this popul ation concludes that most youth on the streets are both runaways and homeless becau they have home to which they are willing or able to return10 some definitions of runa way and homeless youth ma include subpopulation known as thrownaway youth or push out s who have been abandoned by their parents or have been told to leave thei r households these youth may be considered part of the homeless population if they lack alternative living arrangements however the most recent federal study of runaway youth the national incidence study of missing abducted runaway nd thrownaway children2 nismart2 conducted by the us department of ju stice includes thrownaway youth in its estimates11 the study deemphasizes distinc tions between runaway and thrownaway populations because many youth expe rience both circumstances and the categorization of runaway or thrownaw ay episode frequently depends on whether information was gathered from the youth who tend to emphasize the thrownaway aspects of the episode or their care ta kers who tend to emphasize the runaway aspects some definitions of runaway nd homeless youth including those used by hhs include street youth because they lack shelter and live on the street and in other areas that increase the ri sk of sexual abuse sexual exploitation drug abuse and prostitution12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33785crs7 13 christopher l ringwalt et the preval ence of homelessness among adolescents in the united states american journal of public health vol 88 9

precise number of homeless and r unaway youth is unknown due to their residential mobility these youth often eschew the shelter system for locations or areas that are not easily accessible to sh elter workers and others who count the homeless and runaways13 youth who come into contact with census takers may also be reluctant to report that they have left home or are homeless determining the number of homeless and runawa youth is further complicated by the lack of standardized methodology for counting th population and inconsistent definitions of what it means to be homeless or runaway14 differences in methodology for collec ting data on homeless populations may also influence how the characteristics of the runaway and homeless youth population are reported some studies have relied on point prevalence estimates that report whether youth have experienced homelessness at given point in time such as on particular day15 according to researchers that study the characteristics of runaway and homeless youth these studies appear to be biased toward describing individuals who experience longer periods of homelessness16 the sample location may also misrepresent the characteristic s of the population generally17 surveying youth who live on the streets may lend to the percepti on that all runaway nd homeless youth are especially deviant youth surveyed in loca tions with high rates of drug use and sex work known as cruise areas tend to be older to have been away from home longer to have recently visited communitybased agencies and to be less likely to attend school than youth in noncruise areas18 as discussed later in the report th runaway and homele ss youth protection act pl 110378 which renewed the runaway and homeless youth program through fy2013 authorizes funding for

the prevalence of staying at particular dwelling place while homeless was constant across racial groups socioeconomic status youth who lived with both parents and those who did not and youth who lived in cities of varying sizes however boys were more likely to experience homeless episodes especially as these episodes related to sleeping in shelter or outside20 measured characteristics of homeless yout h vary depending on the source of the sample and methodology so evaluations of homeless youth indicate that gender representation varies across sample locations surveys from family shelters suggest either even numbers of females and males or more females see below for discussion of the gender of youth using federallyfunded basic center shelters21 although studies tend to document that hom eless youth generally reflect the ethnic makeup of their local areas some studies s how overrepresentation of racial or ethnic minorities relative to the community black youth are overrepresented at the basic center shelters22 the history of homelessness among youth also varies by the sample location youth in sh elters tend to have short periods of homelessness and have not experienced prior

by the chapin hall center for children university of chicago found that the average likelihood of an individual running away from foster care placemen ts increased over this time period34 youth questioned about their runaway experiences cited three primary reasons why they ran from foster care first they wanted to reconnect or stay connected to their biological families even if they recognized that their families were neither healthy nor safe second youth wanted to express th eir autonomy and find normalcy among sometimes chaotic events many youth explained that they already felt independent because they had taken on dult responsibilities beginning at young age third youth wanted to maintain surrogate fa mily relationships w ith nonfamily members youth in the study were more likely than their foster care peers to abuse drugs and to have certain ment health disorders youth who experience foster care are also vulnerable to homelessness after emancipating from the child welfare system each year about 26500 youth age out of foster care many of whom lack the proper supports to successfully transition to adulthood35 only about twofifths of eligible foster youth receive

policy early years 1930s1960s federal legislation on homeless youth the federal government first addressed the problem of youth homelessness during th great depression when it established programs to provide relief services fo r children and youth often accompanied by their families who left home to find work and became homeless the estimated number of homeless indi viduals in 1933 was two million to five million of whom 20 to 30 were boys44 mayors at this time reported that the transient and homeless populations in th eir cities were some times fed pushed on to other cities or placed in jail in response to the influx of homeless adu lts and youth to the nations cities the federal transient relief ac t of 1933 established transient division within the federal transient relief administration to provide relief services through state grants also in 1933 the civilian conserva tion corps opened camps and shelters for more than one million lowincome olde r youth in 1935 president franklin roosevelt created the national youth administration by executive order to open employment bureaus and provide cash assi stance to poor college and high school students together these programs help ed to reduce the number of homeless and transient youth according to the july 1935 federal transient relief acts monthly report 50000 young people were homele ss andor transient at
