rulings and court decisions regarding insurance activities of national banks generally banks by virtue of their chart ers and their enabling statutes which may be state or federal have limit ed powers that are generally confined to the business of banking in some instances they are specifically excluded from insurance activity over the course of the years however various legal authorities have permitted certain insurance sale s activities three recent supreme court decisions have upheld regulatory interpretations establishing the ability of national banks to sell i nsurance from offices in towns of less than 5000 to sell annuities and to preempt state law forbidding bank sale of insurance the supreme court decisions invalidating state prohibitions on national bank insurance sales leave

insurance sales provides an extensive legal interpret ation by occ of national bank insurance sales powers according to testimony presented to the house committee on banking and financia l5 services on february 10 1999 by william b greenwood president of the independent insurance agents of america there has been considerable state activity to regulate bank sales of insurance in the wa ke of barnett seventeen states have enacted laws regarding bank insurance activities arkansas col orado connecticut illinois indiana kentucky louisiana maine massachusetts michigan new hampshire new mexico new york pennsylvania rhode island texas an d west virginia six others are considering such legislation florida georgia maryland mississippi ohio vermont and wyoming do so despite the existence of the mccarranferguson act provision 15 usc 101b which relegates the regulation of insuranc to states unless federal law that specifically relates to the business of insurance specifies otherwise the court thus held that section 92 specific ally relates to insurance and that statute can relate to both banking an d insurance the court noted that by holding that national banks may continue to sel l insurance from towns of 5000 or less despite state laws that prohibit bank sales f insurance it was not invalidating ot her forms of state regulation of national banks so long as they did not prevent or significantly interfere with the national banks exercise of its powers the distinction the court made between impermissible state outlawing f national bank sale of insurance in the face of federal statutory authorization an d permissible state regulation has prompted speculation as to the type of state regulation that will be permissible among the consequent developments are occ issuance of variou s guideline s and state enactment of laws attempting to regulate bank sale of insuranc e4 within their states5
