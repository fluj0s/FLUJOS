the corporate interests of the military have expanded so much under gene ral musharraf that the army is now overwhelming all the major sectors of the state the economy and the society19 military agencies are blamed for abusing human rights and some critics have suggested that musharrafs faustian bargain with islamists serves to strengthen the very extremism that he publicly opposes20 one senior western observer contends that the generals cannot gove rn pakistan but they will not let anyone else govern it pakistani commentator sees the problem as military that wants to control things without being overtly seen to be doing so21 although civilian parliament has been seated for three years most of islama bads policy making process is opaque an absence of transparency may be most ticeable with pakistans defense budget which appears as single line in the federal budget numerous opposition figures have complained that removing the deta ils of military spending from public scrutiny is nondemocratic and allows the countrys intelligence services in particular to remain unaccountable to the people22 although it is possible to argue that paki stan is more democratic since october 2002 elections many analysts note that th countrys democratic institutions and processes are inflexible and unaccommodating of dissent and they see pakistans political parties seriously weakened in r ecent years with the militarys influence correspondingly more pr ofound23 moreover numerous commentators reject the 911 commissions best hope label for musharraf himself as myopic and repetitive of past us reliance on pakistani military regimes especially in light of signs that pakistans seemingly decreasing political stability is rooted in musharrafs policies and in his patronage

advantage of current geopolitical dynamics yet at july 2004 hearing of the sena foreign relations committee there appeared to be consensus among the panel of three veteran pakistan watchers about the potential problems inherent in real or perceived us over reliance on the individual of musharraf at the potential cost of more positive development of pakistans democratic institutions and civil society many commentators believe such velopment is key to the longterm success of stated us policy in the region calling musharra f marginal satisfier who will do only the minimum expected of him one hearing witness recommended that the united states must alter the impression our support for pakistan is essentially support for musharraf25 this conception is echoed by pa kistani analyst who contends that all of musharrafs major policy shifts after septem ber 2001 have come through compulsion by external pressure or events and that while the direction of pakistans policy change has been appr opriate the momentum of change is too slow and awkward and unsure to constitute critical and irreversible mass26 many pakistani and western commentators insist that only by allowing the countrys secular political parties fully into the system can the count ry realize stable and enduring democracy27 in june 2005 statements before house panel one senior us scholar warned congress about pakistans d ysfunctional social order its dangerous sectarianism and its distorted political system sayi ng the country has achieved sustainable failure when asked by members of the house international relations committee about the countrys governance system this expert opined that pakistans military has sought to prevent any of the mainstream parties from emerging as an alternative to the military yet he finds this strategy harmful to the militarys own interests viewing the army as demonstrably unabl to effectively govern progressively deteriorating pakistani system thus its in the armys own interest that it retreats from politics and allow mode rate centrist parties to fill the space he called sharifs and bhuttos return from exile requirement for truly free elections in 2007

considerably there are those who still conclude that the existence of an unstable and possibly islamicized or failed state between afghanistan and india state in possession of nuclear weapons is far ss desirable circumstan ce than the present one in which powerful and secular military institution maintains reasonable degree of order in pakistan29 for some this argument has become less persuasive

ministers and army chiefs military regimes have ruled pakistan for more than lf of the countrys 57 years in existence and most observers agree th at pakistan has sustained history of effective constitutionalism or parliamentary democracy the country has had five constitutions the most recent being ra tified in 1973 and significantly modified several times since from the earliest da ys of independence the countrys armed forces have thought of them selves as saviors of the nation perception that has received significant though limited public support the military usually acting in tandem with the president has engaged in three outright seizures of power from civilianled governments gen ayub kh an in 1958 gen ziaulhaq in 1977 and gen musharraf in 199931 since 1970 five successive

the pakistani people many of whom considered the sharif government to be incorrigibly co rrupt even many of the countrys more liberalminded opinionmakers acquiesced with the hope that musharraf might succeed in improving pakistans lot wh ere civilianled gove rnments had failed andor because they believed that military led government was the only remaining alternative to radical islamic regime in islamabad36 yet musharrafs subsequent actions became widely interpreted as indicating his intention to impose more or less permanent authoritarian rule over the country and they thus alie nated many of the early optimists while maintaining his promise to hold national elections in october 2002 musharraf spent ensuing years taking actions that bolstered his ruling position and that of the military

military rulers beginning with gen ayub khan in 1958 had em ployed like efforts as part of their political reforms according to one report local governments have proved to be key instruments in the militarys manipulation of the pakistani polity to ensure regime survival80 musharrafs plan was similar to that of former ruler gen zia in calling for threetiered system at the union tehsil town and zila district levels each with its own nazim mayor and naib deputy nazim notably nazims were given nominally full administrative au tonomy thus bypassing provincial governments and the elections were held on nonparty basis the first such polling took place in early 2001 while noting that the devolution plan did provide some benefits including greater attention to local needs and more facile public access to government officials analysts have been skeptical of the systems susceptibility to rigging lack of democratic accountability there is direct election of district nazims and an apparent absence of genui ne fiscal and administrative autonomy still many nonpakistani observers esp ecially those from international aid organizations such as the as ian development bank see the nazim system as bright spot in otherwise faltering effo rts at pakistani democratization81 although august 2005 municipal elections ostensibly were nonparty affairs officials from the opposition ppp complained in july that president musharraf was violating the code of conduc t by urging voters to cast ballots for candidates favored by the ruling pmlq then in blow to the hopes of islamist sympathizers the

consensus view among analysts has the pakistani military maintaining its substantive administration of the country in the event of president musharrafs premature removal the nature of such potential removal likely would influence the scope and intensity of military governance for example if musharraf were removed through violent means it is quite possible that the army would declare martial law and rule directly for period in any case it is widely assumed that the hierarchical solidarity and historic professionalism of pakistans military would result in its continued effectiveness as stabilizing force at least in the short and perhaps middleterm despite the apparent sturdiness of the militarys command structure there remains widespread pessimism about the ability of political institu tions built by musharraf to survive his sudden removal and so doubt s remain about the viability of political succession mechanisms moreover it is not clear th at musharrafs successor would

opposition disunity including an activ campaign of divideandrule by the military and previous hints of an accomm odation between musharraf and the ard have not panned out there are however signs that belowboard accommodation between the pakistani military and the islamist parties is disintegrating107 pakistans unstable and even deteriorating domestic security circumstances seen in still tense relations with pashtun tribesmen in border regions near afghanistan and continuing sectarian violence and islamic militancy in urban centers can have the effect of improving the ar mys standing among some sectors of the pakistani public one us scholar suggests that criticism of pakistans apparently slow movement toward democracy is arbitrary and ignores the potential cost to us policy interests that faster movement might entail such cost could include more constrained pakistani military and political leaders in islamabad whose greater responsiveness to public opinion might m ean reduced cooperation with the united states108 however and as noted above this view is disputed by numerous observers who insist that the strengthening of pakistans democratic institutions and civil society is itself fundamental requirement for the creation of stable and prosperous pakistani state109 pakistan has come long way since th 1990s when potential failed state was not an unusual label for this
