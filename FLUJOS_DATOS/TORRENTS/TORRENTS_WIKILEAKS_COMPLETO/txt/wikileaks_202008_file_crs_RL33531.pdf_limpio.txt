other federal programs with related purposes the lwcf is authorized to accumulate 900 million annually from designated sources with most of the money derived from oil and gas leasing in the outer continental shelf congress determines the level of appropriations each year and appropriations have fluctuated widely since the origin of the program fy2001 marked the highest funding ever with appropriations exceeding the authorized level by reaching nearly 1 billion total lwcf appropriations have declined nearly each year since fy2001 throughout the history of the program total lwcf appropriations approximately 15 billion have been unevenly allocated among federal land acquisition 62 the state grant program 27 and other programs 11 similarly federal land acquisition funds have been allocated unevenly among the four federal agencies more recent legislation pl 109432 provided that portion of revenues from certain ocs leasing will be provided to the state grant program these funds would supplement any f unds appropriated from lwcf there is difference of opinion as to the appropriate level of funds for lwcf and how those funds should be used current congressional issues

conservation fund lwcf act of 19651 was enacted to help preserve develop and assure access to outdoor recreation resources main goal of the law was to facilitate participation in recreation and strengthen the health and vitality of us citizens the law sought to accomplish these goals by providing funds for federal acquisition and development of lands and other areas and by providing funds for and authorizing federal assistance to states in recreation planning acquiring lands and waters and development of recreation facilities the law created the land and water conservation fund in the treasury as funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals it set out the lwcf is trust fund that accumulates revenues from the federal motorboat fuel tax and surplus property sales to supplement these sources to reach the annual authorized level of 900 million the fund accumulates revenues from oil and gas leases on the outer continental shel f ocs for many years the ocs revenues have accounted for almost all of the deposits monies in the fund are available for outdoor recreation purposes only if appropriated by congress and the level of annual appropriations has varied widely since the origin of the fund current congressional issues include 1 deciding the amount to appropriate for federal land acquisition and identifying which lands should be acquired 2 deciding the level of funding for the state grant program and 3 determining what if any other programs should be funded through lwcf and at what level the primary context for debating these issues is the annual interior appropriations legislation for the most recent action on lwcf see the land and water conservation fund section of the most recent crs report on appropriations for interior environment and related agencies 2 g10g152g160g561g157g145g142g561g8g158g151g141g561g25g152g155g148g156g561 the lwcf is not true trust fund in the way trust fund is generally understood in the private sector the fund is credited with revenues totaling 900 million annually but these credited monies cannot be spent unless appropriated by congress unappropriated funds remain in the us treasury and can be spent for other fede ral activities from fy1965 through fy2008 about 308 billion has been credited to the lwcf about half that amount150 billionhas been appropriated 3 further interest is not accrued on the accumulated unappropriated balance that has been credited to the lwcf while some supporters assert that the lwcf was originally intended to be revolving fund whereby the money would be maintained in separate account that could accrue interest this has not been the case the funds basic purpose has not been altered even though the authorizing legislation has been amended most notably to raise the funding ceiling and to mandate that offshore oil and gas leasing revenues should make up any shortfall from other specified financing sources 1 act of sept 3 1964 pl 88578 78 stat 897 16 usc 460 l4 et

federal acquisition of land and waters and interests therein 2 grants to states for recreational planning acquiring recreational lands waters or related interests and developing outdoor recreational facilities and 3 related purposes starting in fy19984 g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g14g138g151g141g561g3g140g154g158g146g156g146g157g146g152g151g561 the lwcf remains the principal source of funds for federal acquisition of lands for outdoor recreation most federal lands are acquired and managed by four agenciesthe forest service fs in the department of agriculture and the national park service nps fish and wildlife service fws and bureau of land management blm in the department of the interior5 these four agencies manage about 95 of all federally owned lands of these agencies only the fws has another significant source of acquisition funding specifically under the migratory bird conservation fund the fws has permanently appropriated source of funding for land acquisition 6 the process for appropriating funds for federal land acquisition is similar from year to year the annual budget submission from each of the four federal agencies typically has included proposals for lands the agencies seek to acquire with requested lwcf funds the fy2009 requests sought to fund relatively few acquisitions specifically the three doi agencies sought funds for acquisitions at 10 sites while the fs did not seek funds for new acquisitions in fy2009 section 7 of the lwcf act 16 usc 460 l9 provides that federal funds may be used for purposes including water development projects with recreational benefits land acquisition in areas administered by the secretary of the interior for recreational purposes land acquisition in national park national forest and national wildlife system units the large backlog of potential acquisitions provides each agency with options in its annual request congress reviews agency requests then determines which areas will be acquired and the funding level it will provide for each acquisition in general most of the funds have been earmarked to specific sites for instance in fy2008 congress specified funds for 75 acquisitions by the four federal agencies in recent years congress typically has provided the agencies with portion of the acquisition funding for one or more related purposes for instance funds have been provided for acquisition management to cover the costs of land purchases such as appraisals and title research acquisition funds also have been provided to cover the costs of land exchanges as well as the acquisition of lands within the boundaries of federal land units inholdings that may become available throughout the year further in some cases funds have been appropriated for emergencies or hardships for acquisition of lands from an owner who must sell quickly and where the agency determines there is need to purchase the lands quickly 4 hereafter these purposes are referred to respectively as 1 federal land acquisition 2 the stateside program and 3 other purposes 5 for an introduction to these agencies and their responsibilities see crs report rl32393 federal land management agencies background on land

until expended meaning the funds can be carried over from fiscal year to fiscal year often an appropriation is not used in the fiscal year provided because the process for completing land acquisition has many components and often takes more than one year7 g21g157g138g157g142g156g146g141g142g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 another portion of the lwcf administered by the nps provides matching grants to states including the district of columbia and us territories for recreation planning acquisition of lands and waters and facility development gran ts are provided for outdoor recreation purposes only rather than for indoor facilities such as community centers through fy2008 41208 grants have been provided to state and local governments for outdoor recreation projects this figure includes 7487 grants for acquisition 26868 grants for developing recreation facilities 2949 grants for redeveloping older recreational facilities 672 state planning grants for studies of recreation potential need opportunity and policy and 3232 grants for combination of these activities recipients have acquired 26 million acres acquisitions funded through lwcf grants must remain in recreation use in perpetuity unless the secretary of the interior approves of the conversion of the land to another use and replacement lands are substituted conversions occur due to changing state needs such as to use park lands to build schools widen roads and develop civic facilities the nps approves about 5075 conversions yearly nationwide according to the agency appropriations to the state grant program typically do not include earmarks or other directions to the nps to guide how these funds should be distri buted or spent the secretary of the interior apportions the appropriation for state grants in accordance with formula set out in 6 of the lwcf act 16 usc 460 l8 the formula calls for portion of the appropriation to be divided equally among the states and the remaining appropriation to be apportioned based on need as determined by the secretary 8 in current practice population is the biggest factor in determining state need state can receive more than 10 of the total appropriation states have up to three years to use the moneythe federal fiscal year in which the apportionment is made and the next two fiscal years it is rare for state not to use the money during this time according to the nps under law the secretary is to reapportion any amount that is not paid or obligated during the threeyear period to be eligible for grant state must prepare and update statewide recreation plan this plan usually addresses the needs and opportunities for recreation and includes program for reaching recreational goals it generally does not include specific projects under law the plan is required to be approved by the secretary and in practice it is sent to the nps for approval the states award their grant money through competitive process based on their recreation plans and their own priorities and selection criteria they can use the money for state projects or for passthrough to localities states send their topranked projects to the nps for formal approval and obligation of grant money under law payments to states are not to cover more than 50 of projects 7 lwcf funds are among the first to be borrowed for wildland fire fighting when funds appropriated for fire fighting are insufficient borrowed funds typically are repaid in subsequent appropriations bill 8 the apportionment among states including the district of columbia and us territories for each of

remaining cost is to be borne by the state9 additional monies are provided for state grants under provisions of the gulf of mexico energy security act of 200610 specifically 125 of the revenues from certain ocs leasing in the gulf of mexico is directed to the stateside program in accordance with the terms of the lwcf act the funds are to be in addition to any amounts appropriated by congress for lwcf the money is available without further appropriation and is available until expended an estimated 82 million in proceeds from pertinent ocs leasing was projected to be collected in fy2008 and

because there is set of other programs specified to be funded from lwcf presidents have sought f unds for variety of programs and congress has chosen which if any other programs to fund from lwcf for instance for fy2008 president george w bush sought lwcf funds for 11 programs within the fws fs and other agencies and congress provided funding for two of these programs si nce fy1998 the lwcf has been used for broad array of other programs including the maintenance needs of the four land management agencies fs highway rehabilitation and maintenance the historic preservation fund the payments

million fy1980 to 805 million fy1978 and averaged 647 million annually lwcf appropriations spiked dramatically in fy1998to 969 millionfrom the fy1997 level of 159 million fy1998 was the first year that lwcf appropriations exceeded the authorized level of 900 million 11 they included 270 million in the usual funding titles for land acquisition by the four federal land management agencies an

the authorized level and totaled nearly 1 billion this record level of funding was provided partly in response to president clintons lands legacy initiative which sought 14 billion for 21 resource protection programs including the lwcf it also was provided in response to some congressional interest in securing increased and more certain funding for the lwcf the 106th congress considered legislation to fully fund the lwcf and to make it operate like private sector trust fund such proposals sought to divert offshore oil and gas revenues to conservation and reinvestment act cara fund and to permanently appropriate receipts credited to the lwcf among other related purposes when it became clear that cara legislation would not be enacted congress included aspects of the legislation in the fy2001 interior and related agencies appropriations law pl 106291 these provisions established the conservation spending category csc with the lwcf as major component in the csc the csc provisions set target for total funding for all the component programs in fy2001 at 16 billi on including 12 billion through interior appropriations and 400 million through commerce appropriations under law the target was to increase each year until it reached 24 billion in fy2006 however congress generally did not use the csc structure in appropriating funds to the lwcf and related programs the csc was authorized in interior appropriations law through fy2006 while the commerce appropriations law authorized it for only fy2001 figur 1 l wcf appropriations fy1965fy2008 mill ions

are differing opinions as to the appropriat level of lwcf appropriations and what these funds should be used for the lwcf has broad support from resource protection advocates many of whom seek stable and predictable funding th rough consistent levels of appropriations or permanent appropriations most of these advocates seek higher appropriations in general while some have specific priorities such as higher acquisition funding for one of the four federal agencies the state grant program or particular site or area advocates of higher federal land acquisition funding promote strong federal role in acquiring and managing sensitive areas and natural resources others seek reduced levels of funds for lwcf ba sed on varied concerns they include concerns about further acquisition of privately owned land by the federal government either generally or at specific sites especially in the west where federal ownership is already concentrated the concerns involve preferences for private ownership limits that federal agencies may place on uses of private lands and reduced local tax revenues that result from public ownership some opponents believe that maintaining and rehabilitating the land and facilities that federal agencies already own should take priority over further acquisitions since federal agencies cannot use lwcf funds for maintenance supporters of this priority favor more funding to other accounts that can be used for maintenance and less for lwcf as part of the annual appropriations process congress sets the overall funding for each agency for land acquisition identifies which areas will be acquired and specifies the amount of funding for each particular acquisition if funding for land acquisition continues to decline or is relatively low these choices may be more difficult and there may be more competition for limited funds since the early 1990s the appropriations debate has grown more complicated as perspectives on resource protection have changed alternatives to acquisition which may provide potentially lower levels of protection but at less cost such as easements have become more widely used by federal agencies also resource protection is discussed increasingly for either larger areas with multiple landownerssuch as ecosystems landscapes or watershedsor for managing systems where only portion of the land is in public ownership in these complex situations success depends on cooperation and partnerships and the lwcf may be viewed as less critical or looked to as one component in cooperative protection efforts one area of congressional focus has been the stateside program with debate over the level of funds for grants the bush administration did not request funds for new stateside grants for several years on the grounds that state and local governments have alternative sources of funding for parkland acquisition and development the current program could not adequately measure performance or demonstrate results and large federal deficits require focus on core federal responsibilities stateside supporters assert that the program contributes significantly to statewide recreation planning state leadership in protection and development of recreation resources and longterm outdoor recreation overall and particular ly through locally sponsored projects that are readily accessible to communities they see the program as way to help fiscally constrained local governments and leverage state and local funds for recreation further advocates assert that investments in recreation save money in other areas for instance they say that these investments promote healthier lifestyles and thus save health care expenditures another focus has been on which if any programs other than land acquisition and stateside grants should be funded through the lwcf some seek to channel lwcf funding to broader array of programs to protect federal lands for instance the bush administration sought lwcf
