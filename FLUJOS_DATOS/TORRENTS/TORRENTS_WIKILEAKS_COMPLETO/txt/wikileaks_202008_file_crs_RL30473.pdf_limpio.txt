of medicaid create new separate state schip program or devise combination of both approaches states choosing the medicaid option must provide all medicaid mandatory benefits and ll optional services covered under the state plan in addition they must follow the nominal medicaid costsharing rules or apply the new state plan option for premiu ms and servicerelated costsharing as allowed under the deficit reduc tion act of 2005 dra in general separate state programs must follow certain coverage and benefit options outlined in schip law while some costsharing provisions vary by family income the total nnual aggregate costsharing including premiums copayments and other similar charges for family may not exceed 5 of total inco in year preventive services are exempt from costsharing nearly 40 billion was ppropriated for schip for fy1998 through fy2007 in bba 97 with the annual allotments to stat determined by formula using combination of the estimated number of lowincome children and

state childrens health insuran ce program schip under new title xxi of the social security act1 the program offers fe deral matching funds to states and territories to provide health insurance to certain lowincome children although specific requirements apply to eligibility benefits and beneficiary costsharing as described below these rules can be modified via waiver authority provided in section 1115 of the social security act2 eligibility and enrollment in general title xxi defines targeted lowincome child as one who is under the age of 19 years with health insuran ce and who would not have been eligible for medicaid under the rules in effect in the state on march 31 1997 states can set the upper income level for targeted lowin come children up to 200 of the federal poverty level fpl3 or 50 percentage points above the applicable preschip medicaid income level however under current statutory and regulatory authority states are able to effectivel expand eligibility of all children under 19 years of age to whatever level they choose4 within these general rules states may provide assistance to qualifying children in two basic ways they may cover ch children under their medicaid programs andor they may create separate schip pr ogram for this purpose more details on available benefits under each approach are described in the next section whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30473crs2 5 under medicaid law section 1902r2 authority may be used to liberalize income and resource methodologies for number of gr oups including for example povertyrelated children ie those under age 6 in families with income up to 133 fpl and those between ages 6 and 18 in families with income up to 100 fpl that same authority can be used to liberalize financial rules for schip purposes family coverage is provided under section 1931 this section has its own provisions for liberalizing income and resource standards 6 personal communication with judy rhoades centers for medicare and medicaid services june 5 2003 7 because individuals can have other health insurance and still be covered by medicaid this approach also allows states to bring into medicaid otherwise ineligible higherincome children regardless of their other health insurance stat us under this strategy for example states can provide medicaid benefits to add itional children whose existing health insurance is limited sometimes referred to as underinsu red when states liberalize the financial rules for existing medicaid eligibility groups the federal share of the costs for services provided to the subset without other health insurance the targeted lowincome children is paid for out of schip funds described in further detail below the federal share of the costs for services deliver ed to the remaining children with other health insurance is paid for by medicaid under the fourth senten ce of section 1905b and section 2105a2 of the social security act states are required to exhaust their schip allotments before using medicaid funds to pay for those who meet the definition of targeted lowincome childstates provide medicaid coverage to targ eted lowincome children medicaid rules typically apply when states provide coverage to targeted lowincome children through separate schip programs title xxi rules typically apply in both cases the federal share of program costs comes fro m federal schip funds also described in further detail below title xxi does not establish an individual entitlement to benefits instead title xxi entitles states with approved state schip plan s to predetermined federal allotments based on distribution formula t in the law explained further below however targeted lowincome children covered under schipfinanced expansion of medicaid are entitled to the benefits ffered under that program as dictated by medicaid law such individual entitlement exists for targeted lowincome children covered in sepa rate schip programs states may cover targeted lowincome children by expanding their medicaid programs in the following ways 1 by establishing new optional eligibility group for such children as authorized in title xxi andor 2 by liberalizing the financial rules5 for any of several existing medicaid eligibility categories many states with medicaidexpansion schip programs chose th latter opting to cover targeted low income children under existing medicaid elig ibility pathways especially medicaids povertyrelated child groups rather than by establishing the title xxi optional coverage group6 such strategy reduces the administrative burden of creating and implementing new coverage group7 states may also provide coverage to ta rgeted lowincome children by creating separate schip program st ates define the group of targeted lowincome children who may enroll in separate schip programs title xxi allows states to use the following factors in determining eligibility geography eg substate areas orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30473crs3 8 states may apply resource or asset tests in determining financial eligibility but are not required to do so in states with resource test individuals must have resources for which the dollar value is less than specified standa rd amount in order to qualify for coverage states determine what items constitute countab resources and the dollar value assigned to those countable resources assets may incl ude for example cars savings accounts real estate trust funds tax credits etc in 2005 assetresource tests were an eligibility criteria in only four states

au thority under schip has been to expand coverage for adult populations which has proven controversial12 see below for further discussion of adult coverage under schip fourteen states reported enrollment of about 587000 adults in schip in fy2007 see table 1 substantial share of these adults 487000 about 83 were parents roughly 93000 were childless adults nd the remainder 6500 we re pregnant women the number of schipenrolled adults in fy2007 587000 is lower than in fy2006 when it was 701000 adult enrollment in fy2008 will likely be even lower because the adultcoverage waiver s in illinois and oreg on were not renewed as shown in table 1 fy2007 adult enrollment was nearly 251000 in illinois and 15000 in oregon adult schip enrollment in these two states made up nearly half of all adult schip enrollment nationally from fy2006 to fy2007 most of the 14 states with adult schip coverage experienced enrollment increases howe ver those were overshadowed by large declines in four states by fy2007 ar izona completed its transition of 85000 schipenrolled childless adults into medicaid michigans enrollment of childless adults under 35 of poverty fell from 102000 in fy2006 to 78000 in fy2007 minnesotas enrollment of parents also fell from 34000 in fy2006 to 29000 in fy2007 finally wisconsins parental enrollment declined from 110000 in fy2006 to 48000 in fy2007 the only state in fy2007 with more adult schip enrollment than child enrollment was minnesota prior to the actment of schip more than decade ago minnesota expanded its medi caid program to cover child ren up to 275 of poverty as result federal schip f unds in minnesota could be used only to cover children above 275 of poverty in order to ve an operational sc hip plan minnesota began its schip program by covering 0 to 2yearolds between 275 and 280 of poverty with this limited eligibility group minnesota spent only 706910 of the nearly 126 million in federal schip funds it had been allotted between fy1998 and fy2001 in june 2001 the bush administrati on approved the state s waiver to cover parents of medicaidschip children w ith family income between 100 and 200 of poverty13 as result the states schip f unding position reversed with the state receiving an fy2002 allotment of 30 million but having federal schip spending of 65 million since then its annual fe deral schip spending has exceeded its annual allotment by 16 million to 42 million minnesota has been considered shortfall state since fy2005 in fy2007 the state had 29225 parents enrolled along with 62 0 to 2yearolds and 5346 unbor n

amendments varies among states for example some states use amendments to extend coverage beyond income levels defined in their orig inal state plans others define new copayment standards for program participants still others modify benefit packages in addition to the amendment process states that want to make changes to their schip programs that go beyond what the law will allow may do so through

schips authorizing legislation due to budgetary constraints applicable at the time the legislation was drafted the 110th congress passed two bills to reauthorize schip providing schip funding for

availabl through marc h 31 2009 b ecause shortfalls of federal schip funds were s till projected to occur in certain states additional funds were appropriated as discussed in the next section the allotment of funds among the states is determined by formula set in law this formula is based on combination of the number of lowincome children and the number of uninsured lowincome children in the state adjusted by cost factor that reflects average wages in the states health servi ce industry compared to the national average annual original allotments are basically separate sequential funding accounts for each state and territory the account for given fiscal year is made available at the beginning of that year and remains available for up to three years except for the new allotments for fy2008 and fy2009 under mmsea for example the fy2004 original allotments were av ailable to states until the end of fy2006 typically schip payments are taken out of the earlie st active account on ce that fiscal year allotment is fully expended the state can begin drawing from the next available allotment redistribution of unspent fede ral funds and appropriations to address shortfalls at the end of the applicable threeyear period of availability unspent allotments are redistri buted to other states the rules vary by fiscal year since fy2005 only states that exhausted the relevant allotment

states illinois and massachusetts ultimately d higher fy2006 schip spending than anticipated so they experienced shortfalls totaling pproximately 100 million almost all of that from illinois in fy2007 147 million in unspent fy2004 or iginal allotments was available for redistribution in th closing hour s of the 109th congress bill was passed to specify how those funds would be redistributed the national ins titutes of health nih reform act of 2006 hr 6164 pl 109482 nihra required that the funds go to states in the order in whic h such shortfall states realize monthly funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007 the purpose was to delay any state facing shortfall as far into the year as possibl with the available funds crs projections indicated that this particular provision w ould delay shortfalls until the end of march 2007 to delay shortfalls even further the schip provisions of nihra called for an initial redistribution of up to half of unspent fy2005 original allotments as of march 31 2007 capped at 20 million per stat after 2½ years of availability for state to forgo unspent fy2005 funds on that date nihra required not only that the state have unspent fy2005 balances but that the states total schip balances from the fy2005fy2007 original allotments as of march 31 2007 were at least double what the state project ed to spend in federal schip funds in fy2007 this was projected to provide an additional 138 million for shortfall states delaying any state facing shortfall of federal schip funds until may 2007 the shortfalls remaining for the rest of the fiscal ear were projected at just over 600 million in 12 states on may 25 20 07 pl 11028 the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act 2007 utra was enacted in

redist ribution mmsea appropriated up to 16 billion for states remaining shortfalls in fy2008 current projections are that less than 12 billion of this appropriation will be necessary thus th total

approximately 200 million other factors affecting federal financing like medicaid schip is federalstate matching program for each dollar of state spending the federal government makes matching payment drawn from schip accounts states share of program spending for medicaid is equal to 100 minus the federal medical assistance percentage fmap the enhanced schip fmap is equal to states medicaid fmap increased by the number of percentage points that is equal to 30 multiplied by the number of percentage points by which the fmap is less than 10036 for example in states with medicaid fmap of 60 the enhanced fmap equals the medicaid fmap increased by 12 percentage points 60 30 multiplied by 40 percentage points 72 in this example the state share is 100 72 28 in other words the enhanced fmap means states share of expenditures is 30 lower than under the regular fmap in the previous example with the federal government paying 60 of medicaid expend itures the states share was 40 under the enhanced fmap in schip the st ates share is 28 ie 40 x 07 compared with the medicaid fmap which ranges from 50 to 7589 in fy2007 the enhanced fmap for schip ranges from 65 to 8312 all schip assistance for targeted lowincome ch ildren including cove rage provided under medicaid is eligible for the enhanced fmap the medicaid fmap and the enhanced schip fmap are subject to ceiling of 83 and 85 respectively there is limit on federal spending for schip administrative expenses which include activities such as da ta collection and reporting outreach and education and other activities for fede ral matching purposes 10 cap applies to state non benefit expenses this cap is tied to th dollar amount that state draws down from its annual allotment to cove r benefits and these nonbe nefit costs under schip as opposed to 10 of states total annual llotment in other words more than 10 of the federal funds that state dr aws down for schip be nefit and nonbenefit expenditures combined can be used for nonbenefit costs incl uding administrative expenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30473crs14 37 for more information on this issue see crs report rs22629 medicaid citizenship documentation by april
