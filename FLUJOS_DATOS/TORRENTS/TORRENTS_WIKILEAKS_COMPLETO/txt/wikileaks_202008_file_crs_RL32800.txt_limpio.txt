are released monitoring their movements the debate however on sex offenders their punishment and management continues and as discussed in the previous section additional legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress issues related to sex offender laws have included the extent to which they are enforced their effectiveness the adequacy or targeting of federal funding to support registration and notification and the extent to which they reflect available research on sex offender recidivism these issues are discussed below enforcement of registration requirements major concern of supporters of sex offender registration is whether sex offenders are actually registering in states an investigation in 2003 by the associated press suggested that california could not account for 33000 sex offenders subsequent survey conducted by parents for megans law in 2003 which has not been published but has been reported in the press also suggested that thousands of convicted offenders had failed to register with states as legally required others while registering had provided false addresses or changed addresses without updating registration information according to the parents for megans law survey on average states could not account for 24 of sex offenders who were supposed to be in their sex offender registries in addition 23 states missed between 10 and 50 of their sex offenders while 17 states could not determine how many offenders were unregistered19 19 jennifer coleman lawmakers review audit of megans law registry associated press state and local wire september 23 2003 kim curtis survey states have lost track of thousands of sex offenders associated press state and local wire february 6 2003 see httpwwwparentsformeganslawcom crs33 effectiveness of state sex offender registration programs do not appear to vary with the size of the sex offender population florida populous state identified two reasons for its relatively low rate of noncompliance 47 of 27689 offenders one is that each year the states department of law enforcement mails letters to sex offenders and closely monitors letters that are returned certain state agencies have entire units whose purpose is to followup on offenders who fail to respond the state employs 11 fulltime staff to track offenders who do not register another reason for floridas low rate of noncompliance is the states use of technology which helps keep track of unregistered offenders for example florida requires sex offender to carry state identification card several florida agencies including those that issue drivers licenses and state identification cards have direct electronic access to the sex offender database and by crosschecking can monitor offenders20 according to the attorney general of north dakota state with smaller population of sex offenders required to register 32 of 1006 convicted offenders had failed to register north dakotas compliance rate was 97 the north dakota attorney general attributed the states high compliance rate to law enforcements placing high priority on enforcing the sex offender registration laws21 following is sampling of noncompliance rates of selected states as reported by the parents for megans law survey new york 10 of 18000 sex offenders were reportedly unregistered california 44 of 76350 offenders ohio 33 of 9086 offenders oklahoma 50 of 471122 tennessee 50 of 6300 offenders23 florida 47 of 27689 offenders massachusetts 44 of 18000 offenders and illinois 14 of 17087 offenders both the survey by parents for megans law and state audits of sex offender registries revealed that serious and highrisk sex offenders often failed to register and that state databases contained errors inconsistencies and outdated information in california address information had not been updated for at least year and in some cases updates had not occurred for at least five years24 explanations given for the poor enforcement of sex offender registration by law enforcement agencies vary other than monitoring sex offenders state and local law enforcement agencies may also be responsible for tracking domestic violence orders missing persons outstanding arrest warrants dna information and more spokesmen for many state and local law enforcement agencies argue that they lack the manpower and resources to adequately monitor sex offenders because of budgetary crises some at the state level attribute much of the inaccurate data in the registry to their reliance on local law enforcement personnelagencies that provide the information25 20 ibid 21 sex offender registry failure cited in state daily oklahoman february 7 2003 22 reportedly this percentage is disputed but an oklahoman spokesman could not cite number for the state because study of the compliance rate had been done 23 this percentage is disputed the tennessee bureau of investigation reports noncompliance figure of 37 of 5812 offenders 24 california state auditor bureau of state audits summary

registries constitutional but implementation poses continued crs34 there are several explanations given for the failure of sex offenders to register one view is that requirements to register every three months which apply to certain sex offenders place large burden on individuals who may have difficulty organizing their lives another view is that some sex offenders are ignorant of the registration requirement and believe that they have to register only once some state that offenders are simply irresponsible and do not take the need to register seriously finally it is argued that sex offenders fail to register because they just dont want to be tracked26 effectiveness of community notification programs although sex offender registration and community notification programs were created primarily to protect the public some question whether they are effective they challenge the assumptions underlying these programs that communities would be safe with sex offender laws with harsh penalties that the recidivism rate of sex offenders is inordinately high and that once sex offender always an offender they suggest that legislative approach would be more effective that recognizes pedophilia and some other sexual disorders as both criminal justice matter and public health problem27 few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of sex offender registration and community notification programs only two states washington and wisconsin have conducted evaluations of their community notification programs and neither study is particularly recent washington in 1998 the washington state institute for public policy released its findings of telephone survey conducted in the state over fourweek period in 199728 results of the survey revealed that 80 of respondents were aware of the states community notification law prior to the telephone interview about onethird of the residents knew that released sex offenders were residing in their communities about threefourths of respondents attributed their increased knowledge about sex offenses and how sex offenders operate to community notification 25 continued problems state government

believed that the behavior of sex offenders improved more with community notification than without it threefourths of respondents thought that as result of community notification convicted sex offenders would have difficulty establishing new lives in terms of finding job obtaining housing making friends etc but less than half of the respondents believed that offenders should be given every opportunity for new start as lawabiding citizens and eight out of 10 respondents felt the community notification law was very important in another paper published in 1995 by the washington state institute for public policy the costs of implementing the states community notification law were addressed29 researchers found that the size of communitys population urban or rural and policy decisions at the local level influenced the cost of implementing community notification if community had small population and few sex offenders who were required to register notification was handled informally usually through the county sheriff resulting in lower costs further in an area with large population and many registered sex offenders the costs would increase because of the time and manpower required to track offenders after notification and to investigate an offenders conduct and charges of harassment of an offender by some community members in addition policy decisions influence costs associated with community notification if law enforcement agency as an information repository relies on sex offender information supplied by state agencies such as the state patrol department of corrections etc and reviews only those offenders who have been drawn to the agencys attention such as through special bulletin costs can be modest by using the standard manner of issuing releases for example through schools or press releases it saves postage costs and officers time the study found that where public officials make community notification high priority and officers are assigned responsibility for monitoring convicted sex offenders costs are higher to take these steps may require an increase in payroll expenses and an investment in equipment andor software30 wisconsin generally there are three types of notification laws they require law enforcement agencies to inform residents of sex offenders moving into neighborhoods enable the public to gain access to relevant data on sex offenders and require convicted child molesters to identify themselves as sex offenders wisconsins community notification statute however requires officials only to inform residents about the release and reintegration of sex offenders in their communities in 2000 study assessing the impact of the sex offender community notification law in wisconsin was published which examined the effect of this law on residents 29 carol poole and roxanne lieb community notification in washington state decision making and costs olympia washington state institute for public policy

meetings held from january 1998 through midseptember 1998 throughout wisconsin were surveyed to determine the impact of community notification on residents although results of the study revealed that generally community notification was used to improve community protection 18 of the residents attending notification meetings thought the purpose was to discuss removing or preventing an offender from residing in the neighborhood while 71 of respondents felt they were better informed 35 left the meetings with less anxiety about sex offenders in their communities than before 38 were more concerned and 27 left the meeting with the same level of concern31 local and county law enforcement agencies were surveyed to identify agencies policies and practices in implementing community notification law of 312 questionnaires sent to local and county law enforcement agencies 188 were returned wisconsins law enforcement guidelines for sex offender registration and notification recommend collaborative approach among law enforcement corrections and other agencies in executing the notification process survey data revealed that 86 of law enforcement agencies were familiar with the states guidelines and 66 reported that their policies and procedures reflected those guidelines many law enforcement agencies considered community notification to be an unfunded mandate because of the additional work and costs associated with implementing it more than 66 of law enforcement agencies responding to the survey were concerned about the increase in labor expenditures resulting from implementing community notification agencies found the laws registration requirements beneficial because of an increase in informationsharing but reported that community notification was less beneficial with less than 41 believing that it improved the management and containment of sex offender behavior due to greater visibility based on responses to the survey the following recommendations were made local and county law enforcement agencies were to consider continuing the collaborative informationsharing and problemsolving approach developing written policies and training protocols that address the announcement of meetings distributing pertinent information about sex offenders such as their release locations answering questions and handling negative or hostile reactions to the release of specific offender and seeking federal or state funding for training and overtime expenses associated with sex offender registration and community notification32 probation and parole agents of sex offenders throughout wisconsin were also surveyed for their assessment of the impact of community notification survey findings showed that agents and supervisors who were responsible for implementing community notification were knowledgeable and trained on policies the survey revealed that the caseload for agents in urban areas was much greater than in rural ones the average caseload for agents surveyed was 25 active cases but nine agents had 40 or more sex offenders to supervise and six of the nine had 50 or more 31 richard g zevitz and mary ann farkas sex offender community notification

offenders to supervise and 37 had an average of 21 to 30 offenders 12 supervised 1120 offenders and 22 had 10 or fewer offenders some of the heavier caseloads involved lowrisk sex offender cases nonviolent offense prior felony etc that did not require the same intensive supervision that highrisk offenders did nevertheless community notification had considerably increased the workloads of probation and parole units in the state33 problems identified by agents and unit supervisors that are associated with handling sex offender cases include finding housing for offenders and increased paperwork associated with supervising high risk sex offenders an example of these increased time demands is agents participation in community notification meetings fortysix percent of respondents reported that as part of their job they attended at least one and in some cases more than six such meetings served as presenters at the meetings and assisted local and county law enforcement in planning and organizing notification meeting it was estimated that this involvement with community notification required about 40 hours of agent time per meeting34 finally highrisk sex offenders were surveyed to determine how the community notification process affected them of the 30 sex offenders interviewed all but one stated that the process adversely affected them seventyseven percent told of being humiliated daily ostracized by neighbors and lifetime friends and harassed or threatened by neighbors or strangers although only one was the victim of vigilante action all were concerned for their own safety twothirds of survey participants mentioned the negative impact of the notification process on their family members including parents siblings and children five of the respondents who lived in the same communities as their victims expressed concern for how notification and renewed public attention might affect their victims while only few of the interviewed sex offenders thought the notification would prevent reoffending by making their actions more visible to the public majority suggested that the pressure they felt from the public and the media would drive many sex offenders back to prison35 federal funding in support of registration and notification requirements federal laws directly or indirectly relating to sex offender registration have provided substantial funding over time to support collaborative effort of federal state and local law enforcement both in combating crime and in sharing information across jurisdictional and state lines the following review of the purposes and funding of few selected programs provides glimpse of federal assistance to state and local governments in battling crime in general and in supporting sex offender registration and community notification in particular to assist in this law enforcement effort the adam walsh act established some new grant programs described in more detail earlier in this report 33

programs is the umbrella for criminal justice technological and communications needs on the other hand nchip administered by dojs bureau of justice statistics provides funding primarily for records

major factor that influenced passage of sex offender registration and community notification laws is the perception that the recidivism rate for sex offenders is extremely high results of studies of sex offender recidivism vary greatly and actually contribute to the confusion surrounding the actual rate of sex offender recidivism in 2001 report that examined available research the center for sex offender management csom identified several reasons for the contradictory findings of studies of sex offender recidivism such as how recidivism is defined the sample of sex offenders and behaviors included in each study and the length of the time period studied41 according to csom the definition of recidivism can be measured by determining whether there is new arrest new conviction or new commitment to correctional institution while each of these criteria is valid measure of recidivism each measures something different leading to varied outcomes for instance when recidivism is measured using new arrests or charges as the criteria the recidivism rate will be higher because more individuals are arrested than are convicted when subsequent conviction is the criterion for measuring recidivism the rate of recidivism is lower when the criterion for determining recidivism is return to prison it must be determined whether the return to prison was because of the commission of new offense or technical violation of parole such as consuming liquor or being alone with minor child otherwise technical violation could alter the recidivism rate because it could include as recidivists individuals who may not have committed subsequent criminal offense42 many studies rely on official criminal justice system data to measure recidivism which presents problems because crimes of sexual assault are greatly underreported also researchers must determine the specific behaviors that qualify sex offenders as recidivists for example will the commission of any crime be sufficient to qualify as recidivating offense or will only sex offenses be considered if sex offense qualifies as recidivating offense then researchers must decide whether to include felonies and misdemeanors answers to these kinds of questions affect the level of recidivism reported in each study43 csom studies csom reports that while the vast majority of sex offenders are males they are heterogeneous group they include persons who have engaged in sex with children and family members as well as those who have sexually assaulted 40 continued department of justice justifications office of justice programs

studies should recognize this heterogeneity and examine specific types of sex offenders44 the period in which study monitors group of sex offenders can also affect the reported recidivism rate although to ensure statistical integrity all individuals in study should have the same length of time in community and consequently the same opportunity to commit subsequent offenses often that is not the case in actuality some individuals in 10year followup study may have been in the community for eight or nine years while others were out of prison for only two years to correct this problem csom suggests that survival analysis should be used which is methodology that considers the amount of time each subject has been in the community rather than simple percentage many researchers believe that an ideal followup period for recidivism studies is five years or more45 from public policy perspective recidivism remains valuable measure of how various interventions with criminal offenders are performing46 the noted caveats regarding studies of sex offender recidivism notwithstanding several notable efforts have been made to provide synthesis of studies of sex offender recidivism one of the techniques used to summarize the findings of multiple studies is metaanalysis47 using metaanalysis approach has some advantages in that it can reveal the relative importance of number of factors affecting recidivism across studies also the consistent appearance of certain offender and offense characteristics across different studies allows an estimate of how strongly they relate to recidivism in 1998 study hanson and bussiere that used the metaanalysis technique offender and offense characteristics were grouped by demographics criminal lifestyle sexual criminal history sexual deviancy and some clinical characteristics48 the study found consistent relationship between sexual offending and being young and single sex offenders were likely to recidivate if they had prior sex offense had male victims victimized strangers rather than family members started sex offending as juveniles andor had engaged in diverse sex crimes metaanalysis of 61 research studies found specific patterns of reoffending across victim types and offender characteristics the average sex offense recidivism 44 ibid p 8 45 ibid p 4 46 ibid p 11 47 metaanalysis relies upon quantitative approach to synthesizing research results from similar studies this technique involves more than just simple grouping together of disparate studies to obtain average effects rather it entails statistically sophisticated approach to estimating the combined effects of various studies that meet certain methodological criteria csom recidivism of sex offenders p 11 48 r hanson and m bussiere predicting relapse

child molesters over four to fiveyear period for the same period the recidivism rate for nonsexual violent offenses was 221 for rapists and 99 for child molesters while the recidivism rate for any reoffense for rapists was 462 and 369 for child molesters overall this analysis revealed that the factors with the strongest relationship to sexual offense recidivism were sexual interest in children deviant sexual preferences and sexual interest in boys the study found that having general psychological problems was unrelated to sexual offense recidivism but that having personality disorder was related another finding was that failure to complete treatment was moderate predictor of sexual offense recidivism the study also found that being sexually abused as child was unrelated to sexual offense recidivism knowledge of these historical or static factors helps to predict the relative likelihood of reoffending49 studies that take into account changes over time dynamic factors can inform about the most useful types of interventions in lowering the risk of recidivism another fiveyear study conducted in 1998 hanson and harris focused on dynamic factors50 this study collected data on over 400 sex offenders under community supervision of whom about half were recidivists who had committed new sexual offense during the fiveyear followup period the study revealed number of significant differences in dynamic factors between recidivists and nonrecidivists for instance employment status and drug habit of sex offender were found to play role in recidivism recidivists were more likely to be unemployed especially rapists and to have substance abuse problems nonrecidivists were likely to have positive social influences but tended to have intimacy problems attitudinal differences between recidivists and nonrecidivists also were identified the recidivists in the study who had committed subsequent sex offenses tended to be less remorseful or concerned about the victim they were less likely to acknowledge that they were likely to reoffend and were less likely to avoid highrisk situations in this study recidivists were more likely to report engaging in deviant sexual activities compared to non recidivists the lifestyle of recidivists tended to be more chaotic and antisocial51 bureau of justice statistics study the bureau of justice statistics bjs conducted study

committed by sex offenders within three years of release from prison 40 of the sex crimes were allegedly committed within the first 12 months the oldest sex offenders age 45 or older had the lowest rate of rearrest for sex crime 33 the more prior arrests sex offenders had for different crimes the greater likelihood of their being rearrested for another sex crime after release from prison released sex offenders who had only been arrested once for the sex crime for which they were imprisoned had the lowest rearrest rate for sex crime about 3 those with two or three prior arrests 6 seven to 10 prior arrests 7 and 11 to 15 prior arrests 8 clear association was shown between the lengths of prison terms served by sex offenders and their recidivism rate rearrest for sex crime against child the released child molesters were more likely to be rearrested for child molestation compared to the entire group of sex offenders and to the nonsex offenders released from prison within the first three years of release from prison in 1994 33 of released child molesters were rearrested for child molestation the rate of rearrest for sex crime against child for all sex offenders category that also includes child molesters was 22 while the rate for all nonsex offenders was less than half of 1 released child molesters with more than one prior arrest for child molestation were more likely to be rearrested for the same crime 73 than those with only one such prior arrest 24 rearrest for any type of crime compared to nonsex offenders who were released from prison the overall rearrest rate for sex offenders was lower when rearrests for all types of crimes were counted 43 of the sex offenders who were released were rearrested while the rearrest rate of the nonsex offenders
