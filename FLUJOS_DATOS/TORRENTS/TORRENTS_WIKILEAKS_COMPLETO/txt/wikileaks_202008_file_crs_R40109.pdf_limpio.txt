food vanessa k burrows legislative attorney january 2 2009 abstract industry observers have raised concerns about perceived gaps in food import safety over the past few years one particular area of concern focuses on imported goods that are released into the united states market after the food and drug administration fda detains them under an import alert generally these goods may be released into the market after an importer provides evidence that the entry is in compliance with federal laws and regulations currently the fda does not have express statutory authority to regulate the private labs that test these imported goods for compliance although the fda has authority over the importer and imported products this report focuses on obstacles to and legislative proposals for fda

regulation of certain types of imported food is delegated to the fda under chapter viii of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca 2 generally the ffdca provides that an article must be refused admission into the united states with some exceptions on the following bases if it appears from the examination of samples of food drugs devices and cosmetics which are being imported or offered for import into the united states or otherwise that 1 such article has been manufactured processed or packed under insanitary conditions or 2 such article is forbidden or restricted in sale in the country in which it was produced or from which it was exported or 3 such article is adulterated misbranded or in violation of section 505 3 under the ffdca the fda can automatically detain product without physically examining it4 automatic detention occurs as result of the issuance of import alerts which identify problem commodities andor shippers andor importers and provide guidance for import coverage such as if those products or shippers have met the criteria for automatic detention5 importers 1 fda regulatory procedures manual ch 95 rel ease notices httpwwwfdagovoracompliance_refrpm

petition for the release of their products by presenting testimony from private or thirdparty laboratories that shows that their products are compliant6 in order to do this they submit either their products or samples of their products for testing to the private laboratories for the products to be released the private laboratories must then present test results that indicate that the products do not violate the fdas entry standards the test results can be returned to the importer who will give it to the fda or the lab can turn in the results directly to the f da the fda may then use this data to determine whether the imported food complies with the ffd ca and can be released into the united states7 the fda has recognized these private laboratories as an integral part of food import safety8 according to the fda the thirdparty labs help ensure that the food reaching the market complies with agency standards and allow agency laboratory resources to be devoted to other regulatory matters9 however there has been criticism regarding the autonomy given to the importers and private laboratories such criticism varies from the manner in which the samples are collected for testing to the reporting of test results by the importers to the fda for example at 1998 hearing before senate governmental affairs subcommittee former customs broker testified regarding the abuses of the private laboratory system in relation to the product samples given to the private laboratory he recounted how some importers selected samples for testing that were from shipments that had not been detained or they submitted multiple samples for testing until sample was found to be compliant 10 as the fda has noted both of these activities permit importers to market adulterated or misbranded foods in the united states representing health hazard11 another example occurred early in 2008 when the chairman of private laboratory that samples and tests fdaregulated goods testified at house energy and commerce subcommittee hearing his testimony concerned encounters with importers who deleted information from test results that evidenced fda violations and then submitted the altered results to the fda as well as suggestions for improving the fdas regulation of imported foods via the use of laboratories and existing fda programs12 additionally he stated that the fda should be able to visit and audit laboratories at their physical location at any time currently the fda may conduct voluntary on site assessments of such laboratories13 recent agency administration and legislative proposals address various ways to curb the potential for such abuses by monitoring private laboratories 6 release notices supra note 1 7 requirements pertaining to sampling services and private laboratories

affairs publishes laboratory manual with section on private laboratory guidance14 the guidance seeks to establish uniform systematic and effective approach to ensuring that private labs performing analyses on fdaregulated imported commodities submit scientifically sound data15 to that end the guidance provides recommendations on sampling techniques information regarding the training and experience of private lab analysts considerations for reviewing the analytical packages and suggested criteria for collecting audit samples 16 in general guidance document is type of policy statement issued by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the manner in which the agency proposes to exercise discretionary power17 general statements of policy do not impose any rights and obligations18 nor do they establish binding norm because they are not finally determinative of the issues or rights to which they are addressed19 in april 2004 the fda proposed rule to regulate imported food product sampling services and private laboratories 20 it was withdrawn without comment on august 5 200521 some of the recommendations from the fdas laboratory guidance were put forth in the proposed rule22 the proposed rule would have required samples to be properly identified collected and maintained 23 the proposed sampling requirements outlined specific provisions for identification collection and documentation from the time the sample was collected to the time the sample was delivered to private laboratory particularly the proposed rule placed an emphasis on an independent execution of the sampling to ensure that the sampling and the tests continued usc 374a but has not chosen to assert it that statute authorizes the fda to enter at reasonable times any factory warehouse or establishment in which food is manufactured processed packed or held for introduction into interstate commerce or after such introduction and b to inspect at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in reasonable manner such factory warehouse establishment or vehicle and all pertinent equipment finished and unfinished materials containers and labeling therein in the case of any person excluding farms and restaurants who manufactures processes packs transports distributes holds or imports foods the inspection shall extend to all records and other information

action plan for import safety 27 both reports highlight how the bush administration would like to improve food import safety the food protection plan recommends legislation that would give the fda the authority to accredit private laboratories28 the action plan for import safety notes that the fda plans to issue guidance that would set standards for the sampling and testing of imported products

ways including by requiring new sampling and testing protocols for food shipments the dingell draft would have added new section to the ffdca dedicated to the testing of food shipments the new section would have addressed three areas of food shipment testing 1 testing in facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food that would not have been certified under the provisions that the bill would have established in which case accredited laboratories would conduct sampling and testing of each shipment and simultaneously submit the sampling results electronically to the health and human services hhs secretary and the facility owner 2 testing in like facilities that would have been certified under the bills provisions accredited laboratories would conduct sampling and testing of
