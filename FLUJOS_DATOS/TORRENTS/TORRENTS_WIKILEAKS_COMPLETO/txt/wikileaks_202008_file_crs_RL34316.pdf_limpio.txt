wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34316 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rl34316 pipelines for carbon dioxide co2 control network needs and cost uncertainties paul w parfomak and peter folger resources science and industry division january 10 2008 abstract this report examines key uncertainties in co2 pipeline requirements for ccs by contrasting hypo thetical pipeline scenarios in one region of the united states the report summarizes the key factors inﬂuencing co2 pipeline conﬁguration for major power plants in the region and illustrates how the viability of diﬀerent sequestration sites may lead to enormous diﬀerences in pipeline costs power plants particularly coalﬁred plants are the most likely initial candidates for ccs because they are predominantly large singlepoint sources and they contribute approximately onethird of us co2 emissions from fossil fuels the report discusses the implica tions of uncertain co2 pipeline requirements for ccs as they relate to evolving federal policies for carbon controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34316g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for

issuance of co 2 pipeline rightsofway on public land the cost of co 2 transportation is function of pipeline length and other factors this report examines key uncertainties in co 2 pipeline requirements for ccs by contrasting hypothetical pipeline scenarios for 11 major coalfired pow er plants in the midwest regional carbon sequestration partnership region the scenarios illustrate how different assumptions about sequestration site viability can lead to 20fold difference in co 2 pipeline lengths and therefore similarly large differences in capital costs from the perspective of individual power plants or other co 2 sources variable costs for co 2 pipelines may have significant ramifications if co 2 pipeline costs for specific regions reach tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars per plant then power companies may have difficulty securing the capital financing or regulatory approval needed to construct or retrofit fossil fuelpowered plants in these regions high co 2 transportation costs also could increase electricity prices in sequestrationpoor regions relative to regions able to sequester co 2 more locally as co 2 pipelines get longer the statebystate siting approval process may become complex and protracted and may face public opposition because co 2 pipeline requirements in ccs scheme are driven by the relative locations of co 2 sources and sequestration sites identification and validation of such sites must explicitly account for co 2 pipeline costs if the economics of those sites are to be fully understood since transporting co 2 to distant locations can impose significant additional costs to facilitys carbon control infrastructure facility owners may seek regulatory approval for as many sequestration sites as possible and near to as many facilities as possible if ccs moves to widespread implementation government agencies and private companies may face challenges in identifying permitting developing and monitoring the large number of localized sequestration reservoirs that may be proposed however even as viable sequestration reservoirs are being identified it is unclear which co 2 source facilities will have access to them under what time frame and under what conditions given the potential size of national co 2 pipelines network many billions of dollars of capital investment may be affected by policy decisions made

considering policies to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases prominent among these policies are those promoting the capture and direct sequestration of carbon dioxide co 2 from manmade sources such as electric power plants and manufacturing facilities carbon capture and sequestration is of great interest because potentially large amounts of co 2 produced by the industrial burning of fossil fuels could be sequestered although they are still under development carbon capture technologies may be able to remove up to 95 of co 2 emitted from an electric power plant or other industrial source carbon capture and sequestration ccs is threepart process involving co 2 source facility longterm co 2 sequestration site and an intermediate mode of co 2 transportationtypically pipelines some studies have been optimistic about pipeline requirements for co 2 sequestration they conclude that the pipeline technology is mature and that most major co 2 sources in the united states are or will be located near likely sequestration sites so that large investments in co 2 pipeline infrastructure will probably not be needed1 other studies express greater uncertainty about the required size and configuration of ccs pipeline networks2 handful of regionallyfocused studies have concluded that co 2 pipeline requirements for co 2 sources could be substantial and thus present greater challenge for ccs than is commonly presumed at least in parts of the united states3 divergent views on co 2 pipeline requirements introduce significant uncertainty into overall ccs cost estimates and may complicate the federal role if any in co 2 pipeline regulation they are also concern because uncertainty about co 2 pipeline requirements may impede nearterm capital investment in electricity generation with important implications for power plant owners seeking to reduce their co 2 emissions in the 110th congress there has been considerable debate on the capture and sequestration aspects of carbon sequestration while there has been relatively less focus on transportation nonetheless there is an increasing perception in congress that national ccs program could require the construction of substantial network of interstate co 2 pipelines the carbon dioxide pipeline study act of 2007 s 2144 introduced by senator norm coleman and nine cosponsors on october 4 2007 would require the secretary of ergy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such network of co 2 pipelines the americas climate security act of 2007 s 2191 introduced by senator joseph lieberman and nine cosponsors on october 18 2007 and reported out of the senate environment and public works committee in amended form on december 5 2007 contains similar provisions sec 8003 the carbon capture and storage technology act of 2007 s 2323 introduced by senator john kerry and one cosponsor on november 7 2007 would require carbon sequestration projects authorized by the act to evaluate the most costefficient ways to integrate co 2 sequestration capture and transportation sec 3b5 the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 signed by president 1 see for example john deutch

interior to recommend legislation to clarify the appropriate framework for issuing co 2 pipeline rightsofway on public land sec 7147 this report examines key uncertainties in co 2 pipeline requirements for ccs by contrasting hypothetical pipeline scenarios in one region of the united states the report summarizes the key factors influencing co 2 pipeline configuration for major power plants in the region and illustrates how the viability of different sequestration sites may lead to enormous differences in pipeline costs power plants particularly coalfired plants are the most likely initial candidates for ccs because they are predominantly large singlepoint sources and they contribute approximately onethird of us co 2 emissions from fossil fuels the report discusses the implications of uncertain co 2 pipeline requirements for ccs as they relate to evolving federal policies for carbon control g21g140g142g151g138g155g146g152g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g17

economic cost given the current locations of existing co 2 source facilities and the locations of future sequestration sites on its face this may appear to be straightforward analytic problem of the type regularly addressed in other network industries the oil and gas industry among others employs myriad analytic techniques to identify and optimize potential routes for new fuel pipelines 4 in the context of ccs however predicting pipeline routes is more challenging because there is considerable uncertainty about the suitability of geological formations to sequester captured co 2 and the proximity of suitable formations to specific sources of co 2 one recent analysis for example concluded that 77 of the total annual co 2 captured from the major north american sources could be stored in reservoirs directly underlying these sources and that an additional 18 could be stored within 100 miles of the original sources 5 other analysts suggest that captured co 2 may need to be sequestered at least initially in more centralized reservoirs to reduce potential risks associated with co 2 leaks6 they suggest that given current uncertainty about the suitability of various onsite geological formations for long term co 2 sequestration certain specific types of formations eg saline aquifers may be preferred as co 2 repositories because they have adequate capacity and are most likely to retain sequestered co 2 indefinitely the department of energy estimates that the united states has enough capacity to store co 2 for tens to hundreds of years7 however the largescale co 2 experiments needed to acquire detailed data about potential sequestration reservoirs have only just begun given current uncertainty about potential sequestration sites policy di scussions about ccs

sequestered near where it is produced then co 2 pipelines might evolve in decentralized way with individual facilities developing direct pipeline connections to nearby sequestration sites largely independent of other companies pipelines the resulting network might then consist of many relatively short and unconnected pipelines with small number of longer pipelines for facilities with sequestration sites nearby alternatively if only very large centralized sequestration sites are permitted the result might be network of interconnected long distance pipelines perhaps including high capacity trunk lines serving multitude of feeder pipelines from individual facilities third scenario envisions co 2 sequestration at least initially at active oil fields where injection of co 2 may be profitably employed for enhanced oil recovery eor indeed co 2 pipeline network already exists for eor purposes in the southwestern united states although it is limited in geographic reach whether ccs policies ultimately lead to one or more of these scenarios remains to be seen however the configuration of the resulting co 2 pipeline network and its associated costs may have significant bearing on which ccs policies best serve the public interest g10g162g153g152g157g145g142g157g146g140g138g149g561g5g17

when considering what actual pipeline projects might look like this section outlines contrasting scenarios for hypothetical co 2 pipeline development in the region covered by the midwest regional carbon sequestration partnership mrcsp the mrcsp is one of seven regional partnerships of state agencies universities private companies and nongovernmental organizations established by the department of energy to assess ccs approaches the mrcsp serves as good illustration of co 2 pipeline issues because it has varied mix of co 2 sources and potential geologic sequestration sites and because geologists have completed number of focused studies relevant to ccs in this region

geologic data f or ny are not provided by the m rcsp figure 1 also shows the locations of the rose run sandstone deep saline formation identified by the mrcsp as potential carbon sequestration site9 as the figure shows the plants all lie above or near to this formation so suitable co 2 injection sites presumably could be located very near to each of these plants if the rose run formation proves to be viable for largescale co 2 sequestration then some plants may be able to inject co 2 directly below their facilities and ccs pipeline requirements for some of the other 11 power plants could be small if this were the case then the ccs co 2 pipeline network for the 11 plants might appear as shown in figure 2 9 for most of the area shown in figure 1 the rose run sandstone lies at depths

mrcsp crs geol ogic data for ny are not provided by the mrcsp the hypothetical pipeline layout in figure 2 assumes that 25mile diameter nonoverlapping reserve area is needed for each plants sequestration site and that any location within the rose run formation is viable for sequestration figure 2 also assumes that each power plant is either located at or is connected to the center of its respective sequestration field by large trunk pipeline built along existing rights of way and capable of carrying its peak co 2 output smaller pipelines branching from the centrallylocated plant or from the trunk line distribute the co 2 to multiple injection wells in the sequestration site these smaller pipelines are not considered in detail in this report figure 2 shows that the longest trunk pipeline for co 2 transportation is 32 miles long and the average pipeline is approximately 11 miles long according to models developed at carnegie mellon university cmu the capital costs to construct an 11mile pipeline in the midwestern united states with capacity of 10 million tons of co 2 annually would be approximately 6 million the levelized cost would be approximately 010 per ton of

formation is identified by the mrcsp as major potential sequestration site it has characteristics which may ultimately limit its viability for largescale co 2 sequestration the most important of these is overall sequestration capacity because the rose run formation has low to moderate permeability and thickness geologic models show that it is unlikely all of the co 2 emitted in the rose run region

geologists have concluded that injecting pressurized co 2 into the rose run formation potentially could induce minor earthquakes along certain preexisting but undetected faults in otherwise seismically stable areas13 faults and fractures can in some cases provide additional sequestration capacity and be beneficial for sequestration but faults or fractures can also be permeable conduits for leakage and can be significant pathway for the loss of sequestered co 214 while studies are not yet available to establish the validity of any of these concerns future research may conclude that significant parts of the rose run formatio n would be unsuitable for large scale permanent co 2 sequestration15 g3g149g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g159g142g156g561g157g152g561g5g17

because of its of overall size or integrity if the policy goal is to sequester co 2 from all major sources in the region then at least some of the largest power plants in the mrcsp will need to sequester their carbon emissions elsewhere the alternative sites for potential co 2 sequestration nearest to rose run are unmineable coal beds oil and natural gas fields and another large saline

footprint as the rose run formation but located at different depths underground studies suggest that such coal beds may be suitable for sequestration in some cases injected co 2 could replace methane trapped in the coal seam increasing natural gas available for extraction wells in process similar to eor known as enhanced coalbed methane recovery however the potential capacity for storing co 2 in regional coal beds is only about 5 compared to the rose run sandstone and the practicability of storing co 2 in coal seams is virtually untested16 in addition removing groundwater from coal seams

fields which may offer opportunities for co 2 sequestration the region also includes number of natural gas storage reservoirs both natural and manmade which suggest that co 2 could be similarly stored however according to the mrcsp the ten largest oil and gas fields in the region have an average co 2 sequestration potential of only 251 million tons18 by comparison the 30year co 2 output of the 11 plants in this analysis would range from 270 to 491 million tons at current emission levels the oil and gas fields in the mrcsp region therefore even if they could achieve their stated sequestration potential may not individually have sufficient capacity to sequester co 2 from one of the 11 power plants in this analysis operating with current emissions over 30year period multiple fields possibly could be used by individual power plants to achieve adequate longterm sequestration but this would require multiple pipeline networks and consequently could increase co 2 transportation costs and complexity oil and gas production fields also present co 2 sequestration challenges due to numerous boreholes from historical welldrilling activity geologists are concerned that old oil and gas wells may be inadequately sealed and that their locations may be uncertain 19 increased leakage risks from old wells as well as associated mitigation and monitoring costs may reduce the economic ccs sequestration potential in oil or gas fields although revenues from co 2 sales for eor projects could offset co 2 transportation and sequestration costs for some source facilities longterm co 2 emissions in the mrcsp region would far exceed co 2 requirements for eor it is possible therefore that because of their limited sequestration capacity and wellbore leakage concerns oil and natural gas fields in the mrcsp region may not be viable sequestration sites for the largest co 2 sources either g15g157g495g561g21g146g150g152g151g561g8g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 if neither the rose

mrcsp crs geol ogic data for western indiana re not provided by the mrcsp figure 3 shows hypothetical co 2 pipelines which might be required if any of the major power plants in this analysis were required to transport co 2 to the mount simon formation as in the rose run case figure 3 assumes pipelines use existing rights of way and that 25mile diameter nonoverlapping reserve area is needed for each plants sequestration site however consistent with the rose run limitations the mt simon scenario assumes that the thinnest parts of the formation the easternmost contours on the contour map are unsuitable sequestration sites as the figure shows the pipelines required in ch scenario could be substantial ranging in length from 130 to 294 miles and averaging 234 miles according to estimates from cmu the approximate capital costs for these pipelines would range from 70 million to 180 million and would average 150 million the average levelized cost would be approximately 200 per ton of transported co 221 although figure 3 shows pipeline route for all the 11 power plants in question how many of these pipelines might be needed depends upon which plants may be able to sequester their co 2 emissions closer to home furthermore there are potential scale economies for large integrated co 2 pipeline networks that link many sources together rather than single dedicated pipelines between individual sources and sequestration reservoirs22 the individual pipelines required in figure 3 may be so large on their own that combining multiple co 2 flows from multiple plants through shared trunk lines may be limited23 while the mt simon scenario in figure 3 is far less favorable in terms of cost and siting requirements than the rose run scenario in figure 2 it is not necessarily the

capacity may conclude that the mt simon sequestration sites should be located in thicker parts of the formation in central indiana and michigan to absorb the tremendous volumes of co 2 generated by

sequestration sites relative to co 2 sources the scenarios in this report illustrate how different assumptions about sequestration site viability in the mrcsp region can lead to 20fold difference in co 2 pipeline lengths and therefore similarly large differences in capital costs in this regard co 2 pipeline costs may present the cost component in integrated ccs schemes with the greatest potential variability at the international and national policy levels some studies have recognized this potential variability for example an mit analysis states that the costs of co 2 pipelines are highly variable due to physical and political considerations24 the ipcc report likewise estimates total costs of co 2 mitigation of 31 71 per ton of co 2 avoided for new pulverized coal power plant assuming co 2 pipeline transportation costs including operations and maintenance costs of 0 to 5 per ton25 recent increases in the global price of steel used to make line pipe could push co 2 pipeline costs above this range26 at 5 per ton of transported co 2 pipeline costs account for modest share of aggregate carbon control costsbetween 7 and 16 based on the ipcc estimates nonetheless if ccs technology were deployed on national scale overall co 2 pipeline costs could be in the billions of dollars minimizing these costs while achieving environmental objectives may therefore be an important public policy objective from the perspective of individual power plants or other co 2 sources highly variable costs for co 2 pipelines may have more immediate ramifications if co 2 pipeline costs for specific regions reach hundreds or even tens of millions of dollars per plant then power companies may have difficulty securing the capital financing or regulatory approval needed to construct or retrofit fossil fuelpowered plants in these regions for example in august 2007 the minnesota public utilities commission rejected developers proposal to construct new coalfired power plant in the state in large part because the associated costs of 450mile co 2 pipeline to an eor site in alberta over 635 million were not viewed to be in the public interest27 to the extent that other 24 mit 2007

project like the minnesota plant may not be problem however if other generation sources are constrained eg nuclear renewable then the inability to construct new fossilfueled power plant may negatively impact the regional balance of electricity supply and demand higher electricity prices or reliability concerns might ensue some analysts believe that co 2 pipeline costs will be moderated in the future because generating companies will construct new power plants geographically near sequestration sites recent network cost models suggest otherwise on mileformile basis these models show that electricity transmission costs including capital operations maintenance and electric line losses generally outweigh co 2 pipeline costs in new construction accordingly the least costly site for new power plant tends to be nearer the electricity consumers cities rather than nearer the sequestration sites if the two are geographically separated 28 analysts have therefore concluded that power system with significant amounts of ccs requires very large co 2 pipeline infrastructure29 g5g17

relevant regulatory authorities and must subsequently secure rights of way from landowners there is federal authority over co 2 pipeline siting so it is regulated to varying degrees by the states as is the case for oil pipelines the statebystate siting approval process for co 2 pipelines may be complex and protracted and may face public opposition especially in populated or environmentally sensitive areas30 securing rights of way along existing easements for other infrastructure eg gas pipelines as the scenarios in this report assume may be one way to facilitate the siting of new co 2 pipelines however questions arise as to the right of easement holders to install co 2 pipelines compensation for use of such easements and whether existing easements can be sold or leased to co 2 pipeline companies31 although these siting issues may arise for any co 2 pipeline they become more challenging as pipeline systems become larger and more interconnected and cross state lines if widespread interstate co 2 pipeline network is required to support ccs the ability to site these pipelines may become an issue requiring new federal initiatives 32 continued public utilities

many facilities as possible furthermore capacity limitations at favorably located sequestration sites like the rose run formation may lead to competition among large co 2 source facilities seeking to secure the best local sequestration sites before others do how the development of sequestration sites will be prioritized and how competition for such sites may evolve have yet to be explored but they may create new and significant economic differences among facilities because co 2 pipeline requirements in ccs scheme are driven by the relative locations of co 2 sources and sequestration sites identification and validation of such sites must explicitly account for co 2 pipeline costs if the economics of those sites are to be fully understood proposals such as s 2323 which would require an integrated evaluation of co 2 capture sequestration and transportation sec 3b5 appear to promote such an approach although the details of future sequestration site selection have yet to be established if ccs moves from pilot projects to widespread implementation government agencies and private companies may face challenges in identifying permitting developing and monitoring the large number of localized sequestration reservoirs that may be proposed g3g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g141g561g138g151g141g561g6g146g156g138g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g141g561g20g142g144g146g152g151g156g561 geologists have long recognized that some regions in the united states have high potential for carbon sequestration and others do not for example 2007 study at duke university concluded that geologic sequestration is not economically or technically feasible within north carolina but may be viable if the captured co 2 is piped out of north carolina and stored elsewhere33 likewise states in the northeast minnesota wisconsin and possibly parts of other states appear to lack geological formations with potential for largescale sequestration of the volumes of co 2 they produce if national ccs policies are implemented power plants and other co 2producing facilities in these states may face more extensive and more costly pipeline requirements than other states if they are to sequester their co 2 states such as north carolina with limited sequestration potential and relatively high proportion of coal or natural gas in their electric generation fuel mix may face particular challenges in this regard the duke study for example estimated it would cost 5 billion to construct an interstate pipeline network for transporting co 2 from north carolinas electric utilities to sequestration sites in other states34 one particular concern among some stakeholders is that high co 2 transportation costs could increase electricity prices in sequestrationpoor regions relative to regions able to sequester co 2 more locally for states like massachusetts for example which has some of the highest electricity prices in the country and may have little sequestration potential co 2 transportation costs could raise electricity prices even higher above the national average moving beyond this illustrative example to evaluate comprehensively the distribution of co 2 transportation costs 33

economically efficient development of the nations public infrastructure is an important consideration for policymakers in the context of national program for ccs co 2 pipelines may be major addition to this infrastructure yet there are many uncertainties about the cost and configuration of co 2 pipelines that would be needed to meet environmental goals within an emerging regulatory framewor k exactly who will pay for co 2 pipelines and how is beyond the scope of this report but understanding ways to minimize the cost and environmental impact of this infrastructure may be of benefit to all in addition to specific questions about co 2 pipeline requirements the scenarios in this report raise larger questions about the ultimate development and allocation of sequestration capacity under national ccs policy how much individual companies may have to spend to transport their co 2 depends upon where it has to go however even as viable sequestration reservoirs are being identified it is unclear which co 2 source facilities will have access to them under what time frame and under what conditions while congress is beginning to turn its attention to these questions it will likely require sustained attention and the input of many stakeholders to refine and address them given the potential size of national co 2 pipeline network many billions of dollars of capital investment may be affected by policy decisions made today g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 paul w parfomak specialist in energy and
