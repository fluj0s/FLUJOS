koreas market consistent with oie guidelines specifically the agreement was to allow all us beef and beef products from cattle of all ages to include bonein as well as boneless beef along with offals variety meats and processed beef products this was dependent upon the removal of the following srms the tonsils and part of the small intestine of all cattle and the brain eyes spinal cord skull

it next was to allow beef from all cattle upon publication of final rules promulgated by the us food and drug administration fda expanding the restrictions on feeding srms to animals and pets because these feed rules were published in the april 25 2008 federal register the hope was that the korean market would soon be opened fully rather than in stages httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21709 us officials

imports if another bse case is reported here which could contradict oie guidelines and renegotiate the agreement6 by june 3 2008 the korean government asked that beef from cattle older than 30 months not be shipped although several beef companies said they would begin providing age information on their shipments to korea us government officials expressed disappointment in the korean decision and indicated they did not want to renegotiate the april agreement so the market remained closed in early june 20087 the us meat industry has stressed the importance of fully implementing the agreement

debate over implementation of the uskorea free trade agreement fta the fta phases out korean tariffs on beef over 15 years but does not address animal health related barriers the us international trade commission has estimated that fta itself could increase us beef exports by 600 million to 18 billion nonetheless number of lawmakers have signaled that their support for legislation to implement the fta is contingent on korea fully opening its market for us beef8 us beef exports to japan after months of negotiations the united states and japan announced on october 23 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21709 2004 an interim us marketing program to certify that only beef products from cattle of 20 months or younger are shipped also the united states agreed to an expanded definition for the japanese only of potentially higherrisk cattle parts these srms include for cattle of all ages the entire head except tongues and cheek meat tonsils spinal cords distal ileum and part of the vertebral column this is broader than the us srm definition which applies mainly to cattle over 30 months old the united states also agreed to permit japanese beef previously banned because of animal disease including bse there into the us market following us rulemaking usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis published final rule on december 14 2005 permitting such imports whole boneless beef cuts under specified conditions9 japan finalized its decision to permit us beef imports in december 2005 after its independent food safety commission fsc certified the adequacy of us safeguards at which point shipments resumed the japanese abruptly halted imports from all us importers again on january 20 2006 after they found vertebral column bones in several boxes of veal from one us processor following japans review of the eligibility of us slaughter facilities to export to japan the market reopened on july 27 2006 us officials continue to press the japanese to expand eligibility for more types of beef products as acceptable under oie guidelines but us exports have encountered continuing beef safety concerns among some consumers strict port scrutiny of us shipments uncertainty about us supplies of agequalified animals shift in consumer choice of protein from beef to pork and competition for the japanese market from australia bsefree exporter australia currently provides about 88 of japanese imports of chilled and frozen beef fas said another potential constraint to expanding us beef exports to japan is that countrys possible imposition of beef import safeguard 50 tariff should imports in 2008 exceed trigger levels the current beef import 8 see crs report rl34330 the proposed ussouth korea free trade agreement korus fta provisions and implications 9 70 federal register pp 48494484500 and pp 7390573919 crs5 safeguard is set at level that would not trigger imposition of the safeguard but it is possible that the safeguard established annually could be set at level in 2008 that could seriously curtail us beef exports10 in congress legislative initiatives in the 110th congress will depend in large part on the pace of resumption of us beef imports by japan canada situation on july 18 2005 the us border reopened to imports from canada of live cattle under 30 months old under usdas initial minimal risk rule11 the reopening was the first time in more than two years since canadas bse incident in may 2003 that live cattle from canada were eligible to enter the united states on september 14 2007 usda announced its minimal risk rule

allowing imports of meat from canadian cattle older than 30 months this was suspended part of usda rule issued in january 2005 the rancherscattlemen action legal fund united stockworkers of america r calf usa did not succeed in court action to block the border opening although the court has yet to rule on rcalfs request for temporary restraining order that could result in putting on hold the mrr2 cattle rule until the court rules on its legality12 r calfs legal efforts to block issuance of earlier rules also did not meet with success13 one major concern of some cattlemen has been that mrr2 would result in flood of canadian cull cattle exports to the united states analysis by usda however suggests that for variety of reasons this was unlikely to occur fas lists among factors that will impede the flow of cull cattle from canada to the united states an increase in canadian slaughter capacity for cull cattle that reduces the supply of culled animals available for export large number of canadian cull cattle that are currently older than eight years and thus disqualified from export eligibility by the age requirements in mrr2 and strengthening of canadian cattle prices as the mrr2 rule goes into effect14 us imports of canadian cattle had fallen to 512000 head in 2003 and virtually none in 2004 10 see usda fas japan livestock and products annual report 2007 at httpwwwfas

recovered to approximately 14 million in 2007 still somewhat below their prebse annual level of 17 million according to usda data besides concerns about competition from increased canadian live cattle imports there were worries that opening the border to what some believe are potentially risky canadian animals will undermine efforts to regain the japanese and korean markets others counter that moving forward with the canada rules was necessary for the united states to convince other countries that north american beef is safe and that all countries should like the united states base their import policies on international standards in congress in the 110th congress resolutions of disapproval of mrr2 have been introduced in both chambers hjres 55 and sjres 20 if passed and signed by the president mrr2 would have force or effect another bill introduced in the 110th congress s 1308 would prohibit imports of canadian cattle over 30 months of age or of beef derived from such cattle until

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21709 related us economic impacts15 industry analysts believe that the bse experience has been much less devastating economically in the united states than it has been in other countries one reason is that the united states learning from europe was able to put bse safeguards into place prior to its own first case also the us beef industry is much less dependent on export demand than the canadians cushioning the price effects before the bse events canada exported 37 of its beef production whereas the united states exported 9 in 2003 the us ban on canadian beef and cattle coupled with already tight us supplies and strong demand had driven up us beef and cattle prices substantially after the december 2003 bse case was announced cattle prices fell but quickly stabilized continuing demand plus lower us cattle inventories due in part to widespread drought in cattle country kept cattle and beef prices high during 2004 helping to offset the effects of the bserelated foreign bans usda reported average us fed steer ie slaughter ready cattle prices at nearly 85 per cwt for all of 2004 compared with average fed steer prices of 85 in 2003 and 67 in 2002 by 2007 they reached nearly 92 study by kansas state university of the impact that bse has had on the us beef industry found that average us wholesale boxed beef prices during 2004 were 12 to 17 cents per pound lower than they would have been if all the export markets had been open the loss of beef export markets also meant that byproduct prices were lower than they would have been the total estimated us beef industry losses attributable to loss of beef and byproduct exports in 2004 ranged from 32 to 47 billion according to the study16 15 sources for this section include usdaers livestock
