30300 plans including about 1500 multiemployer plans in fy2007 pbgc paid about 43 billion in benefits to almost 12 million people in almost 3800 plans firm must be in financial distress to end an underfunded plan most workers in single employer plans taken over by pbgc receive the full benefit earned at the time of termination but the ceiling on multiemployer plan benefits that could be guaranteed has left almost all of these retirees without full benefit protection pbgc financing the pbgc is required by erisa to be selfsupporting and receives appropriations from general reve nue the most reliable source of pbgc revenue is the premiums set by congress and paid by the privatesector employers that sponsor db pension plans other sources of income are assets from terminated plans taken over by the pbgc investment income and recoveries collected from companies when they end underfunded pension plans the pbgc is authorized to borrow up to 100 million from the us treasury pl 96364 requires that the pbgcs receipts and disbursements be included in federal budget totals premiums the minimum annual premium char ged for each participant in singleemployer db plan was raised for th 2006 plan year from 19 to 30 by the deficit reduction act dra of 2005 p l 109171 this law also raised the multiemployer plan premium from flat 260 annually per pa rticipant to 8 b ecause these premiumshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95118crs2 are now adjusted for inflation the 2008 rate s will be 33 and 9 respectively the dra added new 1250 per participan t premium for certain plans terminated after 2005 this premium is payable for the year of termination and each of the next two years an additional premium of 9 for each 1000 of unfunded vested bene fits as newly defined by the pension prot ection act ppa of 2006 pl 109280 is assessed against plans that are not fully funded effec tive in 2008 the ppa also eliminates certain exemptions from this variable premium that are presently available pension benefit guaranty erisa sets maximum on the individual benefit amount that the pbgc can guar antee the ceiling for single employer plans is adjusted annually for national wage growth the maximum pension guarantee is 51750 year for plans that terminate in 2008 this amount is decreased if participant retires before age 65 or if the pension plan provides benef its in some form other than equal monthly payments for the life of the retiree only b asic benefits are guaranteed these include benefits beginning at normal retirement age usually 65 certain early retirement and disability benefits and benefits for survivors of deceased plan participants only vested benefits are insured in contrast the ceiling on guaranteed benefits for multiemployer plans is not adjusted annually the amount set in 1980 did not chan ge until the consolidated appropriations act 2001 pl 106554 became law in decem ber 2000 these plans determine benefits by multiplying flat dollar rate by years of service so the benefit guaranty ceiling is tied to this formula the new ceiling equals 100 of the first 11 of monthly benefits per year of service plus 75 of the next 33 of monthly benefits per year of service current financial picture in 1996 the pbgc showed surplus in its single employer program for the first time in its hi story that surplus peaked at 97 billion in 2000 helped by the strong performance of the equity markets in the 1990s the weakness in the economy particularly in the steel nd airline industries has led to large and expensive plan terminations that have eliminated the surplus and left the singleemployer program with deficit of 181 billion at the end of fy2006 the deficit decreased to 131 billion at the end of fy2007 the multiemployer program had surplus from 1982 to 2002 but the pbgc reported that it had deficit of 955 million at the end of fy2007 for more information on pbgc finances see crs report rl33937 the financial health of the pension benefit guaranty corporation by william klunk pension funding levels private sector db pensi on plans are required to report their level of funding to the pbgc and in 2005 over 1100 companies reported underfunding greater than 50 million the most recent year available one reason cited for the increase in underfunding is the low inte rest rate used by pbgc to determine the present value of pension liabilities the higher the interest rate the lower the present value of the liabilities and vice versa ma ny of the underfunded plans are sponsored by financially healthy firms and pose real ri sk to the pbgc however underfunding in plans whose sponsors have belo w investment grade credit ratings or meet one or more financial distress criteria was 66 billion in september 2007 down from 73 billion the previous year as of september 30 2006 the pbgc estimated that th total shortfall in all pension plans exceeded 350 billion additional information is available at the pbgc website at httpwwwpbgcgov
