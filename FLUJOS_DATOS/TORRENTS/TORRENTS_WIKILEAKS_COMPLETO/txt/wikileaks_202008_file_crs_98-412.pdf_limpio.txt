april 20 1998 this report will be udpated again this yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98412international monetary fund imf costs and benefits of us participation summary this report examines us costs of participating in the international monetary fund imf under conventions governing us budgeta ry treatment of the imf any expenditures outlays arising from transactions with the imf are offset by th increase in the us reserve position in the imf and thus have net impact on the budget nevertheless funds for the imf are both authorized and appropriated expenditures in connection with us participation in the fund however do give rise to three other types of financial flows that enter the budget an increase or decrease in the treasurys interest costs receipts from the imf mostly from interest remuneration earned on the us reserve tranche position and foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate movement s between the special drawing right sdr and the us dollar for the period july 1 1969 through december 31 1982 the us government sustained loss on its transactions with the imf that amounted to 14 billion or an annual average of 107 million for the 18year period extending from april 30 1980 to april 30 1997 imf fiscal year the united states had positive return to the us budget of 13 billion or an annu average of 73 million within the total financial picture of the us government these sums are modest for 1997 imf fiscal year for example th us sustained loss of 16 billion this was equivalent to about 01 percent of total expenditures or 02 percent of discretionary expenditures us fiscal year gains and losses resulting from transactions with the imf were largel attributable to exchange rate movements between the us dollar and the sdr the international reserve asset in which all imf accounts are denominated benefits of the imf to the united states like those arising from mos t government pro grams are difficult to quantify perhaps the most important point is that the us government with 1825 perce nt of total imf quotas capital and 1778 percent of the voting power is the l argest shareholder it has veto over major imf policies and deciding say over much else including support programs extended by the imf within the context of major international financial crises the imf is deeply intertwined with us international economic policy given the relatively modes t financial costs of us participation in the imf it would appear that the imf s performance policies and programs are the more critical issue in the current policy

financial costs sustained by the united states in connection with its parti cipation in the imf has arisen this report examines these costs and to lesser extent the largel unquantifiable benefits growing out of participation in the fund the report is based on data provided by the int ernational monetary fund imf to crs updating and supplementing earlier data provided to the us congress by the us department of the treasury on an ad hoc basis at the time of the 1983 and 1992 quota increases 3 the data are presented in two time series the first period extends from july 1 1969 to december 31 1982 the second from april 30 1980 to april 30 1997 the first set of data were prepared by the us treasury on us fiscal year basis th second set combines us treasury data and imf data both of which

committee on banking and financial services general oversight and investigations subcommittee in light of this new data this report will be updated budgetary treatment quota increases are paid to the imf by transferring 25 percent of the amount of the increase the socalled reserve tranche to the i mf in the form of international reserve assets and the balance equal to 75 percent of the increase in the form of letter of credit 4 the reserve tranche payment to the imf is made immediately upon acceptance of the increas ed quota payment is made either in hard currencies currencies that are generally acceptable for international transactions other than countrys ow n currency or in special drawing rights sdrs 5 the letter of credit on the other hand is considered to be contingent liability of the us g overnment the letter of credit is encashed by the imf to meet it s requirements for us dollars to be used in making loans to countries that ar borrowing from the it both reserve tranch payments and payments to the imf under the quota letter of credit result in budget expenditure only as cas h is actually transferred to the imf when transfer is made however the united states gets an equal and offsettin g receipt an interestbearing liquid international monetary asset specifically th increase in the us reserve position in the fund under current budgetar conventions these offsetting transactions are treated as an exchange of assets as6 consequence they do not result in net budget outlays and they do not affect the net budgetary position deficit or rplus of the federal government looked at another way any debt liability incurred through the sale of securities to make thi s expenditure is balanced by an asset the us reserve position in the fund httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98412crs3 under budgetary practices established in consultation with congress in 1980 funding for the imf nevertheless requires budgeta ry authorization and appropriation in the full am ount this is an historical development that contravenes the governing account ing convention but reflects congressional concern regarding the the n burgeoning us fiscal deficit funding for the imf also does not require any compensatory cuts in domestic spending titl x of pl 10533 the balanced budget act of 1997 provides for an adjustment to the budgets discretionary spending limits to allow for us acceptance of the increased financial commi tment that would arise in connection with the imf budgetary treatment for the na b which are an arrangement of credit lines that the imf could tap in the event of financial crisis is identical to that of imf quota increases an exchange of assets having net effect on the us fiscal position and requiring com pensatory cuts in domestic spending drawing by the imf under the nab w ould not constitute contribution to the imfs capital and would not therefore incre ase the us reserve position in the imf rather it would constitute an interestbearing loan to the imf repayable within five years financial flows arising from us participation in the imf as cash is actually transferred to the imf h owever number of financial flows that are distinct from the exchange of assets that has b een described above also occur us government borrowing interest costs may be either increased r decreased the net debt position of the us treasury

transactions with the imf april 30 1980april 30 1997 million estimated us treasury borrowing interest costs us transactions with the imf give rise to budget expenditure only as cash is actually transferred to the imf transfers to the imf enter the us budget s interest costs they increase the treasurys borrowing requirement that is treasurys ne ed to sell securities and thus they increase interest costs conversely receipts from the imf reduce the borrowing requirement this in turn results in decrease in the imputed inter est costs associated with the effect of the transaction on the treasurys borrowing requirement estimated intere st costs are however not just affected by the amount borrowed but also obviously by us domestic interest rates the net effect of us transactions with the imf on us borrowing costs s varied over the years they reflect the pattern of us transactions with the imf and ultimately the pattern of imf lending thus for example when the united state s itself borrowed from the imf in november 197 8 it received an inflow of dollars and hence us borrowing requirements were reduced on the other hand this wa s somewhat offset beginning in 1977 by loans that the united states made to the imf under the supplementary financing facility sff or the witteveen facility as shown in figure 1 after the onset of the third world debt crisis in 1982 us transfers of dollars to the imf fo r use in the latters loan operation s accelerated fund credit outstandin g peaked for the decade in 1985 fac t reflected in the increase of us borrowing costs attributable to the imf in the late 1980s repayments made b developing countries that had borrowe d earlier from the imf reduced transfers of dollars by the united states to the imf improved the cash position of the us treasury and correspondingly reduce d associated borrowing costs fund credit outstanding declined until 1990 when i t again accelerated in the wake of th emergence of market economies i n eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union imf lendin g increased by nearly one quarter between 1994 and 1995 with the increase more than accounted for by imf loans to just two countries mexico and russia the data that are available indicate that from july 1 1969 through december 31 1982 the estimated cost of treasury borrowing attributable to the imf amounted to 1753 million or an

attributable to us participation during the period was 41 billion data from the two periods lead to the following conclusions cumulative net debt outstan ding attributable to transactions with the imf was significant ly lower at the end of january 1991 than at the end of decembe r 1982 having declined from about 6772 million to 4617 million decline of nearly onethird cumulative net debt arising from transactions with the imf also declined as percentage of total us government debt outstanding from less than 05 during us fiscal year 1982 to less than 02 at the end of calendar yea r 1990 and finally although the fiscal periods differed the average annual net debt outstandin g more than doub led between the two periods from 1938 million us fiscal year basis to 4117 million imf fiscal year basis the impact of us transactions with the imf on the us ne t debt position is the counterpart to us borrowing costs and thus likewise mirrors us transaction s with the fund again in the earlier period the united states as borrower wa s receiving funds from th imf in the later period it was lender by the late 1980s the united states was being paid back for imf use of its quota following the 198 2 debt crisis but the surge of lending to easter n europe and the former republics of the soviet union had just begun it is also not surpris ing that the average annual net debt outstanding was higher in the later period again reflecting the us shift fro m borrower to lender at the time this report was written the us treasury department had t provided data for the period since january 1991 to the us congress receipts from the imf interest remuneration and refunds interest costs sustained as result of us treasury borrowing in connectio n with us transactions with the imf re offset by receipts from the imf these arise from interest that the united states receives on any loans that have been extended to the imf such as under the general arrangements to borrow gab11 and potentially under the proposed nab httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98412crs7 since may 1986 the financial consequences of overdue obligations to the imf have been12 shared between debtor and creditor member countries this

inflow into the general treasury that reduce borrowin g requirements and hence interest expense the largest source of us receipts from the imf is remuneration that is interest paid on the socalled remunerated reserve position the remunerate d reserve tranche position is derived from the reserve tra nche onefourth of the us quota or capital contribution to the imf is paid into the imf immediately in sdr s from the exchange stabilization fund esf the fund used by the us treasury to stabilize the international value of the us dollar this reserve tranche i s13 considered to be part of an imf members international reserve assets hence th name members may draw upon their reserve tranche immediately an d unconditionally upon representation of balanceofpayments need the reserv tranche therefore is liquid asset for imf members and liquid liability for the imf itself in 1978 the united states experiencing substantial pressure on the external value of the dollar made reserve t ranche drawing of sdr 2275 million 3 billion from the imf in addition to immedi ate payment of the reserve tranche the united states also presents the imf with noninterest bearing letter of credit on the treasury general account for the balance 75 of the quota contribution except for small amount 14 of 1 that is in the form of dollar demand deposit this is also part of the imfs capital but operates much like credit line it is activated by the imf as i t needs dollars in its financial operations as the letter of credit is drawn upon by the imf in order to use us dollars in its loan operations the funds holdings of dollars as represe nted by the unused balance under the letter of credit decrease and concomitantly the us reserve position in the fund expands similarly as im f drawings under the letter of c redit are paid back the us reserve position contracts the remunerated reserve tranche is not equal to the reserve tranche the exact definition of the remunerated reserve position is technical matter the phras refers to the amount by which the funds holdings of members currency are s than the members norm the norm in turn is defined as an amount equal to 75 percent of the members

sdr 8405 million the us norm therefore currently equals sdr 2442555 million or about 921 of the total us quota in the imf with each successive quota increase the norm moves closer to 100 percent of quota in calculating the level of the funds holdings of members currency the imf excludes currencies held in working balances imf 2 accounts that it uses t handle its administrative expenses and receipts in member countries when they ar equal to less than 110 of 1 of members quota in the case of the united states this threshold for exclusion of working balance is quite high at sdr 265 millio n current ly about 344 million it is undoubtedly safe therefore to assume tha t working balances in the united states constitute excluded currency holdings th imf manages i ts working balances in such way as to minimize them even or perhaps especially in the case of the united states where it is headquartered additionally currency holdin gs that reflect members borrowings from the imf are excluded this does not apply to the united states which is not borrower figure 3 provide s two graphic examples f the us remunerate d reserve position in th leftside example th us reserve position i s exactly

remunerated reserve tranche position which is calculated d aily it is paid quarterly at the sdr interest rate adjusted for burden sharing which for example retroactively for the first quarter of 1998 reduced the rate of remuneration by 20 basis points the sdr interest rate is based on th weighte d average of interest rates on the threemonth paper of the five countrie s whose currencies are included in the sdr basket the united states japan germany the united kingdom and france thus the sdr interest rate is market based because interest rates on some of the constituent currencies notably th japanes yen are lower than us interest rates the sdr interest rate is currentl below us interest rates the sdr interest rate for example during the wee k beginning april 6 1998 was 426 during the period july 1 196 9 through d ecember 31 1982 interest and remuneration received from the im f amounted to 90 5 million of which 225 million was attributable to us loans t the imf and 680 million was

impact of the final category of u s transactions with the imf valuation gains and losses varies from year to year according to the movement of the exchange rat between the us dollar and the sdr all imf accounts are denominated in sdrs since july 1 1974 the imf has set the value of the sdr in terms of basket of currencies as result of this method of sdr valuation however the dollar value of the us quota in the imf fluctuates under the rules and regulations of the fund imf members must maintain the tota l value of the funds holdings of their currenci constant in terms of the sdr stated another way the purchasing power of the sdr must be maintained settlements to maintain the dollar value of the us quota result in foreign exchange losses or gains for the us government valuation settlem ents in which the member country either makes payment to or receives payment from the imf are made at least annually at the end of th imfs fiscal year april 30 they are made through valuation adjustment account that is part of the imfs holdings of members currency whether or not valuatio n adjustment payment is required i s determined from the point of view of the imfs accounts whose value in dolla r terms is being maintained thus n appreciation of the us dolla r internationally means that the sdr i s falling in dollar terms or stated ye t another way each sdr commands fewer dollars decreasing the d ollar value of the us quota in the imf thus stron g us dollar results in valuatio n adjustment payment to the imf budgetary outlay as shown in figure 5 for example in 1985 when the dollar was strong internationally the sdr wa s correspondingly weak worth about 99 the united states experienced valuation losses against the sdr amounting to 569 million as shown in appendix table 4 conversely when the dollar is declinin g internationally and thus also against the sdr the dollar value of the us quota is increasing and the us receives valuation adjustment payment from the imf an example to clarify how currency movements affect the valuation settlement i s presented in appendix ii at the end of this report valuation gains and losses arise out of the market value of the us dollar and the other constituent currenci of the sdr the german mark the japanese yen the british pound and the french franc since the us dollar is the largest component of the sdr valuation gains and

thus has major stake in the internatio nal monetary system this dominance is reflected in the structure of th imf the imf is creature of the major industrial countries including the unite d states its largest sharehold er the united states accounts for 1825 of the quotas and 1778 of the votes in the imf this position has given it veto over nearly all major policy decisions of the imf including quota increases allocation of sdrs and sale of gold and it has also given the united states major voice in all imf loa n programs deciding one in the support programs that have been developed in th wake of major financial crise s notably for latin america in the 1980s for mexico in 1995 and for asia in 1997 u s international economic policy and imf policy have been deeply intertwined if the united states has not achieved substantial benefit s from the imf over its 52year history then to great extent it is also us policy that has failed conclusions us budgetary conventions governing transactions with the imf provide that expenditures outlays for the imf are offset by the increased us reserve position in the imf these are considered to be an exchange of assets the transaction s themselv therefore have net impact on the budgetary position of the unite d states whether it is in deficit or in surplus expenditures in connection with us participation in the fund however d bring about three other types of financial flows that enter the budget an increase or decrease in the treasurys interest costs receipts from the imf mostly from interest remuneration earned on it s reserve tranche position and foreign exchange gains and losses during the 18year period that has been the primary focus of this report th impact of these flo ws on the us financial picture has been modest from april 30 1980 to april 30 1997 these transactions resulted cum ulatively in an inflow into the us budget of 13 billion or an annual average of 73 million in imf fiscal year 1997 ending april 30 they amounted to 11 billion outflow the second larges t outflow after 1996 in the 18year period the 1997 outflow was well under 0 1 percent of total us fiscal year expenditures of 1601 billio n or less than 02 percent of discretionary expenditures of 548 billion more importantly the bulk of thi s18httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98412crs14 continued18 budget of the united states government fiscal year 1999 p 12outflow was attributable to foreign exchange losses which were equivalent to 8 9 percent of the total outflow indeed in virtually every year during the 18year period the major determinant of the net financial gain or loss arising from us participation in the imf was attributable to valuation gains or losses that is to exchange rat movements during the 18year period the implied interest cost s of us treasury borrowing exceeded interest remuneration and other payments received from the imf by cumulative 227 million or an annual average of 126 million after contributing to reduction of us treasury bor rowing costs in 1980 and 1981 the united states sustained interests costs in the following 16 years both estimated us treasur interest costs and receipts from the i mf were at their highest level in 1985 that is at the height of the latin american debt crisis implied interest costs in 1997 were at the second highest level for the period us treasury interest costs are affected both by the amount borrowed and by us domestic interest rates they are not fully offset by receipts from the imf for three reasons 1 the composite sdr interest rate is lower than us domestic interest rates notably because of particularly low japanese domestic rates 2 the reserv tranche position is not fully remunerated and 3 there is an adjustment to the imfs rate of remuneration for burdensharing that is for countries in arrears to the imf figures for net debt attributable to transactions with the imf are available only for the period up to january 1991 the impact of imf transactions on the us governments net debt position varied during the period within the context of th total us debt picture however the impact of transactions with the imf was als modest with the 46 billion outstan ding at the end of calendar year 1990 amounting to less than 02 of total us government debt outstanding given that transactions with the im f have limited impact on the total financial picture of the us government it would appear that assessments of the role an d programs of the imf are the more important policy issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98412crs15 appendix i table 1 estimated us treasury borrowing

calculated in two ways in order to keep the dollar value of the us quota the same in terms of the sdr at the end of ap ril 30 1997 as it was at the end of april 30 1996 as imf rule s require the valuation adjustme nt is calculated as follows from the pointofview of imf accounts 1in terms of the sdr april 30 1996 sdr1145006 sdr2653 billion x 145006 3847 billion april 30 1997 sdr1136553 sdr2653 billion x 136558 3623 billion as shown in figure 3 the sdr depreciated against the dollar that is each sd r bought fewer dolla rs on april 30 1997 about 137 than on april 30 1996 about 145 valuation payment would be made to the imf to maintain the dollar value of the us quota which has fallen in terms of the us dollar looked at from the pointofview of us government acc ounts however the dollar appreciated against the sdr thus the valuation adjustment would b calculated as follows 2 in terms of the us dollar april 30 1996 1sdr 068963 sdr 2653 billion sdr 068963 3847 billion april 30 1997 1sdr 073232 sdr 2653 billio n sdr 073232 3623 billion the us doll ar appreciated against the sdr thus each dollar bought more sdrs on april 30 1997 about sdr 073 than on april 30 1996 about sdr 069 the dollar value of the us quota in the imf would however have fallen from 3847 billion to 3623 billion loss by either method the united states hypothetically had to pay valuatio n adjustment to the imf of 224 billion in order to maintain the value of its quot constant between april 30 1996 and april 30 1997 in fact this would not hav been the amount of the adjustment the dolla r value of the us quota has to be kept constant from the effective date of the last quota increase on november 11 1991 the above calculation is for illustrative purposes only as appendix table 3 shows the united states actually had valuation loss of 876 million during imf fiscal year 1997 ending april 30httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98412crs21 appendix iii articles of agreement of the international monetary fund article i
