drought in the southeast has brought congressional attention to an ongoing interstate conflict among alabama florida and georgia over water allocation in the apalachicolachattahoocheeflint acf rive r system drawdown of lake lanier the uppermost federal reservoir in the acf basin in fall 2007 to support minimum flows in the lower basins apalachicola river escalated the conflict the atlanta metropolitan areas municipa l and industrial water us ers are concerned about drawdown of their principal in some cases their only water supply they question the justification for the minimum flow requirements lower basin stakeholders are concerned about sustaining river flows to meet their municipa l electricity and ecosystem needs and are questioning the sufficiency of georgias municipal industrial and agricultural water conservation efforts the issue for the us army corps of engineers corps is how to manage federal reservoirs to equ itably meet upper and lower ba multipurpose water needs especially during drought the challenge is complying with federal law eg the endangered species act minimizing harm to the river and apalachicola bay species ecosystems and oyster industry and providing flows for hydropower and thermoelectric cooling while also providi ng municipal and i ndustrial water supply security the corps challenge has increas ed as basin water demands have increased eg water supply to support the growing tlanta metro area agricultures increased reliance on irrigation and ecosystem and sp ecies needs creating conflicts between water in storage and flows for instream purposes is the acf harbinger of conflicts between implement ation and other water uses across the nation is the acf testing ground for both federal rive r management and resource allocation

raised about the relationship between climate change and the possibility for increased drought and other changes to the hydrologic cycle increasing temperatures from climate change are expected to result in future hydrologic chan ges but there are major uncertainties in making detailed projections of those changes at the scal of drainage basins such as the acf basin see for example the intergovernmenta l panel on climate change working group ii report p 201 at h ttp wwwipccwg2orgacf primer federal dams regulate for multiple uses the acf basin drains areas of norther n and western

limited storage is primarily for flow regulation and does not func tion as water storage re servoir for acf operational purposes these four facilitie s and other nonfederal dams in the acf also house hydroelectric facilities the fifth federal dam andr ews dam is operated for navigation and has storage capacity water storage facilities have been built on the flint river2 water resource use in the acf has change d since the planning and construction of the reservoirs which originally we re justified based on their navigation hydropower and flood control benefits for example the atlanta metro area has developed into significant economic nd population center basin agriculture has become more dependent on irrigation and environmental quality and species concerns receive greater public attention and federal protections these and other factors have increased competition for acf waters and produced conflicting interests in maintaining water in storage and maintaining river flows for instream purposes reservoir drawdown and minimum flows it is often difficult to recognize when drought is starting and it is challenging to make decisions that entail tradeoffs be tween current and futu re costs and benefits based on expectations about when drought may end3 the current drought is already eclipsing conditions experienced by georgia during the mid1950s which is considered the states most severe drought on record httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34326crs4 4 testimony by brigadier general joseph schroedel corps south atlantic division commander before the us senate committee on

ie and agricultural uses and instream flow requirements eg for species and thermo electric power plant cooling purposes water stored in the reservoirs was released to meet these needs the lower basin reservoirs were drawn down first in late summer 2007 lake lanier was the only reservoir with significant remaining storage when the corps released water from lake lanier in the upper basin to provide minimum flows in the apalachicola river in the lower basin the lake experienced significant drawdown surpassing the reservoirs previous record low and triggeri ng urgent concern from lake lanier water users and recreati onal interests lake lanier water storage is of critical concern because it provides 72 of the water supply for the atlanta metro area nd more than 62 of the storage space in federal acf reservoirs but refills slowly the drainage area feeding the lake is only 5 of the acf basin4 lake laniers drawdown escalated the c onflict among the three states without water allocation agreement or decision to guide distribution of available supply among the states lower basin stakeholde rs began questioning the sufficiency of georgias municipal industr ial and agricultural long term and emergency water conservation and demand management efforts upper basin stakeholders questioned the justification for the minimum flow requirements in the apalachicola river and cited the corps operating procedures wh ich had been adopted in 2006 to protect threatened and endangered species as significantly increasing the risk of depleting acf reservoirs by allowing their draw down and insufficient opportunity for refill tristate water conflict in the 1970s and 1980s georgia official s became increasingly concerned with water supply for the atlanta metro areas growing needs the corps in 1989 agreed to provide storage space for roughly twice as much water in lake lanier by reallocating space from hydropower to wa ter supply this decision resulted in alabama and florida suing the corps based on the impact that the reallocation would have on the lower basin and for failure to comply with national environmental policy act nepa 42 usc 4321 et seq5 see appendix for an introduction to selected acf suits in fede ral courts and the hi story of efforts to establish an acf compact for discussi on of how nepa relates to current acf operations see appendix b the reallocation question has yet to be resolved since this first suit acf waters have b een the foundation of multiple ongoing legalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34326crs5 6 generally interstate compacts which create binding agreement between two or more states require congressional approval in addition to approval by the states involved in the agreement us const art i 10 cl 3 7 the us supreme court has original jurisdic tion to hear disputes between states us const art iii 2 cl 1 in the case of the acf litigation state has sued another state and therefore the cases must be heard first by lower courts 8 congress may apportion interstate waters under its power to regulate interstate commerce see us const art i 8 cl 3 arizona v california 373 us 546 1963 although congress has the authority to act in the inte rest of interstate commerce congressional allocation in such conflicts is rare 9 the riparian system of water rights generally applies to individuals use of water from shared waterways the supreme court has established federal common law method of resolution known as equitable apportionment when disputes between states come before the court equitable apportionment decisions attemp t to balance the benefits and right to use the water among the states involved see kansas v colorado 206 us 46 1907 colorado v new mexico 459 us 176 1982disputes and the subject of tristate water compact that failed when the states could not agree on how to allocate basin waters when states are the parties disputing water allocation the conflict may be resolved by agreement in an interstate compact6 through apportionment by the courts7 or through allocation by congress8 the water rights doctrines operating in the acf states makes allocation particularly challenging alabama florida and georgia like most eastern states generally follow riparian water rights doctrine which permits those whose lands border waters to use them in way that is reasonable relative to other users when the water quantities are insufficient to meet all reasonable needs all users are to reduce their usage proportionally9 in contrast most western states follow prior appropr iation doctrine whic h provides superior right to those who first put the water to use when quantities are insufficient to meet all needs those with the superior right receive their allocation first and others receiving their share in order of priority because the acf states follow the riparian rights doctrine their relative rights to use the water are not determined by priority during drought how to resolve water alloca tion during drought in riparian context has few precedents thus contributing to the challenge of the three states in successfully negotiating water allocation compact the three states most recently failed at such an effort in 2003 see appendix federal and state roles in the acf the federal government s authority under the commerce clause of the us constitution to manage the nations water resources but it recognizes the states authority to allocate and use water within their jurisdictions federal laws often require federal agencies engaged in water resources management to defer to state laws or cooperate with state officials in implementing federal laws although state generally has broad authority over waters within its border exercise of its intrastate authority cannot entirely dismiss the interest s of other states in the case of the acf although the three states have authority over their waters fede ral investments were built and are operated for multiple purposes thus affecting the states water usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34326crs6 10 the iop is integrated into the agencys environmental assessment interim operations plan for support of ndangered and threatened species jim woodruff dam october 2006 available at http wwwsamusacearmymilacf 20water20resources20 managementjwdsect7jwd_io p_fonsi_eaiopfinaleapdf 11 the use of inflow into reservoirs rather than unimpaired runoff in the basin to guide operations is contentious because inflow does not account for consumptive uses that might continuedthat is the basins federa l dams regulate the flow s of the chattahoochee and apalachicola rivers thereby shaping the stat water use federal laws also shape dam operations most recently protection of species protected under the federal has become significant factor in acf dam operations additiona lly certain federal actions must be reviewed under nepa acf reservoir operations corps operations plans as consequence of the extensive acf litigation and the absence of an agreement on allocating water among the three states the corps operates the acf dams based on piecemeal guidance that has not received comprehensive analysis review or comment that is curre nt operations are conducted under 2007 exceptional drought modification to 2006 interim plan for woodruff da m that amended the 1989 draft plan for the tire acf as explained below in june 1990 the corps began opera ting the acf under its october 1989 draft apalachicolachattahoocheeflint basin water control plan wcp the 1989 wcp has not been finalized due to litiga tion and expectations before 2003 for negotiated agreement on trist ate water allocation under the wcp the corps largely operated the reservoirs to meet the multiple uses in the basin while maximizing the quantity of stored water the wcp established operational zones for the federal reservoir these operational zones signaled to the corp s how to manage reservoir releases based on changing storage vol umes over the course of the year with the failure of the compact negotiations the corps had to address the issues in the lower basin without trist ate water allocation agreement after years of informal communications and months of formal consultation with the us fish and wildlife service fws the corps adopt ed the interim operations plan iop for woodruff dam in october 200610 the plan is interim until an updated comprehensive acf water control plan is adopted the iop added new instream apalachicola river flow requi rements for protection of threatened and endangered species to the corps acf operational decision criteria the iop established minimum flows in the apalachicola river based on different inflow rates into acf reservoirs the iop therefore left in place the operational zones of the 1989 wcp but constrained the corps operations by requiring it to meet minimum flow requirements in both normal and dry conditions under the iop the corps would make releases from reservoir storage to m eet instream flow requirements if inflow into the reservoirs was insufficient to support the minimum flows11 in sum the iophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34326crs7 11 continued occur above reservoir

is not especially common in the consultation process it has occurred before eg spotted owls and the northwest forest plan on the other hand tradeoffs in general are very common in the consultation process examples would include direct bitat protection less in one area more acquired in another great er intrusion outside nesting season and less intrusion during it more public access if access is more carefully controlled etc at issue with the edo is not tradeoff per but the degree to which the current clear harm to continuedresulted in both the 1989 wcp operationa l zones and the iop minimum flows guiding corps acf operations during 2007 the iop is the subject of litigation see appendix and of upper basin interests criticisms of the corps reservoir mana gement during 2007 they argue that the lake lanier drawdown in 2007 unde r the iop created an unnecessary risk of system storage depletion in an effort to provide minimum flows that have not been scientifically justified ot hers argue that system stor age should be used to support species during dry conditions because the acf ecosystems and species have been compromised by the cumulative longterm impacts of federal reservoir management and the basins municipal industr ial and agricultural water use exceptional drought operations november 2007june 2008 lower minimum flows and more reservoir refill on november 15 2007 the corps began operating under an ex ceptional drought operations edo modification to the iop the corps proposed the edo on november 1 2007 and requested an expedited consultation and biological opinion by the fws to determine whether the edo would jeopardiz any of the four listed species the biological opinion hereafte r referred to as the biop for the edo approved the edo through june 1 2008 with some stipulations12 see further discussion in crs report rl34440 apalachicolachattahoocheeflint drought species and ecosystem management by m lynne corn et the significance of the edo was that by reducing the minimum flow requirement for the apalachicola river more water was stored in basin reservoirs the edo also largely lifted operational guidelines of the iop until reservoir storage significantly refilled the edo therefor reduced the rate of drawdown as dry conditions persisted and allowed reservoirs to refill more quickly as climate conditions improved one justification provided for the lower minimum flows was to lessen the risk of much lower flows in later months or years if the drought continues in effect the edo risked some harm to the species now to reduce the risk of greater harm later13 the effects of the lower flows on electricity generation alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34326crs8 13 continued species is balanced by potential future benefits were raised as concern and are discussed in detail in appendix c as discussed there the edo does not appear to have caused significant immediate harm to electricity generation or grid reliability as stipulated by the biop for the edo the corps and fws subsequently agreed upon triggers for how the corps was to reduce flows from the previous low of 5000 cfs cubic feet per second in the apal achicola river to 4750 cfs then 4500 cfs the corps and fws reportedly will consider triggers for reductions to 4150 cfs in late spring 2008 when data ar available and if the situa tion warrants as of mid to late spring 2008 flows in the apalachicol river had yet to be reduced below 4750 cfs due to winter rains the winter rains have refilled the lower basin reservoirs and have improved lake lanier storage but not dramatically largely due to the lakes small drainage area proposed modified interim operations plan june 2008 until water control plan is revised on april 15 2008 the corps submitted to fws proposal to modify its iop thus eliminating the temporary edo by incorporating elements of the edo and other changes into modified iop miop biological opinion on the proposal is anticipated by june 1 2008 the modified iop proposal includes provisions to store additional wa ter during the winter and during drought periods and to release more during spawning periods the intent is to avoid storage reaching levels that would trigger the lowering of the apalachicola river minimum flows from 5 000 cfs to 4500 cfs the corps proposal is to store 50 of basin inflow instead of 30 this would be accomplished by eliminating minimum flow of 6500 cfs during wetter peri ods making fish spawn releases dependent on the storage level and switching from two season to threeseason operation regime water control plan revision during the 20072008 winter the corps began revising its water control manua l for the acf reservoirs the omnibus consolidated appropriations act 2008 p l 110161 in 134 division c title i prohibits the implementation of ne w water control manual but not its development and requires the corps to provide data on ba withdrawals use and stream flow by september 2008 the corps plans to spend 1 million on the update in fy2008 the corps estimates that it will take two to three years to draft revised plan when administration efforts to br oker tristate agreement by march 1 2008 failed the corps revision acquired additional significance as mechanism for determining future operations in the absence of tristate agreement and in the midst of litigation water supply issues municipal and industrial and agricultural consumptive use of water reduces the amount of water available in the basin for other uses including instream flows efforts to reduce water consumption through conservation

well as for the original authorized purposes lake lanier and its releases also supply water to the atlanta metro area to what degree the corps operates the reservoirs for water supply is the subject of litigation see appendix the corps principally cites the wate r supply act of 1958 43 usc 390b as its authorization to make water supply storage space at corps facilities available for purposes the act does not authorize the corps to sell or allocate quantities of water the contracts are for space in the reservoir and do not guarantee fixed quantity of water the corps delivers the water if it is available in the storage space without significantly affecting the authoriz ed purposes of the corps project the act also does not authorize the corps to make significant modifications to its projects in order to provide for water supply the majority of the water being provided from lake lanier is being delivered under temporary holdover contracts because earlier contracts expired in 1990 the corps

demand management th plan does not encompass measures to control long term water demand related to population growth nor does it contain significant measures to manage the demand of the indus trial and agricultural sectors this is limitation typical of state drought plans consequently with continued population and agricultural growth in georgia the stat drought risk is increasing even though the adoption and implementa tion of the drought plan is an improvement from 2000 some acf stakeholders have criticized georgia for not taking more emergency conservation actions and for not fully comp

adverse impacts to listed species especially the listed mussel species are reasonably certain to occur as flows on the apalachicola river drop below 5000 cfs51 among the issues mentioned in the rationale for adopting the edos lower minimum flows was reducing the demand for storage in order to have greater assu rance of future ability to sustain flows for listed species during severe multiyear drought as currently being experienced in the acf basin52 in essence the proposal was th at the listed species would face reduced water flow this year to reduce risk s in later years if the

major operational change on its face and therefore under the water supply act required prior congressi onal approval78 because congress did not authorize the change the court ruled that the agreement could not be enforced79 florida and alabama also claimed that th agreement violated the flood control act and nepa but the court did not reach those issues the georgia i case in 2000 the governor of

the summer of 2008122 if scholz needs to shut down there do not appear to be any transmission constraints in the area that would prev ent power from being delivered from other generating plants however the cost of purchased power or generation from other southern company assets may be more expensive than generation from scholz and farley also the reduction in reserve margins from taking plant scholz and other generating plants off line could create reliability concerns especially during the peak summer season
