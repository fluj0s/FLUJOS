public wa ter systems finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking wa ter regulations and to protect public health under the program states receive capitalization grants to make loans to water systems for drinking water projects and certain other sdwa activities since fy1997 congress has provided more than 103 billion for this program including 829 million for fy2008 as of june 2007 the dwsrf program had provided total of 126 billion in assistance and supported 5346 projects the environmental protection agencys pas latest 2003 survey of capital improvement needs for

noncompliance with sdwa requirements unless these systems meet certain conditions to return to compliance systems owned by federal ag encies are not eligible although the law authorizes assistance to privately owned community water systems some states have laws or policies that preclude privately owne d utilities from receiving dwsrf assistance the 1996 amendments authorized appropr iations for

to reimburse states for operator training and certification cost s if separate funding is not provided under section 1419 of the sdwa epa reserved the full amount for several years but reserved none after fy2003 as state training programs had matured to provide technical assistance to small systems epa may reserve up to 2 with 15 million cap however funding for this activity is provided under sec tion 1442 and epa has not set aside funds for this purpose4 the law also includes several setasides and directives that apply to states these provisions offer states flexibility in tailoring their individual dwsrf programs to address state priorities they also demonstrate the emphasis that the 1996 amendments placed on enhancing compliance especially among smaller systems the act requires states to make available at least 15 of thei r annual allotment for loan assi stance to systems that serve 10000 or fewer persons to the extent that the funds can be obligated to eligible projects the act also allows states to use up to 30 of their dwsrf grant to provide additional assistance such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans to help economically disadvantaged communities as determined by the state among other optional setaside provisions stat may reserve as much as 4 of their dwsrf allotment to cover the costs of administering the dwsrf program and an additional portion to help pay the costs of other mandates added by the 1996 law specifically states may set aside as much as 10 for combination of the following public water system supervision programs technical assistance through source water protection programs state capacity developm ent strategies and operator certification programs to use dwsrf funds for these pur poses states must match these expenditures with an equal amount of state funds states may use an additional 2 of funds to provide technical assistance to system s that serve 10000 or fewer pers ons states also have the option of using as much as 15 for combination of the following loans for the acquisition of land or conser vation easements loans to implement voluntary source water protection measures technical and financial assistance to systems as part of capacity development strategy and velopment and implementati on of ground water protection programs expenditures may not exceed 10 for any one of these activities other sdwa provisions include funding authority fo r several of these pr ograms and activities to further enhance public water system compliance the 1996 amendments added new capacity development and operator certifica tion requirements the law required epa to withhold part of the dwsrf grant from an state that did not meet these mandates section 1420 required states to establish capacity development programs that include 1 legal authority or other means to ensure th at new systems have th technical financial and managerial capacity to meet sdwa requirements and 2 strategy to assist existing systems that are experiencing difficulties in coming into compliance states also were required to adopt programs for training nd certifying operators of community and non transient

816r05001 available online at httpwwwepagovsafewaterneedshtmlcongress designed the dwsrf program to give states implementation flexibility congress gave states flexibility to set priorities between the sdwa and clean water act srf programs to accommodate the divergent drinking water and wastewater needs and priorities among the states the law authorized states to transfer as much as 33 of the annual dwsrf allotment to the cwsrf or an equivalent amount from the cwsrf to the dwsrf the statute authorized th transfers through fy2001 in 2000 epa recommended that congress continue to aut horize transfers between the srf programs to give states flexibility to address their most pressing water infrastructure needs subsequent conference reports for epa appropriations have au thorized states to continue transferring funds between these programs drinking water infrastructure needs sdwa section 1452h requires epa to assess the capital improvement needs of eligible public water systems and to report to congress every four years concurrently and in consultation with the indian health service and indian tribes epa must assess needs for drinking water treatme nt facilities to serve indian tribes section 1452i epa is required to distribute the dwsrf funds to the states based on the results of the latest needs survey eligible systems include approximately 53000 comm unity water systems and 21400 notforprofit noncommunity water systems epa conducted its third survey of capital improvement needs for public water systems in 20035 based on this survey epa estimates that systems need to invest 2768 billion on drinking water infrastructure improvements over 20 years to comply with drinking water regulations andor to ensu re the provision of safe water this amount exceeds the 2001 needs survey estimate of 1655 billion in 2003 dollars by more than 60 the 2003 survey includes funds needed for compliance with several recent regulations including the re vised arsenic and radium rule s and pending rules for radon and other contaminants it also identified 1 billion in securityrelated needs also water systems made efforts to improve reporting of needs for infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement which epa determined had b een underreported in the previous surveys of the total national need of 2768 billi on 1605 billion 60 is currently needed to ensure the provision of safe drinking water epa notes that current need typically involves installing upgrading or replacing in frastructure to allow system to continue to deliver safe drinking water and that sy stems with current needs are usually not in violation of drinking water standard epa reports that lthough all of the infrastructure projects in the needs assessment promote th health objectives of the act 451 billion 16 of the total is attributable to sdwa regulations while 237 billion 84 represents nonregulatory costs eg rou tine replacement of ba sic infrastructure the survey presents the 20year

needed to obtain safe water supplies including rehabilitation and inst allation of wells accounts for 128 billion of total 20year needs for further perspective the needs survey breaks down the 20year needs estimates according to system size and ownership large systems serving more than 50000 people account for 1229 billion of total 20year n eed medium systems serving from 3301 to 50000 people account for 1030 b illion and small systems serving 3300 or fewer people account for 342 billion notforpro fit noncommunity water systems have estimated needs of 34 billion american i ndian and alaska native village water systems have estimated 20year needs of 13 billion and 12 billion respectively epa notes that the total needs estimate may be conservative for several reasons 1 systems are required to meet stringent documentation criteria when identifying needs 2 many systems did not fully understand their s ecurity needs at the time of the assessment 3 capital improvement plans often cover fewer than 10 years while the survey tries to capture 20year estimates and 4 the survey is limited to eligible needs thus excluding projects related to dams raw water reservoirs fire protec tion operation and maintenance and future growth other needs assessments have also b een prepared including epas 2002 gap analysis this study identified potential f unding gaps between projected needs and spending from 2000 through 2019 epa estimated potential 20year funding gap for drinking water capital and operations and maintenance ranging from 45 billion to 263 billion depending on different scenarios6 for more information on this study and other needs assessments see crs report rl31116 water infrastructure needs and investment review and analysis of key issues by claudia copeland and mary tiemann program issues with the authorization of the dwsrf prog ram congress acted to help public water systems finance infrastructure projects needed to achieve or maintain compliance with sdwa requirements and protect public health while this federalstate program provides an important means for addressing drinking water needs substantial gap remains between financing needs and available f unds the 2003 needs survey identified 2768 billion in drinking water infrastructure needs over 20 years while the dwsrf program was authorized at 96 billion over seven year s the appropriated amounts augmented by the state match leveraging repayments and interest earnings have created significant financing capacity among the state dwsrfs however many expect funding gap to persist and new sdwa requirements are expected to drive up future estimates of needs other sdwa mandates are ligible for dwsrf funding and heighten competition for these resources the dwsrf program em braces competing objectives and thus this competition is perhaps unavoidable on th one hand the fundamental purpose of the program is to capitalize revolving funds in th states in order to generate perpetual source of funding for drinking water project s on the other nd congre ss authorizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22037crs6 multiple setasides to fund other drinking wa ter program priorities and requirements such as system compliance capacity assurance operator certificati on and small system technical assistance overall states may use as much as 31 of their grant for the set asides and 30 to provide loan subsidies to economically disadvantaged communities while these options offer states flexibility to tailor their programs to meet individual needs using funds for these activities could si gnificantly erode the corpus of state funds and slow the rate at which they become capitalized concern for states is that to the degree that congress relies on the dwsrf to fund other sdwa requirements instead of providing separate appropriations the potential of the dwsrf program is diminished separate issue is the need for communities to address drinking water infrastructure needs that are outside the scope of the dwsrf program communities typically must address several categor ies of infrastructure requirement s unrelated to sdwa compliance and thus ineligible for dwsrf assistance these categories include future growth ongoing rehabilitation and opera tion and maintenance of syst ems epa has reported that outdated and deteriorated dri nking water infrastructure pos fundamental longterm threat to drinking water safety and that in many communities basic infrastructure costs can far exceed sdwa compliance costs lthough the dwsrf program does not address certain categories of needs and exclude s many noncommunity water systems from coverage with this program c ongress has added major tool to the mix of federal state and local initiatives intended to help commun ities ensure the safety of water supplies ongoing drinking water infrastructure issu include the gap between funding and estimated needs the growing cost of complyin g with sdwa standards particularly for small communities the ability of small or economically disadvantaged communities to afford dwsrf financing and the broader need for cities to maintain upgrade and expand infrastructure unrelated to sdwa compliance despite congressional interest in recent years budgetary constraints have posed challenges to efforts to enact water infrastructure funding legislation in the face of large needs scarce federal resources and debate over the federal role in funding water infrastruct ure epa states and utilities have increasingly focused on alternative management and financing strategies to address costs and promote greater financia l selfreliance among water sy stems strategies include establishing publicprivate pa rtnerships improving asset management and adopting full cost pricing for water services these approaches are improving the sustainability of water systems however they may be limited in their ability to fully meet needs particularly among poorer co mmunities and small water syst ems thus interest in infrastructure financing options and expanded federal ssistance continues in recent years house and senate committees have held hearings on the srf programs infrastructure needs and funding issues for four congresses the senate environment and public works committee has reported water infrastructure financing bill including s 3617 srept 110509 in the 110th congress similar to the committee bill from the 109th congress s 3617 would ve authorized increased funding for drinking water and wastewater srf programs authorizing 15 billion over five years for the dwsrf allowed new uses for the funds and would have created grant program for small or economically disadvantaged communities for critical water projects other reported drinking water infra structure bills included s 1933 srept 110475 to create grant program for small systems and s 199 srept 110476 to increase the authorization of appropr iations for water and wastewater grants for alaskas rural and native villages none of the bills was enacted
