45 million americans with feasible range of 11 to 48 million as the american population ages the number of people with ad is expected to increase dramatically to approximately 132 million affected individuals by 2050 range 80160 million medicare costs to treat person with ad are almost three times greater than the average for other beneficiaries and are anticipated to reach 493 billion by 2010 similarly costs to the medicaid program could increase from 182 billion in 2000 to 33 billion annually in less than 10 years the recent death of former president ronald reagan highlighted not only the challenges of providing health services to an ad pa tient but also the devastating impact the disease has on family caregivers since the late 1980s the dramatic incr ease in funding for ad research has rapidly expanded our understanding of the di sease however unlike other important chronic diseases we do not yet have any pr oven preventive interventions or effective treatments for curing ad in

diagnostic criteria an increase in awareness of the condition by physicians coroners or funeral director s who determine the underlying cause of death for the death certificate and in formal acceptance of the term alzheimers disease particularly large increase in 1999 was likely the result of the adoption of the 10th revision of the in ternational classification of diseases icd10 by the

and the chronic and longterm nature of ad will present unique challenges to the us health care system in the coming decades the failure of physicians particularly those in primary care where patients initially seek services and family members to recognize symptoms of dementia in the early stages is major barrier to appropriate care for many ad patients32 one study found that general practiti oners

opportunities for therapeutic interventions amyloid protein on microscopic level the ad brain is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neur ofibrillary tangles large protein called amyloid precursor protein app is broken down ie cleaved into smaller amyloid proteins called betaamyloid40 nd betaamyloid42 the number signifies how many amino acids ie the chemical building blocks of proteins are in each of these cleavage products betaamyloid42 is more likely to be in plaques and be toxic to cells app and its cleavage products may occur in normal cells and cerebrospinal fluid53 but their function is not known54 in alzheimers the betaamyloid produc t builds up around nerve cells in bad form known as betapleat ed sheet and eventually fo rms the characteristic plaque figure 4 the mechanisms of how the betaamyloid protein is allowed to accumulate are still unclear in some cases mutations in the app gene ie the genetic material that is the blueprint for the protein or abnorma l processing of the app by enzymes called secretases may resu lt in the overproducti on of betaamyloid in other instances the accumulation may be mediated by another unknown factor or may be

signs include the association of infl ammatory proteins w ith plaques and the accumulation and activation of microglial cells60 around the plaques while inflammation is normal response to injury or disease chronic inflammation can be harmful to tissues some researchers suggest that the infla mmatory proteins may be involved in the regulation of app synthesis nd actually aggravate the disease in this model the app is made and cleaved into the betaamyloid protein the toxic form of beta amyloid then activates microglial cells to produce inflammatory proteins the inflammatory proteins th stimulate produc tion of more app which then is converted to betaamyloid and so on even tually leading to the buildup of beta amyloid into plaque61 antiinflammatory medications regardless of the

other neurotransmitters which are deactivated by reuptake mechanism ach is broken down into inactive fragments by an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase glutamate glutamate is neurotransmitter that binds to another kind of receptor called the nmda nmethyldaspartate receptor when glutamate binds to the nmda receptor it triggers calcium to flow into the neuron calcium flow into and out of the neuron is important for depolar ization to occur for the brain to store information and function prope rly there must be balance between the levels of glutamate and calcium if there is not enough

identification of patients at greatest risk believing that earlier identification may afford earlier opportunities for intervention brain imaging structural imaging of the brain is generally

tests that show structur such as computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri gi ven that normal aging brains can have evidence of plaques and tangles some are questioning the value of imaging at least with the current state of technology in diagnosing early alzheimers without an effective treatment doctors are not likely to recommend using imaging to screen nonsymptomatic individuals for ad despite widespread availa bility and marketing by commercial firms123 some of the available ima ging techniques are discussed below computed tomography ct scanning uses special x ray equipment to produce cross sections of the body providing tailed images of organs bones and other tissues the crosssections eliminate much of the overlap of structures and increases the resolution of imaging over traditional xrays sometimes special dye is used to increase the contrast between soft and solid body parts the ct is used to evaluate the structure of the brain including an ssessment of its size ad may be indicated if brain atrophy ie shrinking is seen magnetic resonance imaging mri uses radiofrequency waves and strong magnetic field to provide remarkably clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues mri requires specialized equi pment and expertise and allows evaluation of some body structures that may not be as visible with other imaging methods124 the mri also evaluates brain structure and size while it can have better resolution than ct scan and does not use ionizing radiation other factors such as the effect on implanted metal electronic devices or the long time needed to capture an image may make mri less desira ble for some patients positron emission tomography pet scans produce images based on how the brain uses glucose sugar in pet scan

device functi onal tests such as pet and spect can complement structural tests like ct or mri despite promise for earlier diagnosis most current imaging studies are limited to detecting damage which s

to untangle the genetic and environmental infl uences of normal brain stru cture surprisingly many physical brain features such as the distribution of gray matter in the cerebral cortex are under significant gene tic control where there is genetic si milarity between individuals there is similarity in brain structure during the normal aging process and in certain disease processes126

which trait characteristic disease disorder or condition is transmitted from parent to child mutation in contrast to chromosome abnormality mutation is an individual change in dna sequence that accounts for genetic variations mutations may be harmful if they prevent genes from making normal gene products these mutations can cause or increase susceptibility to speci fic diseases or conditions mutation can be inherited from pe rsons parents or acquired from exposure to toxic environmental condition multifactorial multiple causes neocortex the neocortex is thin layer of nerve cells that covers the cerebral cortex top brain that is involved with higher brain functions such as learning neurofibrillary tangles neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic flame shaped structures in the ad brain the tangles are accumulations of abnormal forms of tau proteins which make up microtubules in normal nerve cell the microtubules are the microtubules are the struct ures that neurons use to carry substances within the body of the cell and to its many projections neurotransmitter neurotransmitter is chemical made by nerve cell that is used to transmit signals from one neuron to either another neuron or other cell such as skeletal muscle cell or heart muscle cell neuron another name for nerve cell peptide short or truncated protein pharmacogenetic variations that are inherited in persons dna that are associated with how that individual s body reacts to drugs studies in pharmacogenetics generally look for markers that will predict whether an individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32970crs41 will have an adverse reaction to drug but can also investigate other aspects of drug metabolism pharmacogenomic the entire complement of ge ne products that are expressed in association with an individuals r eaction to specific drugs studies in pharmacogenomics investigate many aspects of the drug metabolism process and many focus on identifying patterns of gene product expression that change in response to drug treatment and whether those changes indicate that the drug is working phenotype observable characteristics appearance of an individual that are determined by the interaction of genes gene products and the environment phenotypic testing identifies genetic variation by looking at the structure or function of gene products rather than looking directly at the gene plaques buildup of the abnormal form of betaamyloid in the brain which also contains various lipids and inflammatory proteins the buildup makes dark round spot in the brain tissue called the plaque polygenic multiple genes predictive testing testing currently healthy or asymptomatic individuals dna for variations that may be ssociated with future disease preimplantation diagnosis testing procedure performed on human eggs sperm or embryos before implantation in the ut erus to determine whether or not certain genetic disease conditions or traits are present prenatal diagnosis testing procedure done on cells that are shed from developing fetus usually between the th ird and fourth mont h of pregnancy to determine if the fetus has genetic disease condition or trait protein string of amino acids that form threedimensional structure to carry out the functions of cell proteins can be structural give the cell shape regulatory act to turn genes on or off or enzy matic cause biochemical reactions to occur secretase an enzyme or family of enzymes that are thought to cleave amyloid precursor protein into smaller peptides one of which is the betaamyloid peptide found in ad plaques stem cells unspecialized cells in an adult organism or embryo that have the potential to become differentiated into any kind of functional cell eg nerve muscle blood susceptibility possibility of disease caused or influenced by genotype most diseases result from complex set of both genetic and environm ental causes some harmful gene mutations increase the like lihood that person will develop specific disease
