partido popular rajoy firmly in control for now but must show results ref madrid 537 madrid 00000691 0012 of 002 1 u mariano rajoy the embattled head of spains main opposition partido popular pp was reelected as party leader on june 21 during the threeday pp congress held in valencia as reported in reftel rajoys leadership had been challenged on several fronts since his party lost second straight national election to president zapateros spanish socialist workers party psoe and it was unclear if he would be able to hold on to power over the past few weeks wouldbe challengers found insufficient support for their candidacy to unseat rajoy and faded back into the woodwork leaving rajoy to run unopposed he further distanced himself from the shadow of former president jose maria aznar by announcing younger more moderate party secretariat on june 19 that won plaudits from even leftleaning national newspapers and now appears to be basking in the glory of successfullycompleted party congress however many in spain believe rajoy has overcome only the first in long series of leadership battles in advance of the next round of national elections in 2012 and he will need to show positive results in offyear regional and european elections if he hopes to have third consecutive chance to grab the brass ring of the spanish presidency 2 u approximately 3025 pp delegates gathered from 2022 june in the seaside city of valencia spain to approve the partys political platform for the next four years under the motto we grow together over 84 of these delegates voted for rajoy to continue as party leader this vote tally was the lowest of any pp leader since the party was reformed in 1989 but should serve to silence critics for now rajoy was coming off tough 100day period following the march 9 election loss and had to deal with tumult and dissension in his partys ranks and open criticism from staunch pp members such as madrid regional president esperanza aguirre former interior minister jaime mayor oreja congressional foreign policy spokesman gustavo aristegui party communications secretary gabriel elorriaga and pp campaign strategist juan costa in addition the popular leader of the pps political allies in the basque country maria san gil stated publicly in may that she had lost confidence in the leadership of rajoy and his team nevertheless opposition to rajoy proved to be mile wide and an inch deep and faded away once it became clear that single alternative candidate had enough support to overthrow the sitting leader comment 3 sbu rajoy appears to have put to rest for the time being any doubts about his pp leadership and his new team is receiving generally positive reviews from across the political spectrum pundits are highlighting not only the collective experience and competence of the group gained from positions at the local regional and national levels but also their backgrounds including single working mother designed to present more moderate face and hopefully appeal to wider swath of spanish voters we believe rajoy is definitely strengthened coming out of the party conference and has mandate to reform the party in his own imagebut his new team will be expected to achieve results quickly if he hopes to lead the partys national ticket in 2012 as we have reportedly previously we believe rajoy owes his longevity as much as anything to the lack of credible successor within his own party but many are waiting in the wings should he stumble again key offyear elections are coming up in the basque country scheduled for early 2009 galicia june 2009 and the european parliament june 2009 and pp supporters will demand to see positive results as reward for having remained patient while rajoy finds his way xxxxxxxxxxxx aguirre
