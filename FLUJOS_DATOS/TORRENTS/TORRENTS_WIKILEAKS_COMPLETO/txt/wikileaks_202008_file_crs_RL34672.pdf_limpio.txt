compared to alternative borrowing strategies interest rates for auctionrate securities are tie d to shortterm market inte rest rates even though the securities themselves have long er maturities in past d ecades interest rates on short term variablerate securities have on average been lower than interest rates on long term fixedrate securities because invest ors usually require compensation to

the extraordinary turmoil in global financial markets that erupted in august 2007 several interest rate auctions for ars fa iled which temporarily left investors unable to sell their ars holdings while ars markets appeared to return to normalcy that fall some large institutional investors had begun to withdraw funds from ars markets large number of ar s auctions in 2007 and early 2008 avoided failure only because investment banks st epped up their support for ars auctions which required them to take on larger ars inventories on their own accounts in midfebruary 2008 key investment ba nks declined to support auctions causing widespread auction failures liquidity essentially evaporated as auctions failed in most ars markets shutting off investors ability to sell their holdings in an

municipal borrowing costs could lead to cuts in public services some policymakers and macroeconomists have looked to infrastructure investments to stimulate economic activity while increasing future economic productivity yet many state and local governments saw financing costs jump due to failures of interest auctions for their ars debt just as th economic slowdown that began in late 2007 began

was ove rly conservative for example the head of the association for financ ial professionals in june 2005 claimed that auction rate securities have proven to be highly liquid investments and there is substantial evidence that the risk of an auction failure is other than remote possibility20 this claim however apparently fa iled to affect the accounting professions view of arss the major accounting firms stance that arss should not be viewed as cash equivalents reduced the attractiveness of ars assets on corporate balance sheets21 in addition some corporati ons had to trade ars assets for more traditional cash equivalents to maintain contractually mandated minimum cash reserves while the shift in the financial accounting treatment of arss may have indirectly affected the ars market as whole some observers doubt that it was proximate cause of auction failures in 2007 as most sophisticated investors and corporate cash managers were well aware of issues concerning arss22 on the other hand

sh ares to investors for auctions with higher number of bids relative to available shares the ability of brokerdealers to influence prices would have been limited when auctions had relatively few bids and were at risk of failing however brokerdealers could effectively set interest rates within range determined by maximum interest rates set in the bond contract or by bids of other i nvestors numerous internal emails quoted in court documents strongly imply that brokerdealers effectively set prices for many auctions at risk of failing25 if brokerdealers set prices for some au ctions their

assumed that the high quality of the assets backing many arss would ensu re smooth functioning of those markets other factors however combined to undermine the viability of ars auctions default risk vs liquidity risk while fears that an issuer may default on payments often sharply reduce liquidity for an asset liquidity risks may also stem from other causes that is default risk nd liquidity risk are di stinct for example an asset entitling its owner to stream of interest payments paid by municipality and backed by that municipalitys power to tax may present very low risk of default however that asset may be structured in such way that may limit in some circumstances the asset owners ability to sell to third party this would present liquidity risk auction failures have occurred for assetbacked securities such as student loans and municipal debt where the financial risks embedded in the underlying loans appear minimal36 moodyrated municipal gene ral obligation or water sewer

moodys and fitch have announced plans to recalibrate municipal ratings in order to make them more comparable to corporate credit ratings38 nonetheless even guaranteed assets carry some financial risk for instance even though federal guarantees for student loans protect lenders or their assignees from most losses due to default administrative and legal procedures required by the default process could delay payments to asset holders that is federal guarantees ensure eventual payment of most lost earni ngs due to default but not prompt payment in some cases bond insurers provide guarantees of timely payment to holders of assetbacked securities c oncerns about the fina ncial condition of bond insurers therefore might trigger investor concerns about timely payment even if eventual repayment

and the level of federal subsidies to lenders saps rating agencies often have considered caps as critical safeguard against high payout rates that could exhaust the loan pools ability to make later payments some arss carried caps that applied directly to auction interest rates for example cap might specify that interest rates could not exceed 7 or could not exceed some fixed spread above benchmark rate such as li bor or given treasury rate caps for taxexempt student loan arss were typica lly set as percenta ge above benchmark municipal debt yield index45 some taxable student loan arss also included cap structured to ensure that income from th trusts loan pool could pay on average fixed spread over given benchmark ra these caps often tied the maximum interest rate to level that would ensure that trusts could pay minimum cash flows thus many student loanbacked arss had maximuminterestrate caps and related restrictions to govern maximum auction reset interest rates but also that could limit cash flows generated by the loan pool municipal arss have been less likely to include maximuminterestrate caps because municipal arss were typically backed by the power to tax there has been less need for interestrate caps to ensure that income streams would be sufficient to pay interest to ars holders in addition state governments have at times intervened to head off impending defaults by local governments or public authorities while the absence of caps implies that municipal interest costs for many ars issues have risen substantially significantly smaller pr oportion of municipal ars auctions have failed persistently46 while most interestrate caps were well above preaugu st 2007 historical levels the sharp expansion of short term interest spreads pushed yields in

trigger max rates available funds caps poten tially resulting in auctions resetting at below market yields these max rates are integral in the securities meeting rating agency stress scenarios and ultimat ely maintaining current ratings the unwillingness of rating agencies to grant waivers on current max rates under current market conditions will accelerate the onset of below market yields due

funding to refinance existing ars debt may be harder for student loan issu ers compared to municipal and closedend fund issuers trusts key element in the structure of slars is the trust that holds the underlying student loan assets when an investment bank unde rwrites slars it typically places student loans from the issuer in trust administered by third party bank the trustee bank uses income generate d by the trusts student loan assets to make interest payments to investors holding slarss ordinarily other sources of income are not available to pay interest the flow of income from the trust is variable because individual student borro wers may default on repayments or may prepay and because lender subsidies saps in recent years have been tied to commercial paper interest ra benchmark the issuer and the trustee bank however have little control over that income fl ow because lender yields for federally guaranteed student loans are establishe d by law thus slars trusts income streams flow unsteadily nd essentially uncontrollably credit ratings agencies whose imprimatur is typically indispensible for slars issuers usually impose conditions on trust structures and payout rates designed to minimize default risk these conditions are typically based on financial analysis using stress tests stress tests are hypothetical scenarios which assume variety of unfavorable conditions for example one stress test might assume that student repayment default rates and commercial interest rates both rise sharply credit rating agencys financial analysts would then assess whether slars could sustain interest payments at least for some peri od of time under such adverse circumstances the credit rating for an issuers slars would then be tied to specific

variablerate securities such as vrdos in light of the collapse of the auctionrate securities in february 2008 many debt issuers and investors have sought alternatives to auctionrate securities for new debt issues and have looked for ways to refinance existing ars debt69 significant proportion of municipal debt s been refinanced using plain vanilla fixedrate longmaturity bonds as well as variablerate securities such as vrdos or similar instruments the return of the put option the melding of characteristics of long maturity and shortmaturity securities was key attraction of auctionrate securities the way in which arss combined those characteristics however also created an intrinsic vulnerability to tight credit conditi ons or liquidity fears because auctionrate securities generally lack put option ie the right to sell back securities to the issuers or designated third party on short notice periodic interest auctions so long as demand was sufficient to supply liquidity tied ars interest pa yments to typically cheaper shortterm rates because investors holding ar ss lacked put option they accepted knowingly or unknowingly risk that liquidity could evaporate if auctions failed following widespread auction failu res many investors and issuers returned to financial instruments that include put option omitting put option allowed issuers to avoid certain underwriting costs

choose new financial instrument and mu st find willing investors to provide new funds to redeem old debt issuers must pay new fees to rating agencies investment banks legal advisors and others because income flows from student loan ars trusts are variable and not controllable and because the student loans those trusts hold are generally the only source of income designing fixedrate bonds with

structure of arss incorporated important asymmetric risks some argue that asymmetric risks can present serious challenges to financial markets74 the attractiveness of arss stemmed from the difference between shortterm and longterm interest rates in normal economic times the yield curve which plots interest rates against maturities slopes upward allowing issuers to pay shortterm rates on longterm debt so long as aucti ons ran smoothly issuers investors and investment banks benefitted from the use of arss issuers paid slightly lower interest rates investors received interest rates slig htly higher than shortterm money market rates and investment banks earned underwriting and remarketing fees not all asymmetric risks are inherently problematic for instance the core role of insurance markets is to handle asymmetr ic risks insurance professionals have developed sophisticated tools to understand and manage asymmetric risks in some other markets however asymmetric risk s that are poorly understood or that are difficult to assess may present important ch allenges because financial markets can be strongly affected by events that from the analysis of historical patterns had appeared extremely unlikely managing asymmetric risks can be difficult75 asymmetric risks embedded in arss appear to have been imperfectly understood by some market participants machinery developed to assess credit risks has largely focused on longterm default risk s not shortterm liquidity risks such as auction failures76 in some cases arrangements such as maximuminterestrate caps on slarss designed to strengthen l ongterm default risks appear to have exacerbated shortrun liquidity risks as the presence of caps on some arss heightened the chances that auctions would fail on the other hand trust administrators and credit ratings agencies may have judged that without such caps income streams might become inadequate to ensure continued payments to bondholders while credit agency ratings provided investors with vital information regarding default risks assessing shor tterm liquidity risk was di fficult given the relative non transparency of ars auction mechanic s despite 2006
