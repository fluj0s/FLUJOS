register dhhs proposed the rule ensuring that department of health and human services funds do not support coercive or discriminatory policies or practices in violation of federal law46 the rules stated purpose is to provide for the implementati on and enforcement of several conscience clause laws including the we ldon amendment that protect the rights of health care entitiesentities both individuals and institutions to refuse to perform health care services to which they may object for re ligious moral ethical or other reasons47 the proposed rule states that entities carrying out dhhs health service programs shall not require i ndividuals to perform or assi st in the performance of any part of health service program or resear ch activity funded by th department if such service or activity would be contrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions48 the proposed rule defines assist in the performance as participating in any activity with reasonable connection to the obj ectionable procedure or health service including counseling referral training and other arrangements for the procedure or health service49 the proposed rule would require certain recipients and subrecipients of dhhs funds including recipients of grants under the public health service act to certify that they will not discriminate against entities for refusing to assist in the performance of abortion or sterilization th recipients and subrecipients would also have to certify that they will not requi re involvement in pro cedures that violate an individuals conscience as part of any part

57 an example of this argument can be f ound in letter from kevin hasson president the continuedrequested abortion counseling or referrals title x grant ees are currently required to provide pregnant women upon request nondirective couns eling and referrals on several options including abortion52 in its comment the guttmacher institute argued that the regulation could allow title x gr antees to ignore this requirement if dhhs is going to undercut this important long standing requirement it has an obligation to indicate how it will ensure that ever title x client w ill be able to r eceive the counseling and referrals to which they ar entitled if individual providers and whole programs even states are allowed to refuse53 similarly the aclu argued that the proposed rule could potentially permit entitie s that perform pregnancy tests to seek title x funding even if they refuse to provide informa tion and counseling54 some commenters also argued that the proposed rule could make it more difficult for title x clients to obtain c ontraception for exam ple the national family planning and reproductiv health association argued that the rule provides guidance about whether it is impermissi ble discrimination for title x family planning clinic that serves primarily women seeking contraceptive services not to hire receptionist because she refuses to make contraceptive ppointments or nurse because he refuses to provide contraceptive services55 the aclu wrote the proposed rule may make it diffi cult for title x clinics to ensure that their staff is willing to participate in the primary purpos of the title x program namely the provision of contraceptive services more over the rule depending on how it is interpreted could make it easier for entities that refuse to provide women with contraceptive services to compete fo r scarce family planning resources56 other commenters supported the proposed rule by arguing that health care practitioners are not likely to specialize in areas such as family planning where they object to the vast majority of the work and that problems of access to contraception can be solved by measures far short of forcing health care practitioners to violate their conscience57httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33644crs16 57 continued becket fund for religious liberty to dhhs september 26 2008 at
