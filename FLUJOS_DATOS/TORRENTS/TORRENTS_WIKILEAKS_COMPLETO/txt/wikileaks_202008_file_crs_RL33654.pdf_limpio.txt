congress viewed the trust fund as primarily capital account that would fund the federal aviation administration faa airport and airway mostly air traffic control capital requirements others including the office of management and budget omb some executive agencies as well as some members of congressional appropriations and budget committees viewed the trust fund as the basis for user pay system

cap on the amount of aviation trust fund money that could be used to fund faa operations in addition penalty mechanisms were put in place that would reduce the cap by formula amounts in proportion to the capital programs shortfall of appropriated funding from their authorized amounts although the cap and penalty provisions had some apparent early success there was growing resistance to passing appropriations bills that adhered to the penalties during the 1980s in 1990 congress removed the penalty some form of cap continued through 1998 in 2000 the wendell h ford aviation investment and

revenue acts of 1970 pl 91259 the 1970 act there has been disagreement over the appropriate use of the trust funds revenues the disagreement centered on differing views of whether the trust funds primary purpose was to fund airport and airway mostly air traffic control infrastructure and those who viewed the trust fund as user pay mechanism that should be available to also fund part or all of faa operations mostly salaries and maintenance activities this led beginning in 1976 to the enactment of series of legislative mechanisms commonly referred to as cap and penalty provisions or out of order provisions designed to assure that federal capital spending for us airports and airways would be funded at their fully authorized levels some supporters also hoped that these provisions would also assure significant general fund share for the federal aviation administrations faa operating budget such funding guarantee proposals have be part of every faa reauthorization debate since 1976 this report begins with background discussion of the establishment of the airport and airway trust fund hereafter referred to as the trust fund and the spending policy conflict that arose from different views concerning the legitimate use of the trust fund revenue during both the debate over the creation of the trust fund and the first years of its existence it then examines the 22year era when congress imposed variety of cap and penalty provisions on aviation trust fund spending in an effort to both encourage full funding of the faas capital programs spending as well as assuring significant general fund share to support the faa s operations the report then briefly examines the current spending guarantees that succeeded the cap and penalty provisions following passage of the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21 st century air21 pl 106181 in march 2000 nd that were continued through fy2007 by vision 100century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 finally the report discusses variety of spending guarantee options wh ich may be discussed during the upcoming faa reauthorization debate this reports analysis necessarily assumes the spending levels and program structure of the times there is an alternative view that too much is spent on the faa which is not discussed in detail in this report g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the faa budget is divided into four categories two of the categories the grantsinaid for airports category basically the airport improvement program aip and the facilities and equipment fe category are considered capital accounts or programs because they deal with the development of airport and airway infrastructure the aip is program of capital grantinaid for airport development projects such as runways and taxiways but it also funds noise mitigation and other airport projects 1 fe which is also capital program pays for the equipping housing such as airport towers and modernizing of the air traffic control system the two noncapital categories include research engineering and development red and operations and 1 prior to 1982 the aviation trust fund supported the aips forerunner program

g344g561maintenance om the red category funds research in support of the aip and fe programs as well as safety research the om account pays the salaries of all faa employees aviation related and also funds some maintenance safety and administrative activities the issue of who should pay for the programs and activities of the faa predates the creation of the aviation trust fund in 1971 by the airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 previously the faas budget had been paid for out of the us treasurys general fund which is supported by general taxpayer revenues dedicated tax revenues were used to fund aviation use prior to implementation of the 1970 act the act authorized taxes on aviation users and dedicated their use to aviation purposes by crediting all these tax revenues to the aviation trust fund conflicts emerged immediately between those who viewed the aviation trust fund as capitalonly source of funding versus those who viewed it more as the basis of full userpay mechanism for all faa funding studies by bot h the congressional budget office cbo and the general accounting office gao now the govern ment accountability office have concluded that the 1970 act was intended to provide that the aviation trust fund would finance airport and airway capital needs and that remaining funds could then be used for the operating costs of the airway system mostly for air traffic control operations as well 2 the issue of the appropriate general fund share of the faa budget has long been one of the most contentious issues during the reauthorization debates the general fund share within the context of aviation policy is to cover costs to the aviation system of government use mostly military use and the benefits of the system to nonusers 3 aviation user groups have historically supported larger general fund share than has the faa the department of transportation dot the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget and appropriations committees who often view at least part of the general fund contribution as an unwarranted andor unnecessary subsidization of civil aviation users by the general taxpayer 4 the nixon administrations faa budget requests for fy1971 and fy1972 under the new trust fund system brought it into immediate conflict with congress over the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues5 the administration treated the new financing system as userpay system to fund all or nearly all of the faa budget whereas many members of congress viewed the trust fund as primarily usersupported capital fund although spending on faa operations was allowable adding to the controversy the administrations first budget submissions of the trust fund era the proposed fy1971 supplemental and the presidents fy1972 budget proposal proposed funding both airport and airway facilities at well below the minimum authorized amounts of 280 million for airport grants and 2 50 million for airway facilities for fy1972 the budget proposed that the remaining trust fund balance be used to pay for faa administration and operations costs this would however have provided more trust fund financing 700 million for operations than for airport grants and airway facilities combined many in congress saw this 2 us congressional budget office the status of the airport and airway trust fund washington cbo 1988 p x 17

g22g155g158g156g157g561g8g158g151g141g561 the adoption of the 1970 act followed closely on the heels of the 1969 congressional adoption of the unified budget concept change that would have ongoing influence on both the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues and the operation of subsequent spending guarantees that rely on trust fund resources 7 under the unified budget concept all trust fund receipts and expenditures were made part of the annual federal budget consequently trust fund amounts collected and spent influence the overall budget deficit or surplus totals this in turn can have an impact on the budgetary treatment of trust fundsupported programs and activities although the inclusion of the aviation trust fund within the unified budget was not major issue during debate over the trust funds creation the unified budget has historically had an impact on trust fund spending levels within the context of the unified budget an excess of aviation trust fund revenues over expenditures can be seen as an offset in federal deficit computations in some cases however the balance may be seen as having been spent on nonaviation programs or purposes 8 because the balance is invested in shortterm treasury notes the interest is payed to the aviation trust fund the federal government is lending itself an amount roughly equal to the balance this in effect frees up the money for spending elsewhere in the budget without pushing up the overall budget deficit or putting pressure on budgetary ceilings established by the congressional budget process during the history of the aviation trust fund concerns have been raised that this situation creates an incentive for those whose priorities for nonaviation spending or for deficit reduction are higher than for aviation spending to holddow n federal aviation trustfundsupported spending on aviation this situation where the trust funds unexpended balance at times somewhat inaccurately referred to as surplus is allowed to grow and is not spent on federal aviation programs and activities has been opposed by much of the aviation community and by the transportation authorizing committees 9 the unexpended balance has also been factor cited in attempts since the creation of the trust fund to legislate mechanisms that would encourage full funding of the faas capital budgets and assure that the aviation trust fund revenues are spent for aviation purposes only 6 us congress senate committee on commerce aviation subcommittee airport and airway development and revenue acts amendments of 1971 hearings on s 1437 hearings held june 22 and 23 1971 serial 9219 86 p to amend the airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 to further clarify the intent of congress as to the priorities for airway modernization and airport development and for other purposes 7 in making this decision congress apparently relied on president johnsons commission on budget concepts see presidents commission on budget concepts p 109 report of the presidents commission on budget concepts washington us gpo 1967 8 because the mechanism of borrowing from the trust fund in effect moves the am ount borrowed to the general fund it is technically impossible to prove that these funds are spent on anything in particular they become indistinct from all the other revenues flowing into the general fund 9 because there are outstanding commitments against these balances the entire trust f und balance is generally not considered available for further spending and most obser vers consider the uncommitted balance to be better indicator of the amount of trust fund resources that could be available for additional spending httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33654g3g159g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g21 g153g142g151g141g146g151

and expressed the intent to meet the minimum spending goals for both airport grants and airways facilities over the 10year life of the trust funds tax provisions congress passed the airport and airway devel opment and revenue acts amendments of 1971 effectively banning the spending of trust fund money on faa operations10 the 1971 amendment was strong congressional reaction consistent with many members perceptions that the nixon administration was ignoring the intent of congress under the 1970 act the reaction embodied in the 1971 amendment went beyond merely clarifying congresss intent and significantly narrowed the allowable use of trust fund revenues the amendment made the trust fund capitalonly account although only temporarily 11 the 1971 amendment eliminated the userpay component ironically by reinforcing the congressional intent that the trust fund be used primarily as capital account the 1971 amendment eliminated the secondary intent that private sector users through taxes imposed under the 1970 act would help pay for the federal services they benefitted from once capital needs of the airport and airway systems were met the change by making all noncapital components of the faas budget dependent on general fund revenues left the faa more exposed to the fiscal pressures that emerged from the constrained general budgetary environment of the period during fy1973fy1976

on the aviation trust fund administration officials continued to assert that the 1970 act was intended to adopt very broad user tax policy and to impose taxes that would pay for the full costs of the airway system including operation and maintenance 15 in the end although congress acknowledged that the aviation taxes in the 1970 act were intended to be user fees that could be used to fund both capital projects and some operations costs concerns still remained in congress that the executive branch would deplete the trust fund to fully fund faa operations and thereby constrain spending on airport and airway capital needs consequently despite the implicit acknowledgment that some spending for faa operations was appropriate the 1976 act included cap and penalty provisions to prevent any misuse of funds by the administration 16 g22g145g142g561g5g138g153g561 accordingly section 6 d of the act placed cap on the use of trust fund revenues for costs of air navigation services of 275

uncommitted aviation trust fund balances continued to grow on september 30 1980 when the original aviation trust fund authorization expired the fund had projected uncommitted balance of roughly 38 billion disputes over what to do about the aviation trust fund balance along with continuing disagreements over the valid use of trust fund revenues and whose taxes should support the fund as well as concerns about deficit spending in general all had part in the legislative deadlock that led to the lapsing of the aviation trust funds authorization on october 1 1980 the gridlock on reauthorization

effect g22g145g142g561g18g142g151g138g149g157g162g561 the basis of the penalty provision was changed from the amounts made available for airport grants under the 1976 act to the amounts made available for fe under the 1982 act the amounts authorized from the trust fund for om for any fiscal year were to be reduced by twice the amount that authorizations exceeded appropriations for fe plus twice any fe carryover funds from the previous year 23 this change in the penalty provision appears to have been made for two reasons first the ca p now already included incentives for higher spending on aip second was the increase in authorizations for fe included in section 506 of the 1982 act under the influence of the proposed nas plan and the growing perception that the airway system needs mostly for air traffic control were great in short the cap would provide incentives for spending on aip while the penalty provisions would protect the increased spending on fe the 1982 act also restricted om

fy1983fy1987 was 27 billion less than the aggregate of the caps for these five years the general fund share of the total faa budget was somewhat lower than under the previous authorization averaging 44 per year down fr om an average of 57 for the previous five years the size of the penalties in fy1984 fy1986 and fy1987 appears to have influenced the relatively high general fund share for those years the uncommitted balance of the trust fund increased nearly 180 from its fy1983 low of 1992 billion to its fy1987 high of 5559 billion24 also the uncommitted balance appears to have surged in the high penalty years of fy1984 fy1986 and fy1987 the role of the cap and penalty provisions in causing the rapid growth of the trust funds uncommitted balance and its role in maintaining the high general fund share increasingly became focus of disagreement between authorizing and appropriating committees 25 this led to struggles during the annual appropriations process between supporters of full adherence to the cap and penalty rules often authorizing committee members and those who felt the impact of the rules was excessive and would argue for partial application of the penalties often appropriations committee members the goal of the cap and penalty provisions continued to be to insure that the aviation trust fund operate primarily as capital account supporting aip and fe while operating in part as user pays system to support some operations spending however although the cap and penalty provisions restricted the spending on operations they did not result in full appropriation of the authorized aip and fe funding levels according to cbo 26 primarily because of program constraints these provisions have merely altered the accounting for aviation spending forcing the general fund to finance more of these expenditures in addition there still remain s an incentive to limit capital spending for aviation programs given the annual level of excise tax revenue from aviation each dollar of aviation spending greater than these tax revenues must be funded by general revenues therefore regardless of the actual accounting for aviation spending each dollar reduction in spending on aviation either reduces the need for the general fund to finance aviation spending or produces trust fund surplus from which the treasury can borrow to cover non aviation expenditures as mentioned earlier the uncommitted balance of the trust fund continued to rise during the 1982 acts authorization cycle reaching 5559 billion at the end of fy1987 24 the restart of the trust fund

argued that the cap and penalties system had reduced the amount of trust fund money that would have been spent by 33 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33654g3g159g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g21

shortfall between the total of aip obligation limitation and the appropriation for fe and red for each year versus amounts specified in the act for each fiscal year 3278 billion for fy1988 3445 billion for fy1989 and 3863 billion for fy1990 the act also added an additional penalty of sorts by directing following year aip appropriation increase equal to twice the difference between the current year authorization and current year appropriation for the three programs referred to by some as popup budget authority 29 as can be seen in table 3 although the trust fund share of om funding was reduced substantially below the cap the reduction only approximated the penalty amount during one year fy1989 for fy1988 and fy1990 although the trust fund shares of om funding provided for amounts that were significantly below the caps the reductions were not equal to the full penalties for those years despite this the aggregate amount made available from the trust fund for om was nearly 23 billion below the aggregate of the caps for these years and therefore roughly this amount would have remained credited to the aviation trust fund the general fund share remained more than 40 during this authorization during fy1989 the year that the penalty was fully assessed against the spending ceiling the general fund share was 56 higher than in other years and this may indi cate that the penalties could have had an effect on the general fund share also the uncommitted balance in the trust fund rose 18 in fy1989 compared to 5 in fy1988 and 8 in fy1990 indi cating that the higher penalty assessment for fy1989 may have had significant impact on the growth of the uncommitted balance g22g138g161g561g22g155g146g144g144g142g155g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 in addition the 1987 act added provision for fy 1988fy1989 that would trigger reduction in the aviation tax rates if the total of the obligation limits for aip and the appropriations for fe and red for fy1988fy1989 were less than 85 of the total amounts authorized for these programs if this situation occurred then in 1990 the ga fuel rates ticket tax and waybill tax would be reduced by 50 the international departure tax would not be changed the idea behind the tax penalty was that it would eliminate the incentive to hold down spending on capital improvements for budget deficit or nonaviation spending purposes because more revenue would be lost than could be saved in outlays or added to the unexpended balance 30 29 this budget authority does not appear to have resulted in an

g343g344g561the tax reduction trigger was never implemented this was not only due to reluctance to follow through on such large percentage cut but also because of pressure to reduce the overall federal budget deficit the amounts appropriated for fy1988 and fy1989 together were just over 80 of the combined authorizations for those years without legislative adjustment the trigger would have taken effect on january 1 1990 however to meet its reconciliation target the house ways and means committee proposed delaying the trigger mechanism for one year estimating that this would save 851 million in fy1990 and 269 million for fy1991 although supporters of the trigger mechanism mostly on the authorizing committees voiced opposition to an extension of the trigger date an extension of the date to january 1 1991 was included in the revenue reconciliation act of 1989 title vii of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 at the end of fy1990 the uncommitted balance had grown to 7446 billion from 5559 billion at the beginning of fy1988 as the 1990 faa reauthorization approached appropriators and budgeteers became more persistent in expressing their concerns among the complaints was that the penalty clause in section 506 c of the 1982 act had resulted in general fund overpayments for faa expenses that in effect had the general taxpayer subsidizing aviation users congressional budget office testimony reflected this view the current accumulated surplus in the aviation trust fund is illusory while this surplus appears to indicate that privatesector users have paid more in taxes than they have received in services the opposite is in fact the case the uncommitted balance in the trust fund has developed ironically because privatesector users of the aviation system have r eceived more in capital and operating spending than they have paid in taxes the airport and airway trust fund is particularly affected by provisions of law that restrict the level of trust fund financing of operations expenditures for the federal aviation administration these provisions tie the level of funding to the obligation limits for airport grants and the appropriations for capital and research expend itures generally speaking the closer these appropriations are to their authorized leve ls the greater the trust fund financing of operations largely because of technical problems in the modernization of the airway system appropriations of capital expenditures have lagged behind authorizations the result has been low proportion of faa spending being debited to the trust fund and an accompanying rise in its accumulated surplus 31

difficult to determine cause and effect in separating out the impact of the cap and penalty provisions from other influences support for adherence to fully implementing the penalty appears to have been influenced by events such as the delays in the faas implementation of the nas for example this was reflected in years when the penalties were only partially imposed in recognition that the authorization levels for fe were based on optimistic assumptions also especially in the mid1990s attempts to rein in the budget deficit had an impact on the budgetar treatment of trust fund revenues in addition because the penalties seem to put upward pressure on both the general fund share and the uncommitted trust fund balance it is unclear that the mechanism provided for net increase in

g343g349g561the first cap and penalty regime appears to have been successful in providing for funding of aip for fy1977fy1979 and for both aip and fe in fy1980 at levels near or very near to their authorized levels however the uncommitted balance in the trust fund increased rapidly during this period and the general fund share remained over 50 while supporters of trust fund spending on aip and fe and maintaining substantial general fund share might see this as success some critics would note that much of the trust fund money squeezed out of the operations budget was mostly retained in the trust fund and simply not spent during the 1980s adherence to the penalty provisions varied from year to year probably due to the varying degree of support for implementing th penalties during the appropriations process this was also period when appropriators were skeptical of the faas ability to successfully manage and spend the amounts authorized for fe eliminating the penalty under obra90 led to pe riod in the 1990s when the capital programs were funded below the authorized levels and the trust fund share of om often exceeded the legislated caps the 1990s however was also period when there was consensus that the overall federal budget deficit was problem and this likely had an impact on the funding of aip and fe and on the support for enforcing the cap provisions as was mentioned earlier the broader budget environment can trump the spending mechanisms although the various cap and penalty mechanisms may have succeeded in restricting spending from the aviation trust fund on operations they did not necessarily succeed in forcing full appropriation of authorized aip and fe funding levels in number of years the cap and penalty provisions combined with the appropriations shortfalls led also to the growth of the trust funds uncommitted balance as congressional budget office cbo report explained 37 primarily because of program constraints these provisions have merely altered the accounting for aviation spending forcing the general fund to finance more of these expenditures in addition there still remain s an incentive to limit capital spending for aviation programs given the annual level of excise tax revenue from aviation each dollar of aviation spending greater than these tax revenues must be funded by general revenues therefore regardless of the actual accounting for aviation spending each dollar reduction in spending on aviation either reduces the need for the general fund to finance aviation spending or produces trust fund surplus from which the treasury can borrow to cover nonaviation expenditures in effect within the context of the unified congressional budget appropriators and budgeteers were more concerned about the overall size of the budget or deficit than whether below authorized spending on aip and fe caused squeezingdown of trust fund spending for om if the intent of the cap and penalty provisions was essentially political however ie to shore up support for the authorization bills among those who were concerned about trust fund spending on operations then it may be viewed as at least partially successful in

h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century pl 106181air21 supporters of spending guarantees wanted mechanism that would resolve the three issues that manifested themselves under the cap and penalty provisions first they wanted legislation that would better assure full funding of the faa capital budget accounts aip and fe second they wanted the legislation to assure that spending from the trust fund would roughly equal trust fund revenues each fiscal year and thereby prevent the accumulation of large balances in the fund third they wanted an outcome that would continue significant general fund share for the operations account provisions that would have accomplished this by taking the aviation trust fund offbudget or erecting budgetary firewalls to assure that all trust fund revenues and interest would be spent each year for aviation purposes never emerged from the conference committee instead air21 provided for funding guarantees that were to be enforced by pointsoforder vision100 retained these provisions g9g158g138g155g138g151g157g142g142g141g561g152g155g561g17g158g157g556g152g143g556g17g155g141g142g155g561 there are two existing spending guarantees whic h are different from the previously discussed cap and penalty provisions one makes it outoforder in the house or senate to consider legislation that does not use all aviation trust

for red or om if the sum of the aip obligation limitation and the appropriation for fe are below their authorized levels as penalty of sorts any failure to fully fund fe will lead to an increased appropriation sometimes informally referred to as popup budget authority for aip equal to the appropriations short fall for fe on its face the guarantee mechanism seemed to work as designed for fy2001 through fy2003 38 both fe and aip were funded at or very near their authorized levels there were shortfalls but they were relatively small fe shortfalls mostly reflected acrosstheboard appropriations rescissions and ranged from roughly 6 million to 39 million for fy2002 funds provided for fe actually exceeded its authorization by 107 million aips shortfalls ranged from 60 to 105 million in fy2003 most observers felt that th guarantees were either working or being acquiesced to at least regarding capital spending the general fund share of total faa appropriations varied from 17 for fy2001 8 for fy2002 and 24 for fy2003 the next four years under vision100 were years of nearly full funding for aip its obligation limitation was 3294 billion for fy2004 3472 bi llion for fy2005 3515 billion for fy2006 and 3515 billion for fy2007 just 106 million 28 million 85 million and 185 million short of aips authorized funding respectively fe however did not fare so well during 38 there were funding

fund contribution for these years was 22 for fy2004 20 for fy2005 18 for fy2006 and 19 for fy2007 although aip did not share the same funding fate as fe the fe experience makes it clear that as was true with the cap and penalty provisions the current spending guarantees can still be trumped by broader budget policy goals such as deficit reduction or by the spending priorities of appropriators the experience of fe lends credence to the view that aips funding success has more to do with the popularity of the program within congress and around the country than the guarantees every congressional district has at least one npias airport and nearly every county does also although fe spending benefits localities across the nation the federal spending involved does not garner the same local government and media attention across the nation as aip grants under air21 and vision100 beginning in fy2002 there has been rapid drawdown of the aviation trust funds uncommitted balance the highway trust fund dropped from an fy2001 end ofyear uncommitted balance of 73 billion to an estimated balance of 19 billion for fy2005 according to gao part of this decline was due to overestimates of trust fund revenues actual revenues were 383 million less than forecast for fy2001 23 billion less than forecast for fy2002 and 1 billion less than forecast for fy2003 and fy2004 40 especially in fy2002 but perhaps also factor in the later years was the post911 drop in flying especially at high fare levels because the funding guarantee requires that the spending of trust fund resources equal the estimated annual revenues these overestimates have led to drawing down of the trust funds balances the revenue could be an issue of concern during the reauthorization debate

the actual revenues accruing to the trust fund as has happened in recent years at least during the first two years of the bill finally by limiting trust fund spending the change could in the minds of some increase the likelihood that the general fund contribution percentage for the faa budget could be set at higher level

g344g343g561critics often view the breadth of aip spending and everwidening project eligibilities as allowing for spending that is increasingly inefficient unfocused and of questionable federal purpose they are often critical for example of the amount of aips resources that go to projects at small local airports that by their nature are questionable from national mobility standpoint they tend to view fe spending as having often been wast efully managed and having pursued questionable technologies that have failed to panout some would even argue that by downsizing faa programs andor restricting program spending it could be feasible to fund the entire faa budget out of the trust fund and thereby ease the burden on the general taxpayer despite questions about the effectiveness of existing and previous spending guarantee mechanisms it may be unlikely that an faa re authorization bill would be enacted without language designed to encourage full funding of the faas capital programs including aip the guarantee language in an authorization bill emphasizes the importance that authorizers place on fully funding aip and fe the provisions are seen by some as helping shoreup support for the overall authorization legislation while the bills work their way through the legislative process extending the current guarantees might be enough to maintain the political advantage during the reauthorization debate extending or making minor modifications to the existing guarantees would probably encounter the least resistance should spending guarantees become major focus of legislative effort there are number of options could arise during the debate it is important to keep in mind that as past history indicates with the possible exception of the first option all the options would almost certainly be opposed by the appropriations and budget committees in congress as well as dot and the office of management and budget

of faa programs and activities from different perspectives authorizing committees generally support the full authorized level of spending for aip and fe as the appropriate level of spending to meet the needs of the nations airports and airways although also concerned about the needs of the airport and airway system appropriators have viewed trust fund spending within the context of the unified congressional budget and the pressures of the overall budget environment of the time this conflict of goals between the committees has meant that the aip and fe appropriations have often been less than their authorizations on its face the simplest way to resolve the disagreement between committees would be for the committees to come to an agreement on trust fund spending an informal negotiated treaty between the transportation authorizing and appropriating committees although unusual has been done at least once in the past in 1990 the appropriations committees agreed to fully fund aip and the authorizing committees agreed to eliminate the penalty portion of the penalty and cap regime 42 this option has the advantage of being the simplest its weakness is that any participant may abrogate the treaty under the treaty aip wa s fully funded for tw years fy1991 fy1992 42 the penalty was repealed in obra 1990 pl 101508 sec 9107 see department of transportation and related agencies

cap and penalty provisions of the 1970s or 1980s might be considered by some during reauthorization the time the cap and penalty mechanism was probably at its most effective was when it was first authorized in 1976 at that time support in congress for the provisions was strong perhaps because it followed closely on the previously mentioned conflicts over the appropriate use of trust fund money with the nixon and ford administrations this environment might have encouraged adherence to the cap and penalty provisions during the appropriations process as mentioned earlier the success of the cap and penalty provisions has been mixed and at times may have had role in unintended consequences such as rapidly growing trust fund balances and in the view of some higher than justified general fund shares of the faa budget also the history of the cap and penalty indicates that over time it does not appear to have been successful in assuring the full funding of faa capital programs such as aip and fe during much of the cap and penalty era appropriators simply absorbed the penalty allowed the unexpended balance of the aviation trust fund to increase as result and used this growing balance as an offset for spending elsewhere the historical cap and penalty provisions may not be compatible with the current law concerning the airport and airway trust fund guarantee 43 the guarantee requires that annual trust fund spending equal the estimated receipts for the year the object of the guarantee is to assure the full spending each years trust fund receipts the cap and penalty mechanism on the other hand is designed to limit and penalize certain kinds of spending

during past reauthorization debates been proposed as means of assuring that the tax revenues deposited in the trust fund are used for aviation purposes 44 in theory an off budget entitys budget authority receipts outlays and in most proposals any deficit or surplus would not be counted in regard to the congressional or presidential budgets if the trust fund were off budget there would be apparent incentive for budgeteers or appropriators to support spending less on aviation in order to be able to spend more on other government programs or activities proponents also argue that unexpended trust fund balances could longer be used to mask the size of the federal budget deficit opponents of off budget proposals often argue that trust fund revenues should not be separated from overall national needs and fiscal policies also as mentioned earlier in regard with the aviation trust fund the uncommitted balance has been much reduced in recent years and some are now more concerned about the trust fund going into deficit the trust funds revenues in and of themselves are not sufficient to cover all of the faas needs this increases the likelihood that an offbudget aviation trust fund would not assure full funding 43 see pl 106181 section 106 44 for further discussion see crs report rs20350 offbudget status of federal entities background and current proposals by

trust fund offbudget would be to amend the balanced budg et and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create discretionary spending guarantee firewall for the faas spending46 this could be done by creating separate budget category for aviation and annual spending caps for programs within the category funding from w ithin this category could not be used to in effect offset increased spending elsewhere in the budget ther eby removing any incentive for restraining the spending of available trust fund revenues in some ways this mechanism has effects similar to going offbudget but the budgetary resources are still counted as part of the unified congressional budget this would prevent the reduction of faa capital program spending to free up funding for spending elsewhere in the budget it is uncertain how effective this would be for faa spending 47 this option would be subject to many of the same caveats as taking the aviation trust fund off budget but would in the eyes of proponents of fu ll funding for aip and fe have the advantage of setting annual funding guarantees that appropriators would have to abide by because this option reduces the appropriations committees influence on spending they could be expected to vigorously resist the change also because this option amends budget act it would require the acquiescence of the house and senate budget committees

funding the aip and fe capital accounts with trust fund revenues would be to fund the full authorized trust fund amount for om and thereby lighten the demands for general fund support for the faa budget recently the funding of the federal transit administration fta underwent change instead of using both trust fund and general fund monies to fund all programs the fta s formula programs are entirely paid for from the trust fund while the congressionally popular new starts capital program is entirely funded out of the general fund although this goes against the historical rationale that trust fund resources should first pay for capital needs it also puts advocates of spending constraints in the position that they have to cut part of the fta budget that has history of strong congressiona l support for faa an analogous change would be to fund all of faas b udget except the well s upported aip program with trust fund revenues and fund aip with general fund revenues this w ould require that those who wish to constrain faa spending to cut the part of the faa budget that has the broadest and deepest support in congress on the other hand this option could leave aip more exposed than other components of 45 in 1999 the house passed hr 1000 which would have taken the aviation trust fund offbudget the provision never emerged from conference with the senate the budget committee leadership had expressed strong opposition to the provision 46 for an explanation of the discretionary spending guarantees enacted for federal aid to highways and transit see crs report 98749 the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 and the federal budget by john w fischer 47 the transit account would be more analogous to the faas budget situation since both rely on
