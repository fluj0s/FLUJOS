from newspapers journals radio and television and the internet intelligence analysts have long used such information to supplement classified data but systematically collecting open source information has not been priority of the us intelligence community in recent years given ch anges in the international environment there have been calls from congress and the 911 commission among others for more intense and focused investment in open source collection and analysis however some still emphasize that the primary business of intelligence continues to be obtaining and analyzing secrets consensus now exists that osint must be systematically collected and should constitute an essential component of analytical products this has been recognized by various commissions and in statutes responding to legislative direction the intelligence community has established the position of assistant director of national intelligence for open source and created the national open source center the goal is to perform specialized osint acquisition and analysis functions and create center of excellence that will support and encourage all intelligence agencies the effort has been only underway since late 2005 but the center is up and running and providing support including training to int professionals throughout the intelligence community administrative mechanisms are in place to ensure that there is comprehensive communitywide open source effort it appears however to some observers that not all agencies have as yet made comprehensive commitments to acquiring and using open source information nor that the odni has taken sufficient steps to ensure that open sources are appropriately exploited observers suggest that congressional oversight of the osint process might provide insight into current progress as well as identify areas that need modification particular focus of congressional interest might be potential tradeoffs between classified and open source collection to ensure that needed information is obtained in the best and most costeffective manner proponents maintain that this approach helps to ensure that agents and expensive surveillance systems are focused on obtaining information that is being actively hidden the collection and analysis of osint information will be ultimately judged by its contribution to the overall intelligence effort collecting information from open sources is generally less expensive and less risky than collection from other intelligence sources the use of osint may result not only in monetary savings but also in less risk than utilizing sensitive technical and human sources osint can also provide insights into the types of developments that may not be on the priority list for other systems or may not be susceptible to collection through other intelligence approachesinnovative applications of new technologies shifts in popular attitudes emergence of new political and religious movements growing popular discontent disillusionment with leadership etc supporters of osint maintain that the future contribution of the intelligence community will be enhanced by its ability to provide detailed information and incisive analyses of such developments this re port will be updated as new information becomes available

intelligence community ic has received its share of criticism since its formal establishment in 1947 it appears such criticism has intensified since the end of the cold war as the community confronted string of perhaps unprecedented challenges including those from the dissolution of the former soviet union the 911 terrorist attacks and the 2003 iraq war and its aftermath although each of these events triggered demands for intelligence community reform perhaps single change in the past quarter of century can match the enduring dayto day challenge posed by the information revolution twenty five years after the development of the internet and the personal computer the explosive impact of the this technologydriven change continues to ripple through the intelligence community one result of this revolutionary change has been newfound willingness on the part of the us intelligence community to reexamine the extent to which it reliesor has failed to relyupon open source information which some have argued has been relegated to second class status by many intelligence professionals who continue to value secret information above all else as part of this reexamination the intelligence community appears to be reassessing number of open source issues including the relative value of open source information compared to that of secret information the impact and importance of the growing volumes of information unlocked by easy access to the internet the dampening effect that certain community security practices may have had and may continue to be having on the use of open sources the state of development of analytic tools necessary to effectively and efficiently collect sift analyze and disseminate vast volume of publicly available information when analysts are expected to also analyze increasingly large amounts of classified information and training issues relating to open source technology and techniques if the global information revolution has sparked debate within the intelligence community over the value of open source information the ongoing jihadist terrorist threat has sharpened its focus in underscoring the strategic and tactical importance of open source information generally and the role of the internet specifically one senior policymaker recently described the internet as being americas new open source battlefield 1 those who share this view tend to argue that the intelligence community must improve its strategic understanding of the of the jihadist threat by more effectively mining the internet and other open sources for information such an effort it is suggested also will enable the community to achieve better tactical understanding of how jihadists use the internets webtelevision capabilities chat rooms and news sites to train forces and raise money ultimately these observers suggest the united states must develop the capability to understand and influence foreign populationsnot in their council of states but in their villages and slumsif it is to effectively counter the threat posed by jihadists in such circumstances it is argued the information that should matter most to policymakers can be derived from open sources 2 the debate over the relative value of open source information compared to that of classified data is occurring at time when the global informati on environment is viewed by some as having 1 see comments

information may be less important than the combination of open source information information sharing computer networking and an ability to sift and analyze dizzying volume of open source information indeed one former senior intelligence officer suggested that whereas the 20th century was the century of secrets the 21st century may well prove to be the century of global information if the intelligence community as whole accepts and understands this change according to some observers it may gain an edge in confronting current threats particularly those posed by terrorism

professionals generally agree that open source information is useful and that such information should be collected and analyzed just as is data derived from classified sources they disagree however over its value relative to that of clandestinelycollected secret information and thus the amount of time attention and resources that should be devoted to its collection and analysis remains in dispute for brief case study of open source intelligence see appendix there generally are three different prevailing views regarding the of relative value of open source information the first holds that policymakers simply derive less value from such information than from clandestinelycollected secrets while open source information can complement supplement and provide context for classified data such information it is suggested rarely provides insight into an adversarys plans and intentions policymakers tend to view such information as being critically important to policy deliberations and attach to it the highest value for that type of insight it is argued the intelligence community must discover and collect secrets it therefore is entirely appropriate that the community target the preponderance of its resources to that end as the director of central intelligence dci reportedly stated in 2005 i only have money to pay for secrets 4 the second view asserts that open source information should be viewed not only as an important contextual supplement to classified data but also as potential source of valuable intelligence in and of itself proponents of this view tend to cite the assahab institute alqaidas sophisticated internetbased messaging and propaganda multimedia production facility as an example of why open source collection and analysis is so important in todays technologydriven and globalized world 5 others cite alqaidas ability to use virtual space to recruit proselytize plot and plan with impunity6 according to one observer alqaida is right on the cutting edge of the adoption of new technologies they grab hold of the new stuff as soon as it becomes available and start using it7 another commentator suggested that gaining an understanding of the inner workings of the assahab institute may provide as an effective way as any to get close to bin laden and zawahiri8 according to one former senior intelligence who believes that the intelligence 3

source information is longer the icing on the cake it is the cake itself9 proponents of the third view adopt middl eground position arguing that open source information probably will never provide the smoking gun about some issue or threat but that it can be instrumental in helping analysts to better focus or drive clandestine collection activities by first identifying what is truly secret open sources therefore should be viewed as an analysts source of first resort although these adherents tend to champion the relative value of open sources their supports appears to be measured while generally believing that the intelligence community should devote additional resources to collecting and analyzing open source information they appear wary of overselling its value we dont have the confidence yet according to one senior intelligence officer in explaining such wariness 10

although the intelligence community has long utilized open source information some suggest that the community has been slow to recognize its value for two reasons first the intelligence communitys principal mission is to discover and steal secrets relying on open sources runs counter to that mission second it is suggested that the intelligence community views clandestinecollected information as being more va luable because it is more difficult to collect 11 as one observer of the intelligence community commented open source was seen as irrelevant and the intelligence community much preferred working with spies and satellites 12 because of this bias the intelligence community has been viewed as supporting and investing in collecting and analyzing open sources only on the margins ironically any failure by the intelligence community to more fully appreciate the importance of open source information may have occurred despite some senior intelligence officers acknowledging its value at various times for example sherman kent the intelligence communitys legendary analyst estimated that in peacetime 80 percent of the information policymakers needed to make decisions was available publicly 13 lt gen samuel v wilson former director of the defense intelligence agency provided an even higher estimate asserting ninety percent of intelligence comes from open sources the other ten percent the clandestine work is just the more dramatic the real intelligence hero is sherlock holmes not james bond 14 9 interview with former senior intelligence official june 6 2007 10 see comments

of the cold war the intelligence communitys reliance on open source information grew as the internet expanded and the availability of public information increased dramatically the world also became more open for example in the case of russia it is estimated that the ratio of unclassified to classified information in the case of russia has more than reversed from its 2080 cold war ratio15 with the end of the cold war the intelligence communitys reliance on open source information also grew because it turned its attention away from the sophisticated military programs of the soviet union and towards the disparate threats posed by emerging postcold war threats collection strategies shifted from sophisticated surveillance satellites capable of counting tanks and missiles to the gathering of whatever information was available on rogue states and terrorist groups much of the information found was actually openly available but not hitherto collected and analyzed the shift within the intelligence agencies was publicly championed by open source advocates such as robert steele of open source solutions who has conducted annual conferences to bring together open source experts from around the world and written extensively on the topic 16 in addition intelligence agencies have come to utilize and rely on electronic databases and search engines which were developed for civilian markets some contractors have developed software and other research tools specifically for sale to intelligence agencies while acknowledging that the intelligence community is relying more on open source information some observers insist that the community continues to undervalue such information while focusing most of its attention on collecting secret information joseph nye former head of the national intelligence council in the 1990s perhaps best captured the prevailing view of the intelligence community when he stated open source intelligence is the outer pieces of the jigsaw puzzle without which one can neither begin nor complete the puzzle open source intelligence is the critical foundation for the allsource intelligence product but it cannot ever replace the totality of the allsource effort 17 some open source proponents view such information as constituting more than just the the outer pieces of the jigsaw puzzle but rather every bit as valuable as clandestinelycollected secrets g17g153g142g151g561g21g152g158g155g140g142g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561g6g142g143g146g151g142g141g561 definitions of open source information have varied over time most simply the term refers to information that is unclassified it also has been defined to signify information that is derived from overt nonclandestine or nonsecret rather than hidden or covert collection the intelligence community defines open source information as that information that is publicly 15 see mark m lowenthal intelligence from secrets to policy second edition cq press washington dc 2003 p 80 even at the height of the cold war period of time when the intelligence community focused much of its efforts on clandestine collection against the former soviet ion american intelligence analysts made time to track the publishing records of soviet scientists they highlighted when certain scientists stopped publishing for period of time concluding that any such pauses could signify that the soviets were developing new technologies such pauses would trigger new targeting aimed at determining if new technology was under development see amy sands integrating

purchase or observation18 thus the acquisition of such information must conform with extant copyright requirements although open source information consists of unclassified material the intelligence community sometimes classifies certain open source information that it collects including information provided by substantive outside experts if it determines that the process by which the information is collected could reveal intelligence sources and methods intelligence requirements for certain collection of intelligence or certain policy concerns 19 open source information according to some observers generally falls into four categories20 widely available data and information targeted commercial data individual experts and gray literature which consists of written information produced by the private sector government and academe that has limited availability either because few copies are produced existence of the material is largely unknown or access to information is constrained 21 within these four categories open source information can include media such as newspaper magazines radio television and computerbased information public data such as government reports and official data such as budgets and demographics hearings legislative debates press conferences and speeches information derived from professional and academic sources such as conferences symposia professional associations academic papers dissertations and theses and experts22 commercial data such as commercial imagery and gray literature such as trip reports working papers discussion papers unofficial

even it is suggested among intelligence officials one such misconception is that intelligence analysts rely on the internet for most open source information in fact according to 2003 published estimate analysts derived only three to five percent of such information from internet sources26 it should be noted that there could be any several reasons for this low estimate including the lack of open source expertise ineffective analytic tools lack of subject expertise deadline pressures that prevent more extensive evaluation of internet sources the possibility that the internet may not provide the best sources for certain needed information or some combination of these factors another misconception is that open source information is free although such information can be collected certainly at less expense than for example than that collected by satellite the intelligence community like any other consumer of various media still must pay for access the community also must purchase analytic tools that enable analysts to more effectively sift open source information and the intelligence community is increasing its investment in analytic tool development for example the department of defense recently awarded johns hopkins university 48 million grant to develop technology that is capable of automatically translating and analyzing speech and text in multiple languages it is generally believed that the intelligence community must achieve such capability if it is to effectively collect and analyze open source information when does open source information become open source intelligence according to the statutory definition such information becomes intelligence when it is collected exploited and disseminated in timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing specific intelligence requirement 27 the definition refers to collection even though some open source analysts prefer to use the term acquired arguing that analysts generally acquire previously collected and publicly available information secondhand most intelligence professionals however employ the term collection

confront several obstacles in making more effective use of open source information one such obstacleperhaps principal oneis that many analysts lack sufficient subject matter expertise indeed open source proponents assert that open source intelligence is as much about such expertiseforeign language and cultural understandingas it is about the underlying data itself and that it would be misleading to assume that the value of such intelligence exists mostly or solely in the information itself another such obstacle can be the analysts own bias against open source information some analysts believe that such information generally is not as carefully vetted as clandestinely collected intelligence and therefore is less creditable and ultimately provides less value to the policymaker thus driven by deadlines and confronted by large volumes of open source and classified information analysts often choose to focus their limited time and resources on analyzing clandestinecollected intelligence more over they often receive further encouragement to do so from managers who establish priorities that favor the analysis of clandestinelycollected secrets 26 see

necessary to make the most effective use of open sources internet on the desktop an unknown number of analysts and collectors still are unable to access the internet from their desktops that any analyst or collector lacks internet access leads some observers to question the intelligence communitys commitment to more fully developing open source capabilities v olume in searching open sources analys ts confront an enormous volume of information identifying and analyzing information from this data stream can be daunting and analysts must rely upon their subject matter expertise and an effective set of analytic tools to tackle the task v olume however also can work in an analysts favor by being able to check multiple sources an analyst is better able to assess whether certain piece of information is deceptive biased or in error tools the search for more effective analytic tools remains challenge analysts continue to be overwhelmed by text searches that require examination and correlation in addressing this problem the intelligence community trying to develop visualization tools that will better enable analysts to more effectively extract and manipulate critical information from all available information sources the echo effect such an effect occurs when more than one media outlet makes available the same news story the resulting repetition can imbue particular news item with more credibility and importance than is warranted given the proliferation of news sources this phenomenon remains continuing challenge for analysts security according to some observers overly rigid intelligence community security practices continue to limit the broader and more effective use of open source information certain practicesfor example polygraph requirements and classification reviews of subsequent publicationscan discourage outside experts from collaborating with inte lligence community counterparts subsequently classifying information provided by outside collaborators can also undermine cooperation such practices have dampening effect according to some critics 28 security officials acknowledge as much but generally argue that security concerns must take precedence 28

failure to promote the use of open source information and third recommended that an open source center be established that would serve the community the commissions also criticized the communitys preferential bias with regard to classified information g3g156g153g146g151g556g4g155g152g160g151g561g5g152g150g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g561 in 1996 the aspinbrown commission criticized the intelligence community for failing to make greater use of open source information 29 the commission established by congress to review the intelligence communitys postcold war effectiv eness concluded that the intelligence community was moving too slowly to provide analysts access to open source data bases particularly given the volume of information readily available on the internet while noting that the development of open source data bases was growing the commission said that intelligence analysts had only limited access to such data bases the commission criticized the community for an effort that it characterized as inexplicably slow and recommended that computer infrastructure be established that connected intelligence analysts into open source information networks although the commission di d not address the issue of funding for open source it did urge the intelligence community to adopt less intrusive security measures

analysts have large quantities of information from wide variety of sources delivered to their desktops each day given the time constraints analysts face it is understandable that their daily work focuses on using whats readily availableusually classified material clandestine sources however constitute only tiny sliver of the information available on many topics of interest to the intelligence community other sources such as traditional media the internet and individuals in acad emia nongovernmental organizations and business offer vast intelligence possibilities regrettably all too frequently these non secret sources are undervalued and underused by the intelligence community 33 commissioners recommended that analysts broaden their information horizons and encouraged them to expand their use of open source material outside experts and new and emerging technologies

the completion of the 911 commission report but in advance of the publication of the wmd commissions final report congress in 2004 approved comprehensive intelligence reform bill that included sense of congress resolution calling for the establishment of an open source center which would collect analyze produce and disseminate opensource intelligence 34 the resolution described open source intelligence as valuable source of such information that must be integrated into th intelligence cycle to ensure that the us policymakers are fully and completely informed

greater emphasis on open source information came in the wake of the intelligence reform and terrorism protection act of 2004 pl 108458 which included the most extensive changes in intelligence organization since 1947 the act stated that open source intelligence is valuable source that must be integrated into the intelligence cycle to ensure that united states policymakers are fully and completely informed it also expressed the sense of congress that the director of national intelligence dni should blish an intelligence center for the purpose of coordinating the collection analysis production and dissemination of opensource intelligence to elements of the intelligence community the act asked for report by june 30 2005 from the dni containing his decision on whether an open source center is advisable in response to this congressional direction the administration opted to establish national open source enterprise built around several key principles the establishment of the position of assistant deputy director of national intelligence for open source with overall oversight responsibility of the open source effort 33 ibid p 395 34 section 1052 pl 108458

currently available online in website opensourcegov that is available to government officials many of these products are also available to the public or to outside experts through the world news connection commercial news service38 the nosc maintains vast collection of published material in electronic form including daily downloads of hundreds of newspapers and journals39 the nosc seeks to establish higher professional standards for open source collection and analysis to create an open source guild though every analyst knows about some open source materials such as the local newspaper the rapidly expanding availability of electronic databases and large variety of search strategies requires extensive training and skills that only it specialists are likely to acquire in graduate schools it is widely maintained that training in specific searching skills is cost effective as it reduces timeconsuming and unproductive searches

more open source practitioners but to alter agency cultures to ensure that use of open source information is routine and natural component of analytical practice changing agency cultures is formidable task as one intelligence scholar has noted the culture of the intelligence community tends to devalue the use of open sources except in marginal ways in part because open sources are by definition available to the public they remove one of the psychological benefits of being an insider with special information relying on classified information immediately limits those with whom an analyst can discuss issues and creates wall between those with access and those without it intelligence analysts must by law exclude outsiders without clearance from access to classified information but in this way they create an exclusive club that inhibits the use of relevant and potentially significant expertise also as noted earlier many intelligence analysts trust only classified information they may put excessive confidence in such materials perhaps in the belief that they have been closely vetted and validated during the co llection process this stamp of approval for classified information and the bias favoring it over other sources can cause analysts to be closed off to data emerging from researchers who use open sources 40 to some extent resistance to the use of open source information may be more prevalent among analysts whose careers began during the cold war when the focus was on secretive nation states with sophisticated military capabilities analysts who have entered the workforce in more recent years will have had routine access to open source information in academic environments or in 37 see hamilton bean the dnis open source center an organizational communication

inclined to continue routine use of open sources in conjunction with classified data major component of the open source initiative has nevertheless been an effort to ensure that open source experts are available and utilized in all intelligence agencies and at the same time avoid unnecessary duplicative efforts this effort has concentrated on enhancing expertise within the nosc and in offering training for open source experts in other agencies in many cases however the number of persons whose job responsibilities focus on or include open source information to significant degree have not been consistently identified the odnis budgetary authorities may permit decisive support to the open source effort dedicated open source positions at appropriate paygrades could do much to ensure the visability of the open source effort with information expected to be available from individual agencies and reviewed by the odni budgets submitted by the dni each year could include more detailed information on specific open source analyst positions in each agency congress would then have the opportunity to review these efforts through the budget process to ensure adequate but not redundant open source capabilities some argue that open source billets should be identified not only in national intelligence agencies but also in military intelligence agencies information sharing based on stateoftheart info rmation technology is another important part of the effort the open source center manages this effort for the entire intelligence community as well as homeland defense partners at the state local and tribal levels the goal is to maximize connectivity throughout the government and to supercede separate agencybased system that have incompatible formats and extensive duplicative materials individual agencies may continue to maintain independent open source databases but the goal is that they are maintained in formats that can be accessed by analysts at other agencies the wmd commission noted that information technology has made remarkable advances in recent years the private sector without the same kinds of security concerns as the intelligence community has led the adoption of technologies that are also critical to intelligence two areas show particular promise first machine translation of foreign languages and second tools designed to prioritize documents in their native language without the need for translation 42 this effort depends heavily on the expertise and initiative of commercial enterprises to develop useful and costeffective technologies in 1999 the cia developed inqtel to provide means for business firms to work with intelligence agen cies on comparatively small contracts the effort has been widely praised but has been largely focused on classified technologies similar approach but one focused solely on unclassified open source technologies has been proposed for implementation by the odni one of the most important sources of information from nongovernmental sources private sector contributors is commercial imagery that is purchased by the national geospatialintelligence agency commercial satellites provide extensiv overhead coverage of targets throughout the world to supplement imagery from government satellites in some cases it has also meant that overhead imagery of significant quality is available to anyone

scope of this report the use of commercial imagery has had major influence on the intelligence community especially on the procurement and operation of government satellites43 commercial imagery however is special case as the government is in the many cases the principle customer for most other open source information the us government is only an incidental customer and in some cases an

information the asian studies detachment asd in camp zama japan has collected and analyzed open source information on far eastern topics since 1947 with the services of us military personnel and japanese civilians the asd translates and analyses information for military commands in the region and makes its products available to the intelligence community 45 other military commands some not technically part of the intelligence community also undertake open source collection and analysis although the introduction of webbased information sharing systems makes it possible to share such information with other dod and ic users incentives to share information have not always been present in the wake of the 911 commission report and during consideration of the intelligence reform act of 2004 the under secretary of defense for intelligence established working group to assess open source efforts throughout dod the effort resulted in the establishment of the defense open source council the council was tasked with establishing open source requirements and developing an open source strategy for all dod components in july 2005 there was conference between fbis which would shortly merge into the national open source center and dod open source officials the conference aimed to improve support to military users encourage information sharing and inaugurate longterm mutually beneficial relationship however many of the conference attendees reportedly concluded that open source collection is poorly funded and the personnel involved in dod open source efforts often lack training in media analysis and foreign language capabilities furthermore it was concluded that there is clear external point of contact or central responsibility for open source support for the military 46 although there is greater coordination between the nosc and dod offices in acquiring materials to reduce duplication it is not clear that the inherent challenges in training intelligence personnel in open source collection and analysis have been eliminated although information is shared more extensively and certain open source functions have been rationalized47 the open source efforts are in large measure are conducted in isolation from the nosc and even other dod entities 43 see crs report rl31218 commercial remote sensing by satellite status and issues by richard rowberg 44 special efforts

g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 congress has been an important advocate of greater use of open source information as noted above it created statutory requirement for increased use of open source

include identifying open source activities copyright issues moving the nosc to the office of the dni

allow congress to evaluate the implementation of mandated open source efforts this creates uncertainties about how the mandate is progressing for example while the dni currently has the statutory authority to ensure the effective execution of the budget including open source activities throughout the intelligence community 50 the reality is that funding allocations may be affected by requirements imposed by agency heads including the dcia some observers suggest that open source positions and budgets need to be effectively fenced or protected to ensure that congressional mandates are implemented this concern has been expressed in regard to open source efforts in the various agencies and even to the nosc itself the extent to which different priorities of cia managerial officials and the nosc leadership have complicated open source efforts is unknown but oversight committees may wish to verify the current ic approach is adequately implementing the congressional open source mandate one way is to examine specific budget areas in which spending on open source currently can be identified first there are amounts indicated in budget submissions for the staff of the deputy dni for open source and within the budget submission for the cia for the personnel and operations of the open source center similar information for open source efforts in other agencies may be more difficult to identify it is not known if relevant detailed budget information on open source efforts is included in the classified budget justification books that are presented annually to the

base on which more detailed open source oversight could be exercised another opportunity occurs when the dni submits to congressional intelligence committees an annual report reviewing analytical products arguably these annual reports should address the use of open source information however oversight committees could ask for additional information on open source utilization if needed and finally an approach that might be considered in some situations would be request for an alternative analysis of specified topic solely based on open sources in order to compare it with allsource an alyses the intelligence reform act specifically provided for alternative analyses 51 and in some cases it might be appropriate to have alternate analyses based solely on information in the public record such an effort could demonstrate the additive value of specific forms of classified information if product based on open sources was essentially consistent with an analogous analytical product based on classified sources then the former would have the useful advantage of be ing more easily provided to congress and the public g5g152g153g162g155g146g144g145g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 difficult issue for those responsible for acquiring analyzing and disseminating open source information within the government is the extent to which such activities can be carried out in accordance with the provisions of laws governing copyrights much of the open source information acquired by intelligence agencies is in the public domain ie information for which copyright is claimed in other cases as with certain commercial databases rights to the information have been obtained by contract in accordance with usual government procurement procedures in many other cases however agencies acquire copyright information without the authorization of the copyright holder as of course millions of writers and researchers also routinely do in using such copyrighted information intelligence agencies like other users of public information are governed by the doctrine of fair use based on common law and codified in the copyright act of 1976 17 usc 107 fair use permits the use of copyrighted materials without authorization from the copyright holder if certain criteria are met these include variables such as 1 the amount and character of the use 2 the nature of the copyrighted work 3 the amount copied in relation to the whole copyrighted work and 4 the effect of copying on the potential market for the copyrighted work 52 copyright however has to be claimed and defended by the copyright holder and some if not many would see benefit in suing the federal government on such grounds further complications arise in regard to works published in foreign countries whose governments may or may not adhere to the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works which provides international protections for copyrighted material detailed analysis of the implications of copyright law on the open source intelligence effort lies beyond the scope of this report but it is clear that the intelligence communitys desire to buy it once and only once may be in conflict with the goal of copyright holders to ensure that payment for the use of their products by multiple government agencies is not avoided 51 pl 108458 section 1017 52 crs report rl30495 the

copyright law that would cover the open source efforts of intelligence agencies removing uncertainty of the extent of copyright would facilitate open source efforts and facilitate the widest possible use of the information by public officials on the other hand such an initiative could infringe upon the legitimate rights of copyright holders including the profits they could reasonably expect from copies sold to the many government offices

some have proposed making the open source center component of the office of the director of national intelligence odni while essentially retaining its current roles and missions this approach would attempt to guarantee that open source resources would be managed by practitioners with significant expertise that could not be redirected for single agencys temporary higher priority given the availability of information systems that extend throughout the intelligence community an open source center directly under the dni arguably could meet the needs of analysts at all levels even if it had agency homebase the advantage of placing the nosc directly under the dni would be to enhance the prestige of the open source discipline by raising its profile fencing the funding and ensuring its independence from shifting priorities within the cia where human intelligence collection inevitably makes heavy and continuing demands on senior officials as part of the odni the nosc would have more visability and arguably would be better positioned to influence the use of open source throughout the community disadvantage would be the need to establish an administrative infrastructure that would to some extent duplicate that which already exists within the cia placing the nosc within the odni could also facilitate the noscs ability to support law enforcement agencies and state local and tribal entities as part of the cia the nosc is constrained in collecting information that will be used for law enforcement purposes in accordance with the provisions of the national security act precluding cia involvement in law enforcement activities 53 the intelligence community as whole contains however intelligence agenciesthe fbi and dhsthat are also law enforcement agencies and use open source information to carry out their statutory responsibilities arguably placing the nosc in the odni would facilitate its ability to support law enforcement agencies for instance collecting media accounts in foreign publications or websites that provide information about potential terrorist activities that involve persons physically present in the us could arguably infringe on the statutory prohibition of cia involvement in law enforcement functions 54 g3g149g157g142g155g151g138g157g142g561g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g142g156g561 congress also has broader reaching options the bush

been little opposition to this approach expressed by members of congress some outside observers have advocated alternative approaches more radical approach would be to establish an open source agency completely outside the intelligence community in addition to the existing open source center the goal would be to provide open source information not just to intelligence analysts but to all elements of the federal government including congressional committees it is envisioned that the new agency would be an independent federal agency under the secretary of state and similar to the broadcasting board of governors such an entity could also be established in the defense department outside of intelligence agencies with special responsibilities for supporting multilateral operations involving number of countries some of whom might not be intelligence partners of the united states this initiative could be based on an assessment that open source information systematically collected and analyzed is important for all government efforts including those that cannot realistically be supported by the intelligence community particular advantage cited by advocates is that open source intelligence could support the conduct of us public diplomacy efforts without what is considered the taint of the secret world in addition there might be less concern about acquiring public information that included references to us persons than about intelligence agencies collecting information from all sources that included references to us persons proponents of this plan argue that open source information is essential for virtually all governmental functions but that the explosion of available information has not been matched by concerted efforts to acquire and analyze it the goal would be to establish center of expertise for the entire federal government and to make available to the public free universal access to all unclassified information acquired through this initiative at present information provided by the nosc is av ailable to all government agencies but it is designed to support the intelligence community some ask why shouldnt an information collection and analysis agency be established to deal with policy issues that may be of concern to other government agencies including those re sponsible for domestic issues such an effort would have to be justified on the basis of widely perceived need and pervasive support throughout the federal government this support it seems is not yet apparent but advocates of wider effort to acquire and analyze open source information may continue to make the case that it is needed to meet ongoing and emerging policy issues it is also possible that the nosc will become more useful as times goes on and that its contribution will be so widely recognized that it will become model for larger entity that can serve all federal organizations g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561 although unclassified information has often been slighted by the intelligence community consensus now exists that open source information must be systematically collected and in fact constitutes an essential component of analytical products this has been recognized by various commissions and by congress in statutory language responding to legislative direction the intelligence community has established the position of assistant director of national intelligence for open source and the national open source center the goal is not only to perform open source acquisition and analysis functions but also to create center of excellence in open source

agencies in the intelligence community in the effective use of open source the challenge is to deploy all available information sources and technologies including cutting edge approaches to obtain and analyze information of national security importance that is available openly the effort has been only underway since late 2005 but the nosc is up and running and providing support including training to open source professionals throughout the intelligence community it is less clear that administrative mechanisms are in place to ensure that there is comprehensive communitywide open source effort it appears to observers that not all agencies have as yet made comprehensive commitments to acquiring and using open source information nor that the odni has taken sufficient steps to ensure that open sources are fully exploited observers suggest that congressional oversight of the open source process might provide insight into current progress of administration efforts as well as identify areas that need modification particular focus of congressional interest might be potential tradeoffs between classified and open source collection to ensure that needed information is obtained in the best and most costeffective manner the goal would be to ensure that vulnerable human agents and expensive surveillance systems are focused on obtaining information that is being actively hidden and

tests on may 11 1998 the indian government tested three nuclear devices the first such tests in 20 years the tests caught the us intelligence committee by surprise thendirector of central intelligence george tenet appointed former admiral david jeremiah to examine how and why we had missed the boat so badly56 in conducting his review jeremiah touched on number of issues including the availability at the time of open source information in the form of public statements made by bharatiya janata party bjp leaders prior to the election of party leader atal behari vajpayee to be indias prime minister those public statements indicated that the bjp was interested in exercising the nuclear option 57 in his final report jeremiah concluded that both the intelligence and the policy communities had an underlying mindset going into these tests that the bjp would behave as we behave for instance there is an assumption that the bjp platform would mirror western political platforms in other words politician is going to say something in his political platform leading up to the elections but not necessarily follow through on the platform once he takes office and is exposed to the immensity of his problem the bjp was dead serious 58 others were more explicit in their criticism former us senator patrick moynihan reportedly commented it didnt take spies or spymasters simply to read what indian leaders said and to take it seriously59 these and other observations suggest that if analysts had paid greater attention and attached more significance to some of the bjps public statements about nuclear testing the intelligence community might have more accurately assessed bjp intentions review of the public record prior to the indian tests however presents mixed picture in this regard and arguably underscores some of the difficulties analysts confront when attempting to analyze open source information 55 george tenet at the center of the storm my years at the cia harperco llins

policy spokesman stated that his party had every intention of exercising the nuclear option if elected60 but in february of that year the bjp issued campaign manifesto that suggested to some indian analysts that the bjp might not be fully committed to conducting nuclear tests61 new bjp prime minister vajpayee while reportedly stating that government would keep open the option of adding nuclear capability to its arsenal said there was time frame for doing so62 the governments defense minister further suggested there was need to test nuclear weapons63 amid other public signs that included indication of imminent nuclear testing highlevel us delegation met with their indian counterparts and concluded that such tests were imminent in the final analysis open source information that was available prior to indias nuclear tests in 1998 presents mixed if not misleading picture that presented number of analytic challenges
