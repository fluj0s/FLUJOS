agreement between bsac and bechuanaland exploration company limited 10 certificate of transfer number 2 the above land and mineral rights were owned by the bechuanaland exploration company plc be an associate company up until they were expropriated by the zambian government in approximately 1970 be never gave up the right to claim compensation from the zambian government in respect of these assets in 1988 all claims that be had against the zambian government not only in respect of the above assets but generally in respect of all land and mineral rights previously owned by be were transferred to tati company limited italics authors own formal agreement recording the transfer was not concluded between the companies the transaction was effected by means of journal entries in their respective financial records the transfer was made in contemplation of the anticipated members voluntary liquidation of be which was commenced in 1989 please find attached draft memorandum of agreement between the two companies could you advise whether such an agreement should be entered into and if so whether the wording contemplated is correct furthermore your advice on how to proceed with the claims andor the reinstatement of the assets would be appreciated yours sincerely for tati company limited sam glazer director the relevant section of the draft memorandum referred to in the above draft memorandum read as follows draft memorandum of agreement between tati company limited and be it has now been agreed 1 that be cedes for nominal amount of z2 to tati all its rights to claim from government compensation in respect of the assets andor the return of the assets 2 that this agreement shall cover any other assets previously owned by be and subsequently expropriated by government it is noted that the shareholders of be and tati are to all intents and purposes the same the semantics of this memorandum are important sam stated explicitly that in 1988 all claims that be had against the zambian government not only in respect of the above assets but generally in respect of all land and mineral rights previously owned by be were transferred to tati company limited authors emphasis the first implication of this sentence is quite clear be also held other land and mineral rights in zambia and not only the assets mentioned in the memorandum the second implication is ambiguous it clearly states that be had previously owned other land and mineral rights however its not clear whether this statement implies that they are now owned by tati or that they are now owned were expropriated by the zambian government above all one must bear in mind that bechuanaland acquired all the rights and entitlements for the northern copper bsa company on 28 september 1914 the financial statements of be stated consistently from 1970 onwards that three farms belonging to the company had been expropriated presumably these were the same three farms that sam referred to in his 1992 memorandum this would also imply that whatever other land and mineral rights be had held was not expropriated they were transferred to tati co although kafue sugar loaf and hot springs the three farms mentioned in the memorandum were described as farms they were in fact mineral areas each covered an area of 10 square miles or 25km2 together they formed single mineral area which was identified as mt24 combined with two other mineral areas mt3 and mt4 it was part of much larger mineral area called the big concession see map situated few miles northwest of town called mumbwa the big concession was triangular piece of ground that covered 700 square miles 1 800 km2 it originated from three separate grants made by the british south africa company in 1895 these three grants were amalgamated then subdivided and by 1922 had been assigned to three different companies kafue copper development co ltd bechuanaland exploration co ltd and the south african townships mining finance corporation ltd the south african townships mining finance corporation ltd transferred its rights to african gold base metal holdings ltd in 1939 these companies in turn did deals with the bsac whereby each one opened the area under its control to general prospecting the bsac got the first 10 of any licence fees or royalties received for so called administration charges it also got 35 of the remaining 90 the assignee company got the other 65 see appendix flowcharts however according to geological report 27 on the area completed in 1968 mining was undertaken in the big concession from about 1923 apart from the working of the dumps at sable antelope during 1952 and the period 1955 6 according to the abovementioned geological report the bsacs interests in terms of the above agreement were transferred to the government of the republic of zambia on the eve of independence in 1964 government white paper on ownership of mineral rights in northern rhodesia as it was then known was issued in that same year and stated that 135 million before tax 70 million after tax had accrued to the bsac by that time the bsac received 40 for every ton of copper mined it estimated that if the private ownership of mineral rights continued the company would receive between 7 million and 12 million year after tax for the next 22 years until 1986 the national budget for african meaning black education at the time was 3 million why 1986 it turns out that an agreement had been signed in 1950 whereby the bsac would give the state 20 cut of its share of the royalties until 30 september 1986 thereafter the companys entitlement to royalties would be transferred entirely to the state on the surface therefore the date of this transfer of royalty interests was brought forward by 22 years as result of the country gaining its independence this is further confirmed in south africa inc david pallister sarah stewart ian lepper which states anglo had first invested in the rhodesian copperbelt most of it in presentday zambia in 1924 this was the same year in which cecil rhodes bsa company transferred its 30 year old administration of northern rhodesia to legislative council that excluded africans after anglo incorporated its rhodesian holding company rhodesian anglo american rhoanglo in london in december 1928 the lineage began as far back as 1928 when rhoanglo was formed in london to finance the expansion on the copperbelt it moved to zambia in 1954 and ten years later was renamed zambian anglo american zamanglo when the country acquired its independence in 1970 when the new government took 51 of the company it was transferred to the tax haven of bermuda to receive the compensation monies in the form of dividends from government bonds four years later it was renamed minorco and was soon to overtake charter as the groups overseas flagship the two big copper mining companies anglo and the us firm amax had sent 260 million out of the country in dividends interest and royalty payments during the previous ten years the bsa company had received 82 million net for its mineral royalties from 1923 to 1964 over the same period the british treasury received 40 million in taxes in part because the mining companies were based in london until the 1950s its also not made clear whether the other parties to the contract kafue development company be and african gold base metal holdings ltd were made to give up their ownership and consequent share of the royalties in every instance or only in some the arguments presented for the nationalisation of mineral ownership in the 1964 white paper were simple and compelling firstly private uk registered company controlled the countrys most valuable resource and one that was exhaustible to boot surely any decisions to exploit this resource should be made by the government on behalf of the people of the country and more to the point surely zambia and not some other country should benefit financially from its resources apparently by 1964 the bsac had only reinvested about 10 of its total gross royalty receipts in zambia and its zambian portfolio represented only onefifth of its total investment portfolio the original or founding agreements were struck between the emissaries of cecil john rhodes and various african tribal chiefs or kings during the late nineteenth century the african chiefs granted rhodes ownership of the minerals in exchange for few hundred pounds year maybe some guns possibly steamship patrol for protection and invariably the promise of education and other trappings of civilisation the agreements took the form of letters addressed to the company drawn up on behalf of the illiterate chiefs by rhodess lawyers who used deliberately ambiguous language that failed to draw clear distinction between the british crown and the company rhodes in turn waved these letters in front of the british prime minister lord salisbury and gained royal charter signed by queen victoria on 29 october 1889 the charter gave the company immense powers to make treaties promulgate laws preserve the peace maintain police force and acquire new concessions essentially it could run the colonies like government but make profits as private company rhodess model was the highly profitable east india company which had done the same thing in india century before in both cases britain enjoyed the fruits of control over vast natural and human resources without incurring any direct costs other than the occasional military intervention the bsac became known as the chartered company and incurred the costs of running and developing the country according to the 1964 white paper the british government took over the administration of both southern and northern rhodesia from the bsac in 1923 the company agreed to drop its claim of 16 million administration deficit in exchange for half the revenue from certain future land sales and recognition of the company as owner of all northern rhodesias mineral rights in perpetuity as various englishmen argued in disgust at the time the british government effectively gave away the mineral rights of an entire country to private company registered on its great britains own shores without consulting the people of that country the white paper even implied certain degree of complicity between the british government and the company in maintaining the status quo after it had been challenged publicly on numerous occasions and accused of having its own narrow financial interests ahead of those of an entire nation it alleged that by the time of independence the british government had allegedly earned some 12 million in taxes on the royalties earned by the bsac rhodesia broken hill the rhodesia broken hill was formed by the rhodesia copper company and registered in london on 30 november 1904 the authorised capital was 550000 in shares of 1 each the first board of directors consisted of edmund davis rt hon lord gifford rt hon lord teynham ch villiers sir albert markham hw fox and pc tarbutt on 1 july 1929 the company was granted lease over 64 square miles adjacent to the mulunghushi river it financed these developments by increasing its capital to 1000000 in 1923 and doubled it two years later to extend the mulungushi scheme and erected large zinc and vanadium plant in 1925 anglo american corporation of south africa was appointed as the consulting engineers this contract was terminated in 1931 at the time when the worldwide depression was at its worst in 1936 the company was reconstructed with an authorised capital of 3500000 of which 3250000 was issued in 13000000 shares of 5s each the annual report for be for the year ended 31 march 1937 stated rhodesia broken hill the operations of the rhodesia broken hill development company limited during the year ended 31st december 1936 resulted in an output of 20730 tons zinc 179 tons fused vanadium oxide and 1250 tons of vanadium concentrates the company recently increased its capital upwards of 560 700 has been provided for development and equipment of the mine to greater depth to further the exploitation of the sulphide ores the future management of the undertaking has been transferred to the anglo american corporation of south africa and profitable future is anticipated rhodesian angloamerican formed part of the list of principal investments acquired by the glazer brothers in 1955 below find diagram of the financial interrelationships in 1962 pic the annual report for be for the year ended 31 march 1973 stated that claims for compensation for the three farms which had been expropriated have been lodged through the foreign and commonwealth office in london and the directors anticipate that adequate compensation will be received according to sams 1992 memorandum however such compensation was never received this is not to say that there were agreements over other portions of land held by be and any other companies which had been assigned land by the bsac subsequent writings make mention of any agreement between the government of zambia and companies with claims to mineral rights ownership rather they make it emphatically clear that the ownership of minerals in zambia reverted to the state with independence for example publication by muna ndulo called mining rights in zambia isbn 998201 0018 states emphatically that the property in all minerals within zambia is vested in the president on behalf of the people of zambia however the question remains whether deal was done behind the scenes to the satisfaction of all parties company interrelationships in 1962 pic mineral rights and the big concession the area northwest of mumbwa zambia pic pic pic pic 7 conclusion the countries in africa are heavily in debt one only has to look at who owns that debt to know who pulls the strings in those countries and therefore who is influencing the political landscape an inspection of those banking groups other interests may reveal something of the bigger picture in 2003 zambia caved in to pressure from the international monetary fund imf to sell 49 of the stateowned zambian national commercial bank zanaco absa was preferred bidder and is presently one of only two horses still in the race along with crowd called african international financial holdings ltd wwwafricaonlinecom 21 january 2004 according to report in business report on 1 april 2003 the country had sold more than 250 stateowned firms including copper mines since 1992 under pressure from the imf and other lenders report on the website wwwunion networkorg dated 29 january 2003 stated that absa had foreign debt of more than 63 billion and was asking for debt relief to help cut poverty in country where three out of four people live on less than 1 day according to the same report its decision to stop the privatisation program had threatened more than 1 billion of debt relief from the imf the 2004 report by africaonlinecom stated that the successful privatisation of zanaco is one of the conditions for zambias attainment of the highly indebted poor countries completion point expected by the middle of this year another debtforequity tradeoff and absa is in the front of the queue what will they extract as means of securing payment of the countrys debts absa was formed in 1992 from the amalgamation of number of south african banks including volkskas which was glazers partner in number of ventures under the directorship of dr danie cronje the current chairman of absa volkskas took over glazers 25 share of volkskas international in 1984 the year that glazer died absa also owns 26 increased to 50 in 2003 of commercial bank of zimbabwe and 55 of national bank of commerce ltd tanzania mcgregors who owns whom 2004 edition the 1973 annual report for be stated clearly and simply that its fixed assets included mineral rights and that its dividends took the form of income received from mineral rights while further income from mineral rights was listed in subsequent reports the ownership of mineral rights remained feature of the companys fixed assets until they were transferred to tati in 1987 prior to the companys voluntary liquidation letter from the zambian registry of lands and deeds dated 5 june 2003 confirmed that farms 157a 158a and 159a were compulsorily acquired under section 19 of the lands acquisition act of 1969 it also confirmed that tati company limited currently owns farms 709 and 726 in letter dated 24 august 1995 addressed to mr j levison of leviton boner consulting the administrators disputed valuation by leviton boner of the assets of the trust leviton boner were acting for michele attempting to secure her rights to settlement of the first tranche in terms of the will which had been due since july 1994 they were also arguing for an early settlement of her share of the estate in the letter the administrators argued for 50 discount of the unimproved land belonging to tati company due to the uncertain and longterm nature of the land they put the value of such discount at r9 743 548 this of course included the assets that had once belonged to be which by then was in voluntary liquidation the reasons for the voluntary liquidation of be were given by the administrators in memorandum dated 12 december 1995 responding to queries raised by hofmeyr attorneys on behalf of michele few weeks earlier the reasons they gave were as follows the company was sustaining losses in the years prior to liquidation b there was threat by the zimbabwean government of the expropriation of farms belonging to noncitizen farmers c there was threat that squatters would move onto the farms which squatters would have been difficult to evict d zimbabwean exchange control regulations prohibited the remittance of funds from zimbabwe to south africa and the administrators were not prepared to send money into zimbabwe during the lifetime of the late mr bernard glazer embassy investments south african company owned by glazer bros borrowed monies from be amounting to some z18 million the administrators did wish to remit funds to zimbabwe in repayment of that loan notwithstanding the periodical requests by the zimbabwean authorities to do so f large amount of estate duty became payable in zimbabwe on the death of the late bernard glazer this liability arose from the holding of his shares in tati company limited by glazer bros investments zimbabwe here again the administrators were not prepared to remit funds to zimbabwe in payment of such duty and the necessary funds were provided by the liquidation with the consent of the authorities press reports about land grabs in zimbabwe started in 1999 michele recorded in conversation with her attorney that her brother sam had boasted to her that theyd got out of zimbabwe just in time could it be that they had known what was coming after all the chaos seems to have served them well in terms of undervaluing the estate bernard glazer was busy and successful his whole life hed stamped his authority on the african scene along with his brother sam in the 1950s when they spent at least 5 million acquiring some of the biggest landholding companies in africa this excluded controlling bids for central mining investment corp rand mines 15 million pounds and london rhodesia lonhro based on the audited balance sheet of the glazer will trust as at 28 february 1995 the shares and bearer warrants in the bechuanaland exploration company plc bec held by glazer bros investments zimbabwepvt ltd and ultimately amarena holdings in panama were omitted from the computation of first distribution to michele glazer as bec is in voluntary liquidation what happened to those principal investments acquired in over 40 leading industrial mining and finance companies acquired with in the 1950s with assets worth over 1 million pounds by the time the first liquidation distribution ld accounts were prepared 40 years later the administrators could only find assets worth some r16 million by the time of the second and final ld it had actually shrunk to dutiable amount of r128 million the glazer will trust was also placed into voluntary liquidation in 2000 meanwhile donald gordon who had been an articled clerk at kessel feinstein when glazer was already millionaire has since become billionaire at the time of his death glazer held 2 000 shares in liberty holdings ltd valued at r21 100 retired sage chief louis shill was another exkessel feinstein protégé when the glazers already owned great chucks of africa shill retired to nettleton road in clifton cape town the most expensive little street in africa where mansion on the hill costs in excess of r25 million electronics billionaire bill venter lives in glacierlike mansion in this street and security development has been proposed that is intended for the likes of george bush sr who has apparently become regular visitor to south africa if bernard glazers administrators are to be believed he did not enjoy similar success with his finances instead his growth levelled out in what if it was true would be one of the most spectacularly poor portfolio showings of modern history top johannesburg leaders pay tribute to feinstein as he retires grant thornton press release 10 may 2002 julius feinstein who
