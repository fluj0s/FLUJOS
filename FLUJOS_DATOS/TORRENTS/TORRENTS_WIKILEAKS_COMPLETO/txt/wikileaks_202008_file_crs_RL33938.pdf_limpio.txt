dieoffs due to varroa and tracheal mites the first varroa mite infestation was reported in 1987 tracheal mite s were first detected in 198413 varroa mites are also said to have eliminated most feral bee colonies in the mid1990s14 varroa parasitism affects both worker bees and male larvae and can affect the ability of the queen to reproduce it is associated with viral pathogens and if left untreated can cause colony mortalities usually within six months to two years after the initial infestation less is known about the eff ects of the tracheal mite the pathogen paenibacillus larvae is the most serious honey b ee pathogen and causes american foulbrood afb which is disease of rval honey bees af b resulted in large colony losses in the 1940s but its incidence has been reduced by the use of antibiotics and increased apiary inspection programs nevertheless mite and pathogen infestations have likely raised beekeeper operating costs to pay for miticides andor antibiotics labor and expenses for treatment improved management and inspection and colony replacement of dead bees symptoms similar to those observed for ccd have been described in the past and heavy losses have been documented it is still not clear whether the current colony losses are being caused by the same factors or if new contributing factors are involved15 maarec also reports that large beekeeper operations may have experienced higher than normal losses compared with the past few years and heavy overwintering losses were reported in 20032004 for many northern beekeepers overall usda reports

colony losses are occurring in large numbers and the reason why these losses are occurring remains still largely unknown the current phenomenon was first calle d falldwindle disease but was renamed because of the unusual characteristics of the colony declines moreover the condition is not only seasonal but manife sts itself throughout the year the term dwindle implies gradual loss whereas ccd onset is sudden also the term disappearance is used to describe othe r types of conditions which differ from the symptoms currently being associated with ccd finally the term disease is usually associated with biological agent but none has yet been identified26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33938crs9 27 d vanengelsdorp et fa ll dwindle disease investigations into the causes of sudden and alarming

adult worker bees few or dead bees found in the hive presence of immature bees brood small cluster of bees with live queen present and pollen and honey stores in hive among the key symptoms of ccd in collapsed colonies is that the adult population is suddenly gone without any accu mulation of dead bees the bees are not returning to the hive but are leaving behind their brood young bees their queen and maybe small cluster of adults what is uncharacteristic bout this situation is that the honey bee is very social insect and colonyoriented with complex and organized nesting colony failing to return to the hive is considered highly unusual an absence of large number of dead bees makes an analysis of the causes of ccd difficult also there is little evidence that the hive may have been attacked in actively collapsing colonies an insufficient number of adult bees remain to care for the brood the remaining workforce seems to be made up of young adult bees the queen is present appears healthy and is usually still laying eggs but the remaining cluster is reluctant to consume feed pr ovided by the beekeeper and foraging is greatly reduced possible causes of col ony collapse disorder the current search for factors invol ved in ccd focuses on four areas28 pathogens parasites environmental stresses and bee management stresses such as poor nutrition initially the potential causes of ccd as reported by the scientists researching this phenomenon were thought to include but not be limited to pa rasites mites and disease loads in the bees and brood em ergence of new or newly more

to the varroa mite new or emerging diseases especially mortality by new species of singlecelled parasite nosema ceranae pesticide exposure and potential immunes uppressing stress on bees due to one or combination of these factors30 in september 2007 res earch team that included usda published the results of genetic screening of ccdaffected honey bee colonies and nonccdaffected hives31 the only pathogen found in nearly all samples 961 from ccdaffected colonies but not in nonccd colonies was the israeli acute paralysis virus iapv dicistrovirus that can be transmitted by the varroa mite32 usda considers this research to have identified iapv as marker of ccd since it is found in affected bees but not to have identified iapv as the cause of ccd however this research indicates there is strong correlation of the appearance of iapv and ccd together33 early on researchers had tentatively removed some practices and conditions from the list of possible causes of ccd these included feeding practices chemicals used by beekeepers such as antibiotics and miticides use of bees primarily for honey production versus pollin ation and queen source34 however the scientists researching this phenomenon note that thes could contribute to the risk of bee colonies developing ccd some scientists also wonde r whether combination of the stressors including mites disease and nutritional stress are interacting to weaken bee colonies and are allowing stressrelated pathogens such as fungi thus causing final collapse35 others note the possible role of miticide resistance in

been found in the guts of the recoverable dead bees early evidence does suggest the possible presence of pathogen given that some bee colonies have recovered once their bee boxes were irradiated36 researchers have found the fungus nosema ceranae and other pathogens such as chalkbrood in some affected hives throughout the country37 some researchers have speculated that these high infection levels may be compromising the immune system of the honey bees resulting in immune deficiencies in bees that may be among the possible causes for bee mortalities and disappearance38 others have speculated that because most of the reported colony losses are among large commercial migratory operations which may move bees two to five times during growing season the current di sorder may be the result of accumulated stress and factors such as confinement nd temperature fluctuations these stresses may increase the colonys susceptibility to disease and may also increase its potential exposure to other diseases and parasites39 10 dieoff is not uncommon following transportation w ith losses of 30 possible of the possible causes of ccd being examined one that has become the subject of debate is whether certain chemicals or combinations of chemicals could be contributing to ccd including some pestic ides and possibly some fungicides one class of insecticide being studied are neonicotinoids which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid and similar other chemicals such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam honey bees are thought possi bly to be affected by such chemicals which are known to work their way through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar and pollen which is the food for young developing bees the scientists studying ccd have tested samp of pollen and

the doses taken up by bees are not lethal but they are concerned about possible chr onic problems caused by long term exposure as noted by the nrc some studies report subletha l effects of pesticides on bee foraging behavior that may impair the navigati onal and foraging abilities of honey bees41 concerns about imidacloprid as reported by beekeeping associations in the united kingdom and france42 and by some us beekeepers43 have focused on its potential to affect complex behaviors in insects including flight navigation olfactory memory recruitment foraging and coordination however the nrc and some scientists who study ccd note there is conflicting informa tion about the effect of these pesticides on honey bees still the us environmental protection agency has identified some of these chemi cals as highly toxic to honey bees44 and use of some of these pesticides has reportedly b een discontinued in parts of europe because of their potential effects on pollinators45 however bee colony losses are also occurring in europe where these chemical s are reportedly longer used in the united states the organic consumers association reports that bee colony losses are not occurring at organi c beekeeping operations46 other reported theories include the eff ects of shifting spring blooms and earlier nectar flow associated with broader global climate and temperature changes47 the effects of

its action plan for ddressing cdc in july 2007 usdas action plan focuses on improving coordinati on and redirecting existing resources and research for mitigation and prevention incl uding education and outreach as well as expanding research and diagnostic resources to prevent future losses working with the land grant universities it also coordinates activities across three usda agencies agricultural research service ars animal and plant health inspection service aphis and cooperative state resear ch education and extension service csrees usdas focus on expanded research is consistent with the approach taken in the most recently introduced c ongressional bills and with recommendations by the american honey producers association and the american beekeeping federation51 under the plan usda will 1 conduct surv eys and collect data on bee health 2 analyze bee samples for pests disease causing pathogens pesticide exposure and other factors 3 conduct c ontrolled experiments to iden tify factors affecting bee health including potential causes of co lony collapses and 4 develop best management practices and guidelines to improve the general b ee health and reduce their

throughout the united states in june 2007 the subcommittee on fisheries wildlife and oceans of the house committ ee on natural resources held hearing on the role of pollinators in ecosystem h ealth which also addr essed concerns about bee colony declines in april 2008 chai rwoman barbara boxer and other members of the senate environment and public works committee hosted briefing on pollinators and their role in agricultural security policy options discussed at these cong ressional hearings and briefings have focused on the need for increased federal funding for multidisciplinary research and monitoring to document changes in pollination reserves as well as additional technical support and assistan ce for beekeepers additiona l research funding would help support usdas research efforts and thos at its laboratories located in arizona louisiana maryland texas and utah56 other recommended options include expanding crop insurance to include b eekeepers and honey producers providing onetime payment for incurred losses improving existing usda conservation programs to better prevent habitat loss and sustain w ildlife populations emphasizing the importance of pollinator diversity nd

agricultural chemicals and continuing th current marketing loan program for honeyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33938crs15 on may 22 2008 congress enacted the 2008 farm bill pl 110234 the enacted bill contains provisions that would among other things provide additional funding for research and conservation programs addressing honey bees and pollinators the bill reflects provisions that were included in both the house and senatepassed versions of the farm bill which provided for honey bees and pollinators as part of their conservati on specialty crop res earch and miscellaneous title provisions below is summary of these provisions the conservation title of the 2008 farm bill includes language that broadly encourages habitat development and protection among the administrative requirements for native and managed pollinators under usdas conservation programs section 2708 and ensures that usdas conservation t echnical assistance includes standards that account for nativ and managed pollinators section 2706 the inclusion of these provisions c ould broaden the focus of usdas farm conservation programs to include pollinator habitats and habitat improvement among the goals of these programs as well as require usda to review its conservation practice standards with respect to managed and native pollinators in addition the research title of the 2008 farm bill identifies pollinator protection among its socalled highpriority research and extension areas section 7204 this provision provides for research and extension grants 1 to survey and collect data on bee colony production nd health 2 to investigate pollinator biology immunology ecology genomics an d bioinformatics 3 to conduct research on various factors that may be contributing to or associated with colony collapse disorder and other serious threats to the health of honey bees and other pollinators including parasites and pathogens of pollinators and the sublethal effects of insecticides herbicides and fungicides on honey bees and native and managed pollinators 4 to develop mitigative and preventative measures to improve native and managed pollinator health and 5 to promote the health of honey bees and native pollinators through habitat conservation and best management practices for this provision the 2008 farm bill authorizes appropriations for grants at 10 million annually for fy2008fy2012 the research title provisions also directs usda to increase its capacity and infrastructure to address colony collapse disorder and other longterm threats to pollinator health including hiring add itional personnel and to conduct research on colony collapse disorder and other pollinat or issues at usdas facilities annual appropriations are authorized at 725 million fy20082012 with nothe r 275 million annually fy20082012 for honey bee pest and pathogen surveillance the 2008 farm bill also directs usda to submit an annual report to congress on its response to colony collapse disorder indi cating that the report should investigate the causes of honey bee colony collapse and recommend appropria strategies to reduce colony loss additional provisions in the 2008 farm bill supporting pollinators are provided for in the enacted bills crop insurance and other disaster assistance provisions one such provision identifies honey farms as possible beneficiaries of the bills supplemental agricultural disaster ssistance section 12033 another provision provides contracts for additi onal policies and studies to carry out research and development regarding insurance policies that cover loss of bees section 12023httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33938crs16 the enacted bill also contains provisi ons that generally support honey production these include for example provisions pe rtaining to the national honey board section 1040110402 provisions c overing rates for marketing assistance loans for certain commodities including honey sec tion 1202 and other provisions covering certain nutrition title provisi ons such as section 4231
