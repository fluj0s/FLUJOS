pins econ subject erdogan and ak party after two years in power trying to get grip on themselves on turkey on europe u classified by ambassador eric edelman reasons eo 12958 14 abcd 1 c summary pm erdogan and his ruling ak party seem to have firm grip on power if for other reasons that there is currently viable alternative and inertia weighs heavily in politics nevertheless erdogan and his party face enormous challenges if they are successfully to embrace core principles of open society carry out eu harmonization and develop and implement foreign policies in harmony with core us interests end summary 2 c as pm erdogan strode through the eu corridors of power dec 1617 with his semipro soccer players swagger and phalanx of sycophantic advisors he may have seemed strong candidate for european leader of the year regional leader to be reckoned with for decade to come the man who won turkey the beginning of accession negotiations with the eu who broke loose three decades of frozen turkish policy on cyprus who drove major human rights reforms through parliament and through constitutional amendments whose rhetorical skill while etched with populist victimhood is redolent with traditional and religious allusions that resonate deeply in the heartland deeply in the anonymous exurban sprawls who remains the highly popular tribune of the people without viable or discernible political rivaloutside his own ruling akp 3 c in short erdogan looks unbeatable but is he and is he willing to give relations with the us the leadership and momentum they need from the turkish side 4 c erdogan has twothirds majority in parliament main opposition leftofcenter chp amounts to more than bunch of elitist anklebiters there is currently serious broadbased political alternative owing to erdogans rhetorical dominance and control of the debate on social questions close to the hearts of the centerright majority in turkey other party leaders political bankruptcy and the stultifying effect of current party and election laws on entry for younger untainted political aspirants akp argues that the economy at least from the perspective of macro indicators and continued willingness of emergingmarket portfolio investors to buy the expectations and sell the facts appears to have stabilized moreover the authority of akps nationwide party machine is blurring with the turkish states executive power at the provincial and district level and with municipal functions to an extent not seen since the days of the oneparty state these factors seem set to continue for the foreseeable future 5 c yet erdogan and akp face politically fateful challenges in three areas foreign policy eu iraq cyprus quality and sustainability of leadership and governance and resolution of questions fundamental to creation of an open prosperous society integrated with the broader world place of religion identity and history rule of law eu 6 u erdogan indexed his political survival to getting negotiation date from the eu he achieved that goal the wall street journal and other western and turkish media have opined that the eu owes turkey fair negotiating process leading to accession with the journal even putting the onus on the eu by asserting that while turkey is ready the question is whether europeans are ready for turkey 7 c but theres always monday morning and the debate on the ground here is not so neat with euphoria at getting date having faded in 48 hours erdogans political survival and the difficulty of the tasks before him have become substantially clearer nationalists on right and left have resumed accusations that erdogan sold out turkish national interests cyprus and turkish traditions core institutions of the turkish state which remain at best wary of akp have once again begun to probe for weaknesses and to feed insinuations into the press in parallel with the nationalists assertions in the face of this euroaversion neither erdogan nor his government has taken even minimal steps to prepare the bureaucracy or public opinion to begin tackling the fundamental some turks would say insidious legal social intellectual and spiritual changes that must occur to turn harmonization on paper into true reform the road ahead will surely be hard 8 u highprofile naysayers like main opposition chp chairman baykal former ambassador gunduz aktan and political scientist hasan unal continue to castigate erdogan but theirs is routine whine more significant for us is that many of our contacts cloak their lack of selfconfidence at turkeys ability to join in expressions of skepticism that the eu will let turkey in and there is parallel widespread skepticism that the eu will be around in attractive form in ten years 9 c the mood in akp is brighter with one of fonmin guls mfa advisors having described to uk polcounselor how bruised turkey feels at the eus inconsistency during the final negotiations leading to dec 17 eu diplomats in ankara have given us the other side of the story gul was noticeably harderline than erdogan in public comments in the leadup to the summit and was harderline in presummit negotiations in brussels according to uk polcounselor there was noticeable tension between erdogan and gul in brussels according to aksam ankara bureau chief nuray basaran she also noted to us that when negotiations seemed to have frozen up on dec 17 erdogans advisors got phone calls from putin advisors urging turkey to walk basaran says that at least some of erdogans advisors urged him to do so 10 c akps lack of cohesion as party and lack of openness as government is reflected in the range of murky muddled motives for wanting to join the eu we have encountered among those akpers who say they favor pursuing membershipor at least the process some see the process as the way to marginalize the turkish military and what remains of the arid secularism of kemalism we have also run into the rarely openlyspoken but widespread belief among adherents of the turkislam synthesis that turkeys role is to spread islam in europe to take back andalusia and avenge the defeat at the siege of vienna in 1683 as one participant in recent meeting at akps main think tank put it this thinking parallels the logic behind the approach of fonmin gul ally and chief foreign policy advisor in the prime ministry ahmet davutoglu whose muddy opinion piece in the dec 13 international herald tribune is in essence call for oneway multicultural tolerance ie on the part of the eu 11 c those from the more overtly religious side of akp whinge that the eu is christian club while some assert that it is only through turkish membership and spread of turkish values that the world can avoid the clash of civilizations they allege the west is fomenting others express concern that harmonization and membership will water down islam and associated traditions in turkey indeed as akp whip sadullah ergin confided to us recently if the eu says yes everything will look rosy for short while then the real difficulties will start for akp if the eu says it will be initially difficult but much easier over the long run 12 c akp also faces the nutsandbolts issue of how to prepare for harmonization in choosing chief negotiator erdogan will need to decide whether the risks that the man he taps will successfully steal his political limelight outweigh the political challenge his choice will face since it will be the turkish chief negotiators responsibility to sell the eu position to recalcitrant turkish cabinet it is because the chief negotiator is likely to be ground down between eu demands and prickly domestic environment that some observers speculate erdogan might give the job to his chief internal rival gul 13 c at the same time the government must reportedly hire couple thousand people skilled in english or other major eu languages and up to the bureaucratic demands of interfacing with the eurocrats who descend on ministries as harmonization starts if the government continues to hire on the basis of one of us ie from the sunni brotherhood and lodge milieu that has been serving as the pool for akps civil service hiring lack of competence will be problem if the government hires on the base of competence its new hires will be frustrated by the incompetence of akps previous hires at all levels questions about akp leadership and governance 14 c several factors will continue to degrade erdogans and akps ability to effect fair and lasting reforms or to take timely positive decisions on issues of importance to the us 15 c first is erdogans character 16 c in our contacts in anatolia we have not yet detected that erdogans hunger for absolute power and for the material benefits of power have begun to erode his grassroots popularity others disagree pollster and political analyst ismail yildiz has asserted in three lengthy expositions to us late in dec that the erosion has started we note that 1 yildiz expressed frustration to us that the akp leadership did not respond to his offer to provide political strategy services 2 he is currently connected to mainstream opposition figures and 3 he also runs conspiracytheory web site so we treat his view cautiously however judging by his references and past experience in the turkish state he appears to have maintained conncetions with the state apparatus and to have network of observers and data collectors in all 81 provinces 17 c inside the party erdogans hunger for power reveals itself in sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of others as former spiritual advisor to erdogan and his wife emine put it tayyip bey believes in godbut doesnt trust him in surrounding himself with an iron ring of sycophantic but contemptuous advisors erdogan has isolated himself from flow of reliable information which partially explains his failure to understand the context or real facts of the us operations in tel afar fallujah and elsewhere and his susceptibility to islamist theories with regard to islamist influences on erdogan defmin gonul who is conservative but worldly muslim recently described gul associate davutoglu to us as exceptionally dangerous erdogans other foreign policy advisors cuneyd zapsu egemen bagis omer celik along with mucahit arslan and chef cabinet hikmet bulduk are despised as inadequate out of touch and corrupt by all our akp contacts from ministers to mps and party intellectuals 18 c erdogans pragmatism serves him well but he lacks vision he and his principal akp advisors as well as fonmin gul and other ranking akp officials also lack analytic depth he relies on poorquality intel and on media disinformation with the narrow worldview and wariness that lingers from his sunni brotherhood and lodge background he ducks his public relations responsibilities he and those around him including fonmin gul indulge in pronounced prosunni prejudices and in emotional reactions that prevent the development of coherent practical domestic or foreign policies 19 c erdogan has compounded his isolation by constantly traveling abroad reportedly 75 foreign trips in the past two years with new series of trips planned for 2005 to russia eurasia the middle east and africa indeed his staff says 2005 is the year of africa but they provide coherent reason why this grueling cycle of travel has exhausted him and his staff and disrupted his ability to keep his hand on the tiller of party parliamentary group and government he has alienated many in the akp parliamentary group by his habit of harshly chewing out mps moreover we understand that musiad an anatoliawide group of businessmen influential in islamist circles who gave erdogan key financial support as akp campaigned prior to the 2002 elections is disaffected by erdogans unapproachability judging by comments to us of insiders in the influential islamist lodge of fethullah gulen such as publicist abdurrahman celik the lodge which has made some inroads into akp minister of justice cicek minister of culture and tourism mumcu perhaps 6080 of 368 mps some appointments to the bureaucracy has resumed the ambivalent attitude it initially had toward erdogan and akp 20 c second is the coalition nature of akp the limited number of ministers whom erdogan trusts and the efforts of some principally fonmin gul but from time to time cicek to undermine erdogan one else in akp comes close to erdogan in grassroots popularity however guls readiness to deprecate erdogan within akp and even to foreign visitors eg israeli deputy pm olmert and his efforts to reduce erdogans maneuvering room with hardline criticisms of us policy in iraq or eu policy on cyprus have forced erdogan constantly to look over his shoulder and in turn to prove his credentials by making statements inimical to good usturkish relations we expect erdogan to carry out partial cabinet reshuffle early in 2005 but he will be unable to remove the influence of gul 21 s third is corruption akp swept to power by promising to root out corruption however in increasing numbers akpers from ministers on down and people close to the party are telling us of conflicts of interest or serious corruption in the party at the national provincial and local level and among close family members of ministers we have heard from two contacts that erdogan has eight accounts in swiss banks his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his and that turkish businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four erdogan children in the us purely altruistically are lame 22 s among the many figures mentioned to us as prominently involved in corruption are minister of interior aksu minister of foreign trade tuzmen and akp istanbul provincial chairman muezzinoglu as we understand it from contact in the intel directorate of turkish national police continuing investigation into muezzinoglus extortion racket and other activities has already produced evidence incriminating erdogan in our contacts across anatolia we have detected willingness yet at the grassroots level to look closely at erdogan or the party in this regard but the trend is time bomb 23 s fourth is the poor quality of erdogans and akps appointments to the turkish bureaucracy at party headquarters and as party mayoral candidates broad range of senior career civil servants including defmin gonul former undersecretary of customs nevzat saygilioglu former forestry dirgen abdurrahman sagkaya and many others has expressed shock and dismay to us at the incompetence prejudices and ignorance of appointees such as omer dincer an islamist academic whom erdogan appointed undersecretary of the prime ministry the key position in the governmentstate bureaucracy dincer is despised by the tgs many interlocutors also point to the weakness of erdogans deputy party chairmen the result is that unlike former leaders such as turgut ozal or suleyman demirel both of whom appointed skilled figures who could speak authoritatively for their bosses as their party general secretary and as undersecretary of the prime ministry erdogan has left himself without people who can relieve him of the burden of daytoday management or who can ensure effective productive channels to the heart of the party and the heart of the turkish state two big questions 24 c turkeys eu bid has brought forth reams of pronouncements and articles mustafa akyols gulenisttinged thanksgiving for turkey in dec 27 weekly standard is one of the latest attempting to portray islam in turkey as distinctively moderate and tolerant with strong mystical sufi underpinning certainly one can see in turkeys theology faculties some attempts to wrestle with the problems of critical thinking free will and precedent ictihad attempts which compared to what goes on in theology faculties in the arab world may appear relatively progressive 25 c however the broad rubbermeetstheroad reality is that islam in turkey is caught in vise of 1 100 years of secular pressure to hide itself from public view 2 pressure and competition from brotherhoods and lodges to follow their narrow occult true way and 3 the faction and positivismridden aridity of the religious affairs directorate diyanet as result islam as it is lived in turkey is stultified riddled with hypocrisy ignorant and intolerant of other religions presence in turkey and unable to eject those who would politicize it in radical antiwestern way imams are for the most part poorly educated and all too ready to insinuate antiwestern antichristian or antijewish sentiments into their sermons exceptionally few muslims in turkey have the courage to challenge conventional sunni thinking about jihad or eg verses in the repentance shura of the koran which have for so long been used to justify violence against infidels 26 c the problem is compounded by the willingness of politicians such as gul to play elusively with politicized islam until turkey ensures that the humanist strain in islam prevails here islam in turkey will remain troubled defensive force hypocritical to an extreme degree and unwilling to adapt to the challenges of open society 27 c second question is the relation of turkey and its citizens to history the history of this land and citizens individual history subject to rigid taboos denial fears and mandatory gross distortions the study of history and practice of historiography in the republic of turkey remind one of an old soviet academic joke the faculty party chief assembles his party cadres and warning against various ideological threats proclaims the future is certain its only that damned past that keeps changing 28 c until turkey can reconcile itself to its past including the troubling aspects of its ottoman past in free and open debate how will turkey reconcile itself to the concept and practice of reconciliation in the eu how will it have the self confidence to take decisions and formulate policies responsive to us interests some in akp are joining what is still only handful of others to take tentative but nonetheless inspiring steps in this regard however the road ahead will require massive overhaul of education the introduction and acceptance of rule of law and fundamental redefinition of the relation between citizen and state in the words of the great alevi anatolian bard asik veysel this is long and delicate road 29 u baghdad minimize considered edelman
