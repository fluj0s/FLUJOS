robert keith specialist in american national government government and finance division summary during the period encompassing fy19862002 the budgetary decisions of congress and the president were guided in part by specific goals in statute enforced by process known as sequestration the statutory goals initially took the form of deficit targets but later were changed to limits on discretionary spending first effective for fy1991 and payasyougo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation first effective for fy1992 five sequesters were triggered during years in which congress and the president did not adhere to these statutory goals three under the deficit targets and two under the discretionary spending limits sequester occurred however after fy1991 in many of the years since fy1991 congress and the president were able to avoid sequester by ensuring that it did not enact spending or revenue legislation in violation of the statutory goals at times congress and the president had to take advantage of flexibility in the procedures such as the ability to designate certain spending as emergency requirements in order to achieve this outcome in other instances however congress and the president prevented sequester that otherwise would have occurred by enacting into law provisions that intervened in the normal operation of the process this report will not be updated the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 set forth deficit targets leading to balanced budget and established the sequestration process as the means of enforcing them the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 amended the 1985 act to effectively replace the deficit targets with two new enforcement mechanismslimits on discretionary spending ie spending controlled through the annual appropriations process and payasyou go paygo requirement applicable to legislation affecting direct spending ie spending controlled outside of the annual appropriations process and revenues procedures under the bea of 1990 were revised and extended affecting legislation enacted through fy2002 by several laws including the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the budget enforcement act of 1997 and the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 among others congressional research service the library of congress crs2 sequestration involved automatic largely acrosstheboard spending reductions to bring projected budget levels in line with the statutory goals1 any sequester under the discretionary spending limits the paygo requirement or both would have been triggered by report issued by the director of the office of management and budget omb within 15 days after the end of congressional session if the omb directors report indicated that spending cuts must be made then the president was required to issue sequestration order immediately directing that the necessary cuts be made in strict conformity with the omb directors report in the case of discretionary spending further sequester for fiscal year would have occurred during the following session through june 30 if the enactment of supplemental appropriations act caused breach of the limits the enactment of such measure on or after july 1 would not have caused sequester instead the applicable discretionary spending limits for the following fiscal year would have been reduced by the requisite amounts under sequestration tied to the deficit targets half of the required outlay savings were to be achieved by cuts in defense programs and the other half by cuts in domestic programs sequestration keyed to the discretionary spending limits applied to different categories of discretionary spending eg defenseinternationaldomestic or defensenondefense which varied over time sequestration under the paygo requirement applied first to selected programs that were covered under special rules such as 4 limit on medicare cuts any further paygo savings were to be achieved by uniform reductions in the remaining nonexempt programs except for programs covered by paygo special rules all reductions made under sequester had to comply with the uniform reduction percentage applicable to each category the reduction percentage would have been applied uniformly to all appropriations and budget accounts within the category and the reductions also would have had to be extended uniformly to all of the programs projects and activities within each account the uniform reduction percentage could have varied from one category to another during the period that sequestration was in effect beginning with fy1986 sequesters were triggered five times see table 1 the first three sequesters occurred when deficit targets were in effect and the other two occurred in the first year that the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement were in effect the deficit targets were in effect from fy19861990 initial outlay savings associated with the three deficit target sequesters were substantial 117 billion for fy1986 200 billion for fy1988 and 161 billion for fy1990 the uniform reduction percentages ranged from 43 to 105 except for fy1986 these savings subsequently were rescinded by budget agreement fy1988 or were reduced by later law to 455 billion for fy1990 notwithstanding the implementation of sequester for each of these three fiscal years the deficit targets proved to be ineffective on the whole the actual deficit for each of these years exceeded the applicable target by an average of about 60 billion 1 for additional information on the sequestration process see crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith crs3 during the remaining years covering fy19912002 sequestration applied to the enforcement of the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement although the paygo requirement applied to legislation enacted by the end of fy2002 it also applied to the outyear effects of such legislation through fy2006 two sequesters under the discretionary spending limits occurred for fy1991 drafting error in the foreign operations appropriations act for fy1991 triggered sequester initially expected to yield 191 million in outlay savings but the drafting error was corrected in later legislation and the savings were canceled supplemental appropriations act for fy1991 inadvertently caused small breach leading to an across theboard cut in domestic spending of 13 tenthousandths of one percent 13 for every one million dollars in an account that yielded 14 million in outlay savings sequesters under the discretionary spending limits occurred after fy1991 although congress and the president had to enact special legislation to avoid problems for fy200020022 paygo sequester ever occurred but congress and the president also had to enact special legislation to prevent paygo sequesters in recent years finally pl 107312 enacted on december 2 2002 effectively terminated the paygo requirement for the outyears fy20032006 thereby preventing sequesters for each of the four years3 2 for discussion of actions taken to avoid sequesters during this period see crs

paygo sequesters for this yearsf crs5 outlay reductions under the fy1986 sequester were limited by the 1985 balanced budget act to this amount b the fy1988 sequester was in effect from october 20 until december 22 1987 when legislation implementing budget summit agreement of november 20 was enacted outlay reductions of 200 billion were expected to occur had the sequester been in effect for the full fiscal year c the required outlay reduction of 161 billion was reduced to 575 billion by section 11002 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 and new sequestration order consistent with the lower amount was issued cbo estimated that the application of the crediting rule under section 252f of the 1985 balanced budget act would reduce the savings from 575 billion to 455 billion d two sequesters under the discretionary spending limits occurred for fy1991 on november 9 1990 395 million in budget authority was sequestered in the international category leading to estimated outlay savings of 191 million the sequester was rescinded on april 10 1991 by section 401 of pl 10227 supplemental appropriations act on april 25 1991 24 million in budget authority was sequestered in the
