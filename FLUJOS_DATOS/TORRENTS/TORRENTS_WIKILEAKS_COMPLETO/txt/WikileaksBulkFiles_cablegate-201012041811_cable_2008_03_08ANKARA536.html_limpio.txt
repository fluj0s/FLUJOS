constitution ref ankara 526 and previous classified by polcouns janice g weiner reasons 14 b d 1 c summary turkeys ruling justice and development party akp is drafting miniconstitutional amendment package to attempt to overcome the closure case filed against it in constitutional court the package will include temporary clause that would wipe out existing closure cases including against the prokurdish democratic society party dtp if necessary the got would be prepared to take the package to referendum end summary 2 c xxxxx told us march 19 the party is hard at work on miniconstitutional amendment package the party sees the closure case as political in nature its intent he stated is to decapitate the party and ban pm erdogan from politics by the weekend small akp committee will have drafted package to deal with future party closure cases it will include temporary article intended to eliminate existing closure cases including the case against the dtp akp will then sit down and talk with the nationalist action party mhp in parliament which according to mhp general secretary cihan pacaci is drafting its own package pacaci will speak to mhps proposal on the floor of parliament march 20 in manner designed to condemn party closures in general and avoid the specifics of existing cases 3 c with respect to the concern voiced by many that the current case is untouchable because article 138 of the constitution prohibits legislative activity on ongoing cases xxxxx said that much in the large body of legislation parliament has passed in akps five years in government has touched on issues before the courts it is basic principle of turkish law that if new provision works in someones favor the person may benefit from it if it would work against the person it does not apply they will forge ahead 4 c xxxxx akp will work at compromise with mhp if that is not possible akp will push the package through parliament akp on its own likely with dtp which stands to benefit has more than the 330 votes required to send constitutional amendment package to referendum pacaci who claimed to know the contents of the akp package said he did not like it he confirmed that in the absence of agreement with mhp which would give the package vote total that would obviate the need for referendum akp would likely send it to referendum 5 c asked whether akp in pushing such package was not playing with fire xxxxx responded the party had concluded it would be more dangerous for the country to go through another prolonged period of political and economic instability and uncertainty than to face this head on it was preferable to take abrupt decisive action to cut off the closures cases then the got could proceed with its agenda he did not believe this was matter in which the military would interfere both xxxxx to us that akp had made mistakes including failure actively to push its parliamentary agenda in recent months and its failure when it dealt with article 69 on party closures in 2005 to limit the chief prosecutors sole discretion to file closure case but the party did not deserve to be closed nor did the 47 of the people who had voted for akp 6 c comment the akp appears determined to fight this head on this is wellaligned with pm erdogans streetfighter instincts and with the partys reaction to the april 27 2007 ecoup they are indeed playing with fire but to be fair the fire was lit under them first if the package moves through parliament to referendum it is hard to believe it would not garner solid majority visit ankaras classified web site at
