following the month of enrollment in general an individual who does not enroll during his or her initial enrollment period will only be able to enroll durin g the annual open enrollment period which will run from november 15 to d ecember 31 each year coverage will begin the following january 1 thus individuals first eligible for medicare on or before january 31 2006 who fail to enroll by may 15

costs paid under the new part d medicaid will long er pay for drugs that could be covered under part d2 there were more than 6 million dual eligibles who needed to be enrolled in part d plan cms established an autoenrollment process which was intended to assure there was gap in coverage the autoenrollment process was random among plans with premiums at or below the lowincome benchmark premium which is weighted average of premiums in the area see the discussion below on the implementation of the autoenrollment process httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33268crs3 3 the qmb program pays medicare parts

meeting the additional workload requirements of the medicar drug benefit for additional information see angeles times article r alonsozaldivar drugplan woes spread past medicare feb 4 2006there are number of differences among available plans key differences are drugs included in plan formularies and pharmacies participating in the plan as network pharmacies some dual eligibles may find that they have been autoenrolled in plan which may not best meet their needs for this reason they are able to change enrollment at any time with cove rage under the new plan effective the following month this is the only population group that has this option it should be noted that if an enrollee selects plan with premium above the lowincome benchmark he or she is re quired to pay the difference other persons qualif ying for extra help other lowincome persons in second group automatically qualify for ssistance in meeting part d medicare premium and costsharing re quirements these are indi viduals who do not meet the criteria for full benefit dual eligibles but who are currently enrolled in medicare savings programs ie th qualified medicare beneficiary qmb program the specified lowincome medicare beneficiary slmb program and the qualified individual qi1 program3 or the supplemental security income program in the spring of 2005 cms mailed letters to these persons informing them that they would automatically qualify for lowincome subsidies other lowincome persons may qualify but they will n eed to submit an application in 2005 the social security administration ssa sent application forms to lowincome persons who the agen cy identified as possibly qualifying for extra help ssa makes eligibility determinations for those who fill out the applications4 federal efforts are not expected to identify all persons potentially entitled to lowincome assistance persons who think they might qualify need to file an application with ssa or their state medicaid office cms will facilitate enrollment in part d plans for persons identified as qualifying for extra help exclusive of dual eligibles lowincome individuals who have not selected plan by the close of the initial enrollment period may 15 2006 will be randomly enrolled in plan with coverage effective june 1 2006 the facilitated rollment process will be similar to that for autoenrollment for dual eligibles namely persons will be randomly enrolled in plans with premiums at or below the lowincome benchmark however they will only be able to switch plans once during 2006 with the new coverage effective the

implementation to the new part d benefit the program ex perienced number of problems during the initial days of operation the major problems appeared to be related to the transfer of the dual eligibles from medicaid to medicare drug coverage on january 1 2006 the following highlights some of the problem s that have been reported in the press and elsewhere many dual eligibles were leaving pharmacies without needed medications because their eligibility could not be verified or transition policies were not applied lowincome persons had difficulty getting information on medicare tollfree lines or had difficulty getting information targeted to dual eligibles or other lowincome persons pharmacists had long waits on phone lines when trying to verify information pharmacists were unable to make eligibility determinations with thee1 query see the discussion of this query system below cms and state eligibility data did not always match with the result that not all dual eligibles were identifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33268crs5 6 cms has also contracted with perse technologies to serve as the part d programs troop facilitator for plans troop stands for true outofpocket drug costsindividuals who were autoenrolle d in plan but changed their enrollment were showing up as not enrolled or enrolled with two plans pharmacies did not know that an individual was lowincome subsidy individual and therefore subject to reduced copayments individuals were unable to contact pdps on timely basis cms actions to address enrollment issues autoenrollment prior to implementation of part d the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms took number of actions designed to assu re that dual eligibles did not face coverage gap in may 2005 cms mailed letter to ll full benefit dual eligibles informing them that they automatically qualified for the lowincome subsidy and did not need to apply in novemb er 2005 cms mailed notices to dual eligibles informing them about the upcoming trans ition the enrollment process information on the plan they would be enrolled in if they failed to make another choice before january 1 2006 and how to obtain informati on on other plans available

pharmacy without the necessary documentation three contractors may be involved first an eligibility inquiry described in greater detail below is submitted to perse t echnologies formerly ndc health6 to determine whether the individual is enrolled in pdp and what plan the individual is enrolled in if the eligibility inquiry commonly refe rred to as an e1 inquiry does not identify plan wellpoint anthem national pd p the pos contractor is to provide pointof sale access to these persons provided they have evidence of both medicare and medicaid eligibility the pos process assures that beneficiaries do not leave the pharmacy without their medications the process applies only to full benefit dual eligibles ztech the enrollment contractor is to expedite validation of dual eligibility and return independently verified information on the individuals eligibility for enrollment cms has outlined the pos process as follows beneficiary presents at pharmacy with medicaid card or recent history of medicaid billing in the pharmacys patient profile systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33268crs6 pharmacist obtains photo id or other supporting documentation and submits an eligibility inquiry e1 query to perse technologies see discussion below if e1 query returns part d enrollment informati on the pharmacist bills the appropriate plan otherwise the process continues only if the pharmacist cannot identify the appropriate plan and the pharmacist is able to verify both medicaid and medicare eligibility the pharmacist enters the claim in the automated pharmacy systemthe pharmacist submits the claim to the single preestablished service account indicated on the po s contractor wellpoint payer sheet and the drug is provided at the 13 costsharing level the pos contractor wellpoint processes the claim as paid the pos contractor wellpoint sends daily file to the enrollment contractor on the beneficiary data submitted with the claim the enrollment contractor ztech uses the information to validatedual eligibility and returns validation of eligibility or ineligibility to the pos contractor if the individual is dually eligible and not enrolled in part d planthe pos contractor wellpoint rolls himher in pos contractor wellpoint plan with the individual having the option to choose another plan if the beneficiary is already enrolled in plan the pos

is outside the scope of this report however perse tec hnologies made several changes to the e1 system to correct earlyidentified problems after the implementation of the medicar part d drug benefit on january 1 2006 the primary issues identified with the operations of the e1 eligibility verification system were the slow res ponse time to queries submitted by pharmacies andor transactions being st

information about which plan an individual is enrolled in and how much an individual is required to pay for costsha ring these issues are somewhat more difficult to address because of the quality of the underlying data that feeds into the e1 eligibility verification system on february 1 2006 hhs reported that it has taken steps to improve the quality of data on dual eligible beneficiaries and to
