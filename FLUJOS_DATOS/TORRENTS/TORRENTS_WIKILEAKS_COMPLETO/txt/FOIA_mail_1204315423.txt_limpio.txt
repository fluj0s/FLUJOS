from ben santer santer1llnlgov to melissa free melissafreenoaagov subject re ijoc paper date fri 29 feb 2008 150343 0800 replyto santer1llnlgov cc john lanzante johnlanzantenoaagov philip d jones pjonesueaacuk xflowed dear melissa thanks for your comments on the ijoc paper here are few quick responses melissa free wrote hi ben ive looked through the draft and have some comments 1 i dont feel completely comfortable with the use of ssts rather than combined landsea surface temperatures for the lapserate analysis are we sure we have thought through the implications of this approach if you show that the relationship between ssts and tropical mean tropospheric temperatures is consistent between models and observations that seems to imply that they are not so consistent for land surfacetroposphere lapse rates could this be used to support the pielkechristy theory that land surface temperature trends are overestimated in the existing observational datasets i do feel comfortable with use of ssts rather than combined landocean temperatures to estimate changes in tropical lapse rates as isaac held pointed out the temperature of the free troposphere in the deep tropics follows moist adiabat which is largely set by the warmest ssts in areas experiencing convection the temperature of the free troposphere in the deep tropics is not set by temperatures over land so if you want to see whether observations and models show lapserate changes that are in accord with moist adiabatic lapse rate theory it makes sense to look at ssts rather than combined landocean surface temperatures admittedly the focus of this paper is not on amplification behavior still it does make sense to look at tropical lower tropospheric lapse rates in terms of their primary physical driver ssts as i tried to point out in the text of the ijoc paper models and rssbased estimates of lapserrate changes are consistent even if lapserate changes are inferred from combined landocean surface temperatures the same same does not hold for lapse rate changes estimated from hadcrut3v and uah data i must admit that i dont fully understand the latter result if you look at table 1 youll see that the multimodel ensemblemean temporal standard deviation of tsst is 0243 degrees c while the multimodel ensemblemean temporal standard deviation of tlo is higher 0274 degrees c this makes good physical sense since noise is typically higher over land than over ocean yet in the hadcrut3v data the temporal standard deviation of tlo 0197 degrees c is very similar to that of tsst for the hadisst1 and hadisst2 data hadisst2 is the sst component of hadcrut3v the fact that hadcrut3v appears to have very similar variability over land and ocean seems counterintuitive to could it indicate potential problem in the tropical land 2m temperatures in hadcrut3v i dont know ill let phil address that one the point is that weve done at least in my estimation thorough job of looking at the sensitivity of our significance test results to current observational uncertainties in surface temperature changes 2 the conclusion seems like too much of dissertation on past history of the controversy as i pointed out in my email of feb 26th i had specific concern about the summary and conclusions section i think that many readers of the paper will skip all the statistical stuff and just read the abstract and the summary and conclusions i did want the latter section to be relatively selfcontained we could have started by saying here are the errors in douglass et and here is what we found but on balance i thought that it would be more helpful to provide some scientific context as i mentioned this morning the douglass et paper has received attention in high places not everyone who reads our response will be apprised of the history and context 3 regarding the time scale invariance of model amplification and the effects of volcanic eruptions on the trend comparisons i am attaching draft of my paper with john lanzante comparing volcanic signals in sonde datasets v models im not sure if the statements on page 45 of the ijoc paper are consistent with my findings i thought about sending you this paper before but it seemed like you were probably too busy with the ijoc paper to look at it ill look at your paper this weekend im not quire sure which statements on page 45 you are referring to 4 i suspect the statement in the last sentence of the conclusion wont represent the view of all authorsalthough its certainly dians view i dont think it is my view quite yet others have also queried this final paragraph at present it looks like it might be tough to accommodate the divergent views on this subject but ill certainly try my best im investigating an expedited internal review process and will let you know how it looks thanks for looking into the expedited review melissa with best regards ben ps i hope you dont mind that ive copied my reply to phil im hoping he can chime in on the issue of land surface temperature variability in the hadcrut3v data benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore
