conduct that significantly hinders lawful hunt on federal lands the conference report states that to be violation the conduct must be intentional and must be done with the intention of significantly hindering lawful hunt25 the statute also authorizes injunctive relief against violations the conference report gives examples of violations of the statute including using visual aural olfactory or physical stimuli to affect wildlife behavior ibid this suggests the possibility that court could construe mere words addressed to hunter as physical conduct if such words affected wildlife behavior or hunters concentration so as significantly to hinder hunt this apparently would not violate the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech provided that the statutes civil penalty were imposed on the speaker for the effect of the sound of his words and not for their content the statute states that the term conduct does not include speech protected by the first article of amendment to the constitution the statute does not otherwise define conduct or physical conduct but this of course would go without saying as congress cannot punish speech that is protected by the first amendment

103272 it was previously codified at 45 usc 7174 it is also known as the cruelty to animals act the live stock transportation act and the food and rest law as amended in 1994 it provides that rail carrier express carrier or common carrier except by air or water receiver trustee or lessee of one of those carriers or an owner or master of vessel transporting animals across state lines may not confine animals in vehicle or vessel for more than 28 consecutive hours without unloading the animals for feeding water and rest it also provides that animals being transported shall be unloaded in humane way into pens equipped for feeding water and rest for at least 5 consecutive hours the statute does not apply when animals are transported in vehicle or vessel in which the animals have food water space and an opportunity for rest the 28hour period is subject to the following exceptions sheep may be confined for an additional 8 consecutive hours without being unloaded when the 28hour period of confinement ends at night animals may be confined fora more than 28 hours when the animals cannot be unloaded because of accidental or unavoidable causes that could not have been anticipated or avoided when being careful and b 36 consecutive hours when the owner or person having custody of animals being transported requests in writing and separate from bill of lading or other rail form that the 28hour period be extended to 36 hours the twentyeight hour law is enforced by the attorney general who on learning of violation shall bring civil action to collect penalty of at least 100 but not more than 500 for each violation the statute does not provide for criminal penalties the statute does not mention any federal agency or official besides the attorney general but its 1906 version provided it shall be the duty of all us attorneys to prosecute all violations of this act reported by the secretary of agriculture and as noted above the 1994 amendment was intended to be without substantive change to the 1906 version in addition in 1963 the usda issued regulations under the act that remain in effect 9 cfr 891895 therefore it appears that the usda continues to play role in enforcing the act in 2006 noting that the plain meaning of the statut ory term vehicle in the twentyeight hour law includes trucks which operate as express carriers or common carriers the usda decided for the first time to interpret the act to include the transportation of animals by trucks 27 in the same document in which it announced this decision the usda noted the twentyeight house law was never construed as being applicable to poultry and usda does not intend to change this longstanding interpretation of the statute 26 hrept 103180 103rd cong 2nd sess 1994 at 1 reprinted in 1994 us
