aliens are aliens who have committed crimes that make them removable the potential pool of removable criminal aliens is in the hundreds of thous ands some are incar cerated in federal state or local

their criminal sentences so that the aliens can be removed from the united states in addition cap is directed at identifying criminal aliens in federal state and local prisons and assuring that these aliens are taken into ice custody at the completi on of their criminal sentences although federal prisons have syst em to notify ice when there is an alien in custody notification from state and local prisons and jails is not systematic and many criminal aliens are released after their criminal sentences are completed rather than taken into ice custody making it more difficult to locate the aliens

expressed concern over proper tr aining finite resources at the local level possible civil rights violations and the overall impact on communities some localities for example even provide sanctuary for illegal aliens and will generally promote policies that ensure such aliens will not be turned over to federal authorities nonetheless some observe rs contend that the fede ral government has

des 4 million for airport perimeter security program element that was not f unded in the presidents request the secure flight program for pres creening passengers against government terrorist watchlists woul d be funded at 28 million belo w the presidents request under the house bill reflecting frustration ove r the lack of complete cost estimate for system development and testing and th prospect that operational testing could slip from fy2008 until early fy2009 the bill continues the longstanding requirement for gao oversight and dhs cer tification that sp ecified operational requirements regarding data retention data security pr ivacy and mechanisms for redress are met prior to implementing the system on other than test basis the provision also prohibits the use of commercial data or algorithms to evaluate the risk of passengers whose names ar not included on any governme nt terrorist watch lists if the system does not check airline passenger names against the full terrorist watchlist the bill would require the assistant secretary for transportation security to certify that checking passengers against subset of this list does not raise any security risks all other transporta tion threat assessment and credentialing ttac programs would be f unded at the levels specified in the presidents request the house bill also provides funding for surface

equipment purchase and installation 89 milli on more than the presidents request but 31 million below the amount specified in the house bill the senate bill would consolidate maintenance costs for baggage and checkpoint screening technologies as requested in the presidents request however citing slow procurement decisions and large unobligated balances for acquis ition of emerging passenger screening systems and related maintenance costs the senate bill would provide 7 million less than the presidents request for screening technologies maintenance and utilities while the senate committee

an amendment approved by the senate samdt 2461 would shift 3 million from transportation security s upport to aviation security to provide increased funding for law enforcement reimbursable agreements that provide state and local law enforcement presence at passenger screening checkpoints the senate bill specifies 28 million for the secure flight program 3 million more than the amount specified in

requirements for the program despite 18 months of reb aselining the program and years of work to develop passenger prescreening system however the senate bill includes provision that would give the tsa author ity to transfer the additional 25 million sought if the tsa can demonstrate significant improvement in the program supported by the findings of an ongoing gao review like the house bill the senate bill would keep in force the longstanding stipulation that secure flight may not be deployed for any purpose other th an system testing until the gao finds that all issues identified in

the presidents request and 112 million above enacted base and supplemental appropriations made in fy2007 fy2008 appropriations for av iation security total 4809 million which is below both the housepassed and senatepassed bills however those bills did not consider the additional 250 million in nondiscretionary deposits from passenger security fees to the checkpoint screenin g security fund established under pl 110 53 nor did the original bills consider the reauthorization of aviation security capital fund at its nondiscretionary funding level of 250 million also from passenger security fees adding these ms to discretionary appropriations provided in the act yields total of 5309 million which is slight decrease in funding compared with fy2007 base and supplementa l appropriations for aviation security plus the 250 million pl aced in the aviation security capital fund which totaled 5372 million the fy2008 appropriations how ever provided the federal air marshal service fams with

housepassed amount and 235 milli on less than the natepassed amount this combined with the 250 million in collec tions to be deposited into the aviation security capital fund yields total of 544 million which represents rough compromise between the housepassed and natepassed funding levels rather than sizable budget cut similarly to account for the creation of the checkpoint screening security fund division of pl 110161 eliminated funding for the checkpoint support activity which the house had proposed to fund at the same level this fund provides for ie 250 million wh ereas the presidents request and the senate had both specified 136 million for this activity thus the net result on the tsas budget for checkpointre lated technologies is in line with the housepassed funding am

used to fund wide array of mandated aviation and surface transportation security activities with regard to surface transportation security in general enacted amounts were identical to those specified in the presidents request and passed by both the house and the senate division of pl 110161 also included several general pr ovisions related to transportation security notably section 513 continues longstanding appropriations requirement specifying that the dhs mu st certify and the gao must report to congress that all conditions pertaining to privacy protection data security and redress have been adequately addressed before secure f light or any other successor prescreening program is imple mented other than on test basis tsa has indicated that it will finalize plans to implement secure flight in fy2008 prompting additional appropriations for this program whereas the house and senate had passed amounts of 25 and 28 million respectively the enacted appropriation for secure flight was set at 50 milli on roughly in line with the presidents request section 521 specifies that an prior year funds for aviation security that are deobligated or recovered sha ll be available solely for the purpose of procuring and installing explosives detection systems for checked baggage carryons or air cargo section 542 establishes civil penalties for airport vendors nd contractors that fail to collect airport security badges from ter minated employees section 565 requires the dhs to establish an international registered traveler program within two years the international registered traveler progra m is to incorporate technologies such as biometrics and epassports along with security threat assessments and it is to complement us visit and the visa waiv er program secti on 568 appears to have the effect of eliminating the tsas current acquisition management system which was based on faa acquisition management within six months bringing the tsa in line with dhswide acquisition management regulations and practices also section 571 specifies that within 90days after enactment participants in the registered traveler rt program may satisfy checkpoint identification requirements by presenting their biometric rt card in lieu of providing governmentissued photo identification the tsa has required photo id entification for rt pa rticipants and has indicated to vendors its desire

appropriations language gao assessm ent of the tsas screener staffing allocation methodology among commercial passenger airpor ts found that the tsas underlying assumptions should be reassessed92 in particular the gao found that many medium and smaller sized airports were staffed at vels either above or below the allocation specified by the staffing thodology however at small and medium sized airports average peakperiod passenger wait times in screening queues have consistently met the goal of 10 minutes or less while the gao found that all but one major category x airport was staffed at levels consistent with the screener allocation meth odology the average pa ssenger wait times at these airports 126 minutes in fy2006 exceeded the target of 10 minutes or less among other large airports category i screener staffing was found to be in line with the staffing model at almost 80 of the airports and av erage passenger wait times 104 minutes in fy2006 were found to be just slightly above the 10minute target observations from these findings include the difficulty in predicting staffing needs at smaller and medium sized airports where changes in air carrier flight schedules can have more pronounced impact on screener staffing nd the possible need to more closely examine the persisting difficulties in achieving passenger wait time targets at large airports particularly among the busiest air ports in the country the joint explanatory statement accompanying division of pl 110161 directs the tsa to submit quarterly wait time data for all airports with above av erage wait times and for the 40 busiest airports in these reports the tsa is to explain any significant changes in wait times at airports while the presidents fy2008 budget proposed to eliminate the 45000 fte cap for tsos and add 955 additiona l screeners this increase will support the new travel document screening initiative and is not expected to address staffing imbalances or passenger wait time issues during th fy2008 appropriations debate screener staffing needs to address these issues may be topic of particular interest while neither the house nor the senate bills retain the longstanding screener cap minority view printed in house rept 110181 ques tioned the removal of this cap voicing concern that it would lead to poor strategic planning by hiring screeners rather than focusing on technology approaches to str eamline screening procedures that could reduce manpower needs provision in the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 11053 ex plicitly removes the cap and directs the tsa to hire as many personnel as dete rmined necessary to enhance security and reduce passenger wait time s to under 10 minutes in addition to screener

original housepassed and senatepassed versions of the implementing the 911 commission recomme ndations act of 2007 hr 1 would have placed tsa screeners under the same pe rsonnel management sy stem as all other tsa employees thereby extending to tsa screeners the right to collective bargaining these provisions however were excluded from the conference report on the bill hrept 110259 which became pl 11053 when the tsa was established in 2001 the aviation and trans portation security act atsa pl 107 71 gave the tsa administrator discreti on to implement an alternate personnel system for screeners which has to date barred screeners from collective bargaining tsa administrator kip hawley had cautioned that the direct cost to the tsa to set up collective bargaining program for tsa screeners would be 160 million93 tsas application of its performance based accountability and standards system for employees has been another ongoing issue in 2006 the tsa initiated performancebased management system

tsa has indicat ed that it is culling the lists it currently provides to airlines for passenger prescreening to reduce false matches while all of these initiatives could have an impact on reducing the burden on tsa screening resources particularly resources dedicated to secondary screening of passengers evaluating the impact of these initiatives may be an issue of particular interest to appropriators with regard to how they impact appropriations needs for screening resources screening technologies most of the currently deployed baggage explosives detection systems deployed in the 2002 and 2003 time frame have been in service for several years and are not as capable as newer next generation nextgen equipment with regard to bagga ge throughput and explosives detection capability

electronic baggage screening program ebsp strategic plan to optimize screening solutions at the 250 busiest airports with the goal of decreasing life cycle costs for baggage screening technologies faced with escalating ma intenance costs for baggage screening systems the effectiveness of this plan and its implementation may be an issue of particular interest for appropriators both the house and senate bills would increase funding for explosives det ection equipment procurement and installation above the requested levels the reaut horization of the aviation s ecurity capital fund and its nondiscretionary funding of 250 million combined with discretionary appropriation of 294 million fo r eds and etd purchase nd installation provides total of 544 million for the deployment of

known shipper program by incl uding freight forwarder management information riskbased freight assessmen t system and certif ied shipper program implementation of this initiative may be an issue of particular interest for the appropriations debate provision in pl 11053 requires the tsa to phasein physical inspections of all cargo placed on passenger airplanes under this provision 50 of all cargo placed on passenger airplanes would have to be inspected within 18 months and 100 of such cargo would have to be insp ected within three years of enactment it is unclear how such mandate would sp ecifically impact appropriations this is because the provision does not specifically indicate whether the screening would be federal function or whether it would be carried out by the airlines as is currently the practice for those cargo items currently inspected critics of this measure have argued that the explosives detection technologies needed to meet such mandate are not yet available thus additional appropriations may be needed to accelerate technology development if this proposal is enacted both the house and senate bills include increased funding for air cargo security activities above the requested amounts these funds are intended for deploying additional canine units for screening air cargo and increasing the number of air cargo security regulatory compliance inspectors in addition to conti nued deployment and testing of new air cargo screening technologies general provision in the house bill s ec 516 would require doubling of the amount of cargo placed on passenger

airlines are assessed direct fees for aviation security at present the tsa has final authority in setting these fees and allocating fees among the various carriers provided that the total fee collections do not exceed what all passenger airlines combined paid for privatelyrun security screening of passengers and property in calendar year 2000 thr ough fy2004 there were also per carrier limits that prevented any single carrier from paying more in fees that what it had spent on screening in calendar year 2000 but these limits longer apply thus the tsa serves as the final authority for termining the proportion of total airline security fee collections and by statute the tsas determinations are not subject to judicial review provision in the hous bill sec 539 however would strike the provision in existing statute that exempts these tsas setting of these fees from judicial review allowing ai rlines to challenge the ts as fee determination methods in court the administration has

assistance instead of requesting sufficient funds at the start of the process for example in fy2007 the administration requested 1500 million initially for the drf supplemental requests added billions more the request for fy 2008 exceeds that for the previous fiscal year by 200 million to 1700 million the senate set the mark for the drf at about 1640 million the final amount enacted was 1324 llion while this is significant amount within the context of fema s budget the actual amount is slightly below femas historical average of drf spending excluding outliers such as hurricane katrina and the world trad center attacks the smaller amount below requested levels for the drf was arrived at in the context of the recent dod appropriations act of n ovember 11 2007 pl 110116 which added 29 billion to the drf in funding that is available until expended137 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34004crs80 138 us congress senate committee on appropriations department of homeland security appropriations bill

congress house committee on appropriations department of homeland security continuedthe senate committee report addressed the accountability issue for the drf by requiring that fema provide detailed estimate of drf funding needed through september 30 2008 not only the end of the fi scal year but toward the end of the hurricane season the committee also ca lled upon agency officials to firmly establish measurable thresholds for tran sparent decision making regarding federal fiscal expenditures for disaster response138 the omnibus act also requests from fema list of all contracts that were awarded on sole source or limited competition basis as well as an estimate of when available appropriations will be exhausted assuming an average disaster season139 congress also may be concerned about accountability for drf expenditures in particular when relevant programmatic expertise resides in an agency other than fema an example is the crisis couns eling assistance and training program ccp authorized by the stafford act which provides pr ofessional counseling services to victims of major disaster in order to relieve ntal health problems fema and the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa in the department of heal th and human services hhs share administrative duties for ccp though the program is funded through the drf it is not clear which agency bears primary or ultimate responsibility for the program which has been associated with fiscal and programmatic challenges140 similarly questions have been raised about femas administration of the temporary housing program also funded through the drf141 in past years congress has authorized or directed the transfer of money from the drf to other fema accounts to address id entified needs or shortcomings some may contend that the dispersion of mone from the drf reduces the amount needed for disaster relief activities others perceive the drf to be an appropriate source of funds to meet special needs related to th mission of the agency for example the office of inspector general oig has r eceived funds in this manner to conduct audits and investigations into the use of drf funds the senate version of the legislation continues this tr adition with the transfer of 14 million to the oig the ominbus act approved an even larger am ount 16 million to be transferred to the oig the bill also allows for the transfer of up to 48 million to fill agency personnel vacancies and provide further oppor tunities to enhance the skills of the workforce the house did not include similar language the house appropriations committee noted its disapproval of the pl anned transfer of 48 million to convert temporary disaster employees into permanent positions142 the omnibus

functions until the federal emergency management agency submits an expenditure plan to the committee on appropriations of the senate and the house regarding the 250 positions143 postkatrina reform act measures in addition to the significant resources needed for fema to administer preparedness grants there are provisions in the postkatrina reform act that in seeking to improve the performance of fema necessarily expand the agencys c overage and areas of responsibility many of these changes carry potentially large costs depending on th frequency and scope of future disaster activity however they also hold the potential for vastly improved service to disaster victims and their communities some of the areas for potentially increased costs include the following federal contributions for the hazard mitigation grant program hmgp for approximately the past five years has been set at 75 of the total aid provided in state after it receives major disaster declaration the postkatrina ac t modifies the hmgp provision to provide 15 for disasters with total damages under 2 billion 10 for disasters with damages between 2 billion and 10 billion and 75 for disasters between 10 billion and 353 billion the house committee report noted that hmgp assistance has been greatly underutilized after hurrican katrina and directs fema to report on needed policy changes and plans to direct funding as needed144 also related to mitigati on the senate committee report makes reference to the recent findi ng that mitigation activities result in cost savings and encourages incentives for such actions the senateapproved version of the legislation includes provision that exempts certain hazard mitigation projects associated with hurricanes katrina and rita from precertification requirements this emphasis by the respective committees is reflected in the increased funding for both map m odernization and the predisaster mitigation fund the public assistance pa progra m authority has been expanded in several ways that could result in in creased federal disaster spending first the list of eligible applicants previously defined by those that provided essential services of g overnmental nature to the general public can now be expanded by the president also under thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34004crs82 2006 amendment services do not nece ssarily have to be available only to the general public s econd the pa program statutory authority establishes eligibility for some facilities previously identified in regulations third education facilities can apply directly for stafford act assist ance without first pursuing small business administration loan finally the postkatrina act includes pilot program for public assistance that seeks to provide incentives to state and local governme nts to be more involved in the pa work such as debris remova l and repair projects while one intent of the provision is to re duce costs the incentives provided could result in an increase in the federal cost share for participating areas as well as reimbursement for base wages for local hires employed by the state and local governments to accomplish this work public assistance costs will also increase the amounts paid out from the disaster relief fund as resu lt of pl 11028 which waived the state and local costshare for gulf coast states that had infrastructure damage due to hurricanes katrina wilma dennis and rita other costshares for disasterrelated co sts were also waived in that legislation but will not amount to th significant increases in federal costs inherent in large in frastructure repair projects another area of accelerated fema involvement that could increase costs concerns expedited federal assistance this may take the form of earlier and greater technical assistance provided to state for precautionary evacuation measures as well as help with logistics and communications there are several administrative and service improvement provisions in the postkatrina act likely to result in increased outreach and greater expenditures including efforts to identify and assist the disabled and disaster victims with limited english proficiency assist in the reunification of families following disaster event and provide increased transportation assistance to victims another deficiency identified in the wake of hurricane katrina concerned the information systems used by fema the senate committee report included expectations that the agency is to adopt cutting edge technology and ensure that tec hnology is used effectively to achieve this goal the senate committee included 6 million to be awarded competitively for this purpose while the omnibus act does not specifically address this issue it may be part of the additional stafford act

reduction in appropria tions for assistance to firefighters program administration budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants as well as zero f unding for safer

may face relating to the implementation of the usv isit system and its proposed transfer to the nppd these issues may include whether the administrations decrease in funding for the exit component and focus on expanding the entry component of the system is appropriate whether us vis it should be placed administratively within the nppd or whether there is some other configuration within dhs that is better suited to usvisits mission and whethe r the current poe infrastructure can support the added communication load that 10 fingerprint system would likely require administrative placement within nppd some question whether the administrative placement of usvisit with in the proposed nppd is appropriate163 most of the other dhs components that would comprise the nppd focus on infrastructure protection and government wide coordination nd were previously located within the office of infrastructure protection at dhs while an argument could be made that usvisit supports th protection of critical infrastructure by preventing terrorists from entering the c ountry counterargument could be made that usvisits primary role is immigrationrelated and relates to screening individuals as they enter the country some observers including the gao have noted that the usvisit program w ould benefit from st ronger management oversight especially in light of the programs continuing inability to formulate strategic plan164 however there is some doubt c oncerning whether the nppd would be the best fit within dhs for usvisit given the seeming disparity between us visit and the other proposed components of the nppd possible issue for congress could include whether usvisit should be placed administratively within the nppd or whether there are other administrative placements that would be more appropriate possible options should c ongress decide against placing usvisit within the nppd could include leaving usvisit as standalone entity within dhs reporting directly to the undersecretary

increasing interest in the levels of f unding available for homeland s ecurity efforts the office of management and budget as originally directed by the fy1998 national defense authorization act has published an annual report to c ongress on combating terrorism beginning with the june 24 2002 edition of this report homeland security was included as part of the analysis in subsequent years this homeland security funding analysis has become more refi ned as distinctions and account lines between homeland and nonhomeland security activities have beco more precise this means that while table 20 is presented in such way as to allow year to year comparisons they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis as outlined above with regard to dhs funding it is impor tant to note that dhs funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts in fact while the largest component of federal spendi ng on homeland security is contained within dhs the dhs homeland security request for fy2008 accounts for approximate ly 49 of total federal funding for homeland security th department of defense comprises the next highest proportion at 29 of all federal spending on homeland security the department of health and human services at 72 the department of justice at 55 and the department of energy at 30 round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security these five agencies collectiv ely account for nearly 94 of all federal sp ending on homeland security it is also important to note that not all dhs funding is classi fied as pertaining to homeland security activities the legacy agencies that became part of dhs also conduct activities that are not homeland security related therefore while the fy2008 request included total homeland security budget authority of 297 b illion for dhs the requested total gross budget authority was 430 billion the same is true of the other agencies listed in the
