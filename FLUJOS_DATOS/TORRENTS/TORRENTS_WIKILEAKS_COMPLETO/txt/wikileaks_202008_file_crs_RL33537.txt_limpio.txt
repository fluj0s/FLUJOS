care policy foreign affairs defense and trade division military medical care questions and answers summary the primary mission of the military health system which includes the defense departments hospitals clinics and medical personnel is to maintain the health of military personnel so they can carry out their military missions and to be prepared to deliver health care during wartime the military health system also provides health care services through either department of defense dod medical facilities known as military treatment facilities or mtfs as space is available or through private health care providers known as tricare this system of military and private health care offers benefits to active duty personnel and other beneficiaries including dependents of active duty personnel military retirees and dependents of retirees tricare beneficiaries can obtain prescription drugs through pharmacy system that includes mtf pharmacies network retail pharmacies nonnetwork retail pharmacies and the tricare mail order program tmop dependents of active duty personnel and retirees and dependents under age 65 can choose to enroll in tricare prime managed care option or if they choose not to enroll they can obtain care through tricare standard feeforservice option or tricare extra preferredprovider option retirees who are eligible for medicare can enroll in tricare for life tfl the military health system currently includes some 63 hospitals and 413 clinics serving an eligible population of 92 million it operates worldwide and employs some 44100 civilians and 89400 military personnel calculating the total cost of military medical spending is complicated by the different categories of funds involved dod statistics on total medical spending indicate growth from 175 billion in fy2000 to an estimated 416 billion in fy2009 the latter figure includes 104 billion paid to an accrual fund for medicare eligible retirees dod projects total medical spending to grow perhaps reaching 64 billion in fy2015 as of 2007 active duty military and their dependents made up 44 of tricare beneficiaries thirtysix percent of beneficiaries were retirees under age 65 and their dependents and 20 were retirees age 65 and over and their dependents dod estimates that care provided to retirees and their dependents will make up over 65 of dod health care costs by 2015 up from 43

health requirements set forth by dod background although the military health system is the primary source of medical services to active duty service members it is also major source of medical care in both military and civilian facilities to the dependents of active duty personnel military retirees and their dependents and survivors of deceased service members since 1966 civilian care to millions of dependents and retirees and retirees dependents has been provided through program still known in law as the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed services champus but more commonly known as tricare tricare has four main benefit plans including health maintenance organization option tricare prime preferred provider option tricare extra feeforservice option tricare standard and medicare wraparound option tricare for life for medicareeligible retirees options available to beneficiaries vary by the beneficiaries duty status and location this report attempts to answer basic

of defense for health affairs home page may be of interest available at httpwwwhealthmil crs2 questions and answers 1 what is the purpose of dods military health system in law the purpose of the legislation authorizing the military health system is to create and maintain high morale in the uniformed services by providing an improved and uniform program of medical and dental care for members and certain former members of those services and for their dependents1 the military health system helps to maintain the health of military personnel so they can carry out their military missions the military health system must also be prepared to deliver health care required during wartime often described as the medical readiness mission this effort involves medical testing and screening of recruits emergency medical treatment of service members involved in hostilities and the maintenance of physical standards of those in the armed services in addition recruitment and retention are supported by the provision of health benefits to military retirees and their dependents 2 what is the structure of the military health system the military health system consists of 1 the defense health program dhp which is centrally directed by the office of the secretary of defense and decentrally executed by the military departments and 2 medical resources under the direction of the combatant or support command within the military departments for dod the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs asdha controls nondeployable medical resources facilities and personnel the asdha reports to the undersecretary of defense personnel and readiness who reports to the deputy secretary of defense the following all currently report to the asdha deputy assistant secretary of

recent final report of the task force on future of military health care noted that there has been considerable debate about the appropriate command and control structure for the military health system2 alternatives to the current structure that have been suggested include defense health agency or unified medical command an october 2007 government accountability office report faulted dods analysis of these options for the lack of comprehensive costbenefit analysis3 the military health system currently includes 63 hospitals and 413 clinics serving an eligible population of 92 million it operates worldwide and employs some 44100 civilians and 89400 military personnel direct care costs include the provision of medical care directly to beneficiaries the administrative requirements of large medical establishment and maintaining capability to provide medical care to combat forces in case of hostilities civilian providers under contract to dod have constituted major portion of the

personnel in dod remained the same over the next few years costs associated with the military health system are expected to grow this results from general inflation in the cost of health care and an increasing percentage of care being provided to retirees and their dependents as of 2007 active duty military and their dependents made up 44 of tricare beneficiaries 36 of beneficiaries were retirees under age 65 and their dependents and 20 were retirees age 65 and over and their dependents dod estimates that care provided to retirees and their dependents will make up over 65 of dod health care costs by 2015 up from 43 in 19994 3 what is the unified medical budget asdha prepares and submits unified medical budget which includes resources for the medical activities under his or her control within the dod the unified medical budget includes funding for all fixed medical treatment facilitiesactivities including such costs as real property maintenance environmental compliance minor construction and base operations support funds for medical personnel and accrual payments to the medicare eligible retiree health care fund merhcf see what is the merhcf below are also included the

funding has traditionally been appropriated in several places the defense appropriations bill generally provides under the other department of defense programs title funding for operations and maintenance om procurement and research development test and evaluation rdte are appropriated under the heading defense health program funding for military personnel and accrual payments are generally provided in the defense appropriations bill under the military personnelmilpers title funding for medical military construction milcon is generally provided under the department of defense title of the military construction and veterans affairs bill standing authorization for transfers from the merhcf to reimburse tricare for the cost of services provided to medicare eligible retirees is provided by 10 usc 1113 costs of war related military health care is generally funded through supplemental appropriations bills other resources are made available to the military health system from third party collections authorized by 10 usc 1097bb and number of other reimbursable program and transfer authorities the presidents budget typically refers to the unified medical budget request as its funding request for the military health system but only includes an exhibit for the dhp in the department of defense military chapter and exhibits for the merhcf in the other defense civil programs chapter of the appendix volume medical milcon and milpers request levels are generally found in dods budget submissions to congress the administrations 2009 unified medical budget request5

fund merhcf the floyd d spence national defense authorization act for fy2001ndaa directed the establishment of the medicareeligible retiree health care fund to pay for medicareeligible retiree health care beginning on october 1 2002 prior to this date care for medicareeligible beneficiaries was space available care in mtfs the merhcf covers medicareeligible beneficiaries regardless of age the ndaa also established an independent threemember dod medicareeligible retiree health care board of actuaries appointed by the secretary of defense the board is required to review the actuarial status of the fund to report annually to the secretary of defense and to report to the president and the congress on the status of the fund at least every four years the dod office of the actuary provides all technical and administrative support to the board within dod the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness through the office of the assistant secretary of defense oasd for health affairs has as one of its missions operational oversight of the defense health program including management of the merhcf the defense finance and accounting service provides accounting and investment services for the fund in fy2007 the merhcf initially authorized approximately 77 billion in total health care services civilian providers 59 billion military medical treatment facilities 14

compensation page 45 6 in what ways has the military health system been changing in recent years during the cold war military health care was designed to support fullscale extremely violent war with the soviet union and its allies in europe high casualties were anticipated along with need for intheater medical treatment facilities however the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the warsaw pact led to major reassessment of us defense policy this led defense planners to believe the most likely conflicts will be of limited duration and involve smaller numbers of troops in the future indeed the overall size of the active duty force has been reduced by onethird since the mid1980s planners expected that casualties can be treated crs9 locally with greater reliance on telemedicine or if necessary evacuated to military medical facilities in the continental united states conus this strategic planning along with associated military personnel reductions required smaller medical establishment fewer military medical personnel and the closure of number of hospitals and clinics more recently considerations driven by the events of september 11 2001 and the resulting global ware on terrorismgwot have driven changes in dods planning the 2006 edition of the quadrennial defense review qdr focused dod on better defining its responsibilities for homeland defense within broader national framework including gwot counterterrorism counterinserguency and military support for stabilization and reconstruction efforts with respect to the military health system the qdr process identified 18 initiatives across 4 focus areas 1 transform the force 2 transform the infrastructure 3 transform the business and 4 sustain the benefit7 as part of this process dod launched medical readiness review mrr in august 2004 the mrr was intended to determine the optimal size of the active duty medical force the results of the mrr led to plans for converting military health billets to civilian jobs from fy2005 to fy2007 the navy converted 2676 military positions to civilian positions created hiring plan for 2116 converted positions and hired 1349 civilian employees the army planned to convert 1588 positions in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and the air force planned to convert 1216 military positions to civilian jobs8 these conversions have been controversial within the military services and congress has imposed limitations on these so called milciv conversions in each of the last three ndaas in addition to revisions in military planning nationwide changes in the practice of medicine have also affected dod in particular managed care initiatives and capitated budgeting that are widely adopted in the civilian community are being implemented in dods tricare program tricare is also designed to coordinate medical care efforts of the three military departments in three geographical regions each under single military commander known as lead agent the lead agents are responsible for managing care provided by all military medical facilities in their respective regions and for contracting for additional care from civilian providers these competitivelybid regionwide contracts represent significant change in delivery of defense health care and will it is anticipated result in cost savings detailed regulations governing tricare were made effective on november 1 1995 32 cfr 199 although care continues to be centered around military medical facilities heavy reliance is placed on civilian contractors managed by the lead agent were necessary the centerpiece of tricare is the tricare prime option dod version of health maintenance organization hmo that the beneficiary joins and which provides essentially all of his or her medical care care is provided through dod medical personnel hospitals and clinics as well as affiliated civilian physicians 7 office of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs quadrennial defensse review roadmap for medical transformation april 3 2006 pages 12 8 department of defense task force on the future of military health care final report december 2007 page 111 crs10 hospitals and other providers costs are contained through administrative controls and treatment protocols in civilian practice hmos have been credited with some success in reducing costs although opponents of these systems complain about restrictions on provider choice and incentives that may be created to constrain the delivery of services tricare standard has been the military equivalent of health insurance plan run by dod for active duty dependents military retirees and the dependents of retirees survivors of deceased members and certain former spouses9 unlike private insurance plans tricare standard does not require premiums if care at military facility cannot be provided due to space limitations limitations on the types of services that facility is capable of providing or due to the fact that beneficiary may not live close enough to military facility to make such travel reasonable tricare standard will share responsibility with the beneficiary for the payment of care received from nonmilitary health care providers subject to regulations certain types of care such as most dentistry and chiropractic services are excluded in addition to tricare standard and tricare prime there is preferredprovider option tricare extra in tricare extra beneficiaries do not enroll or pay annual premiums but use physicians and specialists in the tricare network and are charged 5 less for medical services many of the changes made in the past decade have been intended to improve medical care available to the active duty population but they have also resulted in less medical care available in military facilities for retired personnel and their dependents the introduction of tricare for life in fy2002 provided coverage for retired beneficiaries but most of their care will undoubtedly be obtained from civilian providers reimbursed by medicare and tricare the establishment of tricare for life and the current pharmaceutical benefit have contributed to significant growth in health care spending by dod the expanding costs of military healthcare reached an estimated 416 billion in fy2009 with the majority of the spending going to provide care to individuals longer on active duty or to their family members the congressional budget office has also projected that dods medical spending will grow by more than 80 in real terms by 202410 7 who is eligible to receive this care current law provides that active duty personnel are entitled to receive health care at military medical facilities in addition active duty dependents military retirees and their dependents and survivors of deceased members are eligible to receive health care at military medical facilities when space and professional services 9 for more information on those benefits available to former spouses see crs report rl31663 military benefits for former spouses legislation and policy issues by david f burrelli 10 congressional budget office longterm implications of current defense plans and alternatives summary update for fiscal year 2006 october 2005 crs11 are available also eligible to receive care for fixed fee in these facilities are certain government officials including the president and members of congress and certain foreign military personnel on active duty in the us reserve component their dependents are also entitled to care in military medical facilities and participation in tricare under certain conditions as discussed in question 14 below since 1967 dod has funded care by civilian providers to dependents retirees and dependents of retirees who are under age 65 and unable to obtain access in military health facility after 1991 dod began with congressional support moving towards managed care arrangements under the tricare program that include greater use of civilian health care providers even for active duty personnel 8 how are priorities for care in military medical facilities assigned active duty personnel military retirees and their respective dependents are not afforded equal access to care in military medical facilities active duty personnel are entitled to health care in military medical facility 10 usc 1074 according to 10 usc 1076 dependents of active duty personnel are entitled upon request to medical and dental care on spaceavailable basis at military medical facility title 10 usc 1074 states that member or former member of the uniformed services who is entitled to retired or retainer pay may upon request be given medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed service on spaceavailable basis this language entitles active duty dependents to medical and dental care subject to spaceavailable limitations such entitlement or right is provided to retirees or their dependents instead retirees and their dependents may be given medical and dental care subject to the same spaceavailable limitations this language gives active duty personnel and their dependents priority in receiving medical and dental care at any facility of the uniformed services over military members entitled to receive retired pay and their dependents the policy of providing active duty dependents priority over retirees in the receipt of medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed services has existed in law since at least september 2 1958 pl 85861 since the establishment of tricare and pursuant to the defense authorization act of fy1996 pl 104106 dod has established the following basic priorities with certain special provisions priority 1 activeduty service members priority 2 activeduty family members who are enrolled in tricare prime priority 3 retirees their family members and survivors who are enrolled in tricare prime priority 4 activeduty family members who are not enrolled in tricare prime priority 5 all other eligible persons the priority is given to active duty dependents to help them obtain care easily and thus make it possible for active duty members to perform their military service crs12 without worrying about health care for their dependents this is particularly important for active duty personnel who may be assigned overseas or aboard ship and separated from their dependents as retirees are not subject to such imposed separations they are considered to be in better position to see that their dependents receive care if care cannot be provided in military facility thus the role of health care delivery recognizes the unique needs of the military mission the role of health care in the military is qualitatively different and therefore not necessarily comparable to the civilian sector the benefits available to service members or retirees which require comparatively little or contributions from the beneficiaries themselves are considered by some to be more generous benefit package than is available to civil servants or to most people in the private sector retirees may also be eligible to receive medical care at department of veterans affairs va medical facilities11 9 what is the relationship of dod health care to medicare active duty military personnel have been fully covered by social security and have paid social security taxes since january 1 1957 social security coverage includes eligibility for health care coverage under medicare at age 65 it was the legislative intent of the congress that retired members of the uniformed services and their eligible dependents be provided with medical care after they retire from the military usually between their late30s and mid40s champus was intended to supplement not to replace military health care likewise congress did not intend that champus should replace medicare as supplemental benefit to military health care for this reason retirees became ineligible to receive champus benefits when at age 65 they become eligible for medicare many argued that the structure was inherently unfair because retirees lost tricarechampus benefits at the stage in life when they were increasingly likely to need them it was argued that military personnel had been promised free medical care for life not just until age 65 after considerable debate over various options for ensuring medical care to retired beneficiaries congress in the fy2001 defense authorization act pl 106259 provided that beginning october 1 2001 tricare pays outofpocket costs for services provided under medicare for beneficiaries over age 64 if they are enrolled in medicare part b this benefit is known as tricare for life tfl disabled persons under 65 who are entitled to medicare may continue to receive champus benefits as second payer to medicare parts and b with some restrictions the requirement for enrollment in medicare part b which will cost 9640 per month in 2008 for most military retirees is source of concern to some beneficiaries especially those who did not enroll in part b when they became 65 and thus must pay significant penalties some argue that this requirement is unfair since part b enrollment was not originally prerequisite for access to any dod medical care on 11 see crs report rl32975 veterans medical care fy2006 appropriations by sidath viranga panangala crs13 the other hand waiving the penalty for military retirees could be considered unfair to other medicareusers who did not enroll in part b upon turning 65 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act pl 108173 passed in december 2003 waived penalties for military retirees in certain circumstances during an open season in 200412 10 have military personnel been promised free medical care for life some military personnel and former military personnel maintain that they and their dependents were promised free medical care for life at the time of their enlistment such promises may have been made by military recruiters and in recruiting brochures however if they were made they were not based upon laws or official regulations which provide only for access to military medical facilities for nonactive duty personnel if space is available as described above space was not always available and tricare options could involve significant costs to beneficiaries rear admiral harold m koenig the deputy assistant secretary of defense for health affairs testified in may 1993 we have medical care program for life for our beneficiaries and it is pretty well defined in the law that easily gets interpreted to or reinterpreted into free medical care for the rest of your life that is pretty easy transition for people to make in their thinking and it is pervasive we dod spend an incredible amount of effort trying to reeducate people that that is not their benefit13 dr stephen c joseph assistant secretary of defense for health affairs in april 1998 however argued that because retirees believe they have had promise of free care the government did have an obligation joseph did not specify the precise extent of the obligation the fy1998 defense authorization act pl 105 85 included in section 752 finding that many retired military personnel believe that they were promised lifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years of service and expressed the sense of congress that the united states has incurred moral obligation to provide health care to members and retired members of the armed services further it is necessary to provide quality affordable care to such retirees14 11 how are private health care providers paid by law pl 102396 and federal regulation 32 cfr 19914 health care providers treating tricare patients cannot bill for more than 115 of charges authorized by dod fee schedule in some geographic areas providers have been unwilling to accept tricare patients because of the limits on fees that can be charged 12 see crs report rs21731 medicare part b premium penalty by jennifer osullivan 13 us congress house of representatives committee on armed services military forces and personnel subcommittee 103rd congress 1st session national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1994 hr 2401 and oversight of previously authorized programs hearings

grant exceptions statutes 10 usc 1079 also require that payment levels for health care services provided under tricare be aligned with medicares fee schedule to the extent practicable over 90 of tricare payment levels are now equivalent to those authorized by medicare about 10 are higher and steps are being taken to adjust some to medicare levels 12 what will be the effect of base realignment and closure brac on military medical care base realignment and closures undertaken as part of the restructuring of the defense department in the postcold war period have prompted changes in the military health services system as result of base realignment and closure brac actions 35 of the dod medical treatment facilities providing services in 1987 were closed by the end of 1997 although the number of eligible beneficiaries decreased by only 9 another brac round was undertaken in 200515 criteria for realignments and closures established by dod with congressional consent include the need to deploy force structure capable of protecting the national security anticipated funding levels and number of military fiscal and environmental considerations that encompass community economic impact and community infrastructure four brac commissions have specifically considered the effect of closing dod hospitals and clinics on active duty military personnel as well as on other beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries the first two brac commissions recommended 18 military hospital closures the third brac commission recommended an additional 10 facilities closed include hospitals in philadelphia pa oakland ca orlando fl san francisco ca ft devens ma ft ord ca and long beach ca in one case the commission overruled dod proposal to close the naval hospital in charleston sc while dod had commissioned study group to examine military treatment facilities for the 1995 brac round the assessment of military medical services appears to have been more comprehensive in 2005 medical joint crossservice group jcsg was established to review dod healthcare functions and to provide brac recommendations the review included healthcare education and training healthcare services medical and dental research development and acquisition the surgeon general of the air force chaired the medical jcsg other members included representatives from the military services the joint staff and the office of the secretary of defense the recommendations were submitted to senior dod leadership for consideration in the preparations of the secretary of defenses recommended brac actions recommendations included closing brooks city base san antonio tx realigning walter reed medical center washington dc realigning the inpatient medical function at lackland air force base in san antonio tx and other initiatives16 15 see crs report rl32216 military base closures implementing the 2005 round by david lockwood 16 for further information see the dod brac website httpwwwdefenselinkmilbrac
