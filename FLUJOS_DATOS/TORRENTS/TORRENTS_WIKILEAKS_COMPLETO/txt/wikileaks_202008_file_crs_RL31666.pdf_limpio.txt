reports from the definition of consumer report for example any report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report is excluded from the definition of consumer report as are communications of that information among persons related by common ownership8 authorizations or approvals of specific extensions of credit by the issuer of credit card are also excluded from the definition of consumer report9 with relatively few exceptions there appears to be consensus among the consumer reporting agencies as to exactly what types of information should be reported10 information reported by credit bureau commonly includes identifying information usually the individuals full name social security number address telephone number and spouses name financial status and employment information including income spouses income place position and tenure of employment other sources of income duration and income in former employment credit history including types of credit previously obtained names of previous credit grantors extent of previous credit and complete payment history existing lines of credit including payment habits and all outstanding obligations public record information including pertinent newspaper clippings arrest and conviction records 11 bankruptcies tax liens and lawsuits and finally listing of bureau subscribers that have previously asked for credit report on the individual12 the fair credit reporting act limits the amount of time that adverse or negative information can be included in consumers credit report generally credit reporting agency is prohibited from reporting adverse information that is more than seven years old or in the case of bankruptcies more than ten years old13 if bankruptcy filed under title 11 of the united states code is included on consumers report the report shall also identify the chapter under which the case arose if such information is provided by the source of the information14 if bankruptcy case or filing under title 11 of the united states code is withdrawn by the consumer before final judgment the report must include the fact that the case or filing was withdrawn15 in addition to adverse credit information consumer reporting agencies are also allowed to include information on consumers failure to pay overdue child support if such information has been provided to the agency by state or local child support enforcement agency or verified by any state or federal government agency this information remains on the consumer report for up to seven years 16
