at httpwwwutblmgovmonumentbearing on actions to establish utah wilderne ss areas these issues have been the subject of congressional oversight nd legislation and law suits against the administration the antiquities act of 1906 the antiquities act of 1906 authorizes th president to create national monuments on federal land the land must contain hist oric landmarks histor ic and prehistoric structures or other objects of hi storic or scientific interest regarding size the president is to reserve the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected extensions or tablishment of monuments in wyoming require the authorization of congress 16 usc 431a and withdrawals in alaska exceeding 5000 acres are subject to congressi onal approval 16 usc 3213 the antiquities act was response to c oncerns over theft and destruction of archaeological sites and was designed to provi an expeditious means to protect federal lands and resources president theodore r oosevelt first used the authority in 1906 to establish devils tower in wyoming as the fi rst national monument fourteen of the 17 presidents since 1906 have pr oclaimed more than 100 monumen ts many presidentially designated monuments now are national park s for instance the grand canyon initially was national monument measuring 08 million acres and is now national park with 12 million acres also monuments have been cr eated or modified by acts of congress sizes of monuments vary wi dely while more than lf initially involved less than 5000 acres they ranged from less than 1 acre to nearly 11 million acres the largest monument was created as part of presiden t carters 1978 withdrawal of 56 million acres of land in alaska to establish 15 new monumen ts and enlarge 2 others grand staircase escalante is the largest presidentiallycreat ed monument outside alaska about 10 of all federal landnearly 70 million acreshas been designated using the antiquities act2 presidential establishment of national m onuments sometimes has been controversial eg the jackson hole national monument in wyoming 1943 and especially president carters alaskan withdrawal some contend that presidents have used the act for broad conservation or recreation purposes rather than to protect endangered resources president clintons use of the antiquities ac t to create grand staircaseescalante raised several issues concern has centered on justif ication for the types of resources and the size of the area protected as well as the level of threat to the area other legal and policy aspects of the proclamation and the antiquities act generally have been questioned including constitutionality consistency with other law especially land withdrawal provisions of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma and the exclusion of congress govern ment officials and the public from the designation process monument management and effect on land uses under the proclamation the escalante monum ent is being managed by blm this is the first time that blm is managing national monument most are managed by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98993crs3 3for legal issues including the selection of blm as monument manager see crs memorandum legal issues raised by the designation of the grand staircaseesca lante national monument by pamela baldwin december 13 1996 national park service nps blm may have been chosen because the federal lands already were under blm management or we re intended to be both protected and yet managed for multiple uses both the pres idents authority to choose management agency other than nps and the c hoice of blm have been questioned3 concern also has centered on the types and exte nt of land uses limited or pr ohibited by the designation the proclamation gave blm until september 18 1999 3 years to issue final plan for managing the monument in novemb er 1998 blm released draft management plan and draft eis outlining five approaches and identifying preferred alternative all five approaches propose high degree of protection for monument resources but they have different emphases the preferred alternative em phasizes conservation of the monument as an unspoiled area concentratin g recreational use along highway corridors restricting use and access in the interior and pr omoting research and applied science the other options emphasize either continuation of current mana gement recreation research or the primitive nature of the land the plan is available for public review and comment until february 12 1999 90 days blm expects to circulate proposed management plan and final eis in the summer of 1999 w ith the final management plan and record of decision on the eis by september 18 1999 the presidential proclamation and accompanying statement addressed management of the monument and blm interim guid elines incorporate and expand on such presidential direction pending approval of management plan president clinton indicated that the proclamation does not appl to the state and private lands included in the monuments borders when designated but rather to the federal lands the proclamation did authorize land exchanges to further the protective purposes of the monument further under the interim gu idelines activities on nonmonument lands that damage or are expected to damage monumen t lands must be repor ted to the responsible management official for appropriate action in general existing uses of the land that are not precluded by the proclamation and do not conflict with the purposes of the monument may continue before the monuments designation some uses of the land had been authorized through mineral leases oil gas and coal and mining claims grazing allotments rights of way grants special and commercial recreation permits and wood collection permits under the guidelines existing use authorizations also may be renewed and new use authorizations may be approved if they are in accord with laws and regulations and do not conflict with the purposes of the monument the final ma nagement plan is expected to review how valid existing rights for varied land use activities are determined and whether any restrictions will be imposed subject to valid existing rights federal lands and interests in lands within the monument were withdrawn from entry loca tion selection sale leasing or other disposition under the public land laws bl m has interpreted this as barring new mineral leases mining claims and prospecting or ex ploration activities existing withdrawalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98993crs4 4for more information on economic issues including mineral development see gao report b 278137 federal land management estimates of mine ral values and of the economic effects of developing minerals in the grand st aircaseescalante national monument october 31 1 997reservations and appr opriations continue but the monum ent is the dominant reservation this generally requires that uses be managed to protect monument values the proclamation states that water rights are not reserved in preparing the management plan the secretary is to address the necessity of water for the care and management of the objects within the monumen t and the extent to which further action is needed under federal or state law to ensure availability of water the proclamation also states that the creation of the monument would not affect grazing which would continue to be governed by other laws and regulations most of the monument currently is under grazing allotments the authority of the state of utah for fish and wildlife management on federal lands within the monument also will continue under the interim guidelines scientific ar chaeological and historical investigations including collection of paleontological re sources may continue except that surface disturbance must be minimal types of recreation including hiking and camping generally are allowed protec tion of wilderness study areas is continued additional areas for offroad vehicles may be designat ed and some existing areas may be closed road maintenance may be permitted but road improvements are to be minimal certain rights of way and ancillary public fac ilities necessary for established communities generally will be processed mining and min eral development the monument contains energy and mineral resources the kaiparowits plateau is known for its large reserves of lowsulfur coal although estimates of the amount of coal and its worth vary for 1997 report the ge neral accounting office contacted variety of sources to ascertain comprehensive estimates and fo und only twothe utah geological survey for the monument generally and th utah governors office for the smoky hollow mine an extensive coal mining ope ration proposed by andalex resources inc the utah geological survey valued all energy and mineral resources within the monument at between 223 billion and 331 billi on the presidents statement indicates that designation of the monument was motivat ed partly by concern shared with the environmental community that large coal mining operation ie smoky hollow was imminent and could damage the resources of the area the utah governors office estimated that the coal mined at smoky hollow would be worth 14 billion over 30 years and would create several hundred jobs in utah the department of the interior has disputed the estimates of the state of utah4 the establishment of the monument was view ed by many area residents as federal intrusion on the states economic interests which would significantly damage the local and state economies by effectively barring velopment others disputed the expected economic benefits including the projected cal effects noting that principal mining company is based overseas still others viewed the monument as having positive economic impact primarily from increased tourism to the areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98993crs5 variety of leases and claims existed on its lands when the monument was created two companies held number of uncontested l eases to mine coal number of different companies and individuals held total of 89 leases for oil and gas although 59 were held by one company also there were dozens of claims for variety of other minerals such as gold and silver blm asserted that wh ile new leases and cl aims were prohibited existing coal oil and gas leases and mineral claims that were determined to be valid would remain in effect however blm so noted that development would have to adhere to higher standard of environmental review to assess its compatibility with the national monument designation many prodevelopment advo cates feared that the new standard effectively could restrict or prohibit development of resources the proclamation preserved valid existing rights holders of leases and claims predating the monument have pursued different courses coal leases have been developed and the administra tion and leaseholding companies are voluntarily pursuing an exchange of those holdings for other lands resources or compensation the president expressed interest in such exchanges when establishing the monument the company holding the majority of oil and gas leases wa s authorized by blm to drill an exploratory well but did not do so but may seek to obtain permit to drill other sites some claim holders have filed notices with blm that they will conduct operations on preexisting mining claims limited operations not aff ecting monument values have begun on some claims but validity determinations will be completed only if more development is likely school trust lands when established the monument contained st ate lands and mineral interests of the utah school and institutional trust lands administration sitla these lands were among those given to utah from the public dom ain as part of its admission to statehood to generate money for utah schools desi gnating the monument was viewed by many in the area as limiting utahs authority to deve lop the surface and mineral resources on its school trust lands because such developmen t might be incompatible with the purposes for which the monument was created the utah geological survey estimated that between 876 million and 13 billion tons of coal are located on the school trust lands and that revenue to the school trust fund w ould range from 14 billion to over 2 billion if all the recoverable coal were developed others disputed the mineral value or development potential of the state lands the location of the school trust lands among federal lands presents manage ment problems both the state and the federal government in creating the monument president clin ton advocated exchanges of school trust lands within the monument fo r other federal land the 105th congress enacted related legislation pl 105335 the law transfers to the federa l government total of 362992 acres of utah state lands and 90423 additiona l acres of mineral rights including 177312 acres of land and 23521 acres of mineral righ ts within grand staircaseescalante in exchange utah receives package incl uding 119296 acres of federal land and 31952 additional acres of mineral in terests and 50 million the exch ange is to be completed by january 9 1999 and would increase the size of the monument to 21 million acres under the law the state of utah and th federal government are required to honor valid existing rights on lands they acquire which in some cases may present challenges to implement the law reflects 1998 statefe deral land exchange agreement between thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98993crs6 state of utah and the department of the in terior it is the culmination of years of proposals and supercedes related 1993 law pl 10393 the 105th congress enacted separate legisla tion pl 105355 to alter the borders of the monument to exclude certain parcel s of land desired by local communities for community needs and to add others this law was crafted to resolve some of the local controversy over potential restric tions on land development wilderness the creation of the monument occurred in the context of lengthy dispute over the designation of wilderness in utah environmental groups led an effort for wilderness protection of 57 million acres while the utah congressional delega tion among others generally supported 18 million acres units of the national w ilderness preservation system must be designated by congress by law and designation of the monument came on the heels of defeat of 18 million acre wilderness bill in 1996 the monument designation affected some of the land previously considered for wilderness but generally is not as restrictiv as designated wilderness wilderness areas usually do not have roads and generally prohibit motorized vehicles and other forms of intrusive human activity to allow for solitude and primitive recreation greater variety of activities may be pe rmitted in monuments so long as their resources are protected having blm rather than the nps manage this monument apparently will result in more flexible management the president stated that monument lands would remain open for multiple uses the proclamations controversy hinged on its inclusion of areas some wanted as wilderness and others desi red as unrestricted for development the federal government owns 338 million acres 64 of land in utah there are 08 million acres of wilderness mostly managed by the forest service alt hough none are within the monument there are also 32 million acres being managed as wilderness study areas wsas result of blm i nventory some years ago 09 million of which are within the monument wsas are managed to maintain their suitability for wilderness designation until legislation is enacted to determine their final status the creation of the monument does not affect these study areas or preclude congress from designating wilderness within the monuments borders currently blm is reviewing additional land of at least 25 million acres in utah for potential inclusion in the wilderness system bout onesixth of this acreage is within the monument this inventory has been controve rsial and contested by the state and others who believe it is biased towards establishing wilderness it was lted by the courts then recently resumed following an appeal utah v babbitt 137 f 3d 1193 10th cir 1998 controversy continues over wilderness in utah focusing on the adequacy of the monument designation versus wilderness designation to prot ect resources the size and location of wilderness areas eligibility of land with certain travel routes for designation as wilderness whether to release areas from further wilderness review or study how water rights would be treated the role of local governments in the management of wilderness and manage ment direction including whethe r to allow certain land uses
