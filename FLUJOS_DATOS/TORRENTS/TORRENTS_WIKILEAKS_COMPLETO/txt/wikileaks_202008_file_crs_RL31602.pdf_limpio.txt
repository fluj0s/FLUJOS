and medicare equity act of 2002 introduction medicaid is joint federalstate entitlement program that pays for medical assistance primarily for lowincome persons who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent children and certain other pregnant women and children within broad federal guidelines each stat designs and administers its own program the federal government shares in states medicaid costs by means of statutory formula designed to provide higher federal matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes in fy2001 fe deral matching ra tes ranged from 50 to 768 of states expenditures for medicaid items and services the state childrens health insurance program schip is another joint federalstate program that allows states to extend coverage to children in families with income that is too high to qualify for medicaid coverage as with medicaid each state designs and administers its own program and the federal gove rnment shares in states costs by matching state spending the schip matching formula is based on the medicaid matching formula but results in higher matc hing rates that ranged from 65 to 838 in fy 2001 two bills under consideration in th house and the senate would make important changes to medicaid and schip the medicare modernization and prescription drug act of 2002 hr 4954 passed the house on june 28 2002 on october 1 2002 the senate

certain public notice and hearing requirements as well as requirements regarding receipt andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31602crs2 consideration of public comments in the wa iver development review and approval process it also clarifies other parameters of the secretarys waiver authority the following sections describe the recent legislative changes as well as the major proposed amendments in hr 4954 and s 3018 disproportionate share hospital dsh payments under medicaid since 1981 states have been required to r ecognize in establishing their payment rates the situation of hospitals that serve disproportionate number of medicaid beneficiaries and lowincome patients these payments are referred to as dsh payments or dsh adjustments the dsh adjustment was intended to offset the costs to hospitals of treating uninsured lowinco patients and to protect access to care for vulnerable populations under broad fe deral guidelines each state determines which hospitals receive dsh payments and the payment amounts to each states that contract with health main tenance organizations hmos or other prepaid managed care providers may include ds h expenses in the payment rates to contractors dsh payments became significant part of the program after 1989 when they grew from just under 1 b illion to almost 17 billion by 1992 during that time states medicaid budgets were facing number of upward pr essures while states were learning about financing techniques that made it easier to collect increased dsh payments from the federal government in 1991 congress intervened to control the growth of these expenditures by limiting dsh payments by state and tting national limits the new law was successful after 1992 dsh payments increas slowed considerably although the level of national dsh paym ents remained high at just under 19 billion in 1995 significant reductions in dsh payments were included in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 lowered dsh payments by establishing allotments or ceilings on dsh payments for each state the allotments were sp ecified for fiscal years beginning in 1998 through 2002 for mo st states those amounts declined over the 5year period thereafter the dsh allotment for state was to equal its allotment for the preceding fiscal year increased by the percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu as estimated by the secretary for the previous fiscal ear subject to ceiling of 12 of the total amount of expenditures for medicaid benef its during the fiscal year subsequently the medicare medi caid and schip balanced budget refinements act of 1999 bbra99 pl 106113 included provisions increasing the medicaid dsh allotments for certain states and the district of columbia then under medicare medicaid and schip benef its improvement nd protection act of 2000 bipa2000 pl 106554 new rules go verning federal dsh payments for fy2001 and fy2002 were established the special rule di rected that dsh allotments for the two years be based on fy2000 allotments increased by inflation instead of on the declining amounts specified in bba97 allotments for fy2003 and thereafter were to revert to am ounts calculated based on the methodology specified in bba97 bipa2000 also ex tended special hospitalspecific dsh limit that had previously applied only to certain public hospitals in california to such hospitals in all states for 2year period finally additional f unds were provided forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31602crs3 certain state public hospitals not receiving dsh payments that have lowincome utilization rate in excess of 65 legislation during economic downturns states medicaid eligibility rolls often expand at the same time as tax recei pts which help to fund those programs contract recognizing this increased fiscal pressure that stat are under since the economic slowing began over one year ago both bills include provisions to increase annual state dsh allotments fo r fiscal years beginning in 2003 each bill however uses different methods to achieve thos increases hr 4954 would raise dsh allotments for fy2003 by setting those am ounts equal to fy2001 allotments as specified in bba97 increased by the pe rcentage change in the cpiu for fy 2001 allotments for fy2004 and thereafter would be equal to the allotment for the previous year increased by 17 unless th secretary determines that the allotment under this provision would equal or long er exceed the allotment for that state that would have been in effect under prior w for these states beginning in the first fiscal year that their allotment would equal or longer exceed the prior law levels their allotment would be equal to the allotment for the previous year increased by the percentage change in the cpiu for the previous year s 3018 would raise dsh allotments by specifying that 2003 allotments would be calculated to be equal to fy2002 llotments under bipa2000 increased by the percentage change in the cpiu for fy2002 for 2004 they would be equal to fy2003 allotments increased by the percentage change in the cpiu for fy2003 and for 2005 they would be equal to fy2004 allotments increased by the percentage change in the cpiu for fy2004 for fy2006 allotments would be based on the amounts specified in bba97 for fy2002 increas ed by the percentage change in the cpiu for fiscal years 2002 through 20 05 for fy 2007 and thereafter allotments would be calculated based on the previous years amount increased by percentage change in the cpiu for the previous fis cal year in additi on for fy2 003 through fy2005 s 3018 would increase allotments for the district of columbia and for certain extremely low dsh states the bill specifies special formulas for these purposes redistribution rules under the state childrens health insurance program schip schip created under bba97 is the largest publicly funded effort to provide health insurance to children since medicaid was enacted in 1965 the program offers federal ma tching funds for states and territories to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured lowincome children in families whose nnual incomes are higher than states medicaid eligibility thresholds the original enactment appropriated federal matching grants totaling 397 billion for schip for fy1998 through fy2007 allotment of funds among the states is determined by formula set in law each annual allotment is available to states for period of 3 years under current w allotments not spent at the end of the applicable 3year period will be redistributed by method to be determined by the secretary of hhs to states that have fully exhausted their original allotments for that year redistributed funds not spent by the end of the fiscal year in which they are reallocated will expirehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31602crs4 1 other sections in medicaid statute allow waiver of other provisions under certain circumstancesbipa2000 created special rule for the redistribution and availability of unused fy1998 and fy1999 schip allotments the change decreased the amount available for redistribution to states that had exhausted their original allotments for those years by allowing states that had not spent their full allotments to retain portion of their unspent funds specifically out of the total pool of unspent funds for given year states that exhausted their allotments were given amounts equal to their excess expenditures then states which had not exhausted their allotments received an amount equal to their proportional cont ribution to the pool of unspent funds s 3018 builds upon bipa2000 by establishing method for redistributing unspent allotments for fy2000 forward for each of fy2000 through fy2003 states that exhaust their original allotments w ould receive amounts equal to their excess expenditures subject to specific nnual caps 60 fy2000 and fy2001 70 fy2002 80 fy2003 on unspent funds the distribution method for such funds among these states should the pool of ava ilable funds be insufficient to cover all excess expenditures is left to the secr etary to determine for fy2004 forward redistribution among such states would be the same as provided under bipa2000 for each of fy2000 through fy2003 the remaining unspent funds would be distributed among states th at do not use their full allo tments subject to specific annual floors 40 fy2000 and fy2001 30 fy2002 20 fy2003 on unspent funds each such state would re ceive an amount equal to the ratio of its contribution to the total pool of unspent funds to the remaining available funds again for fy2004 forward redistribution among such states would be the same as provided under bipa 2000 for fy 2004 forward s 3018 also would establish caseload stabilization pool to provide certain states with additional schip funding any remaining unspent redistributed dollars beginning with the fy1998 appropriation would become part of this pool in add ition the bill specifies that unspent funds in the pool would remain in th pool ie they do not expire eligible states include those whose total cumulative spending through the end of the previous fiscal year exceeds their cumulative orig inal allotments for the same time period these states would receive an amount equa l to the ratio of such states original allotment for the previous fiscal year to the total original allotments of all eligible states for the same prior fiscal year waivers under medicaid and schip section 1115 of the social security act provides the secretary of hhs with broad authority to conduct research and demonstration projects under medicaid nd five other programs under this authority the secretary may waive provisi ons in section 1902 of medicaid statute usually freedom of provider choice comparability of benefits and statewideness1 most largescale statewide waivers are pproved for 5year period the costs of such waivers are allowable expenditures unde r the applicable program schip is not identified in section 1115 however th schip statute stat that section 1115 pertaining to research and demonstrati on projects applies to schip but does not specify which sections may be waivedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31602crs5 congress has twice changed section 1115 au thority as it applies to the medicaid waiver review and approval process first bba97 provided process for 3year extension of medicaid statewide comprehensive section 1115 waiver projects beyond the initial 5year term second bipa 2000 defined process for approving extensions beyond initial 3year extensions much of the detail surrounding the polic ies and procedures for reviewing and approving section 1115 waiver proposals has been issued by the secretary of hhs through written guidance for example in 1994 the secretary published notice in the federal register outlining requirements with resp ect to public notification and involvement during the deve lopment phase of proposed waiver projects under medicaid schip did not yet exist at that time since that time the secretary has provided other waiver guidance in july 25 2001 letter to the house committee on energy and commerce hhs described its public notification requirements for the 3year waiver extensions provided by bba 97 in other letters to state medicaid directors and to state health officials the secretary has described policy with respect to overall budget neutrality re quirements coverage of childless adults under schip as well as further details on public noti ce and involvement requirements most recently under the current bush administr ation new health insurance flexibility and accountability hifa1115 waiver in itiative for medicaid and schip was established and guidance and technical information for this initiative was made available to states through postings to the agencys website the initiative encourages states to develop statewide pr ojects that coordinate medicaid and schip with private health insurance coverage nd target uninsured individuals with income below 200 of the fede ral poverty level s 3018 responds to recent concerns th at some approved waivers exceed the statutory authority of the secretary and that explicit statutory procedures would improve the waiver approval pr ocess the bill places on bot h states and the secretary of hhs certain public notice and hearing requirements and re quirements regarding receipt and consideration of public comments in the waiver development review and approval process it would clarify that 1 the waiver of specific section under given title must promote the objectives of that title 2 the requirements under medicaids early and periodic screening diagnostic and treatment program for children may not be waived and 3 the secretary may not approve waivers that would use schip funds to cover childless adults excluding caretaker relatives medicaids federal medical assistance percentage fmap the federal share of the cost of medicaid items and services excluding administrative expenses is established by formula set in statute determined annually the fmap is designed so that the federal government pays larger portion of medicaid costs in states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and vice versa for states with higher per capita income fmap must not fall below 50 and may not exceed 83 fmap for the territories is statutorily set at 50 in the territories medicaid is also subject to spending caps thus the federal government pays 50 of the cost of medicaid items and services up to those spending caps while the underlying fmap formula fo r all states has not been changed congress has modified fmap in certain s ituations in bba97 the fmap for the district of columbia was permanently raised to 70 it also increased alaskashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31602crs6 fmap to 598 for fy1998 through fy2000 under bipa2000 the formula for calculating the state percentage and thus the federal share for alaska for fy2001 through fy2005 was changed the state per centage for alaska is calculated using an adjusted per capita income calculation instead of the statewide average per capita income generally used the adjusted per capita income for alaska is calculated as the 3year average per capita inco for the state divided by 105 as with the dsh provisions the senate bill responds to states concerns that recent fiscal pressure may result in medicaid cuts to ease states burden s 3018 would temporarily increase fmaps for fy 2003 spending caps for the territories would be increased only states and territories that maintain medicaid eligibility levels as of january 1 2002 or reinstate ligibility levels as of that date would be eligible for the fmap increase this bill would also appropriate 1 billion in additional temporary grants under the social services block grant title xx of the social security act the grant allotments for each state and territory are specified and these funds may be used for services di rected at the goals set forth in title xx the following sidebyside comparison provides brief desc ription of current law and the changes made to medicaid sc hip and other health programs
