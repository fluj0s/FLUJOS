committees an overview summary since the beginning of the federal g overnment presidents have called upon executive branch officials to provide them with advice regarding matters of policy and administration while cabi net members were among the first to play such role the creation of the executive office of th president eop in 1939 and the various agencies located within that structure resulted in large increase in the number and variety of presidential advise rs all senior staff members of the white house office and the leaders of the various eop agencies and instrumentalities could be said to serve as advisers to the president occasionally these executive branch offi cials playing presidential advisory role have been called upon to testif before congressional committees and subcommittees sometimes such invited appearances have been prompted by allegations of personal misc onduct on the part of the official but they have also included instances when accountability for policymaking and administrative or managerial actions have instigated the request for testimony because such appearances before congressional committees or subcommittees seemingly could result in demands for advice proffered to the president or the disclosure inadvertent or otherwise of such advice there has been resistance from time to time by the chief executive to allowing such testimony congress has constitutionally rooted righ t of access to the information it needs to perform its article i legislative nd oversight functi ons generally congressional committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter which is conducting an authorized investigation for legislative or oversight purposes has right to information held by the executive branch in the absence of either valid claim of constitutional privilege by the executive or statutory provision whereby congress has limited its constitutional right to information congressional committee may request informally or by letter from the committee chair perhaps cosigned by the ranking member or demand pursuant to subpoena the testimony of presidential adviser however congress may encounter legal and political problems in attempting to enforce subpoena to presidential adviser conflicts concer ning congressional requests or demands for executive branch testimony or documents often i nvolve extensive negotiations and may

memorial association 1903 pp 303304presidential advisers testimony before congressional committees an overview since the beginning of the federal g overnment presidents have called upon executive branch officials to provide them with advice regarding matters of policy and administration the constitution reco gnized such relationships when it authorized the president in article ii s ection 2 to require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective ffices there were as well reasons to expect that such advice whether offered orally or in writing would be held in confidence the advice was for the presidents consideration and his decisionmaking the matters involved we re sensitive perhap s bearing upon the foreign military economic or law enforcem ent policy of the nation also the provision discussion and use of such advice by the executive branch could affect its relationships with the other coequal constitutional branches president george washington and his cabinet had these consid erations in mind as secretary of state thomas jeffersons notes on their delibera tions reflect when they decided upon response to 1792 congressiona l request for information we had all considered and were of one mind first that the house was an inquest and therefore might institute inquiries second that it might call for papers generally third that the executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit and ought to refuse those the disclosure of which would injure the public consequently were to exercise discretion fourth that neither the committee nor h ouse had right to call on the head of department who and whose papers were under the president alone but that the committee should instruct their chairman to move the house to address the president1 the cabinet composed of the principal officers in each of the executive departments failed for veral reasons to develop as an important source of presidential advice the department heads constituting the cabinet were often chosen to satisfy interests that contributed significantly to the presidents election considerations of partisanship ideology geography public image and stature and aptitude among others figured prominen tly in their selection sometimes the president was not personally well acquainte d with these individuals and had only minimal confidence and trust in them in few cases political rival was included in the cabinethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31351crs2 2 arthur m schlesinger jr the age of

suited to the group deliberation of the cabinet similarly many cabinet members might have felt unqualified or were unw illing to offer counsel to the president on matters outside of their immediate portfolios their advice was perhaps limited to and protective of departmental interests finally personal hostilities between or among department heads could result in such tumult within the cabinet that little useful advice could be gained consequently presidents generally looke d to other quarters for advisers one development in this regard was the creation of circles of advisers composed of both public officials and private citizens pr esident andrew jackson whose election and white house tenure occurred in an era marked by violent political controversy and party instability utilized an informal gr oup of advisers which came to be known as the kitchen cabinet the members represented rising social groups as yet denied the prestige to which they felt their power and energies entitled them newspapermen the presidents private secretary campaign organizers and officials from prior administrations and longtime personal friends2 when john tyler succeeded to the presidency upon the death of william henry harrison he revived jacksons practice deserted by whigs and democrats alike tyler resorted to select circle of advisers composed of personal and political friends from his native virginia college president state supreme court judge four members of the states delegation in the house of representatives and senator3 following this practice several succeed ing presidents had informal groups of advisers that were given colorful names by the press for example for grover cleveland it was fishing cabinet for th eodore roosevelt tennis cabinet for warren g harding poker cabinet nd for herbert hoover medicine ball cabinet jacksons inclusion of his personal secr etary in his kitche n cabinet reflects another line of development regarding presidential advisers beginning with washington presidents sought to meet the demands of their office with the assistance of single personal secretary usually relative compensated from their own private resources in 1833 congress au thorized the president to appoint with the advise and consent of the senate secretary whos duty it shall be under the direction of the president to sign in his name and for him all patents for lands sold or granted under the authority of the united states4 jackson named andrew jackson donelson his wifes nephew and curre nt personal secretary to this position relieving himself of conti nued personal compensation of the young man ultimately congress appropriated funds to the chief executive in 1857 for an official household personal secretary steward to supervise the executive mansion and

and an administrative assistant6 appointed to these senior staff pos itions were presidential lieutenants if not presidential intimates nd advisers when franklin d roosevelt came to the presidency in 1933 he brought with him from his new york gubernatorial experience new kind of advisory circle composed of intellectuals or at least core group of columbia university professors who were joined by other ideas people to form the brains trust because there we re an insufficient number of staff positions at the white house to accommodate them these advisers were placed elsewhere in the executive branch but for the most part directly served the president7 this staffing situation coordination pr oblems and the development of new administrative management concept prompted roosevelt to create by announcement study panel the presidents committ ee on administrative management under the leadership of louis brownlow pr ominent public administration practitioner in 1936 to examine and make recomme ndations regarding these matters8 reporting some 10 months later the brownlow committee addressed presidential staffing in dramatic and detailed terms the president needs help his immediate staff assistance is entirely inadequate he should be given small number of executive assistants who would be his direct aides in dealing with the managerial agencies and administrative departments of the government these assistants probably not exceeding six in number would be in addition to the presen t secretaries who deal with the public with the congress and with the press and radio these aides would have power to make decisions or issue instruc tions in their own right they would not be interposed between the president nd the heads of his departments they would not be assistant presidents in an sense their function would be when any matter was presented to the presiden t for action affecting any part of the administrative work of the government to assist him in obtaining quickly and without delay all pertinent informa tion possessed by any of the executive departments so as to guide him in making his responsible decisions and then when decisions have been made to assist him in seeing to it that every administrative department and agency affected is promptly informed their effectiveness in assisting the president w ill we think be directly proportional to their ability to discharge their functions with restraint they would remain in the background issue orders make deci sions emit public statements men for these positions should be carefully c hosen by the president from within and without the government they should be men in whom the president has personal confidence and whose character and attitude is sic such that they would not attempt to exercise power on their own account they should be possessed of high competence great physical vigor and passion for anonymity they should be installed in the white h ouse itself directly accessible to the president in

propose reorganization plans subject to veto by majority vote of disapproval in both houses of congress and to also appoint six administrative assistants after three days of disc ussion and debate the

of administrative management and the effective coordinati on of the tremendously widespread federal machinery he called the initial version little thing compared to its later size it grew under roosevelt and it continued to expand and was further regularized by statute by appropriation acts and by more reorganization plans during the succeeding years16 the executive office organized by eo 8248 consisted of the white house office the bureau of the budget the national resources planning board the office of government reports and the liaison office for personnel management it also provided that in the event of national emergency there could be established such office for emergency management as the president shall determine the office for emergency management was created by an administrative order on may 25 1940 and its functions were further sp ecified in an administrative order of january 7 194117 it subsequently served as pa rent unit for number of subordinate emergency management bodies presidential adviser growth the creation of the executive office of the president contributed to an increase in the number of presidential advisers fo r several reasons first it provided an enclave for various agencies that immediately assisted the president primary among these was the white house office which was longer merely the presidents small office staff but an agency with hierar chically organized staff positions whose personnel rapidly expanded dur ing the next few decades second it counted agencies such as the liaison office for personnel management and the office for emergency management that were headed by an administrative assistant and adviser to the president on the white house office payroll it also included agencies such as the bureau of the budget and its office of management and budget successor th at were headed by leaders for whom advising the president was primary responsibility third senior white house office staff w ould come to

presiden t for natural resources counselor to the president for human resources and counselor to the president for community development18 having such dual white house office titles was viewed as giving added emphasis if not authority to the role of these officials as presidential advisers in the aftermath of world war ii cong ress statutorily chartered most of the agencies within the executive office of the president furthermore congress routinely appropriated funds for the operating expenses of these entities in 1944 congress had adopted an amendment to an appropriation bill th at was designed to restrain the creation of executive office agencies by executive order frequent occurrence during 19411944 the amendment stated after january 1 1945 part of any ppropriation or fund made available by this or any other act shall be allotted or made available to or used to pay the expenses of any agency or instrume ntality including those established by executive order after such agency or inst rumentality has been in existence for more than one year if the congress has not appropriated any money specifically for such agency or instrumentality or sp ecifically authorized the expenditure of funds by it19 in 1982 when t itle 31 of the united states code was recodified the amendment was repealed and replaced with new language at section 134720 the opening sentence of the new section which remains as operative law states an agency in existence for more than one ear may not use amounts otherwise available for obligation to pay its expenses wit hout specific appropriation or

before congressi onal committees and the circumstances under which they may do so remains unres olved by the courts133 and is matter that may be determined by casebycase accommoda tion between the

those few executive branch witne sses whose sole responsibility is that of advising the president who should not be required to appear before congress at all since all of their official responsibilitie s would be subject to claim of privilege and the executive branch witness whose responsibilities include the administration of department s or agencies established by congress and from
