nato and the european union eu have evolved along with europes changed strategic landscape while natos collective defense guarantee remains at the core of the alliance members have also sought to redefine its mission as new security challenges have emerged on europes periphery and beyond at the same time eu members have taken steps toward political integration with decisions to develop common foreign policy and defense arm to improve eu member states abilities to manage security crises such as those that engulfed the balkans in the 1990s the evolution of nato and the eu however has generated some friction between the united states and several of its allies over the security responsibilities of the two organizations us european differences center around threat assessment defense institutions and military capabilities successive us administrations and the us congress have called for enhanced european defense capabilities to enable the allies to better share the security burden and to ensure that na tos postcold war mission embraces combating terrorism and countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction us policymakers backed by congress support eu efforts to develop european security and defense policy esdp provided that it remains tied to na to and does not threaten the transatlantic relationship most eu member states support close natoeu li nks but also view esdp as means to give themselves more options for dealing with future crises especially in cases in which the united states may be reluctant to become involved minority of eu countries spearheaded traditionally by france continue to favor more autonomous eu defense identity this desire has been fueled further recently by disputes with the united states over how or whether to engage international institutions such as the united nations on security matters and over the weight given to political versus military instruments in resolving international crises this report addresses several questions central to the debate over european security and the future of the broader transatlantic relationship that may be of interest in the second session of the 110 th congress these include what are the specific security missions of nato and the european union and what is the appropriate relationship between the two organizations what types of military forces are necessary for natos role in collective defense and for the eus role in crisis management are nato and eu decisionmaking structures and procedures appropriate and compatible to ensure that there is an adequate and timely response to emerging threats what is the proper balance between political and military tools for defending europe and the united states from terrorism and weapons proliferation what is the effect of enlargement on security and stability this report will be updated as events warrant for more information see crs report rl33627 nato in afghanistan test of the transatlantic alliance by paul

community ec now the european union eu had their origins in postworld war ii efforts to bring stability to europe natos original purpose was to provide collective defense through mutual security guarantee for the united states and its european allies to counterbalance potential threats from the soviet union the european communitys purpose was to provide political stability to its members through securing democracy and free markets congress and successive administrations have strongly supported both nato and the eceu based on the belief that stability in eu rope has engendered the growth of democracy reliable military allies and strong trading partners in the second session of the 110 th congress members will likely exhibit an interest in natos effort to develop more mobile combat forces enhance the alliances role in afghanistan examine the appropriateness of possible missile defense system for europe and enlargement of the alliance as in the previous several years the evolution of the natoeu relationship is also likely to attract congressional attention evolution of na to and the eceu after the colla pse of the soviet union in 1991 has brought with it some friction between the united states and several of its allies over the security responsibilities of the two organizations these differences center around threat assessment defense institutions and military capabilities european nato allies that were also members of the eceu have sought from 1990 to build security apparatus able to respond to developments believed to threaten specifically the interests of europe in 1990 after iraqs invasion of kuwait some european governmentsled by franceconcluded that they lacked the military capabilities to respond beyond the north atlantic treaty area to distant threats in consultation with the united states they sought to establish the european security and defense identity esdi within nato in which they would consult among themselves and with nato over response to threat both the first bush administration and the clinton administration asked that esdi not duplicate nato structures such as headquarters and planning staff but rather borrow nato structures for planning and carrying out operations initial reluctance of the clinton administration to involve the united states in the emerging conflicts accompanying the break up of yugoslavia led some allies to redouble their efforts to enhance their political consultation unity and military capabilities they saw threat in the form of large refugee flows autocratic regimes and the spread of nationalist ideas emanating from the conflictridden balkans in 19941996 nato endorsed steps to build an esdi that was separable but not separate from nato to give the european allies the ability to act in crises where na to as whole was not engaged in 19981999 the eu largely adopted esdi as its own and began to transform it into european security and defense policy esdp given greater definition by more detailed arrangements for the europeans to borrow nato assets for the petersberg tasks crisis management peace operations search and rescue and humanitarian assistance britain in major policy reversal joined france in moving forward discussions of these new arrangements within the eu esdps principal differences with esdi were in the effort to secure more independence from nato tutelage and guidance in the event that the united states expressed reluctance to become involved in crisis renewed discussion of more carefully outlined eu decisionmaking structures and

conflict of 1999 further spurred this effort when most eu members of nato conceded that they still lacked adequately mobile and sustainable forces for crisis management all eu members express wish to see strong usled nato however there are disputes with the united states over how or whether to involve international institutions such as th in international crises there are also disagreements over the weight given to political versus military instruments in resolving these crises these disputes have fueled european desires to develop more independent esdp 1 the united states maintains that esdp must be closely tied to nato given the large number of states that belong to both nato and the eu see membership chart in appendix and limited european defense resources congress is actively engaged in the evolving natoeu relationship while congress has supported the greater political integration that marked the european communitys evolution into the european union many members have called for improved european military capabilities to share the security burden and to ensure that natos postcold war mission embraces combating terrorism and wmd proliferation in 1998 and again in 2003 the senate approved the addition of new members to the alliance as means to build european stability through securing democratic governments and adding states that shared concerns over emerging threats during the 1998 na to enlargement debate senator jon kyl offered an amendment to the instrument of ratification that described terr orism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd as new threats that na to must counter the kyl amendment called on the european allies to develop capabilities to project power and provide basis for ad hoc coalitions of willing partners member states should possess national military capabilities to rapidly deploy forces over long distances sustain operations for extended periods of time and operate jointly with the united states in high intensity conflict 2 the amendment passed by wide margin its essence was apparent in natos strategic concept the alliances strategic guidelines adopted at the washington summit in april 1999 and in subsequent nato agreements to redefine the alliances mission and to improve capabilities the issues raised in the 1990s debate over european security remain the essence of the debate today what are the missions in security affairs of na to and the european union what is the proper weight to be given to political and military instruments in defending europe and the united states from terrorism and proliferation what types of military forces are necessary for natos role in collective defense and for the eus role in crisis management are nato and eu decisionmaking structures and procedures appropriate and compatible to ensure that there is an adequate and timely response to emerging threats what should be the role of other international institutions in responding to these threats issues

appropriately and effectively the risks associated with the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weapons the document also describes terrorism as threat but indicates that political and diplomatic means should be the main instruments against both terrorism and proliferation the attacks of september 11 2001 on the united states led to refinement of the allied posture on these threats in may 2002 communiqué nato agreed that the allies must be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed sustain operations over distance and time and achieve their objectives the communiqué marks the moment that na to decided to assume responsibilities around the globe should an ally be threatened in november 2002 at the prague summit the allies made commitment to build the capabilities necessary to go out of area they agreed to establish nato response force nrf of 20000 troops for rapid insertion into theater of op erations the nrf consists of highly trained combat units from member states and could be used to fight terrorism in addition the allies agreed to scaleddown list of new capabilities called the prague capabilities commitment pcc that declining european defense budgets might be able to sustain under the pcc some allies have agreed to develop consortia to fund jointly such systems as strategic airlift and aerial refueling meant to provide mobility for combat operations distant from europe or specialized niche capabilities such as special forces or units to detect chemical or biological agents 3

transatlantic agreement on the new co mmon threats the nrf and the pcc there are significant differences between the united states and its allies over appropriate responses most allied governments contend that the administration places excessive emphasis on military over political means to counter threat and that the allies have other domestic budget priorities such as pension plans that compete with allocations for defense the allies response to the bush administrations doctrine of preemptive attack in the face of an imminent threat captures elements of the transatlantic debate over response to the threat the administrations national security strategy 2002 notes that the united states reserves the right to take military action to forestall or prevent hostile acts by an adversary while most allies would concede such right some view the doctrine as an example of us unilateralism at the moment of us global military preeminence in general they believe that military action must be undertaken within multilateral framework the allied debate over preemptive attack was affected by the us decision to terminate weapons inspections and to go to war against iraq in march 2003 conflict administration officials indicate was undertaken to prevent the hussein regime from developing and using weapons of mass destruction against the united states and other countries the initial refusal by france germany and belgium to approve nato military assistance to turkey in february 2003 in anticipation of possible attack by iraq sharply divided the alliance most allies said then and maintain now that resolution is requisite step whenever possible for nato military action the inability of the bush administration to locate wmd in iraq led to renewed insistence 3 for detailed analysis of the

their opposition was correct and that imprimatur should be sought for nato operations4 allied insistence on involvement of international institutions in legitimizing conflict has its origins in the aftermath of the 20th centurys two world wars europeans remain wary of arguments justifying the crossing of borders and resorting to military action establishment of the united nations in 1946 under us leadership was one means to ensure that international diplomatic and public opinion could be brought to bear to enhance understanding of an impending danger and how to respond to it the north atlantic treatys 1949 reliance on the consensus method of decisionmaking was another the allied debate over preemptive attack outofarea engagement and legitimization of military operations was brought to head by the bush administrations frustration with cumbersome alliance decisionmaking procedur the administration believes that nato military actions should mostly be conducted by coalitions of the willing in this view the allies of which only small number have deployable forces capable of highintensity conflict should use coalitions of member states that agree upon threat and have the means to counter it most european allies believe that coalitions of the willing undermine the solidarity of the alliance and the consensus decisionmaking principle their support for the principle of consensus centers upon desire to maintain political solidarity for controversial measures in this view the consent of 26 sovereign governments each taking an independent decision to work with other governments is formidable expression of solidarity and in itself provides measure of legitimization for an operation some allies believe that this view was given weight for example in natos decision to go to war against serbia in 1999 when russian resistance prevented passage of security council resolution approving intervention on behalf of kosovo 5 the administration proposed controversial groundbased missile defense system to be placed in poland and the czech republic to defend against possible missile attack by iran questions immediately arose in congress and europe about the feasibility of the proposed system as well as the nature of the perceived threat some allies believe that na to should develop new strategic concept given the ongoing debate over the proper balance between the use of military and political tools to bring global stability some allies wish to see brief document that clearly states na tos purpose and its role in regional and global stabilization the allies are likely to discuss the possibility of drafting new strategic concept at natos bucharest summit in april 2008

usable soldiers and have the political will to deploy more of them in multinational operations former na to supreme allied commander saceur general james jones told congress in march 2004 that only 3 4 of european forces were expeditionarily deployable7 the bush administration proposed both the na to response force nrf and the prague capabilities commitment in 2002 to help remedy this problem the purpose of the initiatives has been to create forces that integrate for example aerial refuelers and airlift capacities to allow troops and equipment to be moved to conflict the allies believe that shared funding of some of these capabilities will moderate the costs to individual governments at natos riga summit in november 2006 the allies declared the nrf fully operational perhaps prematurely the nrf was to have 20000 troops on rotation in highreadiness status it can be packaged to respond to range of crises from humanitarian assistance after an earthquake for example to an insertion force for highinten sity combat the nrf is to reach its destination within 730 days and sustain itself for period of time however the alliance has had difficulty in filling out the nrf and planning for three rotations some allies are overstretched in security operations around the globe others express concern about the potentially high costs of participating in an ongoing nrf mission and are asking that the allies consider more equitable plan for sharing such costs in the meantime some governments are reluctant to contribute forces to the nrf there is now debate about the evolution of the role of the nrf the united states and several other allies believe that the nrf should be used in current operations such as in afghanistan others such as france and germany wish to preserve the original concept of an nrf by keeping it available as quick insertion force in crisis and as an apparatus to spur member governments to continue the transformation of their militaries to more mobile forces 8 general jones pressed the idea that more na to assets be funded jointly to ensure availability of needed equipment and forces today nato for the most part follows the concept of costs lie where they fall meaning that governments pay the costs for forces they send to an operation such as in kosovo in 1999 such practice translates into the larger countries with more military capabilities and political will bearing disproportionate costs in providing security for all otherwise the concern is that nato risks failing to develop appropriate forces such as the nrf as governments decline to contribute troops because they might be used for expensive operations 9 at the riga summit sixteen allies announced that they were pooling resources to purchase four boeing c17s in 2007 step that will enhance natos capability to airlift troops and equipment to distant theaters the prague capabilities commitment pcc is slimmeddown version of an earlier capabilities initiative and has eight capability goals targeting the allies principal deficiencies the list of pcc capabilities includes strategic lift air and sea aerial refueling precisionguided munitions secure communications ground

nuclear defense battalion had become fully operational fulfilling one of the capability goals there has been some progress in purchase or leasing of sea lift and the acquisition of precisionguided munitions is on schedule while some us officials say that the pcc is on schedule others say that there remain serious shortfalls in aerial refuelers and air lift where pcc goals are unlikely to be met in the foreseeable future10 the allies designed the capabilities list to form an integrated set of systems because allies are not acquiring some systems other systems effectiveness will be diminished for example improved lift capacity is necessary if equipment munitions and forces are to reach theater of operations in timely fashion some governments such as the german government have pleaded that competing budget necessities such as pension programs are forestalling plans to modernize their militaries the german parliament has also reduced and capped defense expenditures for the next several years 11 at the 2006 na to riga summit the allies issued document called the comprehensive political guidance signed by the members 26 heads of state in the coming years the leaders called on all allies to develop forces of which 40 would be structured for deployment and 8 for sustained operations at any given time12 some analysts worry that nato and the eu might compete for the use of more mobile high readiness forces the eu is developing its own rapid reaction forces for crisis management some of these units are double hatted for use either by the eu or by nato the eu also has embarked on an initiative to enhance its military capabilities and equipment procurement including for example greater strategic lift and weapons for suppression of enemy air defenses the issue of which

afghanistan relatively stable part of the country only in an urgent situation may they go to southern afghanistan an area increasingly unstable and the location of considerable fighting by us british canadian and dutch forces against the taliban the allies lifted some but not all caveats in afghanistan at the riga summit at the same time national caveats are an expres sion of sovereignty by member governments and on occasion may be the price that must be paid to secure the participation of government in nato mission national caveats is political rm and not an official nato description of restrictions on forces the united states has taken the lead in criticizing governments that place caveats on their forces however some us military officials say that some allies might also contend that the united states has its own caveats but that washington chooses to call them by another name for example the united states as do other governments places restrictions on the range of actions that its forces may undertake in the balkans and afghanistan but describes these restrictions as tactical rules of engagement 14 in general however us military officials oppose national caveats because they complicate the forceplanning process with caveats in place force planners must cajole member states to supply troops who have the authority and skills to accomplish mission these

composed of soldiers and civil affairs officers in parts of afghanistan the objective of the prts is to extend the authority of the central government provide security and undertake projects such as infrastructure development that would boost the afghan economy this effort has met with only mixed success in part because allied governments have been slow to sponsor prts and to provide troops for them in part because some allies lack deployable sustainable forces key element lacking in some prts is quickresponse combat and medical units that could assist prts that find themselves in danger the

alliance from at least early 2002 some allies particularly france and germany were contending that the principal threats to the allies lay elsewhere in the nuclear programs of iran and north korea and from instability in pakistan and afghanistan they contended that iraq could be contained through sanctions and after the fall of 2002 wmd inspections 18 transatlantic differences over iraq touched off bitter dispute in nato in february 2003 shortly before the war when france germany and belgium blocked initial us efforts to provide na to defensive assistance to turkey they argued that such assistance would be tantamount to acknowledgment that war was necessary and imminent at time when inspections were still underway the iraq conflict and ensuing failure to locate wmd sharpened debate among the allies over an appropriate nato role in iraq and iraqs effect on allied interests the administration contends that stabilization of iraq is in the interest of all allies the insurgency and general disorder in much of iraq has opened the door to terrorist foothold in the country administration officials believe that anchoring democratic institutions in iraq will have positive reverberative effect on middle eastern governments that have authoritarian traditions the bush administration has gained small measure of nato involvement in iraq nato has agreed to training mission for iraqi security forces many allies led by france and germany recognize that an unstable iraq is an unsettling force in the already volatile middle east however they believe that the arabisraeli conflict must first be settled before there can be stability in the region and that us policy favors israel excessively and is thus an impediment to peace 19 they are skeptical that an outside power

object to former defense secretary rumsfelds repeated advocacy of coalitions of the willing to fight in conflicts as means of using allied resources and supportive nato governments to endorse us interventions on foreign soil they argue that the administrations contention that the mission drives the coalition undermines allied solidarity such doctrine weakens the longheld view that all member states must believe that they have stake in allied security operations some allies believe that the united states relies too heavily upon military power to resolve issues that may have political solution they place the issue of proliferation in this realm and cite the longterm economic pressure of sanctions against libya followed by us and british negotiations with tripoli as evidence that

chiefs of defense or their representatives in brussels and the military staff consisting of about 130 military experts seconded from member states the eu has also established cooperation mechanisms

the eu and noneu european nato members this framework allows for consultations to be intensified in the event of crisis and permits noneu nato members to contribute to euled operations the eu also agreed to establish ad hoc committees of contributors for euled missions to give noneu participants role in operational decisionmaking the natoeu link was formalized in december 2002 which paved the way for the implementation in march 2003 of the berlin plus arrangement berlin plus allows the eu to borrow alliance assets and capabilities for euled operations and thereby aims to prevent needless

common assets for euled operations in which the alliance as whole is not engaged 30 in december 2003 nato and the eu reached an agreement on enhancing the eus military planning capabilities and natoeu

nato to station liaison officers at the eu military staff to help ensure transparency and close coordination between na to and the eu this na toeu agreement was controversial for some nato advocates

objectionable to nato interests british officials maintain that the new eu cell will not be standing headquarters and that national headquarters will still remain the main option for running missions without na to assets31 nevertheless natoeu relations remain somewhat strained more formal strategic discussions between nato and the eu on issues such as terrorism or the middle east have proven elusive due to the differences in membership in both organizations the ongoing dispute over the divided island of cyprus and different us and european views of natoeu relations turkey non eu nato member has objected to cyprus which joined the eu in 2004 participating in natoeu ambassadorial meetings on the grounds that it is not member of natos partnership for peace and hence does not have security relationship with the alliance as result discussions are limited to the joint na toeu operation in bosnia see below and improving military capabilities 32 eu members such as france belgium and greece say they object to dialogue on other global security challenges in such natoeu meetings because not all eu member states are represented disputes between turkey and the eu have also stymied

enhancing european military capabilities has been and remains key challenge for the eu as it seeks to forge credible esdp as noted above the 1999 nato war in kosovo demonstrated serious deficiencies in european military assets and the widening technology gap with us forces european shortfalls in strategic airlift precisionguided munitions command and control systems intelligence aerial refueling and suppression of enemy air defenses were among the most obvious in setting out the parameters of the 60000strong headline goal rapid reaction force eu leaders sought to establish goals that would require members to enhance force deployability and sustainability and to reorient and ultimately increase defense spending to help fill equipment gaps the most ambitious members envisioned the eus rapid reaction force developing combat capability equivalent for example to na tos role in the kosovo conflict in 2000 and 2001 the eu held two military capability commitment conferences to define national contributions to the rapid reaction force and address the capability shortfalls member states pledged in excess of 60000 troops drawn from their existing national forces as well as up to 400 combat aircraft and 100 naval vessels as support elements in 2001 the eu also initiated european capability action plan ecap to devise strategies for remedying the capability gaps in may 2003 the eu declared that the rapid reaction force possesses operational capability across the full range of petersberg tasks but recognized that the force would still be limited and constrained by recognized

many military analysts assert that overall levels of european defense spending are insufficient to fund all esdp requirements european leaders are reluctant to ask legislatures and publics for more money for defense given competing domestic priorities and tight budgets in light of the dim prospects for increased defense spending in the near term eu officials emphasize that they do not need to match us defense capabilities exactlywhich they view as increasingly impossibleand stress they can fill critical gaps by spending existing defense resources more wisely eu leaders point out that rationalizing member states respective defense efforts and promoting multinational projects to reduce internal operating costs have been key goals of ecap some options under consideration include leasing commercial assets primarily for air transport sharing or pooling of national assets among several member states niche specialization in which one or more member state would assume responsibility for providing particular capability and more joint procurement projects in june 2004 eu leaders agreed to establish european defense agency eda devoted to improving european military capabilities and interoperability key focus of the eda will be to help eu members stretch their scarce defense funds farther by increasing cooperation in the areas of weapons research development and procurement in november 2005 eu defense ministers agreed on voluntary code of conduct to enco urage crossborder competition in the european defense equipment market traditionally eu member states have tightly guarded their national defense markets defense equipment contracts have been largely exempt on national security grounds from normal eu internal market rules that eliminate trade barriers the eu hopes that more competition will lead to lower defense procurement costs improved capabilities and increase the competitiveness of the european defense market globally the new code of conduct took effect in july 2006 for those countries that decided to take part 35 critics however charge that promises to spend existing defense resources more wisely have not yet materialized in any substantial way they doubt that eu member states will be willing to make the hard political choices that could ultimately produce more bang for the euro because these could infringe on national sovereignty for example they point out that niche specialization would require some member states to forego building certain national capabilities while proposals to pool assets may require members to relinquish national controls some question how effective the eda will be in promoting harmonization of equipment purchases given that many member states remain wedded to fulfilling national requirements and may be reluctant to expose their own defense industries to competition from other european weapons producers critics point out that the new agreed code of conduct to liberalize the european defense markets will be voluntary and therefore unenforceable many expect that some european defense ministries will also be slow to move away from their trusted national suppliers skeptics also criticize european leaders continued devotion to the increasingly expensive but still nonexistent airbuss a400m military transport project in which seven european allies are investing large portions of their

eu leaders endorsed new headline goal 2010 aimed at further developing european military capabilities the headline goal 2010 is focused on improving the interoperability deployability and sustainability of member states armed forces key element of the headline goal is the battlegroups concept which seeks to further enhance the eus ability to respond rapidly to emerging crises and undertake the full spectrum of petersberg tasks each battlegroup will consist of about 1500 highreadiness troops capable of being deployed within 15 days for up to four months for either standalone missions or as spearhead force to prepare the ground for larger followon peacekeeping operation the conceptual model appears to be largely based on the frenchled eu mission to the congo in 2003 see below which paved the way for peacekeeping force in november 2004 at the eus third military capability commitment conference eu officials announced plans for the creation of 13 battlegroups which may be formed by one or more member states and may also include noneu members the eu established an initial operating capacity of being able to field one battlegroup at time for 2005 and 2006 as of january 2007 the eu announced that the battlegroups were ful ly operational meaning that the eu now has the capacity to field two battlegroup operations nearly simultaneously the eu has not specified geographic area in which these battlegroups might operate but most observers believe that trouble spots in africa or the balkans are the most probable theaters for the battlegroups many european and american military experts view the eus battlegroups as more sustainable and practical than the eus 60000strong rapid reaction force they hope that the emphasis on highly trained rapidly deployable multinational formations indicate that the eu is growing more serious about enhancing its defense capabilities and seeking new ways to stretch existing defense resources farther eu officials stress that the battlegroup concept is intended to complement rather than compete with the new nato response force nrf and note that the eu and nato have been discussing ways to ensure that the battlegroups and the nrf are mutually reinforcing some analysts predict that the nrf will likely undertake higherintensity operations than the eu battlegroups in the near to medium term 37

to assist with bosnian defense reforms counterterrorism efforts and the apprehension of war criminals 39 the eu is also planning to lead in the near future an internatio nal civilian presence in kosovo which is expected to declare independence from serbia in early 2008 the eu has also sought to play role beyond the balkans from june to september 2003 the eu led an international peacekeeping force of 1400 in the democratic republic of congo that sought to stop rebel fighting and protect aid workers the congo mission was requested by the united nations and headed by france in lead nation capacity this mission came as surprise to many eu observers na to officials and us policymakers because it was geographically farther afield than they had thought the eu would venture and because it was conducted without recourse to na to assets the congo operation was planned by french military planners in national headquarters some nato and us officials were annoyed asserting that the eu should have first formally asked nato whether it wished to undertake the congo operation eu officials did consult with na to about the mission but maintain they were not obliged to ask nato for its permission given that the eu was not requesting to use nato assets 40 over the last few years the eu has deployed number of small missions to the congo to assist with policesecurity sector reforms and in support of the peacekeeping force in june 2005 the eu and nato agreed to coordinate efforts to airlift african union peacekeepers to sudan to help quell the ongoing violence in the darfur region in january 2008 the eu approved deploying 3700strong peacekeeping force to chad aimed at protecting the thousands of sudanese refugees there this mission is expected to begin in march 2008 in 2005 the eu

will give the european allies bigger role in alliance decisionmaking newer eu member states from central and eastern europe such as poland and the three baltic states back esdp but maintain that it must not weaken nato or the transatlantic link germany given its size and wealth is considered critical to the success of esdp but has played rather passive role in much of esdps development although always supportive of the initiative berlin was keen to tread carefully in light of us concerns in 2003 in the midst of the transatlantic dispute over iraq some observers noted that the thengerman government of chancellor gerhard schroeder appeared more receptive to french efforts to forge european defense arm independent of nato they point to the april 2003 meeting of french german belgian and

to include combating external terrorist threats or other new challenges such as countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in june 2002 eu leaders agreed that the union should develop

that the possible development wi thin nato of an eu caucusprenegotiated common eu positionscould complicate alliance decisionmaking and decrease washingtons leverage as noted previously eu plans for its rapid reaction force may depend on double or triplehatting forces already assigned to na to or other multinational units thus potentially depriving nato of forces it might need if larger crisis arose subsequent to an eu deployment others fear that the eus success in establishing defense decisionmaking bodies has not been matched by capability improvements potentially leading to situation in
