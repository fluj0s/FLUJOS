the prevention of intentional or unintentional disclosure of private or confidential information to unauthorized persons integrity requirements ensure that information has not been changed

requirements of the nees application management controls are security controls ie safeguards or countermeasures for an information system that focus on the management of risk and the management of information system security2 the types of control measures must be consistent with the need for protection of the system according to nist 80053 the management controls class consists of the following families risk assessment planning system and services acquisition certification accreditation and security assessments 21risk assessment organizations must periodically assess the risk to organizational operations including mission functions image or reputation organizational assets and individuals resulting from the operation of organizational information systems and the associated processing storage or transmission of organizational information there is an increasing trend towards developing baseline approaches to manage the risks of business computer applications this concept proposes up front implementation of security controls for the most common and already recognized vulnerabilities of an operating environment the process may eliminate the need to conduct extensive formalized quantitative risk analyses to cost justify protective measures that may be required this section consisting of several parts is designed and developed as tool to collect general information about business applicationsystem and address the operating risk of noncomplex computer applicationoperating environment it extracts the pertinent security related information from the instructions and

passwords must be changed at least once every six months delete or reassign accounts as soon as users leave nih selecting passwords the objective when choosing password is to make it as difficult as possible for cracker to make educated guesses about what youve chosen this leaves himher alternative but brute force search trying every possible combination of letters numbers and punctuation search of this sort even conducted on machine that could try millions of passwords per second would require many years to complete what not to use dont use your login name eg smithj in any form asis reversed capitalized doubled etc dont use your first or last name in any form dont use your spouses or childs name dont use other information easily obtained about you this includes license plate numbers telephone numbers social security numbers the brand of your automobile the name of the street you live on etc dont use password of all digits or all the same letter this significantly decreases the search time for cracker dont use word contained in english or foreign language dictionaries spelling lists or other lists of words dont use password shorter than seven characters what to use do use password with mixedcase alphabetics if the system password is case sensitive do use password with nonalphabetic characters eg digits or punctuation or combine with alphabetic characters eg robot2 do use password that is easy to remember so you dont have to write it down do use password that you can type quickly without having to look at the keyboard this makes it harder for someone to steal your
