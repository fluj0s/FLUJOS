and is in the process of implementing them approval of grants according to the guidelines of the fund funding fo r projects should not exceed one third of the projects budget however for significant nu mber of projects the requesting grantees did not provide proof of funding sources that cover the remaining two thirds of the budget for projects where this information was available the secretariat of the fund did not verify the sources of these funds furthermore for substa ntial number of projects the budgets showed lump sum amount instead of listing detailed expe nditures as required under the guidelines new guideline requires proof that other donors we re contributing to the projects and this has been applied to the applications received from nove mber 2003 the board did not establish any policy for reducing requested grants in 2002 for 108 out of the 176 projects the approved grants were far belo w the amounts requested similarly in 2003 the practice prevailed oios recommended that the b oard of trustees of the fund should establish guidelines to determine the size of the g rants ohchr stated that the board of trustees would be seized of the recommendations onc they are formally transmitted to ohchr pending grants the guidelines do not establish reasonable time l imit up to which an approved grant can be kept pending in 2001 and 2002 there were pendi ng grants amounting to 160000 and 419000 respectively in the opinion of oios gran ts should not be kept pending beyond one year after its approval so the funds can be used f or other projects t he unvfvt secretariat established one year time limit for pending gr ants emergency grants in two out of ten emergency grants 94000 was pai d in five instalments into the personal bank account of the grantee making series of continue d emergency payments to an individual who was not victim and without review by the board wa s not in compliance with the guidelines oios recommended that the board be informed expost facto on any emergency grants made between sessions the board was informed of all emergency grants appr oved between sessions during the 23 rd session of the board of trustees held in october 2 004 financial reporting monitoring and evaluation contrary to the guidelines further grants for near ly half of the audited projects 13 out of 35 were released even if the recipients did not submit the required audited financial statements the guidelines lacked clarity as to the required fo rmat for the audited financial statements and audit certificate it was also not clear whether th audited financial statements were to cover the entire project or only the grant portion the financial statements submitted by the grantees did not appear to be in compliance with generally accepted accounting standards and did not provide sufficient information as to whether the grantees had complied with the conditio ns of the grant ie spent the money for the intended purpose and in accordance with the budget furthermore there was systematic followup of the projects and the available spreads heet did not contain adequate information for monitoring and followup oios recommended that the secretariat establish standardized format for the audited financial statements on the use of the grant and in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards and establi sh proper financial monitoring and evaluation mechanisms also the secretariat should not release further grants if financial reports for previous grants are overdue ohchr agreed that standardized format for the audited financial statements on the use of grants w ould be adopted ohchr also stated that grants have been released since 2003 where finan cial reports have not been received or if when received these are not

commission branch has accepted most of the recommendations made and i s in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 5 the objective of this audit was to review the fu nds activities to determine i compliance with regulations and rules and wi th the guidelines of the fund for the use of organizations and ii effectiveness and efficiency of the procedu res for the approval and payments of grants and financial reporting and monitoring of the fund 2 iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit reviewed 35 out of the 199 projects th at received grants amounting to 65 million during 20022003 the amount of the grants given to each selected project during this period ranged from 10000 to 500000 the audit r eviewed the funds existing and proposed guidelines procedures for approval payme nt and accounting of grants and their financial monitoring and evaluation the auditors assessed the internal control mechanisms analysed financial reports examined documents and interviewed responsible staff members 7 oios had not conducted any previous audit of the fund except for the audit of the receipt by unog of trust funds including this fund the board of auditors conducted an audit of ohchr trust funds their audit findings an d recommendations have been considered in this audit iv audit findings and recommendations 1 approval of grants 8 the secretariat of the fund receives application s for grants for projects by yearend the secretariat prescreens the projects and presen ts them to the board of trustees during their annual meeting held in may the board after reviewing the project documents recommends their approval and the amount of the gra nts on the basis of these recommendations the united nations high commission er for human rights approves the projects on behalf of the secretarygeneral 9 according to paragraph 25 of the guidelines the amount requested of the fund should not exceed one third of the projects budget the r equesting grantees must provide proof that other donors are contributing to the project to ens ure that the project is not fully dependent on the fund however oios review of the project fil indicated that significant number of the selected project applications did not contain p roof relating to other funding sources furthermore the secretariat did not verify asserti ons about other funding sources even if there was adequate time before review by the board furthermore contrary to paragraph 27 in the guidelines oios found that in significant nu mber of project proposals the budget showed lump sum amount instead of detailed lis ting of expenditures to be covered by the grant ohchr stated that the guideline requiring project pplicants to provide proof that other donors were contributing to their projects wa s adopted by the board at its twenty second session in may 2003 and that this has been pplied to the applications received from november 2003 10 the majority of the ngos applied for grants not exceeding one third of the project budget however the board recommended amounts far below those requested in 2002 in 108 of 176 projects the amount of the approved gra nt was far below the grants requested similarly in 2003 in 157 out of 199 projects the same trend prevailed oios noted that the board did not establish policy or basis for reduc ing the requested grants also oios did not see any indication that such reductions were adequa tely justified or that the grantees were advised of the reasons to cite an example of the t rend one ngo submitted request for grant of 241405 31 per cent for project with total budget of 781000 the approved grant was only 80000 or approximately 10 per cent of the total budget of the project ohchr needs to establish basis for such reduction s and ensure transparency in its approval 3 process ohchr clarified that the policy of the board with r egard to the size of the grants has been to ensure that all requests are treated fa irly through the division of the available money to all admissible requests recommendation head2right the unvfvt secretariat of ohchr in consultation wit h the board should establish clear guidelines to determin the size of the grants document the decisions taken and communicat them to the grantees the unvfvt secretariat should also establ ish procedures to verify other funding sources of the p rojects rec 01 11 ohchr stated that the board of trustees would be ized of the recommendations once they are formally transmitted to ohchr ohchr also required additional human resources to undertake the verification of other so urces of funding for the projects oios will retain the recommendation for follow up of t he outcome of the discussions of the board oios also wishes to point out recommendation 6 in its evaluation report on similar issue 2 pending grants 12 generally grants are paid promptly after the hi gh commissioner has approved the boards recommendations however in certain circ umstances grants are kept pending for reasons such as need for additional information or assessment by the secretariat or any office present in the field oios noticed that the guidelines do not establish reasonable time limit up to which an approved grant can be kep t pending oios review indicated that there were 5 160000 and 17 419000 pend ing grants relating to the period 2001 and 2002 respectively in the opinion of oios approved grants should not be kept pending beyond one year after the approval after one year the approval should lapse and funds should be used for other projects 13 ohchrs practice of raising one blanket obligat ion obmo for the total approved grants including pending grants does not allow ef fective monitoring of payments of grants it also raises the risk that the pending grant could b paid to another grantee in oios opinion for each pending grant separate obligation should be raised in the name of the specific grantee in order to ensure adequate followup and monitoring of the pending grants oios recommended that ohchr should establish time limi t such as one year from the time of approval for retaining grant as pending also ohchr should raise specific obligation for each of the pending grants for effective monito ring and followup 14 in response the unvfvt secretariat had already est ablished oneyear time limit for pending grants with respect to the raising f specific obligation for each pending grant ohchr suggested that three obligations be ra ised one for each category of grant ie prompt pending and emergency ohchr proposed to attach detailed table to each set of obligations including all information relating t the grants including the project number date the amount to be paid the payment number so as to facilitate follow up and monitoring this would be implemented from the 23 rd session of the board oios agrees with ohchrs suggestion and its implementation 4 3 emergency grants 15 according to the guidelines between sessions f the board grantee can apply for an emergency grant if the projects financed by the fun d encounters unforeseen financial difficulties according to established procedures the fund can provide an emergency grant on the basis of the approval by the chairman of the bo ard for amounts up to 20000 and two other board members for amounts exceeding 20000 individual victims of torture can also apply for an emergency grant provided they can prod uce evidence to that effect and provided that there is project financed by the fund that gives assistance to victims of torture in the applicants country ohchr amended the guideline to include the member f the board of the relevant geographical region in the approval of eme rgency grant from particular region 16 during the period 20012003 the fund provided ten emergency grants in two cases oios found that the grants were paid to an individu rather than an ngo the individual legal representative in two claims of torture rec eived total amount of 94000 in five instalments between february 2003 and may 2004 17 the grantee requested an emergency grant from t he fund in december 2002 to meet legal and related expenses for representing the ass assination case of xxx at the inter american court of human rights the funds secretar iat in consultation with the chairman of the board paid 20000 in february 2003 accord ing to the grantees report this amount was spent to settle debts incurred in 2002 subsequ ently the grantee requested supplementary grant of 34000 in february 2003 though the board met in may 2003 this additional request was not submitted to the board s regular case but was approved using emergency procedures the grantee was paid 20000 in july 2003 and another 14000 in november 2003 18 in january 2004 the same grantee requested an additional grant of 80000 to represent case involving yyy the funds secretar iat made 20000 payment in march 2004 after consultation with the chairman of the bo ard the secretariat also advised the grantee that for technical reasons series of payme nts would only be made after the receipt of the acknowledgement for the previous instalment subsequently payment of 20000 was made in may 2004 in oios opinion making serie s of continued emergency payments to an individual who is not victim circumvented th limits set by the guidelines oios noted that although an opportunity existed to consider an d approve these requests as regular cases the grants were nonetheless all paid on an emergenc case basis 19 oios also noted that all ten cases that had been ap proved and granted as emergency grants were not submitted to the subsequent board m eetings on an expost facto basis for review in oios opinion the board should be infor med on an expost facto basis on all emergency cases approved by the chairman oios reco mmended that all emergency requests be taken into consideration and approved in accorda nce with the guidelines and that the board should be informed of all emergency grants ap proved between sessions the recommendation has been implemented since the 23 rd session of the board of trustees held in october 2004 4 financial reporting 20 the guidelines stipulate that all grantees shou ld provide either financial report 5 on the use of the grant b audited financial stat ements issued by an independent audit authority presented and endorsed by the grantees g overning body or c an audit certificate issued by an independent audit authority when the g rantee is not required to have audited financial statements due to the absence of natio nal requirement however oios noticed that the guidelines lack clarity as to the format f the audited financial statements and audit certificate it is also not clear whether the grant ee is required to submit the audited financial statement relating to the entire project or to limi t it to the particular grant provided by the fund therefore as noticed from the files and the correspondence it was not always clear to the grantees which form and content of the audited annual financial statements were required as result oios noticed the following inadequacie s in many cases it was not clear to the secretariat whether the examiners who certified the audited financial statements were authorized to ce rtify them under the respective national laws many of the audited statements do not appear to b in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards audited financial statements submitted to the fund do not provide sufficient information as to whether the ngo has complied with the conditi ons of the grant eg spending the money for the intended purpose and in accordance with the approved budget in considerable number of projects 21 in 2002 an d 30 in 2003 the amount of grants approved by the board was 15000 or less it may n ot be worthwhile to require grantee to submit audited financial statements for such small grants 21 the deadline for submission of the financial re port for the approved grant is 30 november of the year for which the grant was approv ed if final reports cannot be provided by that date an interim report should be submitted by that date and the final report issued later than 15 february of the following year oios found that in 13 out of the 35 selected projects about 40 percent grants were provided without re cipients submission of audited financial statements contrary to the guidelines the revised draft guidelines dispensed with the interim report and set the deadline for the final r eport to 1 february of the year following the payment of the grant since grantees can spend the funds provided until 31 december of the year deadline of 1 february does not still seem to be realistic oios considers 31 march of the following year more realistic deadline for th submission of audited financial statements ohchr should not release further grant s if financial reports for previous grants are overdue recommendation head2right the unvfvt secretariat of ohchr should establish standardized format for the audited financial state ments on the use of the grant in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards and should not release further grants if financial reports for previous grants are overdue rec 02 22 ohchr agreed that standardized format for the aud ited financial statements on the use of grants should be adopted and requested oios to provide it with proposed format 6 ohchr also stated that grants have been released since 2003 where financial reports have not been received or if when received these ar not satisfactory regarding the format oios suggests that ohchr should consult with ohchr and unog financial resources management service and adopt the format oios would retain the recommendation for the review and adoption of the format 5 financial monitoring and evaluation 23 the core function of the secretariat is to foll owup on pending grants implement the recommendations of the board on the projects and in form the board of follow up action up to mid2003 there was systematic followup of t he projects followup and monitoring mechanisms were established later which further ne ed to be strengthened the spreadsheet that is currently used does not contain adequate gr ant data for monitoring and followup the secretariat has relied mainly on the financial repo rts and the audited financial statements provided by the grantees thus the secretariat can not independently ensure that the project has been implemented in full or in part whether th grant was spent fully or whether there was an unspent balance for example an amount of 50000 paid to project 199 remained unspent and the funds secretariat became aware of it only when the grantee approached the funds secretariat and requested guidance when the ngos independent auditors disagreed to include the grant as expenditure as it had not been spent the unspent money was eventually reimbursed to the fund ohchr clarified that the provision of audited finan cial statements allowing for identification of carryover from pr evious grant were not required at the time of this incident in the light of current procedure s this incident could not recur 24 according to the guidelines the members of the boa rd or the secretariat staff may visit project to better understand and evaluate t he work done by the grantee oios noted that the staff of the secretariat had undertaken vi sits to the projects and submitted reports in oios opinion the reports were not comprehensive nd did not include detailed evaluation of the projects in oios opinion the capacity of the staff of the funds secretariat needs improvement particularly in project and financial m onitoring and in the analysis of financial reports ohchr should provide adequate training and evaluation guidelines to the staff to make their field visit more worthwhile exercise oios recommended that adequate training and tools should be provided to the staff of the vfvt secretariat to enhance their capacity in project monitoring and evaluation and in the ana lysis of financial reports ohchr expected that in the course of 2005 more training nd tools would be provided recommendation head2right the unvfvt secretariat of ohchr should establish chanisms to ensure that the projects are adequately monitore d and that the funds are spent for the intended purposes rec 03 25 ohchr stated that the bulk of work undertaken by th secretariat constituted monitoring of the projects ohchr welcomed any conc rete suggestions on mechanisms that could be introduced to ensure that projects are ade quately monitored and evaluated oios wishes to point out that the implementation of the recommendations contained in its evaluation report would strengthen the fund managem ent oios would retain this recommendation for followup of the strengthening of the monitoring mechanisms 7 v further actions required on recommendations 26 oios monitors the implementation of its audit r ecommendations for reporting to the secretarygeneral and to the general assembly the responses received on the audit recommendations contained in the draft report have been recorded in our recommendations database in order to record full implementation t he actions described in the following table are required rec actiondocument required to close the reco mmendation 1 discussion and boards decision on the
