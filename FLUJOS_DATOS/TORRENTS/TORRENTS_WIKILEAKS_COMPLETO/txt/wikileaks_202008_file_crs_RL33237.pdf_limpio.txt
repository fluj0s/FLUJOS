unless permitted by an exception specified in the congressional rules of conduct in general members and staff may not accept gifts including travel and personal hospitality reimbursements or payments

from any one source gifts under 10 need not be counted some travel expenses provided by outside third parties may also be accepted under limited circumstances if the tr avel is officially connected2 travel by staff must be authorized in writing in advance by the supervising member lobbyists and foreign agents lobbyists and foreign agents fall into special category of prohibited sources of certain

registered lobbyist or foreign agent the prohibition also applies even if thes prohibited sources will be reimbursed by nonlobbyist client under the house and senate gift rules lobbyist is defined as one registered under the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 and foreign agent is defined as an agent of foreign principal registered under the foreign agents registration act according to interpretations of the rules by the senate select committee on ethics and the house committee on standards of offi cial conduct those required to file as lobbyists under the 1995 act include individual lobbyists as well as organizations that employ inhouse lobbyists and lobbying firm s with one or more employees who are lobbyists for outside clients3 an organization that employs lobbyists solely to represent its interests or its members interests is not itsel f considered lobbyist for purposes of the gift rules and can sponsor or reimburse for officially rela ted travel lobbying firm that provides services for others however is covered by the gift and travel restrictions thus while lobbyists and lobbying firms are cove red by the congressional gift and travel rules the clients or employers of the l obbyists or lobbying firms are not considered lobbyists unless they actually do lobbying current issues in spite of the restrictions on and disc losure requirements for congressional gift and travel

a1lobbyists to give members of congress gi fts trips or other things of value6 pew poll taken about the same time showe d however that most people around the country arent paying close attention to the corruption scandal involving the lobbyist7 even if the actions taken by member s and congressional st aff are legal under laws and internal rules the appearance f actor places them in the position of abiding by the rules in place but possibly engaging in behavior that gives the appearance of being in that gray area between what is as clean as hounds tooth and that which is obviously improper and illegal8 examples of action permitted under cong ressional rules but open to criticism because of the appearance factor incl ude 1 accepting any gifts from lobbyists even if these gifts are within the permissible limits established by congress 2 accepting officially connect ed travel reimbursements from lobbyists who do not fall within the definition of lobbyists for pur poses of the house and senate gift rules 3 traveling on corporate aircraft or othe r forms of transportation with registered lobbyists or foreign agents because there are restrictions on the traveling companions of members and staff and 4 the absence of guidelines or limits for reasonable expenses for travel and lodging and necessary expenses in connection with officially connected travel such as for speech or factfinding trip that is allowed under h ouse and senate rules9 for corporate aircraft travel members and staff must make some form of reimbursement the costs of such trips if not for officially connected travel is often covered by members campaign committee if the trip is for campaign event the payments however often do not cover the act ual costs defende rs of the practice point to the busy schedules of members and their need to quickly reach destinations that often are not served by commercial airlines10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33237crs4 11 this report highlights the key proposals in
