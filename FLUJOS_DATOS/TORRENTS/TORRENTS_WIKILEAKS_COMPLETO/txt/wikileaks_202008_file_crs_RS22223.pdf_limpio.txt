public displays of religious symbols such as the ten commandments are subject to review under the establishment clause of the first amendment the primary test used to evaluate these claims is known the lemon test under this test public displays 1 must have secular purpose 2 must have primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion and 3 must not lead to ex cessive entangleme nt with religion2 the supreme court first addr essed the cons titutiona lity of public displays of religious symbols in 1980 in stone v graham the court struck down kentucky statute requiring the posting of privately funded copy of the ten commandments on the wall of each public school classroom in the state3 the court determined that the statute had secular purpose and therefore failed the lemon test

applicati on of the ten commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal c ode of western civiliz ation and the common law of the united states4 the court however found that the preeminent purpose for posting the ten commandments on schoolroom walls was plainly religious and the display served educational function5 the court held that an avowed secular purpose is not sufficient to avoid c onflict with the first amendment6 in stone the source of the funding did not aff ect the constitutionality of the statute although the displays were funded by voluntar private contributions the court held that the mere posting of the copies under the ausp ices of the legislatur provides the official support of the state government that the establishment clause prohibits7 2005 supreme court decisions regarding public displays mccreary county v american civ il liberties union of kentucky8 in 1999 two counties in kentucky posted large displays of the ten commandments including citation to the book of exodus in their courthouses th displays were placed in public areas readily visible to those who used the courthouse9 soon after the displays were posted the aclu of kentucky sued the countie s in federal district court for an injunction against maintaining the displays alleging violation of the establishment clause while the court considered the reque sted injunction the counties expanded the display to show that the commandments were kentuckys precedent legal code and included eight other documents each having its own religious reference10 the counties stated several grounds for their position including declaration that the founding fathers had an explicit understandi ng of the duty of elected officials to publicly acknowledge god as the source of americas strength and direction11 although the district court ordered that the commandments be removed immediately and that nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22223crs3 12 american civil liberties ion of

display this final display in each court house included nine documents of similar size to each other and was titled the f oundations of american law and government display13 when the case came before the us supreme court the court emphasized the importance of neutrality in c onsidering issues under the establishment clause noting that the first amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion and between religi on and nonreligion14 the court explained th at the establishment clauses core value of neutrality is violated by government actions that have the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion15 the facts of mccreary raised questions of the releva nce of the purpose prong of the lemon test the court recognized that the purpose of government action though rarely dispositive serves an important function16 according to the court favorin g one religion or favoring religion generally contradicts the understanding t hat liberty and social stability demand religious tolerance that respects the religious views of all citizens17 the court also recognized that purpose is valid consideration when determining the constitutionality of statute citing numerous instances apart from establishment clause cases in which the court looked to the purpose of an ac tion when evaluating its constitutionality18 the court further explained that while governmental entitys stated purpose is generally given deference the lemon test requires that the secular purpose be genuine not sham and not merely sec ondary to religious objective19 the specific actions that the counties had taken in this case led the court to conclude that the counties acted with an unconstitutional purpose according to the court the first display lacked even stone s implausible disclaimer that the commandments were set out to show their effect on the civil law20 furthermore the court noted the county executives pastor testified to the certainty of the existence of god at the ceremony for posting the commandments which could reasonably lead observers to th ink that the counties were emphasizing the religious value of the display21 regarding the second display

court determined that the counties sought to highlight primarily religious texts and that their actions constitu ted an indisputable and undisputed showing of an impermissible purpose23 although the counties atte mpted to demonstrate valid secular purpose by creating third display allegedly intended to educate the public on significant documents in american legal hi story the court found that there was clear theme that overcame the apparent religious obj ectives the counties held in developing the displays24 as result according to the court reasonable observer would probably suspect that the counties were simply reachin g for way to keep religious document on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody religious neutrality25 van orden v perry 26 in 1961 monolith of the ten commandments was erected by the fraternal order of the eagl on the grounds of the texas state capitol the display was included among 17 monuments and 21 historical markers displayed in the 22 acres surrounding the texas state ca pitol commemorating the people ideals and events that compose texan identity27 the eagles paid the cost of erecting the monument the location of which was termined by the state based on the recommendation of the state organization re sponsible for maintaining the capitol grounds in 2001 thomas van orden freque nt visitor to the capitol grounds since 1995 sued state officials cla iming that the display violated the establishment clause in deciding van orden the court did not use the test set forth in lemon but rather analyzed the placement of the monument base d on the nature of the monument itself and the history of the nation28 the court cited numerous examples in which all three branches of government officially acknowledged the role of religion in american life and specifically noted that the court had recognized the role of god in american heritage in previous decisions29 for instance in marsh v chambers the court held that the establishment clause permits state legislature to open its daily session with prayer by chaplain paid by the state30 the court also noted cases in which the court upheld laws originating from one of the ten commandments eg mcgowan v maryland which upheld law prohibiting the sa of mercha ndise on sunday31 with respect to the specific display of the ten commandments the court found that acknowledgments of the role played by th ten commandments in our nations heritage are common throughout america and cited num erous government buildings where thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22223crs5 32 van orden 545 us

can be found32 despite the focus on the historical significance of the commandments the court acknowledged that they were at their inception and remain inherently religious however the court not ed that simply having religious content or promoting message consis tent with religious doctrin does not run afoul of the establishment clause33 although the courts holding mig ht appear to conflict with stone the court distinguished van orden from stone based on the difference be tween religious displays in classroom context and the more passive display of the commandments at issue on the grounds of the texas state capitol34 the court stated that while it had been particularly vigilant in establishment clause cases set in schools there was never any indication that stone s holding would extend to gislative chamber or to capitol grounds35 because the texas monument lacked the particular concerns raised by displays in school settings and because van orden walked past the monument for number of years before bringing the lawsuit the court determined that the van orden display was different from the texts that confronted elementary school students every day in stone 36 the court held that the monument in question had dual significance partaking of both religion and government nd therefore its inclusion among the monuments on the capitol grounds did not violate the establishment clause37 analysis the 2005 cases decided by the court cerning the public display of the ten commandments reached divergent conclusions regarding the displays and used different tests to reach those conclusions while the court did not use these cases to create bright line test for determining whether such displays violate the establishment clause the decisions can be reconciled by studying the specific facts presented in each case the displays at issue in mccreary were created and erected by county officials and placed in prominent locations at the counties main government buildings the counties actions in promoting and justifying the display were viewed by the court as having religious motivations and implicating g overnment endorsement of religious message on the other hand the display at issue in van orden was characterized by the court several times in its decision as passive and placed in location where reasonable observer likely would not infer government endorsement as it was placed among dozens of other monuments and markers the fact that the texas state legislature played role in creating or erecting the monument in the van orden case also alleviated the appearance of governmental endorsement of religious messagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22223crs6 38 lynch v donnelly 465 us 668 687 1984 oconnor j concurring 39 van orden 545 us at 685 40 id at 699 breyer j concurring 41 see

remains unclear from these decisions is the status of the lemon test in the courts establishment clause jurisprudence the majority opinion in mccreary relied on the test but applied modified version of the test that incorporates endorsement into the purpose and effects prongs of the original lemon test38 the court reached its decision in van orden without consensus in its reasoning but the plurality opinion did not use the lemon test noting other decisions where the court used the factors set forth in lemon as helpful signposts without relying on the threepart test for its analysis39 the divergent decisions were reached as result of split court and raise the question of what approach the court will take in future cases of such displays the views of justices stevens oconnor souter ginsburg and breyer were represented in the mccreary opinion that held the display unconstitutional and the views of chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia kennedy thomas and breyer were represented in van orden s decision that upheld the display as co nstitutional the appointments of chief justice roberts and justice alito may chan ge the outcome of future public display decisions future vacancies and replacements also have the potential to influence the understanding of the standard to be applied in future cases although these cases did not use c onsistent standard for analysis mccreary and van orden might not be as divergent from blishment clause jurisprudence as one might expect justice breyer who provided the deciding vote in th cases explained his understanding that the establishment clause requires the government to avoid excessive interference with or promoti on of religion but does not compel the government to purge from the public sphere all that in any way partakes of the religious40 this rationale echoed the courts previous holdings in ch allenges to public displays of religious symbols generally the cour t has upheld public displays of religious symbols where the display is set in diversified context41 mccreary and van orden appear to fit this analysis as the display upheld in van orden was set in historical secular context while the display struck down in mccreary indicated predominantly religious message in november 2008 the court is scheduled to hear the case of pleasant grove city utah v summum 42 which addresses first amendm ent issues regarding monuments displayed in public park summum has challenged the citys refusal to include monument of the seven aphorisms for display in public park that currently includes various monuments including the ten comma ndments the case appears to be brought before the court on free speech grounds rather than under the religion clauses however the courts treatment of the case may provide insight on the roberts courts approach to public displays of religious symbols
