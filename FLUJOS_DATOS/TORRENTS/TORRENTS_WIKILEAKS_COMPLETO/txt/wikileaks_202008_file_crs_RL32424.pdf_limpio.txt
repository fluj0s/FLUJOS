report provides background information on federal fa mily education loan ffel program consolidation loans nd discusses options for redesigning consolidation loans specifically it provides background information on the ffel program and on the role consolidation loans play within the program it also examines recent concerns voiced over the cost of consolidation loans and discusses the types of consolidation loan redesign op tions that are receiving some consideration within the context of the reauthorization of the higher education act hea in brief the report finds the following consolidation loans were initia lly introduced to simplify loan repayment and offer borrowers re lief in the form of extended repayment as the consolidation loan interest rate formula has been modified by congress consolidation loans have evolved into refinance benefit as well the current consolidation loan interest rate formula affords borrowers the opportunity to secure fixed rate equal to the weighted average of the rates in effect on underlying variable rate loans being consolidated rounded up to the nearest one eighth of 1 in the recent low interest rate environment consolidation volume has grown dramatically as borrowers have sought to lock in as permanent the favorable rates currently in effect on their variable loans this has enabled large number of borrowers to secure valuable refinance benefit borrowers who lock in fixed rate s through consolidation in other periods however can miss out on more advantageous variable rates that they would have had on underlyi ng loans this raises concerns with regard to those using consolidation for repayment relief who may need to consolidate in years in which the available fixed rate is high and thus disadvantageous it is generally acknowledged that recent cohorts of low fixed rate consolidation loans will be costly to the federal government this is because the government pays program lenders an interest subsidy designed to compensate lenders for the difference between the below market statutorily set rate charged to borrowers and fair market compensation on the loan the rate s being provided to borrowers on these consolidation loans over time are expected to be well below market rate to gauge with precision the added subsidy cost associated with theconsolidation refinan ce benefit it is necessary to look beyond the recent time period and assess compre hensively how the subsidy rates on cohorts of loans are affect ed by the refinance benefit the central questions underlying the debate on the desirability of the existing consolidation loan rate structure seem to be how favorable should the borrower interest rate be on federally subsidized refinance benefit is the current rate structure well suited to accomplish policy aimshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424contents background 1 r t i n l f r c n s l i d t i n l n s 2 concerns about the cost of consolidation loans 4 c n s i d r i n g t h

consolidation loans nd discusses options for redesigning consolidation loans it also discusses the aspects of two recent reports on the cost of consolidation loans that have garnered good deal of attention these reports like much of the recent discourse on consolidation loans are focused on the cost of providing fixed interest rate on consolidation loans while consolidation loans are also available through the william d ford direct loan dl program recent discussion of consolidation loans has largely centered on ffel program consolidation loans for this reason ffel consolidation loans will be the focus of this report this report is organized in the followi ng manner first it provides background information on the ffel program and on cons olidation loans then it discusses recent concerns voiced over the cost of consolidation loans next it examines two reports addressing this issue and the report concludes with brief discussion of consolidation loan redesign options and considerations the report discusses issues that are cu rrently being considered within the context of higher education act hea reauthorization activities it will not be updated1 background the federal family education loan program authorized by part b of title iv of the hea provides loans to undergraduate and graduate stude nts and the parents of undergraduate students to help them meet the costs of postsecondary education under the ffel program loan capital is pr ovided by private lende rs and the federal government guarantees lenders agains t loss through borrower default death permanent disability or in limited instances bankruptcy2 the federal government also provides lenders with loan subs idy known as special allowance paymenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs2 3 for comprehensive description of consolidation loans terms and conditions see crs report rl31575 consolidation loan provisions in the federal family education l oan and direct loan programs by adam stollsap the sap amount is determined on quarterly basis by statutory formula which is tied to financial index and ensures lenders receive at minimum specified level of interest income on loans the sap is designed to compensate lenders for the difference between the belowmarket statutorily set interest rate charged to borrowers and market set interest rate that is intended as fair market compensation on the loan asset the ffel program provides the following types of loans to students and their parents stafford loans subsidi zed and unsubsidized low interest variable rate loans available to undergraduate and graduate students the interest rates on subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans adjust annually based on statutorily established marketindexed rate setting formula and may not exceed 825 to qualify for subsidized stafford loan student must establish financial need the federal government pays the interest on the borrowers behalf on the subsidized stafford loans while in school on at least halftime basis and during grace periods and deferment periods plus loans variable rate loans available to parents of dependent undergraduate students the interest rates on these ans adjust annually based on statutorily established marketindexed ratesetting formula and may not exceed 9 consolidation loans loans that provide borrowers refinancing options consolidation loans enable borrowers to simplify the repayment of loans by combining multiple loans into one cons olidation loans also enable borrowers to lower monthly payments by extending the repayment period additionally consolidation loans afford borrowers th opportunity to pursue more favorable long tem interest rate through locking in fixed interest rate on their student loans based on the weighted average of the interest rates in effect on the loans being consolidated rounded up to the nearest oneeighth of 1 capped at 8253 rationale for cons olidation loans consolidation loans were introduced in the hea amendments of 1986 pl 99 498 they were initially introduced to simplify repayment for borrowers simplify loan repayment servicing for lenders and to offer relief in the form of extended re payment to those borrowers seeking lower monthly payments table 1 depicts the various interest rate formul as that have been used to set rates on consolidation loans as table 1 shows the consolida tion loan benefit has evolved into much more of refinance be nefit ie benefit that allows borrowers to refinance at better rate as the consolidation loan interest rate formula has been modified by congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs3 4 the grace period is sixmonth period immedi ately following students departure from school lower rate is provided during the grace period because loan servicing costs are lower during this period in which borrower payments are required grace period rates are 60 percentage points lower than repayment ratesunder the initial consolidation loan interest formula see table 1 the borrower rate was fixed at the weighted average of the loans being consolidated with minimum rate of 9 for student borrowers this meant the rate on consolidation loan would be equal to or higher than the rates on the loans being consolidated the second ffel consolidation loan rate setting formula offered borrowers the possibility of securing better rate th rough consolidation at the time this consolidation loan interest rate formula wa s in effect stafford rates were variable through consolidation borrower could lock in as permanent fa vorable annual rates in effect on their variable rate loans rounded up to the nearest whole percent furthermore toward the end of the period in which this formula was in effect stafford grace period interest rate was enacted and consolidation borrowers were afforded the opportunity to lock in as permanent their grace period rate which is lower than the repayment period rate4 the third consolidation loan interest formula was the same variable rate formula available on stafford loans the most recently enacted formula which is currently in effect offers borrowers the strongest opportunity to refinance at better rate throug h consolidation it enables borrowers to lock in as permanen t favorable annual rate s in effect on their variable rate loans rounded up to the near est oneeighth of 1 additionally it affords borrowers the opportunity to lock in as permanent their grace period ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs4 table 1 ffel consolidation loan interest rate formulas disbursement period type of rateffel

education act sections 427a 20 usc 1077a and 428c 20 usc 10783 concerns about the cost of consolidation loans the recent discourse on consolidation loans has centered on the desirability of preserving the existing fixed interest rate formula concerns about the cost of preserving the existing fixed rate benefit have surfaced in light of the prevailing rate s on variable rate stafford loans stafford loans which are the pr imary underlying loans incorporated into consolidation loans carry variable rate that adjusts annually and is determined by statutory ratesetting formula the borrower rate on stafford loans has been quite low in recent years consolidation loan s afford stafford borrowers refinance mechanism enabling them to lock in low rates permanently when borrowers exercise this option the federal government is potentially exposed to high subsidy costs because the government has guaranteed the lenders market rate of return and must make up the difference between the rate the borrower is paying and the rate the lender is guaranteed ie the sap as one might expect federal consolid ation loans have become increasingly popular in the recent low interest rate envi ronment most of the underlying loans being consolidated are variable rate staffo rd loans offering historically low annual rates which can be locked in permanently through consolidation as the shaded area in table

and is not yet completed table 4 displays the effect of the recent spike in consolidation volume on the composition of the outstanding portfolio of consolidation loans through the end of fy2003 it has led to growing concentrati on of consolidation loans with low fixed interest rates as table 4 reveals at the end of fy2003 more than 44 of outstanding consolidation loans had fixed inte rest rates of 5 or below it should be noted that much of the consolidati on volume projected for ay2003ay2004 see table 3 is not captured in the fy2003 data du to this and projections calling for low rates in ay2004ay2005 low in terest rate fixed loans are expected to constitute considerably larger share of the out standing portfolio in upcoming years that said it is also noteworthy that at present roughly one quarter of all outstanding consolidation ans have relatively high fi xed interest rates above 775 roughly 18 have fixed rates at or above 825 these loans are likely to be less costly to the government than they would have been had they retained their variable ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs7 this also introduces facet of the fixe d rate benefit some find troubling some borrowers fare worse under the high fixed rate they lock in than they would have had they retained their variable rate this raises concern particularly with regard to those using consolidation for repayment relief ie extended repayment because these borrowers may have to consolidate in years in which the fixed rate is disadvantageous table 4 end of fiscal year 2003 ffel lender held outstanding

consolidation loan rate ranges apply to fixed rate loanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs8 5 for the purposes of this memorandum the lender rate is the commercial paper based component of the sap calculation net of the payment lenders make back to the government on consolidation loans 6 10year repayment term has been chosen to allow for easy comparisons between interest subsidies on new consolidation loan as opposed to the underlying loans had they not been consolidated 7 projections of bond equivalent rates of 91day treasury bill rates and threemonth commercial paper rates from cbos mar 2004 baseline projections for student loan programs have been used to calculate borrower and lender rates for future yearsit is generally acknowledged that the r ecent cohorts of consolidation loans will be costly to the federal government this point is easily illustrated by examining the key determinant of the interest subsidy cost the spread between the lender rate5 and the borrower rate two scenarios presented in table 5 examine this relationship both of the scenarios presented in table 5 assume that borrower chooses to consolidate outstanding stafford loans all of which have been disbursed since july 1 1998 and repay the consolidation an over 10year repayment term6 under the first scenario examined in table 5 it is assumed the borrower consolidates loans in the current year while still in the grace pe riod and secures fixed interest rate of 288 on consolidation loan this is the mo st favorable rate scenario that has been available to borrowers who have borrowed since the current stafford rate setting formula has been in effect under the second scenario the borrower consolidates loans early in july 2000 securing fixed interest rate of 825 on consolidation loan this is the least favorable rate scenario that has been available since the current stafford rate setting formula has been in effect these two scenarios present boundaries within which most recent consolidations fall however as the data in tables 3 and 4 suggest recent consolidations have been much more likely to resemble the first scenario projected consolidation volume for that year is nearly four times as larg as the year in which the second scenarios consolidation occurred for each scenario spread between the lender rate and borrower rate on consolidation loans is provided for comparative purposes another spread between the lender rate and variable stafford borrower rate is provided the two spreads presented for each scenario illustra the potential additional cost associated with providing the fixed rate benefit in other words they allow for comparison of how the lender rate relates to lockedin fixed rate or variable stafford rate that the borrower could have chosen to retain for each of the examples the lender rates were constructed by using actual commercial paper cp rates where available for past periods if applicable and the congressional budget offices cbos projected cp rates for future periods the variable borrower rates were constructed by using actual loan interest rates where available for past periods and cbos projected tbill rates for future periods7 since the lender rates are being presented to illustrate the interest subsidy on consolidationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs9 8 the 159 addon reflects the actual 264 add on minus

78a source crs estimates note the estimated annualized lender rates and sap rates in table 5 are offered as approximations due to limitations in the data upon which these calculations are based they should not be viewed as precise projections lender rates have been constructed through the use of actual threemonth cp rates where applicable and cbo projections of cp rates for future periods for past periods the lender rate is based on an average of quarterly cp rates used in actual sap calculations plus an add on 1598 for consolidation loans and 234 for stafford loans for future years lender rates are constructed based upon cbos annual cp rate projections plus an add on to construct the estimated annualized sap rate the annual borrower rate is subtracted from the annual lender rate and then the differences with negative values treated as zeroes averaged across all relevant years b the variable rate borrower interest rates are presented in apr form apr is the estimated annual percentage rate paid under the variable rate formula the 288 consolidation loan in the first scenario illustrates the type of spread that has generated concern over the cost associated with the fixed interest benefit under this scenario the estimated rate fo r lenders is well above the borrower rate meaning the federal government has larg difference to make up as the estimated sap rate suggests under this scenario the government may end up paying more interest on the loan than the borrower does by looking at the relationship between the borrower lender rate spread on the fixed rate consolidation loan compared to the spread had the loan remained stafford loan one gets sense of the additional cost to the federal government associated with the fixed rate benefit the loan has been transformed from below market rate to ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs10 well below market rate for the borrower but has high subsidy cost for the federal government the second scenario illustrates situa tion in which the government may have sap related subsidy cost under consolidation loans the borrower is already paying more than the rate the government guarantees lenders when it calculates and pays saps so sap is necessary the am ount of income lenders receive above the government rate is often called floor income discussed more later additionally the estimated sap rate of zero on the fixed rate consolidation loan is less than the estimated sap rate applicable had the loan retained its stafford variable rate this illustrates the savings to the federal government as well as the relatively high costs to borrowers associated with the fixed rate benefit on loans refinanced at high fixed rate considering the debate on the fixed rate benefit contrasting conclusions have been reached in two recently released high profile reports on the cost of providing fixed intere st rate on consolidation loans in the text below an attempt is made to examine why the reports reach dissimilar conclusions the first such study is the net incremental cash flow and budget effects of the ffel consolidation loan program fy2005fy2010 by ernst and young this study examines the budgetary effects of ffel consolidation loans by studying historical cash flows in the ffel consolida tion loan program to and from the federal government within disc rete time period fiscal ears 19952002 and by estimating the net present value of future cash flows for certain cohorts of consolidation loans the study primarily profiles positive historical cash flows for the federal government on consolidation loans and projected positiv budgetary effects for future cohorts of consolidation loans it does however fi nd that two recent cohor ts of consolidation loans have substantial federal interest subsidy costs the ernst and young study suggests that in the recent historical time period examined consolidation loans have produced positive net cash flow for the federal government because the study does not ttempt to capture lifetime costs associated with the consolidation loans examined here these findings are of limited value given the influence rate fluctuations across time periods have on the cost of subsidizing loans there is reason to believe that chosen discrete time period will be reflective of costs over the life of an for this reason it is common to gauge the lifetime cost of credit and not to isolate particular time periods for analysis the ernst and young study presents estimate s of the budget effect of future cash flows of the recent large cohorts of conso lidation loans ie those made in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 in the period from fy2005fy2010 these consolidation loans are estimated to add 35 billion in fe deral interest subsidy cost in that time period these findings are adversely aff ected by the timing of the study the fy2004 cohort is much larger than was proj ected at the time and interest rates are lower than projected meaning the subs idy cost for these loans is likely underestimatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs11 9 testimony of dr thomas s newbig ernst and young for us congress house committee on education and the workforce fiscal responsibility and federal consolidation loans examining cost im plications for taxpayers students and borrowers 108th congress 2nd sess mar 17 2004 10 recent cbo analysis of its own for ecast record and that of omb and the blue chip consensus finds that the difference between two year forecasts and actual outcomes over the past 20 years was one percentage point or more for each entity it is reasonable to assume that longer term projecti ons would be less precisethe study presents projections of the net present value of lifetime costs of future cohorts of consolidation loans thos disbursed from fy2005fy2010 this part of the study focuses on the lifetime cost of consolidation loans over and above the interest subsidy on the underlying loans the ernst and young study projects these consolidations to have positive budgetary eff ect for the government the net present value of the incremental cash flow from these consolidation loans is projected to be 19 billion the long term projections assume 68 fixed borrower rate takes effect for new stafford loans as of july 2006 this is reasonable assumption based on existing statutory provisions but does not address the difference between fixed and variable rate it should be noted that several projections were updated by ernst and young for its march 17 2004 congre ssional testimony however insufficient details were available to enable the updated informati on to be considered here9 the second study is the fiscal and social costs of consolidating student loans at fixed interest rates by kevin hassett and robert shapiro this study examines the budgetary effects of ffel consolidati on loans by studying the projected lifetime costs of outstanding consolidation loans it concludes based upon series of modeling assumptions that the lifetime cost of subsidizing all outstanding consolidation loans may range from 14 billion to 48 billion it is important to note however that the study is focused on cons olidation loans total subsidy cost as opposed to the additive subsidy cost associated with the fixed rate benefit in other words underlying loans eg unsubsidized st afford loans already carry an interest subsidy the key question in the eyes of many observers though unanswered in this report is how much more expensive do they become when they are converted to fixed rate loans additionally the met hodology hasset and shapiro used for arriving at budgetary cost approaches the issue analytically at very high level of aggregation characteristics taken from across the entire portfolio of outstanding consolidation loans ie mean values for interest rates and repayment terms are used to model costs for the entire portfolio this approach lacks the precision that would be derived from assessing costs of each outstandi ng cohort of consolidation loans the hasset and shapiro cost projecti ons are also reliant upon their own forecasting of cp rates over the next 20 years all rate projections and especially long term rate projections contai n some real degree of imprecision10 each of these studies has limitations what would be needed to gauge added cost with more precision are analyses that comprehensively assess costs associated with providing the fixed rate refinan ce benefit across the varied cohorts ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs12 outstanding stafford loans the subsidy ra on stafford loans is affected by the available refinance benefit it would be helpful to examine the way in which these subsidy rates are affected by fixed rate andor alternative refinance benefits underlying issues and redesign considerations several issues under lie the debate on consolida tion loan interest rates however the debate seems to be centr ally focused on the following issues how favorable should the borrower interest rate be on federally subsidized refinance benefit is it desirable to offer the current fixed rate option on consolidation loans those in favor of the existing fixed rate setting formula assert that in the current low interest rate environment the fixe d rate amounts to valuable benefit to borrowers at time of escalating student loan debt it provides important repayment relief and sends signal to students and potential students that repayment will be manageable further proponents of the existing rate setting formula suggest that eliminating the opportunity to lock in fi xed rate would be tantamount to taking away benefit that was available when bo rrowers received their stafford loans and that they are counting on utilizing once they enter repayment the removal of this benefit in todays in terest environment would amount to dropping roughly half the interest subsidy currently available to borrowers proponents of offering fixed rate on consolidation loans suggest it provides borrowers with level of certainty bout their repayment amount which is not available through the variable rate they also suggest it is optimal to allow borrowers choice between fixe d and variable rate options those opposed to sustaining the existin g rate setting formula suggest it offers an overly generous borrower benefit that is costly to the point of placing future aid in jeopardy further they question whether benefit received in the years after postsecondary schooling contributes in an way to students postsecondary access persistence or choice they note the repayment period subsidy is provided without regard to need over lengthy period pot entially extending up to 30 years beyond schooling and disproportionate ly benefits students who attended fouryear private institutions andor graduate programs opponents of offering fixed rate opti on suggest such an option is inherently flawed if it bears relationship to loan financing or subsidy costs and argue it results in cost to either the federal government or the borrower if the borrower locks in low fixed rate federal subsidy costs escalate if the borrower locks in high fixed rate the borrower pays an above market rate over the life of the loan further they suggest the variable rate form ula with cap provides borrowers with protection from exceedingly high rates and reduces risk for the borrower and the governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs13 11 this discussion on this option and subsequent options assumes that stafford loan interest rates are variableconsolidation loan design options and considerations this report concludes with brief discussion on consolidation loan design options and considerations as backdr op to this discussion it is important to consider the structure of existing subsidies in the text that follows several options for setting the rate on consolidation loans are considered the discussion is limited to some of the major options having received attention in the recent debate in general the policy discourse has been centered on the desirability of offering fixed versus variable rate on consolidation loans crs of course ta kes position on any option presented the interest subsidies supporting stafford borrowers can be divided into three categories 1 the needbased interest be nefit on subsidized stafford loans through which the government pays the borrowers interest during periods in school grace or deferment 2 the sap on all stafford loans which guarantees borrower rate based upon statutory rate settin g formula with an interest cap designed to be below market rate and 3 the sap on consolidation loans which offers the borrower an opportunity to lock in an even better rate it is this last category of subsidy that is under debate possible options include preserve the existing rate structure11 under this approach the additional interest subsidy would remain available to borrowers who consolidate in low interest rate environment borrowers who consolidate in high interest rate environment eg those who are consolid ating due to need to extend their repayment period in order to reduce mont hly payments would likely pay higher rate on their consolidation loan than they would have on stafford loan concerns about added federal subsidy co sts associated with future high volume consolidation periods when interest rates ar low would not be alleviated eliminate the fixed interest rate benefit on cons olidation loans under this approach borrowers would retain their stafford interest rate and receive additional interest subsidy when they consolidate consolidation would cease to offer an additional interest benefit but would retain its role in simplifying repayment and providing extended repayment cerns about added fe deral subsidy costs associated with consolidation would be lleviated and federal subsidy costs may be reduced but borrowers would lose potential benefit they now enjoy offer refinance benefit that is income sensitive under this conceptual approach borrowers could still be offered more generous interest subsidy on refinanced loan but the additi onal interest subsidy would be offered on selective basis contingent upon need depending on how such benefit were structured it could reduce federal subsidy costs by conferring subsidies on fewer recipients over shorter intervals it coul d also bestow heavier subsidies than arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32424crs14 currently available during periods of need which could reduce or eliminate savings in subsidy costs offer fixed rate set by the market under this approach borrowers could choose to retain their stafford vari able interest rate and would receive additional interest subsidy when they consolidate for borrowers making this choice consolidation would offer dditional interest benefit but would retain its role in providing relief in the form of extended re payment alternatively those borrowers seeking certain monthly payment could choos to select fixed rate set by lenders presumably on loan that would cease to carry sap under this scenario the fixed rate would likely cost the borrower more which would be reflective of the loans higher finance costs but the fi xed and variable rate options would be available this would provide borrowers fixed and variable ra options and may be cost neutral to the federal government offset consolidation costs by capturing floor income under most of the approaches discussed above federal intere st subsidies could be reduced by having lenders floor income on conso lidation loans refunde d to the federal government the floor income is income lenders earn in quarters when the borrower rate is above the sap rate which is designed to approximate fair market interest income for lenders offset consolidation costs by increasing lender fees it may be possible to reduce federal subsidy costs associated with any of the rate structures proposed above by increasing lender fees on consolidation loans if lender fees can be increased without jeopardizing lender participation in th consolidation loan program this is another option
