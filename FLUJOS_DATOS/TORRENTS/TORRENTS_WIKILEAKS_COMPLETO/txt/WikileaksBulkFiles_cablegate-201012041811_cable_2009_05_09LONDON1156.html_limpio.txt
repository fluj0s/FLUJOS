archipelago british indian ocean territory ref 08 london 2667 notal classified by political counselor richard mills for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf summary hmg would like to establish marine park or reserve providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the british indian ocean territory biot senior foreign and commonwealth office fco official informed polcouns on may 12 the official insisted that the establishment of marine park the worlds largest would in way impinge on usg use of the biot including diego garcia for military purposes he agreed that the uk and us should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that us interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of biot was upheld he said that the biots former inhabitants would find it difficult if not impossible to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire chagos archipelago were marine reserve end summary protecting the biots waters 2 cnf senior hmg officials support the establishment of marine park or reserve in the british indian ocean territory biot which includes diego garcia colin roberts the foreign and commonwealth offices fco director overseas territories told the political counselor may 12 noting that the uninhabited islands of the chagos archipelago are already protected under british law from development or other environmental harm but that current british law does not provide protected status for either reefs or waters roberts affirmed that the bruited proposal would only concern the exclusive zone around the islands the resulting protected area would constitute the largest marine reserve in the world 3 cnf roberts iterated strong uk political support for marine park ministers like the idea he said he stressed that hmgs timeline for establishing the park was before the next general elections which under british law must occur later than may 2010 he suggested that the exact terms of the proposals could be defined and presented at the usuk annual politicalmilitary consultations held in late summerearly fall 2009 exact date tbd if the usg would like to discuss the issue prior to those talks hmg would be open for discussion through other channels in any case the fco would keep embassy london informed of development of the idea and next steps the uk would like to move forward discussion with key international stakeholders by the end of 2009 he said that hmg had noted the success of us marine sanctuaries in hawaii and the marianas trench note roberts was referring to the papahanaumokuakea marine national monument and marianas trench marine national monument end note he asserted that the pew charitable trust which has proposed biot marine reserve is funding public relations campaign in support of the idea he noted that the trust had backed the hawaiian reserve and is wellregarded within british governmental circles and the larger british environmental community three sine qua nons us assent 4 cnf according to roberts three preconditions must be met before hmg could establish park first we need to make sure the us government is comfortable with the idea we would need to present this proposal very clearly to the american administrationall we do should enhance base security or leave it unchanged polcouns expressed appreciation for this priori commitment but stressed that the 1966 usuk exchange of notes concerning the biot would in any event require us assent to any significant change of the biots status that could impact the biots strategic use roberts stressed that the proposal would have impact on how diego garcia is administered as base in response to request for clarification on this point from polcouns roberts asserted that the proposal would have absolutely impact on the right of us or british military vessels to use the biot for passage anchorage prepositioning or other uses polcouns rejoined that designating the biot as marine park could years down the road create public questioning about the suitability of the biot for military purposes roberts responded that the terms of reference for the establishment of marine park would clearly state that the biot including diego garcia was reserved for military uses 5 cnf ashley smith the ministry of defenses mod international policy and planning assistant head asia pacific who also participated in the meeting affirmed that the mod shares the same concerns as the us regarding security and would ensure that security concerns were fully and properly addressed in any proposal for marine park roberts agreed stating that the primary purpose of the biot is security but that hmg could also address environmental concerns in its administration of the biot smith added that the establishment of marine reserve had the potential to be winwin situation in terms of establishing situational awareness of the biot he stressed that hmg sought constraints on military operations as result of the establishment of marine park mauritian assent 6 cnf roberts outlined two other prerequisites for establishment of marine park hmg would seek assent from the government of mauritius which disputes sovereignty over the chagos archipelago in order to avoid the gom raising complaints with the he asserted that the gom had expressed little interest in protecting the archipelagos sensitive environment and was primarily interested in the archipelagos economic potential as fishery roberts noted that in january 2009 hmg held the firstever formal talks with mauritius regarding the biot the talks included the mauritian prime minister roberts said that he cast fly in the talks over how we could improve stewardship of the territory but the mauritian participants were not focused on environmental issues and expressed interest only in fishery control he said that one mauritian participant in the talks complained that the indian ocean is the only ocean in the world where the fish die of old age in hmgs view the marine park concept aims to go beyond economic value and consider biodiversity and intangible values chagossian assent 7 cnf roberts acknowledged that we need to find way to get through the various chagossian lobbies he admitted that hmg is under pressure from the chagossians and their advocates to permit resettlement of the outer islands of the biot he noted without providing details that there are proposals for marine park that could provide the chagossians warden jobs within the biot however roberts stated that according to the hgms current thinking on reserve there would be human footprints or man fridays on the biots uninhabited islands he asserted that establishing marine park would in effect put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelagos former residents responding to polcouns observation that the advocates of chagossian resettlement continue to vigorously press their case roberts opined that the uks environmental lobby is far more powerful than the chagossians advocates note one group of chagossian litigants is appealing to the european court of human rights echr the decision of britains highest court to deny resettlement rights to the islands former inhabitants see below at paragraph 13 and reftel end note je ne regrette rien 8 cnf roberts observed that biot has served its role very well advancing shared usuk strategic security objectives for the past several decades the biot has had great role in assuring the security of the uk and us much more than anyone foresaw in the 1960s roberts emphasized we do not regret the removal of the population since removal was necessary for the biot to fulfill its strategic purpose he said removal of the population is the reason that the biots uninhabited islands and the surrounding waters are in pristine condition roberts added that diego garcias excellent condition reflects the responsible stewardship of the us and uk forces using it administering reserve 9 cnf roberts acknowledged that numerous technical questions needed to be resolved regarding the establishment and administration of marine park although he described the governmental act of declaring marine park as relatively straightforward and rapid process he noted that the establishment of marine reserve would require permitting scientists to visit biot but that creating park would help restrict access for nonscientific purposes for example he continued the rules governing the park could strictly limit access to biot by yachts which roberts referred to as sea gypsies biot more than just diego garcia 10 cnf following the meeting with roberts joanne yeadon head of the fcos overseas territories directorates biot and pitcairn section who also attended the meeting with polcouns told poloff that the marine park proposal would not impact the base on diego garcia in any way and would have impact on the parameters of the usuk 1966 exchange of notes since the marine park would have impact on defense purposes yeadon averred that the provision of the convention on the law of the sea guaranteed free passage of vessels including military vessels and that the presence of marine park would not diminish that right 11 cnf yeadon stressed that the exchange of notes governed more than just the atoll of diego garcia but expressly provided that all of the biot was set aside for defense purposes note this is correct end note she urged embassy officers in discussions with advocates for the chagossians including with members of the all party parliamentary group on chagos islands appg to affirm that the usg requires the entire biot for defense purposes making this point would be the best rejoinder to the chagossians assertion that partial settlement of the outer islands of the chagos archipelago would have impact on the use of diego garcia she described that assertion as essentially irrelevant if the entire biot needed to be uninhabited for defense purposes 12 cnf yeadon dismissed the appg as persistent but relatively noninfluential group within parliament or with the wider public she said the fco had received only handful of public inquiries regarding the status of the biot yeadon described one of the chagossians most outspoken advocates former hmg high commissioner to mauritius david snoxell as entirely lacking in influence within the fco she also asserted that the conservatives if in power after the next general election would not support chagossian right of return she averred that many members of the liberal democrats britains third largest party after labour and the conservatives supported right of return 13 cnf yeadon told poloff may 12 and in several prior meetings that the fco will vigorously contest the chagossians right of return lawsuit before the european court of human rights echr hmg will argue that the echr lacks jurisdiction over the biot in the present case roberts stressed may 12 as has yeadon on previous occasions that the outer islands are essentially uninhabitable and could only be rendered livable by modern western standards with massive infusion of cash comment 14 cnf regardless of the outcome of the echr case however the chagossians and their advocates including the all party parliamentary group on chagos islands appg will continue to press their case in the court of public opinion their strategy is to publicize what they characterize as the plight of the socalled chagossian diaspora thereby galvanizing public opinion and in their best case scenario causing the government to change course and allow right of return they would point to the governments recent retreat on the issue of gurkha veterans right to settle in the uk as model despite fco assurances that the marine park concept still in an early conceptual phase would not impinge on biots value as strategic resource we are concerned that longterm both the british public and policy makers would come to see the existence of marine reserve as inherently inconsistent with the military use of diego garcia and the entire biot in any event the us and uk would need to carefully negotiate the parameters of such marine park point on which roberts unequivocally agreed in embassy londons view these negotiations should occur among us and uk experts separate from the 2009 annual politicalmilitary consultations given the specific and technical legal and environmental issues that would be subject to discussion 15 cnf comment continued we do not doubt the current governments resolve to prevent the resettlement of the islands former inhabitants although as fco parliamentary undersecretary gillian merron noted in an april parliamentary debate fco will continue to organize and fund visits to the territory by the chagossians we are not as sanguine as the fcos yeadon however that the conservatives would oppose right of return indeed mp keith simpson the conservatives shadow minister foreign affairs stated in the same april parliamentary debate in which merron spoke that hmg should take into account what i suspect is the allparty view that the rights of the chagossian people should be recognized and that there should at the very least be timetable for the return of those people at least to the outer islands if not the inner islands establishing marine reserve might indeed as the fcos roberts stated be the most effective longterm way to prevent any of the chagos islands former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the biot end comment visit londons classified website
