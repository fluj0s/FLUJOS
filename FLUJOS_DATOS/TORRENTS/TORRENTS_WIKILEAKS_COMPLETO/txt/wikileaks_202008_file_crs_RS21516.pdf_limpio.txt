resources science and industry division summary iraqs agricultural sector represents sm all but vital component of iraqs economy over the past several decades agriculture s role in the economy has been heavily influenced by iraqs involvement in military conflicts particular ly the 198088 iraniraq war and the 1991 gulf war and by varying grees of government efforts to promote andor control agricultural production in the mid1980s agriculture accounted for only about 14 percent of the nati onal gdp after the imposition of sanctions and the iraqi governments noncompliance with proposed oilforfood program in 1991 agricultures share of gdp is estimate d to have risen to 35 percent by 19921 rapid population growth during the past three decades coupled with limited arable land and general stagnation in agricu ltural productivity has steadily increased dependence on imports to meet domestic f ood needs since the mid1960s by 1980 iraq was importing about half of its food supply by 2002 between 80 and 100 percent of many basic staples wheat rice sugar vege table oil and protein meals were imported this report will be update d if events warrant agroclimatic setting iraq has total surface area of 437 million hectares about the size of wyoming and south dakota combined of which 340 million 777 percent is not viable for agricultural use under curre nt conditions less than 04 percent is in forest and woodlands situated along the ex treme northern border with turkey and iran2 the remaining 22 percent about 95 million h ectares is involved in agricultural activities

hectares5 between 75 and 85 percent of crop area is generally planted to grai ns mostly wheat and barley iraq is divided into predominantly ra infed northern winter grain producing zone and centersouth irrigated zone that produces vegetables and fruit as well as cereal crops about onethird of iraqs cereal production is produced under rainfed conditions in the foothills of the northwest in iraqikurdistan winter wheat and barley are planted in the fall septembernovember and harvested in the late spring mayjune yields on the rainfed crops are generally poor and often vary signif icantly with rainfall amounts the remaining twothirds of iraqs cereal pr oduction occurs within the irrigated zone that runs along and between the tigris and euphrates rivers very little rain falls in the centersouth zone of iraq and agricultural in this region is dependent on irri gation according to the united nations food and agriculture organization fao 255 million hect ares were irrigated in 19896 throughout history the irrigated agriculture of iraqs centersouth region has been menaced by salinization the water table of southern iraq is saline and so near the surface that it only takes bit of injudicious overirrigation to bring it up to r oot level and destroy the crop irrigated crop production includes winter wheat and barley as well as summer crops such as rice corn cotton vegetables and fruit for the most part single crop is planted per year although there is some multiple cropping of vegeta bles where irrigation water is available irrigated summer crops are generally planted during aprilmay and rvested in august september although this may vary by crop livestock grazing occurs throughout both ag ricultural zones but is more widespread in the north where hillside grazing prevails small ruminants sheep and goats are the most prevalent livestock species however beef from cattle has been the traditional source of dietary protein for most iraqis poultry production

fledgling feedlot industry in addition marketing re gulations were relaxe d and the government raised prices for virtually all commoditie s in the early 1980s in order to stimulate production and to

compre hensive sanctions on iraq following that countrys shortlived invasion of kuwait14 under sanctions the importation of agricultural products was not banned however foreign companies were prohibited from investing directly in iraq15 in addition the iraqi governments unwillingness to participate in the u ns 1991 oilfo rfood off plan cut off government oil export revenues needed to purchase foodstuffs nd agricultural inputs on the international market from 1990 to 1994 iraqs agricultural imports averaged slightly above 1 billion or less than half of the prewar level usdas export

anecdotal evidence suggests that the 1991 gu lf war resulted in significant damage to the irrigation and transportation infrastructure vital to iraqs agricultural sector but it is difficult to evaluate the extent or seve rity of the damage agricultural productivity suffered for lack of fertilizers agricultural machinery and the means of spraying planted areas with pesticides salinity has spread acro ss much of the irrigated fields of central and southern iraq as the government ended its maintenance of the irrigation system once severe salinization has occurred in soil the rehabilitation process may take several years according to fao officials16 in addition rural areas were left with severe labor shortage further hurting agricultural productivity according to the u s census bureau in 1991 iraq experienced 37 percent decline in population as an timated 663000 persons died or left the country following the first gulf war17 much of this exodus included foreign guest workers from the agricultural sector httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21516crs5 18 faostat fao 19 undp iraq country office 19992000 report june 2000iraqs poultry and livestock populations were devastated by the loss of rangeland to grain crops and the drop off of feed grain im ports and veterinary medicines needed for routine control of parasites and diseases poultry invent ories dropped from an estimated 105 million birds in 1989 to only 36 million in 199118 the 1991 liquidation of the poultry inventory represented major setback for poultry consumption dropping the daily calorie per capita from poultry from over 55 in the 1989 to less than 4 in 1991 according to fao data similarly iraqs cattle popul ation saw its number decline by nearly 37 percent between 1989 and 1991 1997 screw worm epidemic and 1998 outbreak of footandmouth disease resulted in further losses of animals under the terms of iraqs 1991 military defeat the country was effectively partitioned into two distinct entitiesthr ee northern governorates erbil dohuk and sulaimaniyah and fifteen governorates located in central and southern iraq this division corresponds roughly to the rainfed northern agricultural zone and the irrigated center south zone the central government took several steps to increase both production and control of domestic food within its zone of control these changes included government monopoly control over most grain production and the introduction of statemanaged system of rationing of basic foodstuffs the government raised the official purchase price of major field crops and initiated program to expand planted area particularly for cereal crops in northern iraq cereal farmers were ordered to deliver their output to state collection centers within two weeks of harvesting the government also t ook emergency steps to confiscate land from farmers who failed to fulfill production quotas finally the government introduced the death penalty for hoarding of cereals government incentives coupled with rising internal food prices encouraged iraqi farmers to expand crop area by planting on marginal pastureland and fragile hillsides record cropped area was attained in 1992 nd again in 1993 however agricultural productivity suffered for lack of fertilizers agricultural machinery and the means of spraying planted areas with pesticides iraqs irrigation infrastructure fell into disrepair and salinity spread across much of the irriga ted fields of central and southern iraq by the mid1990s severe macroeconomic problems related to the international sanctions led the government to end most support to the s ector and instead to implement austerity measures that further curtailed agricultural investment declining food availability resulted in significant rise in malnutrition in iraq particularly in the center and south of the country19 by 1996 iraq agreed to terms for establishing an oilforfood off program once started however off food imports made iraqs trade dependence nearly complete for many basic foodstuffs according to th world food program by early 2003 nearly 60 percent of iraqs population was totally dependent on imports via the off nutritional programs administe red through unicef and wfp ve played key role in sustaining vulnerable segments of the iraq i population particularly infants and pregnant or lactating women the iraqi

kilograms this fell to 177 in the 1970s and 130 in the 1980s but had regained ground to 155 kilograms during the 199094 perioddependence was further aggravated by seve re drought that persisted throughout much of the middle east from 1999 through 2001 nd devastated crop output in iraq cereal production in iraqs raindependent northern zone was par ticularly hard hit but even the irrigated production of the centersouth region suffered from diminished water availability down to 43 percent of normal levels as result of the drought iraqs annual cereal production per cap ita plummeted from its ready low 1999level of 77 kilograms to only 39 by 200020 shortage of fodder resulted in forced slaughter of sheep and compounded the impact of footandmout h disease outbreak that had started in 1998 an estimated one million head of livestock died due to lack of medicines outlook in the early stages of the post2003 iraq war period the countrys agricultural sector remains beset by the gacy of past mismanagement inaccessibility of farm machinery fertilizer s and pesticides and the lin gering effects of the 19992001 drought iraqs irrigation in frastructure is only partially functional salinization of prime cropland is widespread throughout the irriga tion system and the fe rtility of cropland and rangeland has been badly depleted from ove r exploitation due to poor soil management practices such as continuous cropping rather than the normal cerealfallow rotation the poultry and livestock sectors have been devast ated by general lack of feedstuffs and pasture as well as from lack of veterinary medicines used to c ontrol common parasites and diseases some progress has been made toward restoring lost agricultural productivity however return to normal weather pattern s is critical for domestic cereal production in iraq political stability improved internal security and an end to international sanctions will also likely be needed before iraqs agricultural sector witnesses significant investment and growth restor ation of the irrigation infrastru cture including longterm desalinization program as well as the grain marketing infrastructure for handling storing and distributing agricultural inputs and outputs will be vital in addition the development of viable agricultural resear ch and extension service to develop and disseminate improved varieties and successful production practi ces are needed to restore agricultural productivity clearly iraq will be depe ndent on imports for fully meeting domestic food demand for several years to come in the long rm after the economy has regained its viability and vibrancy market forces and international competition will likely be the driving forces behind iraqs agricultural trade patterns ir aqs historical trade and food consumption patterns suggest that food grains such as wheat and rice feedstuffs including corn barley and protein meals vegetable oil sugar meat and dairy products are all likely to be important imports into iraq
