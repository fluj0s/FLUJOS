this report provides an analysis of st ate and federal laws regarding diploma mills which offer students academic degrees for little or meaningful academic work specifically this report addresses the

degrees that purport to be from existing accredited univers ities but rather focuses primarily on the legal issues surrounding phony degrees from entities that provide diplomas without requiring an appropr iate level of acad emic achievement although formal legal definition exis ts diploma mill is generally regarded as an entity that lacks accreditation fro m state or professional accreditation organization but that nonetheless sells college and graduate degrees that are fraudulent or worthless because of the lack of standards imposed on the purchasers of such degrees while experts estimate th at diploma mills have existed for hundreds of years1 such entities have proliferated in r ecent decades due to lax law enforcement and technological advances such as the rise of the internet by some estimates there are several hundred diploma mills operating at any given time2 with revenue in excess of 500 million per year3 because many diploma mills use the inte rnet to operate their phony institutions of higher education it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between purveyors of phony degrees and legitimate online institu tions that operate traditional distance learning degree programs this difficulty is one reason that federal and state policy makers have trouble drafting laws that can be used to shut down phony institutions nevertheless most diploma mills display some or all of the following hallmarks of fraudulent operation 1 th ey are accredited or th ey claim to be accredited but the organization that they cite is not one of the legitimate accrediting agencies recognized by the council on higher educ ation accreditation or the united states department of education ed 2 they do not require previous academic records such as grade point average or test scores for admission 3 they charge tuition based on the number of degrees purchased rather than the number of credit hours orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32144crs2 4better business bureau is the internet

professors often have degrees from unaccredited universities and have little or contact with students 7 they are located in foreign country or have addr esses that are post office box numbers and 8 they have names that are strikingly similar to legitimate accredited universities4 diploma mills pose dangers to consumers and employers as well as the general public and to legitimate ins titutions of higher educati on although some individuals who obtain degrees from diploma mills are ac tive conspirators in fraud others are innocent victims of financial scams in which they pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for worthless degrees if the fraudulent credentials are discovered such individuals may lose their jobs or face civil or criminal charges regardless of whether such individuals have fraudulent in tent employers who hire individuals with fake degrees may at best have inadequately trained em ployees and at worst expose themselves to liability for the mistakes of such employees finally diploma mills may harm members of the general public who receive professional services from individuals with fake academic credentials and they may damage the reputation of legitimate degreegranting institutions5 despite the potential harm caused by diploma mills state and federal efforts to shut down these entities have been somewhat erratic over the years depending in part on the jurisdiction and enforcement prior ities involved for example enforcement has been weak at times for reasons that range from the difficulty in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate institutions to the ability of diploma mills to move jurisdictions quickly if authorities in one state begin an aggressive enforcement campaign further complicating matters is the fact that every state has its own diploma mill laws which vary in strength and effectiveness meanwhile the federal government pursues enforcement actions against diploma mills under separate set of laws these federal and state laws regarding diploma mills are discussed in detail below ii federal oversight of diploma mills in general the regulation of education in the united states is state responsibility nevertheless the federal government plays role in education oversight and diploma mills are ex ception although federal law does not explicitly prohibit diploma mills the sale of fraudulent academic credentials is punishable under several fede ral statutes relating to mail fraud wire fraud and conspiracy and at least fi ve different governmental agencies have some direct involvement in or

and waned for example the fbi and the po stal inspection service have periodically engaged in collaborative criminal investigations of diploma mills indeed these investigations were particularly active from the 1970s to the early 1990s when the fbi spearheaded the dipscam operation short for diploma scam dipscam consisted of an fbi task force whose successful investigations of diploma mills led to multiple arrests and convi ctions under federal antifraud statutes and to decline in phony institutions ultimately the dipscam task force disbanded shortly after the retirement of its top diploma mill expe rt and phony institutions have made comeback in the years since14 investigations and prosecutions of diploma mills also appear to have declined in recent years as federal agencies have focused enforcement efforts on other priorities for example since the events of septem ber 11 2001 combating terrorism has been the fbis top priority while the postal inspection service has aggressively targeted the issue of identity theft in recent years the ftc is another federal agency with some regulatory authority over diploma mills under the federal trade commission act the ftc is authorized to enforce consumer protection laws that prohi bit fraud deception and unfair business practices15 as defined by the statute unlawful deceptive trade practices include false and misleading advertising16 with respect to vocational and distance learning schools the ftc has interpreted the ba n on false and misleading advertising to prohibit such schools from using deceptive tr ade or business names misrepresenting the extent or nature of accreditation or approval or issuing deceptive diplomas degrees or certificates17 specifically ftc guidance notes that it is deceptive for an industry member to issue degree diploma certificate of completion or any similar document that misrepresents directly or indirectly the subject matter substanc or content of the course of study or any other material fact concerning the course for which it was awarded or the accomplishments of the student to whom it was awarded b it is deceptive for an industry memb er to offer or confer an academic

authority the ftc does not appear to have pursued many enforcement actions against diploma mills22 ed is another agency with some invol vement in the issue of diploma mills although ed is responsible for overseeing fe deral education efforts the agency does not have any statutory authority to accr edit colleges and unive rsities rather for purposes of identifying institutions that are eligible to receive federal student financial aid the higher education ac t hea authorizes ed to recognize independent accrediting agencies that m eet certain criteria these accrediting agencies in turn verify the legitimacy of institutions of higher education23 because eds regulatory authority is limited to overs eeing entities that receive federal funding under statutes that provide federal financial assistance for education activities the agency has oversight or regulatory authority over institutions that do not participate in the programs included in the hea thus we have independent authority or ability to determine if such school is diploma mill24 furthermore although ed recognizes legitimate accreditin g agencies some diploma mills falsely claim that they are accredited but the accr editing agency that they cite is not recognized by ed or by the council for higher education accreditation which is private organization that also recognizes accrediting agencies ed however does not have the

for greater coordination in the future29 in its capacity to issue visas that allow entry into the us the us citizenship and immigration services uscis of dhs also confronts the problem of diploma mills for example in order to receive st udent visa students must be enrolled in federally approved academic ins titution30 likewise some types of employment visas require baccalaureate or advanced

or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both49 since issues related to personnel or em ployment practices may be considered to be matters that fall within the jurisdiction of the various branches of government federal employee who knowingly and inte ntionally uses phony degree to secure federal employment or advancement could potentially be criminally liable it is important to note however that this statute requires evidence of specific intent to defraud which is often difficult to estab lish in addition because of the intent requirement this law would not apply to fe deral employees who believing that their degrees are legitimate innocently claim educational achieveme nt based on degrees from diploma mills likewise an employee who knowingly and intentionally secures agency funding to pay for his or her fraudulent degree may violate federal criminal laws indeed any individual who knowingly and with inte nt to defraud the united states or any agency thereof possesses any false ltered forged or c

certain educational criteria65 the law also prohibits institutions from awarding degrees solely on the basis of payment of tuition or other suspect criteria or from fa lsely claiming accreditation66 violations of the statute are punishable as misdemeanor by fine of up to 1000 or up to six months in prison or both67 despite these prohibitions and penalties wyoming reportedly does not vigorously enforce its higher education licensing laws68 ultimately it appears that the majority of states has laws that specifically target diploma mills69 in addition most states have laws of more general applicability such as statutes pertaining to civil actions for fraud and misrepresentation and criminal prosecutions for forgery embezzlement theft of services or false pretenses or impersonation70 that they can use to shut dow n diploma mills should they choose to do so enforcement of such laws however appears to vary from state to state with relatively few reported cases involving the criminal prosecution of persons who have made or used fraudul ent academic credentials71 in part successful prosecutions may be rare since it is difficu lt to determine jurisdiction if diploma mill operates in several states at once and since such institutions may relocate quickly and easily if the state in which they reside cracks down thus the popularity of given state as haven for diploma mills often changes over time as one commentator concludes in the end sound legislation at the state vel is the first line of defense against unscrupulous diploma mill operators but legi slation by itself is insufficient wellequipped enforcement agency and public mood that will support its efforts are also needed72httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32144crs14 73restatement second of torts 52526 537 1977 74id at 552

prosecution under state nd federal legislati on diploma mills may potentially be subject to common law tort action for negligent misrepresentation or fraud under lawsuit for fraud an indi vidual who was injured as result of receiving phony degree from diploma mill c ould sue for damages if 1 the owner or operator of the diploma mill knowingly ma false representations regarding the quality of the degree and 2 the individual relied on those statements to his or her pecuniary detriment73 suit for negligent misrepresentation may be pursued if the defendant did not exercise reasonabl care or competence in obtaining or communicating the false information even if there was intention to deceive nor knowledge of the informations falsity74 in addition to common law actions for fraud or misrepresentation many states have acted unfair or deceptiv practices statutes that provide consumers with remedies against false misleading and deceptive business practices unconscionable actions or breach of warranty depending on the circumstances victims of di ploma mill scams might be able to assert claims under these state statutes v enforcement despite the available array of ws targeting diploma mills these phony institutions continue to exist many observers believe that there appears to be lack of prosecutorial interest at both th state and federal level in pursuing cases involving fraudulent academic credentials75 certainly there have been notable examples of diploma mill prosecutions over the years76 nevertheless the strength of overall enforcement efforts is difficult to gauge since it is unclear how many prospective cases have remained unpursued77
