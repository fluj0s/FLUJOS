karl w eikenberry for reasons 14 bd 1 snf summary president karzai and i continued our dialogue on the future of usafghan relations reftel in our weekly meeting july 7 we were joined by national security advisor rassoul karzai discussed his priorities for the next five years as outlined in his draft election manifesto the presidents manner was significantly more relaxed and warm than in meetings the previous week when he was often agitated accusing the us of working against him reftel as result our discussion was more constructive and forwardlooking when karzai drifted towards reiteration of his antius conspiracy theories on several occasions i was able to refocus the conversation on how the us and afghanistan governments can work together in the near and medium term to achieve combined success reviewing karzais election manifesto for next five years 2 snf as we discussed the longterm goals outlined in karzais draft election manifesto i reiterated the us commitment to continuing our close partnership with afghanistan regardless of whom the afghan people elect in august i then outlined what the us was seeking from the relationship over the next five years and commented on some points in karzais proposed agenda under president obamas strategy for afghanistan i noted we would continue to pursue more coherent regional approach while assisting the afghan government build more secure and economically sustainable country that would never again permit sanctuary for international terrorism i emphasized the importance of achieving meaningful progress in the near term to prove to the us and the international community that our ongoing investment of lives and resources in afghanistan was producing tangible lasting results for the afghan people 3 snf i took issue with the foreign policy section of karzais draft manifesto which stressed afghanistans relations with the islamic world and with palestine followed by rather weak comment on relations with the us i pointed out this did not accurately reflect our robust partnership and raises questions regarding karzais perspective on the bilateral relationship 4 snf i also noted the documents lack of strong emphasis on strengthening afghan national security forces ansf and judicial system five years down the road i said success would be defined by whether the ansfs increased capacity allowed it to take the lead in planning and conducting effective military operations as well as apprehending and detaining insurgents under afghan legal authority note we are seeking translation of the draft of karzais manifesto passed to us earlier this month and will transmit septel once translation is complete 5 snf karzai then mentioned that after the election he planned to call national jirga to make recommitment to the afghanistanus relationship and our partnership in the war against terror this would he claimed clarify the military assistance aspect of the relationship and counter what many afghans perceive to be the unfocused presence of international forces reducing public concerns about those forces note we have since learned that later draft of karzais manifesto may include this call for traditional loya jirga to address the presence of us forces in afghanistan if true that karzai intends to convene traditional loya jirga instead of constitutional loya jirga it would reflect disappointing continuation of karzais tendency to govern through reliance on personalities of the past rather than on democratic institutions ambassador focus should be on afghan govt winning hearts and minds 6 snf karzai then returned to familiar theme his wish for afghanus relations to recover the spirit of 200204 period karzai sees as golden age in the relationship he would like for us forces to again be able to drive their humvees through villages greeted warmly by villagers who would shout good morning sergeant thompson karzai claimed as he has many times that his concern over the erosion of public trust in the us was driving factor in his increasingly strident criticism regarding civilian casualties night raids and detentions 7 snf i reminded karzai that we had agreed our discussion would be forwardlooking rather than dwell on past grievances i also reminded him the us and isaf had made kabul 00001892 002 of 003 tremendous effort over the past year to avoid civilian casualties noting that in recent engagement in helmand where one us marine had been killed and 25 wounded we had not employed close air support or artillery karzai agreed there had been dramatic reduction in civilian casualty incidents saying he intended to make public statement noting his gratitude for us efforts i welcomed such statement observing that the us continues to bear heavy cost for our assistance to afghanistan in the american lives lost as we work to ensure more secure future here 8 snf i also took issue with karzais golden age perspective reminding him that i had been in afghanistan during this period it was clear even at that time that trouble was brewing as the focus on security and reconstruction drifted and declined due to lack of resources and comprehensive strategy i urged karzai to recognize that president obama is providing the usafghan partnership with the tools necessary to build lasting foundation for afghanistans success based on sustainable security accountable government and working economy i stressed to karzai that our primary goal in afghanistan is not to win public support for the us but rather to help the afghan government win its own peoples hearts and minds by enabling it to provide basic security and effective governance to the people in five years we expect to still have forces in afghanistan but with the majority as advisors and trainers in support of ansf in areas such as logistics air support intelligence etc returning to karzais hopes for the future i told him americans do not long for day in which their soldiers are hailed throughout afghanistan they are instead growing impatient for the day respected afghan army and national police force are fully capable of providing security to the afghan populace time is not unlimited karzais antius rhetoric undermines advocacy for continued support 9 nsf i then raised with karzai his regular claim to senior us visitors that the us has failed in afghanistan i noted that such rhetoric could potentially undermine continued bipartisan support for our current strategy of expanding us assistance to afghanistan i said some criticism was fair but in these meetings with senior us officials karzai regularly failed to acknowledge any meaningful progress resulting from us contributions by condemning us efforts while failing to take any responsibility for afghanistans problems karzai was not presenting the afghan government or himself as responsible partner in this relationship partner cognizant of and sensitive to mutual obligations leaving meetings with karzai officials could easily conclude that the us has accomplished little or nothing here and question why we continue to devote american lives and resources to the effort karzai indicated that he understood the need to present more balanced perspective note it remains to be seen whether karzai can or will refrain from this blame america tactic he uses to deflect criticism of his administration indeed his inability to grasp the most rudimentary principles of statebuilding and his deep seated insecurity as leader combine to make any admission of fault unlikely in turn confounding our best efforts to find in karzai responsible partner elections karzai still suspicious of us intentions 10 snf revisiting favorite grievance karzai asserted that early in the year some officials in the obama administration had encouraged potential opposition candidates to run karzai indicated he felt secretary clinton had been very supportive and noted relations with vp biden were much improved he still felt some senior officials were actively working to undermine him those officials he said were openly discussing election runoff scenarios that would give the opposition an opening to unite against him karzai claimed that in fair and free election he would win on the first round if there were irregularities and the election went to second round karzai believed opposition candidates would play the ethnic card to marshal support undermining national unity 11 snf i challenged his assertion that administration officials had promoted opposition candidates i emphasized that in fact our mission has gone to great pains to remain balanced in engagement with presidential candidates and to promote levelplaying field i reminded karzai that i had decided not to visit mazaresharif because of governor attas overt campaigning for abdullah and his reported refusal to comply with moi atmars dismissal of two policemen in the province for corruption karzai replied with humor kabul 00001892 003 of 003 that he conceded in this instance that the us had been evenhanded in demonstrating its commitment to fair elections comment 12 snf although more relaxed than in recent meetings karzai remains deeply suspicious of us intentions and actions regarding key opposition candidates frequently citing usbased support groups for abdullah abdullah and ashraf ghani karzai is currently most concerned about potential abdullah coalition he dismissed ghani saying that he will know ghani has admitted defeat when he asks for position in karzais new government karzai clearly expected or hoped to receive the same us support for his candidacy that he received in the 2004 election and interprets our neutral stance in this election as evidence that the us is against him i will continue to use my weekly dialogues with karzai to clarify our position on this and other issues while focusing him on the way forward in usafghan relations with an emphasis on our shared desire that progress needs to continue regardless of who wins the election in future discussions i will continue to stress the importance of afghanistan assuming more meaningful partnership role and focus on key issue areas such as ansf growth and assumption of lead responsibility for security reconciliation government accountability and sustainable development through this engagement we will also seek to avoid the gap between the us and karzai widening to the point that we will lose precious time closing the distance should he be reelected eikenberry
