instructional methods and adaptations of the curriculumis to codify the interpretation of fape contained in the s upreme court decision board of education of the hendrick h udson central school district v rowley 5 both the house and senate bills would add language to the definition of child with disability with respect to child ages three to nine years of age6 current law permits state or local educational agency lea to include child in this age group in the definition if he or she is experiencing development delays and therefore needs special education and related services both bills would add the phrase or any subset of that age range ie ages 3 to 9 including ages 3 through 5 this language apparently is not intended to alter who receives services to address development delay but to clarify that states have flexibility to serve subgroups within the general age range of 3 to 97 hr 1350 senate adds definition of core academic subject by reference to the definition of that term in sec tion 9101 of the elementary and secondary education act esea8 the house bill does not contain similar provision hr 1350 senate but not hr 1350 h ouse would amend the definition of assistive

requirements of the child left behind act nclba11 the house bill defines the term highly qualified w ith the same meaning as the term in section 9101 of the elementary and secondary education ac t

disabilities for the purpose of idea were discussed during the house debate on hr 1350 an amendment offered by representative shadegg and passed on the house floor provi des in part that it is the sense of congress that students who have not been diagnosed by physician or other person certified by state health board as ving disability as defined under the individuals with disabilities ducation act should not be classified as children with disabilities for purposes of receiving services under that act also hr 1350 house would require gao study revi ewing variation among the states in definitions and evaluation pr ocesses relating to the provi sion of services under idea to children having conditions falling under the terms emotional disturbance other health impairments and specific learning disability14 allocation formula provisions state and substate grants both hr 1350 house and hr 1350 s enate would make minimal changes in idea state and substate grant formul as none of which would appear to change how idea funds are currently allocated15 the bills would simplify the language of the part b grantstostates formula most notably by eliminating language on the interim formula which had been in eff ect before the permanent formula became effective in fy2000 after that date the interim formula would never become effective again both bills retain the permanent ie current formula language with the technical change that funds permittin g states first ar allocated the amount received for fy1999 and then remaining funds are allocated by the population poverty formula16 fy1999 is the effective base year amount under current law so this should not change idea allocations both bills specify authorization levels for the part b grantstostates program hr 1350 house would authorize amounts that increase annually from fy2004 111 b illion authorized 22 billion increase over the fy2003 appropriations and fy2005 136 billion authorized 25 billion increase over the fy2004 authorization to fy2010 252 billion authorized after fy2010 authorizations would return to such sums for fy2011 and subsequent fiscal years hr 1350 senate authorizes specific amounts for 7 fiscal years from approximately 124 billion for fy2005 to 261 b illion forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32415crs5 17 261 billion appears to be the most recent cbo estimate of full funding under current law for fy2011 18 both bills also would maintain the perm anent authorization of the preschool program authorized under section 619 of part b section 619j 20 usc 1419 19 hr 1350 house 611a3 maximum stat grants the basis of full funding for idea are calculated based on 40 of the na tional average per pupil expenditure appe times the number of children with disabilities th state serves for further information on idea grant formulas under current law see crs report rl31480 individuals with disabilities education act idea state grant formulas 20 hr 1350 senate 611a2 21 these percentages parallel the weights given to and the age ranges for population and poverty in the grantstostates formula age ranges for population and poverty vary according to the age ranges for children with disabilities in the various states 22 hr 1350 senate would make change in funding for the freely associated states of the republic of the marshall islands the federated states of micronesia and the republic of palau under current law these entities receive idea part b funds through competition funded as part of the setaside for outlying ar eas and the freely associated states under hr 1350 senate each of these entities would receive grant equal to the amount received for fy2003 under part b hr 1350 senate 611b1b for fy2003 the total amount for these entities is about 66 million the senate bill also adds section 610 stating that the freely associated states shall continue to be eligible for competitive grants hr 1350 house would eliminat payments to the freely associated statesfy201117 with such sums authorized for fy2012 and subsequent years thus the permanent authorization of part b grants to states is maintained in both bills18 maximum state grants the bills differ substantially with respect to the provision for providing maximum state grants or full funding under the grantstostates program hr 1350 house would retain the current calcu lation of maximum grants except that it would limit the number of children with disabilities ages 3 to 17 that are to be counted for the purposes of determining maximum state grants to 135 of all children in that age group within state19 the presumed impact of this change would be to discourage some states from overidentifying children with disabilities to increase their maximum grants hr 1350 senate would substantially change the calculation of the full funding amount20 the bill would specify calculation of the maximum am ount available for awarding grants under this s ection for any fiscal year this total would be calculated based on the total number of children with disabilities served for school year 20022003 times 40 of national average per pupil expenditure appe the total amount for each successive year would be determined by increasing this amount by an annual factor derived 85 from overall growth in child population and 15 from overall growth in ch ildren living in poor families21 this amount would presumably be distributed to states outlying areas22 and the bureau of indian affairs according to currentlaw provisions thus hr 1350 senate would eliminate the provision in current law determining states maximum state grant at 40 of appehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32415crs6 23 this minimum amount is currently about 570000 24 current maximum state setasides vary fro m 83 to 115 of state grants based on data from the us department of ducation ed budget service 25 hr 1350 house 611f4 apparently if states grant was less than its fy 2003 amount current language would apply that is its maximum reserve would be its prioryear reserve increased by inflation 26 hr 1350 senate 611e1times an annually update d number of children with disa bilities the state serves this provision would have impact on states allocation until the state became eligible for its maximum grant the presumed even tual impact of this change would be to remove incentives for any state to overidentify children with disabilities to increase their maximum grants it is important to note that such limitation on child count for the purposes of determining ma ximum state grants has impact on who must be served under part b of idea state reserves both bills would make certain changes in provisions governing state reserves for administration and other statelevel activities under current law the maximum amounts states may reserve fro m their part b grants for administration and for state level activities are determined by increasing the prioryear reserve by the lesser of the rate of inflation or the percentage increase if any in state grants since appropriations for the part b grantstostates program have been growing at rates well above inflation the state reserv have been increased from year to year by inflation of this amount states may reserve for state administration 20 or minimum of about 500000 adjusted for inflation23 whichever is greater currently these provisions mean that states can retain for state purposes on average about 10 of their state grants and about 2 of state grants on average for administration but these percentages vary somewhat from stat to state and under current law will almost certainly change probably decreasing in the future24 although hr 1350 house apparently re tains currentlaw nguage related to state setasides it would add language based on an accepted floor amendment offered by representatives mckeon and wool sey that appears to override provisions on how much states can reserve for statewide activities based on this language for any fiscal year for which st ates part b grant is equal to or greater than its fy2003 grant hr 1350 house would set the max imum state could retain for statelevel activities at the amount it retained in fy200325 in addition hr 1350 house would increase the state minimum for administration to 750000 however this minimum amount would not be inflation adjusted as it is in current law hr 1350 senate would permit states to reserve for state administration the maximum reserved for fy2003 or 800000 whichever amount is greater26 apparently these amounts would be increas ed by inflation each year with the exception of the increased minimum for administration states administrative reserves should be the same as those unde r current law hr 1350 senate would change the maximum amount states could re serve for other state activities and wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32415crs7 27 hr 1350 senate 611e2 28 states for which the maximum reserve for state administration is 800000 would be permitted to reserve up to 12 of their tota l grant after subtracting the amount for administration for fy2004 and fy2005 for other statelevel activities 29 if future growth rates in part b grants to states are below infla tion growth in state set asides under hr 1350 senate would be grea ter than under current law which pegs set aside growth rate to the lesser of inflation or states overall grant growth rateenlarge the scope of those activities27 for fy2004 and fy2005 states could reserve up to 10 of their total grants after s ubtracting the amount reserved for state administration28 beginning in fy2006 the maximum amount for other state activities would be adjusted by the rate of inflation this approach would continue through fy2009 under the senate proposal amounts for other state activities could be appreciably larger than under current law for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 for the next 4 fiscal years the growth rate would be the same as the currentlaw growth rate if overall state grants grow at rates above inflation29 however these growth rates would be applied to higher base than under current law table 2 shows how the bills might impact state setasides for hypothetical state that received fy2003 idea grant of 50 million growing at 15 annually in subsequent years the total setaside under current law would grow at the rate of inflation 2 per year in the example the currentlaw administrative setaside would be 20 of the state setaside th setaside for other statelevel activities would be the total setaside minus the admin istrative setaside based on the house provision discussed above stat setasides under the house bill would remain at the fy2003 level the administrative setaside under the senate bill would grow by the rate of inflation and be the same as the currentlaw amounts the difference the senate bill would make can be seen in comparing am ounts for other statelevel activities which would grow si gnificantly for fy2004 and fy2005 table 2

day for number of years but eventually they requested the school to accept financial responsibility for his health care services during the school day the supreme court interpreting the definition of related services held that the extensive services required by garret f mu st be provided by the school as long as they were not medical services that must be provided by physician31 hr 1350 house would allow states to use up to 40 of the amount reserved for statelevel activities for establishing and implementing cost or risk sharing funds consortia or cooperativ to assist local educa tional agencies in providing high cost special education and related services this provision together with the permitted use of local funds discussed below addresses the issue of educating children with low

would be applied to children wit hout disabilities except that educational services may not cease110 hr 1350 senate keeps the concept of manifestati on determination but contains revised language manifestation determinations do not have to be conducted prior to taking disciplinary action for ten consecutive school days or less or for removal in cases involving weapons drug s or serious bodily
