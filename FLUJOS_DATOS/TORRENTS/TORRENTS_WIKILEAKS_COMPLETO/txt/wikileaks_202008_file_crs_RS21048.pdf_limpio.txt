forward operating base in afghanistan this was not believed to be the first such raid with the seals and other jsoc forces having conducted two or three similar raids in the past severe pakistani political reaction to the september 3 raid in particular the threat to cut coalition supply lines transiting pakistan has supposedly resulted in the decision to suspend future unapproved us sof raids into pakistan on october 26 2008 us sof supported by helicopters reportedly conducted small cross border raid near the town of abu kamal five miles inside the syrian border both the pakistan and syria raids were said to result of those nations unwillingness to prevent crossborder attacks against us and allied forces but critics of these operations contend that they are of limited tactical benefit and only serve to further complicate already tenuous diplomatic efforts with those nations and incite local civilians in the case of pakistan where us sof is said to be training pakistani frontier corps paramilitary personnel 15 these raids could result in the suspension of these activities which are viewed by many as longterm solution to deal with taliban and queda forces operating in the

to relieve the global shortfall of us sof as about 80 of sof are deploy ed to the us central command uscentcom area of operations which has resulted in shortage of sof in other regions18 another concern impacting sof expansion is that dod reports that full one third of special forces soldiers are eligible to retire19 the emphasis on uscentcom has resulted in dilution of skill levels for some sof members who under normal circumstance s could be assigned to other areas of the world where they would be using and refining different languages cultural skills and operational tactics in addition the high concentration of us sof in the uscentcom region has hindered ussocom efforts to establish what it describes as global network of persistent presence rather than an episodic presence

suggests that while sof expansion is proceeding as planned equipment shortages may have an operational impact on ussocom forces one crucial shortage area is airliftboth rotary and fixed wing analysts maintain that the sof helicopter fleet has not increased in proportion with the expansion of sof units as result sof units in iraq have relied heavily on conventional army aviation which is said to provide twothirds of sofs lift requirements this deficit could worsen as sof takes on more missions worldwide and also if there is significant reduction of army aviation in iraq as there is t expected to be corresponding sof draw down observers also note that sof requires additional unmanned aerial vehicles ua vs for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr support portable radios and even small arms are also reported equipment shortfalls for special operations units contributing factor is said to be ussocoms acquisition emphasis which has fo cused instead on bigticket programs such as the seal delivery vehicle and large air platforms at the expense of smaller items of equipment related difficulty is lack of sof logistics capability and units needed to repair equipment and sustain sof operations sof support units have been characterized as not being robust enoughlacking human intelligence analysts cooks mechanics and other support specialists because of these shortages conventional army units have been providing much of sofs logistical support in iraq including running dining facilities refueling vehicles flying medical evacuations and guarding sof bases the concern is that in the case of iraq if there is significant draw down of conventional forces as anticipated sof operations might become significantly constrained due to lack of organic logistical capabilities the lack of sof aviation intelligence and logistics support is said to be factor impacting possible surge of sof to afghanistan to target insurgents 21 18 information in this section is from william h

nonstate actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations iw favors indirect and asymmetric approaches though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities in order to erode an adversarys power influence and wi ll dods december 2008 directive on iw directs the asd solicic to serve as the principal civilian advisor to the secretary of defense for iw and provide overall policy oversight within dod commander ussocom was tasked to assist the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff by coordinating the development of those aspects of sof doctrine relevant to iw ussocom was also directed to lead the development of sof iwrelevant training and education standards fo r units and individuals in addition ussocom was tasked to develop sof capabilities for extending us reach into denied areas and uncertain environments by operating with and through indigenous foreign forces or by conducting low visibility operations with this emphasis on iw some senior dod officials have suggested that generalpurpose forces need to become more soflikein terms of responsiveness and the ability to adapt 23 dods ongoing roles and missions review reportedly will attempt to establish the right division of responsibilities for special operations troops and generalpurpose forces across the spectrum of irregular warfare including for counterinsurgency and foreign internal defense24 within this context it is possible that generalpurpose forces might be assigned greater share of foreign internal defense and training advisory and assistance missions which have traditionally fallen to sof units this shift in mission could have number of operational implications for us sof units g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561

into pakistan and other countries are well within its capabilities such operations may not be in its best selfinterest these raids may in fact kill insurgents and their leaders disrupt their operations and send the message that there is sanctuary for them but such raids might also make it more difficult for sof to conduct indirect operations sof indirect operations such as training foreign militarieslike pakistans frontier corpshave proven successful in the philippines and in colombia but are very dependent on strong long term ties to foreign militaries25 and the host nations government given pakistans reaction to the september 2008 unsanctioned raid into south waziristan us leaders may wish to consider that further efforts could imperil longterm indirect sof efforts to train pakistani forces to assist 22 unless otherwise noted information in this section is from dod directive number 300007 irregular warfare iw december 1 2008 23 goeff fein oef oif demonstrating us

reports of equipment and logistical shortages might merit further investigation given the fact that ussocoms budget has more than doubled sinc 2001 the issue is not likely lack of funds but instead an overemphasis on larger procurement items and expanding sof operators at the expense of soldierspecific items such as weapons and radios and the development of organic logistics assets such an imbalance could result in the inability to fully equip newly manned sof units as well as employ them in operations sofs reported dependency on significant support from the conventional army might make it extremely difficult for them to take on greater role in iraq as conventional forces are redeployed or to surge in afghanistan to support an anticipated increased us commitment

sof one is that more foreign internal defense and training advisory and assistance missions could be transferred to generalpurpose forces which could potentially free up sof units that normally would be assigned these missions for other operations the call for generalpurpose forces to become more soflike might facilitate iw operations and remove some of the operational burden from sof but in order to achieve this transformation of generalpurpose forces sof resources and personnel would likely be dedicated to this effort which could preclude their availability for operational missions
