taxes and other sources of revenue in funding the hazardous substance superfund trust fund congress makes annual appropriations to the environmental protection agency epa from this trust fund and from general treasury revenues for the purpose of supporting the superfund program the superfund program addresses both shortterm emergency and longterm cleanup activity of hazardous substances at contaminated sites three dedicated taxes on petroleum chemical feedstocks and corporate income historically provided the majority of the trust funds income the taxes expired at the end of 1995 however and the amount of unobligated money in the fund gradually dwindled by the end of fy2003 the funds unobligated balance was zero down from high of 38 billion in 1996 the administrations decision to not request reinstatement of the taxes has been supported by congress although some members introduced legislation to do so the annual budgets have compensated for the lack of dedicated tax revenue by increasing the contribution from the general fund of the us treasury in fiscal years 20042008 virtually the entire superfund program appropriation came from general treasury revenues proponents of reinstating the dedicated taxes contend that the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and releases eg spills and leaks should rely on taxes paid by the chemical and petroleum industries and companies that used the hazardous substances being cleaned up not taxpayers proponents refer to this as the polluter pays principle they also contend that in the context of federal budget deficits it may be difficult to maintain spending at needed levels without dedicated taxes opponents of reinstating the tax argue for example that the tax is overreaching and unfair as it applies to all industry sectors and to both compliant and noncompliant companies in general this funding debate applies to 30 of the sites on the national priorities list the remaining 70 of the sites according to epa are cleaned up by responsible parties several reports including one for the house and senate appropriations committees and reports by the epa inspector general have concluded that spending has fallen short of the programs needs from fy2004 through fy2008 the president s superfund budget requests declined each year however during most of those years the presidents superfund budget proposals exceeded the amounts appropriated by congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31410g21g158g153g142g155g143g158g151g141 g561g22g138g161g142g156g561g152g155g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g20

proposal which congress accepted to not request renewal of the superfund taxes in its fy2003 budget submission1a decision repeated in each subs equent budget proposal fy2004fy2009 the tax authority expired in 1995 but the funds balance remained positive until fy2003 although several members of congress have introduced bills to reinstate the taxes during these years such efforts have lacked the necessary support the superfund trust fund is used to clean up sites contaminated by releases of hazardous substances without dedicated taxes and with relatively small balance in the trust fund congress has been using general revenues for larger percentage of cleanup funds this report reviews income sources for the fund provides superfund program funding estimates for fy2009 and discusses whether this funding will be adequate to meet projected program needs g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla which was greatly expanded by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 sara pl 99499 created the superfund program 2 to clean up the nations worst hazardous waste sites and directed the environmental protection agency epa to prepare national priorities list npl to identify sites that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment the superfund account in epa s budget funds the agencys efforts to remove contamination that presents an immediate risk and to remediate contamination for which there is potential pathway of exposure although federal facilities are subject to cercla provisions the costs of remediation at federal facilities are paid by the federal agency that caused the contamination rather than out of the superfund account in majority of cases superfund cleanups are paid for by potentially responsible parties prpsusually current or previous ownersope rators of the site according to epa prps conduct cleanup at more than 70 of the sites on the npl 3 at approximately 30 of the npl sites either epa cannot locate prps for these properties or the prps located do not have the necessary financial resources to assist with cleanup it is primarily at this group of npl sites that epa uses funds from the trust fund to conduct cleanup activities the superfund funding debatethat is whether the trust fund should be supported by dedicated tax or general treasury revenuesapplies to this subset of npl sites g21g158g153g142g155g143g158g151g141g561g22g138g161g142g156g561 the trust fund has had several sources of revenue over the years the most important being dedicated taxes on petroleum chemical feed stocks and corporate income the taxes on petroleum 97 cents per barrel and on chemical feedstocks and imported chemical derivatives 1 the administration had not requested renewal of the taxes in its fy2002 budget submission either but the issue did not become particularly contentious in part perhaps because the fund had larger balance at the time 2 for more information on the superfund program see crs report rl33426 superfund implementation and selected issues by mark reisch and jonathan l ramseur 3 at many sites however epa cannot immediately locate financially viable prp or there are disputes among the prps concerning their degree of responsibility in such cases the statute permits epa to pro ceed with cleanup using the trust funds resources locate prps after or during cleanup and recover the cleanup costs from prps at later date i httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31410g21g158g153g142g155g143g158g151g141

that many of the hazardous substances to be cleaned up were derived from these sources the third tax referred to as the corporate environmental income tax pegged at 012 of corporate income in excess

us treasury departm ent note fy1991fy199 5 re prese nt s the fiveyear period prior to th expiration of t he supe rf und tax proponents of the superfund taxes argue that the taxes are justified based on the polluter pays principle both the bush administration and its critics say they support the polluter pays principle but they mean different things when using that phrase when administration spokespersons support polluter pays they mean cleanup funded by responsible parties at sites where such parties have been identified as owners operators or contributors of the waste requiring cleanup from this perspective polluters would not include industrial sectors or corporations that may not have contributed directly to specific sites contamination 4 the administrations critics use the polluter pays term in broader sense however to mean that the tax money that is used to clean up the other 30 of the sites should come from industries that profited from the sale or use of the chemicals being cleaned up but who may not be directly related to particular release of hazardous substance thus they support resumption of the dedicated taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks as well as the corporate environmental income tax arguing that this approach is more appropriate than funding the trust fund through general treasury revenues lesser sources of income to the fund have

agencies for emergency removal activities and collection of fines and penalties funds from general treasury revenues have also contributed to the superfund program to some degree including years when the tax was active table 1 shows the sources of revenue to the fund from 1991 to 1995 the last five years before the taxes expired the three dedicated taxes provided an average of 145 billion per year 658 of total revenues during the period the taxes generated nearly four times as much as the contribution from general revenues which averaged 369 million per year or 168 of total superfund revenues during the period the remainder of the funds income came from interest on investments 200 million per year and cost recoveries 180 million per year

1995 the republican leadership notably the chairman of the house ways and means committee during the 104 th through 106th congresses opposed reinstating the taxes except as part of comprehensive cercla reauthorization that would remove or modify superfunds liability provisions5 consensus was reached on reauthorization and the taxes were not reinstated when the taxes expired the office of management and budget omb reported that the fund had an unobligated balance of nearly 4 billion6 and even after expiration of the taxes money continued to be added to it from interest payments cost recoveries and other sources thus the lapse in taxing authority initially had little effect on the ability to fund the program the clinton administration requested reinstatement of the taxes annually in its budget submission but congress took action on these requests congress continued to fund the program through combination of the existing unobligated trust fund balance and general revenues to make the fund last longer the contribution of general revenues to the annual appropriation was increased from 250 million annually in fy1993 to fy1998 to 634 to 700 million in fy2000 to fy2002 the bush administration requested 700 million from general revenues in fy2003 and 11 billion in fy2004 in fy2005 the entire appropriation 125 billion came from general revenues although the superfund starting balance has improved in recent years the vast majority of the annual appropriations continued to come from general revenues in fy2006 and fy2007 the beginning year balance was 95 million and 178 million respectively omb estimated that the fy2008 starting balance was 273 million the fy2009 balance is projected to be 176 million regardless general revenues remain as the primary source of program funding for both fy2008 and fy2009 5 see for example cbo reports trust fund can survive through 2000 without cercla taxes daily environment report july 16 1996 6 according to the office of

superfund trust fund as shown in figure 1 this balance began steady decline starting in fy1998 by the end of fy2001 the funds unobligated balance had declined to 860 million the presidents fy2003 and fy2004 budgets projected further declines to 427 million at the end of fy2002 and to 159 million at the end of fy2003 these numbers were revised in the fy2005 budget submission and in figure 1 to reflect actual cost recoveries and other transactions in fy2002 and fy2003 the actual amounts show ba lance of 564 million at the beginning of fy2003 and zero balance at the beginning of both fy2004 and fy2005 although fy2005 started with zero balance it nded with 97 million in the account creating starting balance of 97 million in fy2006 7 this trend has continued in recent years fy2007 started with balance of 178 million omb estimated that fy2008 and fy2009 will begin with 273 million and 176 million respectively however these starting balances do not approach the balances that existed when the trust fund was supplied mainly by the superfund taxes based on omb estimates of starting balances in fy2008 and fy2009 general treasury revenues will continue to supply the vast majority of the

of management and budget omb produces annual estimates of the superfund trust funds starting and ending fiscal year balanc and revenue from its funding sources omb includes these estimates in the appendix to the annual budget of the united states government hereafter referred to as the presidents budget request for particular fiscal year as shown in the annual budget request funds that contribute to the trust fund fall into five categories 1 corporate income taxes 2 interfund transactions 3 cost recoveries 4 interest and profits on investments and 5 fines and penalties as discussed above the corporate income taxes category originally dedicated source of program revenue expired at the end of 1995 therefore this category is listed at zero the next category interfund transactions represents the estimated contribution from general treasury revenues which is function of both the level of congressional appropriation and the trust funds fiscal year starting balance similar to recent years the administrations fy2009 budget request proposed 126 billion for the superfund appropriation to consist of sums available in the trust fund on september 30 2008 ie the end of fy2008 therefore the fy2009 starting balance and up to 126 billion as payment from general revenues 8 if the trust fund balance is not sufficient to fund the total appropriation therefore any remaining balance from fy2008 would go toward the fy2009 appropriation and general treasury revenues would fund the remainder of the appropriation up to the maximum level enacted by congress the other three fund categoriescost recoveries interest and profits and fines and penalties help generate the endofyear balance that is used in the next fiscal year cost recoveries represent payments to the fund from potentially responsible parties to reimburse the government for cleanup expenditures at sites for which these private parties are legally responsible recoveries vary from year to year projecting them in advance is difficult and may have larger potential margin of error than other categories of revenue during the sixyear period of fiscal years 19972002 they averaged 272 million per year but they declined steadily from 147 million in fy2003 to 60 million in fy2006 although fy2007 saw recoveries of 234 million omb estimated recoveries of 76 million for both fy2008 and fy2009 like other government trust funds the superfund trust fund earns interest on its current balance until the money is actually expended expenditures can lag obligations by several years so there can be substantial difference between the unexpended and unobligated balances in the fund the unexpended superfund balance was estimated at 29 billion at the beginning of fy2008 due to the size of the unexpended balance the fund is still earning substantial amounts of interest according to the presidents fy2009 budget request omb estimated 151 million in interest earned for fy2008 and 125 million for fy2009 these projections assume an interest rate that is historically low if interest rates are higher than omb expects interest earned on the unobligated balance would be higher fines and penalties have generally contributed only minor portion to the superfund trust fund epa collected 1 million in fy2007 and omb forecasts 2 million in fines and penalties for both fy2008 and fy2009 8 appendix to the budget for

in program funding for fy2009 126 billion compared with the 125 billion appropriated in fy2008 omb estimated that of the total fy2009 appropriation 109 billion would come from general treasury revenues in fy2009 if the appropriation language were enacted as proposed the actual amount of general treasury revenues would depend on the funds starting balance and the appropriation ceiling enacted by congress regardless the vast majority of the fy2009 appropriation would come from general treasury revenues

to estimate general revenue funding needs for superfund in 2008 and later years it is first necessary to identify future program needs in july 2001 resources for the future rff as directed by congress in the fy2000 vahudindependent agencies appropriation pl 10674 conference report released comprehensive study to congress identifying those needs and projecting future costs for fiscal years 20002009 the study looked at all major elements of the superfund program including the removal program for emergency and shortterm cleanups the remedial program longterm cleanup site assess ment activities program staff management and support costs program administration and superfundrelated work of other programs and agencies the authors developed alternative scenarios for estimating the number type and cost of sites likely to be added to the program in coming years rff estimated the fy2009 program needs to be 16 billion this was the reports base case described as our best judgement of the future cost of the superfund program given the full body of our research analyses and interviews the report also estimated high and low case to reflect uncertainties about the factors used in their cost models the low estimate for fy2009 was 14 billion the high estimate was 18 billion 9 there are at least three factors contributing to rffs increased need projections first the funds unobligated balance which remained relatively high see figure 1 during the years of superfund taxes and the two fiscal years following the ta x expiration has decreased steadily since fy1997 reaching zero at the end of fy2003 as discussed ea rlier the current sources of the balancecost recoveries interest and feesprovided significantly less funding support than the superfund taxes second the amounts needed for cleanup were projected to increase beginning in fy2002 as numerous mega sites moved beyond the analysis and design phases and into actual construction of remedies although mega sites are generally classified as sites with projected cleanup cost of 50 million or more rff projected the average cost at mega sites to be 140 million in the rff analysis the cost of remedial action was projected to remain above historic levels through fy2007 and the cost of the superfund program as whole was projected to remain above fy2001 levels through at least fy2009 10 9 probst katherine et 2001 superfunds

order to meet the increased funding needs such as those identified by rff the administration noted that it requested increases in funding in both its fy2004 request for 139 billion and its fy2005 request for 138 billion which congress did not provide congress cut the fy2004 and fy2005 requests by 132 million and 134 million respectively in fact between fy2004 and fy2007 the presidents superfund budget proposals exceeded the annual amount that was subsequently appropriated by congress this trend halted in fy2008 congress appropriated 9 million more than was requested by the administration 17 given rffs projected funding needs for the superfund program and the relatively minimal amounts available to the fund from sources other than general revenues congress will face competing interests if it attempts to appropriate all of superfunds needs rff estimates that general treasury revenue contributions as high as 15 billion per year would be needed to finance superfund through the rest of the decade in the continued absence of superfund taxes this could prove difficult in light of current interest in deficit reduction
