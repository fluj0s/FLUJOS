the analysis of s 1302 is based on the soci security administration memorandum to sen jim demint from stephen c goss chief actuar and alice h wade deputy chief actuary estimated financial effects of proposal to finance individual accounts with the oasdi cash flow surplus june 23 2005 at http wwwssagovoactsolv encydemint_20050623pdf 3 taxable earnings are all earnings covered by soci security up to the taxable maximum which increases annually by average wage grow th in 2005 the taxable maximum is 90000this report describes the provisi ons of the bill it also analyzes the effect of hr 3304 on benefit levels trust fund solvency and the overall unified budget1 finally it compares hr 3304 to s 1302 similar individual accounts plan2 major provisions of hr 3304 account financing currently annual social security tax revenues exceed program costs surplus revenues are credite d to the trust funds as treasury bonds which social security can redeem to pay future be nefits in other words social securitys surpluses like proceeds from all governme nt bonds become part of the treasurys general fund which can be used for ta x cuts spending or repaying debt under hr 3304 bonds equal to social s ecuritys annual cash surplus would be credited to the trust funds as they are under current law genera l funds equal to this surplus would also be used to f und individual accounts called grow acc ounts the same money cannot be spent twice so hr 3304 would require new spending account contributions hr 3304 stipulates that workers born in 1950 or after would be eligible to enro ll in accounts st arting in 2006 eligible workers would be automatically enrolled workers could opt to disenroll once those who disenroll could reenroll once social security benefits would not change for people born before 1950 the ssa actuaries estimate that each acc ount would be credited with 222 of its owners taxable earnings in 2006 declining to 022 in 2016 after which the actuaries project more surpluses3 at that time contributions would cease t hough interest would continue to accumulate in the accounts in the case of divorce before retirement account contributions made during marriage of year or more as well as earnings on those contributions would be di vided equally between spouses account administration and investment the president would appoint sevenmember board to oversee grow acc ount administration between 2006 and 2009 all account assets would be co llectively invested in mark etable treasury bond fund the board would develop plan to expand inve stment options in 2009 and congress would have 90 days to disapprove it before it took effecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278crs3 4 the actuaries assumed 50 stock 25 corporate bond and 25 treasury bond portfolio 5 in hr 3304 the total benefit offset is called benchmark account the monthly offset is called an excess grow account credit grow account owners would be assessed up to 03 of account assets each year in administrative costs during the first five years general funds would cover any administrative costs above this amount social securitys actuaries project that the treasury bond fund would yield average annual re turns of 30 over inflation ie real or 27 after administrative costs they proj ect that diversified portfolio if offered would earn average annual real returns of 49 or 46 after administrative costs4 benefit offset the social security retirement benefits of workers who contribute to grow accounts would be reduced using benefit offset the total benefit offset would be equal to workers grow account ba lance if it had been invested only in the treasury bond fund at retirement the total be nefit offset would be converted into lifetime inflationadjusted monthly amount called an annuity this monthly offset would be subtracted from participants social security benefits5 because preretirement acc ount access would not be permitted offsets w ould not be deducted from nonretirement benefits such as disability and young survivor benefits if an account owners monthly offset were larger than his or her social security benefit the remaining offset would be deducted from the be nefits paid to the owners spouse if the account holder is married at retirement for example if married mans monthly offset exceeds his social security benefit his wifes social security benefit would be subject to two offsets 1 an offset based on her contributions to her own account if any and 2 an offset based her husbands contributions to his account account distributions workers could access their grow accounts when they begin to collect oldage benefits including spousal and survivor benefits nd benefits for disabled workers whose disability benef its convert to retiremen t benefits when they reach full retirement age preretirement account access would not be permitted workers not eligible for traditional social security be nefits ie those with less than 10 years of work covered by social security could acce ss their accounts at their full retirement age at retirement workers would be require d to make withdrawals from their accounts in the form of inflationindexed annuitie s so that their monthly annuity payments combined with their reduced social security benefits were at least equal to the federal poverty level any remaining account balance could be withdr awn as the worker chooses there would be one exception to the povertylevel annuitiz ation requirement beneficiaries whose combined benefits nd annuities would be be low the poverty level would not have to annuitize married grow account owners would be required to purchase joint and twothirds survivor annu ities with their entire account balances unless both spouses consent to another arrangement joint and twoth irds survivor annuity provides monthly payments to its owner for lif then twothirds of the owners payment to survivor beneficiary grow accounts can be inherited when their owners die when married workers die before retirement their surviving spouses would inherit their grow account balances which would count toward their surviving s pouses offsets when married workers diehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278crs4 after retirement their surviving spouses woul d inherit the balance of their grow account balances if any andor the survivor paym ent from joint annuity if one was purchased the surviving spouses benefits would also be reduced by an offset twothirds the size of the deceased spouses offset when unmarried account owne rs die their accounts would be inherited by person they designate or in the absence of designated heir by their next of kin these heirs would not be s ubject to offsets based on the inherited accounts analysis of the grow accounts plan benefit impact under hr 3304 account owners would receive their individual account assets as well as reduced ie offset social security benefits only the offset would directly affect the way

office of the chief actuary actuarial note 20043 scaled factors for hypothetical earnings examples under the 2004 trustees report assumptions by michael clingman and orlo nichols dec 2004 at http wwwssagovoactnotes ran3an20043pdf 7 the actuaries project 75year trust fund defi cit of 192 of taxable payroll under current law and estimate that hr 3304 would decrease this gap by 023 to 024 of taxable payrollpattern6 the worker in this example is assumed to be born in 1985 to begin work in 2006 to earn average lifetime wages to have average patterns of work and earnings and to retire at age 65 in 2050 the grow account accumulation column shows the expected cumulative balance of the account if additional investment options are offered in 2009 and the account is diversified at that time if the worker invests only in the treasury bond fund the cumulative balance would be the same as what is shown in the offset accumulation column only the value would be positive people who invest their accounts in th treasury bond fund and purchase annuities with their entire accounts would receive co mbined monthly payments under hr 3304 that are equal to their current law social security benefits since their grow annuity payments and the reduction to thei r benefits would be equal if the worker in the example invested only in the treasury bond fund hi s or her grow account would contain an estimated 10298 at retirement this sum coul d be used to buy an inflationadjusted singlelife annuity of 62 month the worke rs benefit offset would reduce his or her social security benefit by 62 so the co mbination of reduced benefits and annuity payments under hr 3304 would be equal to current law social security benefits if account owners had inve stment choices beyond the treasury bond fund and opted to diversify their accounts their retirement payments would depend on the returns those investments earn stocks and corporate bonds have higher av erage returns than treasury bonds but also greater risk if participan ts average returns were greater than the treasury bond rate his or her combined paym ents under hr 3304 would be greater than current law benefits if average returns were less than the treasury bond rate his or her combined payments would be lower the bill has minimum benefit guarantee if additional investment op tions were offered in 2009 ssas actuaries project that workers would have higher combined payments on average if worker chose the diversified portfolio used in the actuari projections the acc ount would contain an estimated 20817 at retirement this sum c ould be used to purchase an inflation adjusted singlelife annuity that pays 126 month the workers benefit offset would reduce his or her social security benefit by 62 month leaving the worker with combined monthly payment under hr 3304 that is 64 greater than current law benefits solvency impact under current law ssas actuaries project that the social security trust funds will not be able to pa the full amount of sche duled benefits after 2041 under hr 3304 the actuaries estimate that the trust funds will be solvent through 20437 this improvement is due to the gene ral fund transfers to grow accounts which would reduce the trust funds obligation to pay benefits since offsets are based on account contributions two additional year s of trust fund solvency would allow some future beneficiaries to receive fully schedul ed benefits for two more years than they would have in the absence of any changes to social securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22278crs6 8 the actuaries project that s 1302 would narro w the solvency gap by 015 of taxable payroll 9 ssas actuaries project that both hr 3304 and s 1302 would increase annual budget deficits and the national debt by 929 billion in real rms over 10 years and by about 14 trillion in present value terms over 75 years unified budget impact the unified budget is the total federal budget including the social security trust funds hr 3304 w ould not change the transfers from the trust funds to the general fund however to f und grow accounts on top of the existing trust funds the government must raise taxes cu t spending andor borrow thus adding to annual deficits and the nationa l debt since hr 3304 would not raise taxes or cut spending grow accounts would likely be funded through borrowing cbo estimates that from 2006 to 2015 hr 3304 would increase annual budget deficits and the national debt by more than 1 trillion in real rms this estimate includes about 6 b illion for administrative costs above those charged to grow accounts and over 200 billion for increased debt service ultimately it is the governments overall fiscal position not the size of the trust funds that will determine whether social s ecurity benefits can be paid borrowing to fund grow accounts would reduce the governme nts fiscal position by increasing the national debt cbo projects that relative to current law the national debt would increase by over 6 of gross domestic product gdp by 2015 and by 24 of gdp by 2080 even if hr 3304 were not debtfinan ced the cost of grow accounts would exceed the savings from the offset for two reasons first offsets would not apply in certain cases such as when unmarried work ers die before retirement second fully recouping the cost of the accounts over the long term would require an offset calculated with the treasury bond rate hr 3304 uses the treasury bond rate minus administrative costs that way account owners who i nvest in the treasury bond fund would receive monthly payments equal to current law as cbo explained in effect the 03 percentage points administrative costs would be paid from the social security trust funds how grow accounts compare to senator demints plan hr 3304 is very similar to s 1302 senato r jim demints plan the contribution rates eligibility requi rements enrollment rules offs et amounts and payout provisions in the plans are nearly identical though s 1302 may offer diversified investments year earlier in 2008 the primary differe nce is how the accounts are financed under s 1302 surplus social security re venues would go direc tly into individual accounts the surpluses would not be credited to the social security trust funds as they are under current law and would be under hr 3304 without other changes diverting surpluses into accounts would accelerate the da of insolvency s 1302 would transfer general funds to the trust funds to main tain solvency thr ough 2041 as under current law8 though the source of account funding in s 1302 and hr 3304 is different the amount of funding is the same thus ssas actuaries project that the two plans would have nearly identical effect on the nnual budget deficit nd the national debt9 however some economists belie ve that the trust funds mask the true size of annual budget deficits and the nationa l debt so trust fundfinan ced accounts like s 1302 might spur policymakers to reduce other spending
