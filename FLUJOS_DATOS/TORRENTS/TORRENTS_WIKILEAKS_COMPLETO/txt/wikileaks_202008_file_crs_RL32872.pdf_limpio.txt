funds to states territories and indian tribes for distributi on to local agencies in support of variety of antipoverty activities the origins of the community services block grant date back to 1964 when the economic opportunity act pl 88452 42 usc 2701 established the war on poverty and author ized the office of economic opportunity oeo as the lead agency in the federa l antipoverty campaign centerpiece of oeo was the community action program unde r which nationwide network of local community action agencies caas was veloped key feature of community action is the direct involvement of lowincome people in the design and administration of antipovert activities through mandato ry representation on the caas governing boards currently at the local level caas are the primary grantees of the csbg in 1975 oeo was renamed the community services administration csa but remained an independent executive branch agency in 1981 csa was abolished and replaced by the csbg to be administere d by hhs at the time csa was abolished it was administering nearly 900 caas about 40 local community development corporations and seve ral small categorical programs that were typically operated by local caas the csbg act was enacted as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 p l 9735 title vi section 671 42 usc 9901 as partial response to president reagans pr oposal to consolidate csa with 11 other social service programs into block grant to states congress rejected this proposal and instead created two new block grants the social services block grant under title xx of the social security act and the csbg which consisted of activities previously administered by csa the csbg act was reauthorized in 1984 under pl 98558 in 1986 under pl 99425 in 1990 under pl 101501 in 1994 under pl 103252 and in 1998 under pl 105285 the authorizations for csbg and most related programs expired in fy2003 reauthorization gislation was passed by the house and senate during the 108th congress but not enacted similar legislation was introduced in the 109th congress but not considered and csbg remains an agenda item in the 110th congress several related national activities commun ity economic development rural community facilities job opportunities for lowincome individuals joli and individual development accounts idas also offer grants to assist local low income communities with economic velopment rural housing and water management and asse t development for lowincome individuals among other services these activities are administered at the federal level by the same office of community services at hhs that administers the csbg and in some cases are also authorized by the csbg act prio r to fy2006 nationa l activities that r eceived separate appropriations so included the national outh sports and community food and nutrition programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32872crs4 the block grant use of funds csbg funds are used for activities designed to have measurable and potentially major impact on causes of poverty the law envisions wide variety of activities undertaken on behalf of low income families and individuals including those who are we lfare recipients homeless migrant or seasonal farm workers or elderly states must submit an application and plan to hhs stating their intention that funds will be used for activities to help families and individuals achieve selfsu fficiency find and retain m eaningful employment attain an adequate education make better use of available income obtain adequate housing and achieve greater participation in community affairs in addition states must ensure that funds will be used to ddress the needs of youth in lowincome communities coordinate with related programs including state welfare reform efforts and ensure that local grantees provide emergency f oodrelated services local delivery system states are required to pass through at least 90 of their federal block grant allotments to eligible entities primarily but not exclusively community action agencies caas that had been designated prior to 1981 under the former economic opportunity act the distribution of these funds among local agencies is left to the discretion of the state although states may not terminate funding to an eligible entity or reduce its share disproportionately without determining cause after notice and an opportunity for hearing there are more than 1000 eligible entities around the country the majority of which are private nonprofit organizations many of these organizations contract with others in delivering various services once designated as an eligible entity for particular community an agency retains its designation unless it voluntarily withdraws from the program or its grant is terminated for cause eligible entities are monitored within systematic schedule return visits are made when goals are not met in designating new or replacement entities states may select public agen cy only when qualified private nonprofit organization is available in accord ance with the 1998 csbg amendments local activities vary depending on the needs and circumstances of the local community each eligible entity or caa is governed by board of directors of which at least onethird are representatives of the lowincome community under the 1998 amendments to the csbg act lowin come board members must live in the community that they represent another third of the board members must be local elected officials or their representatives and the remaining board members represent other community interests such as busin ess labor religious organizations and education public entity must either have governing board with lowincome representation as described above or another mechanism specified by the state to assure participation by lowincome indi viduals in the development planning implementation and eval uation of programs there is typical caa since each agency designs its programs based on local community needs assessment ex amples however of csbgfunded services include emergency assistan ce home weatherization activ ities for youth and senior citizens transportation income management and credit

its oversight of state efforts to monitor local csbg grantees 2 efforts by states to monitor local grantee compliance with fiscal requirements and pe rformance standards and 3 targeting by hhs of its training and tec hnical assistance funds and th impact of such assistance on grantee performance15 gao concluded that the office of commun ity services ocs the office within hhs that is charged with administering the csbg lacks effective policies procedures and controls to ensure its own compliance with legal requirements for monitoring states and with federal intern control standards gao found that ocs had visited states as mandated by law but failed to issue reports to the states after the visits or annual reports to congress which also are manda ted by law ocs failed to meet internal control standards because their monitoring teams lacked adequate financial expertise moreover ocs lost the documentation from the monitoring visits to states finally ocs was not systematic in its selection of states to visit and didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32872crs12 not use available informati on on state performance or colle ct other data to allow more effective targeting of its limited monitoring resources on states at highest risk of management problems in connection with its assessment of state efforts to monitor local grantees gao visited five states and found wide vari ation in the frequency with which they conducted onsite monitoring of local grant ees although officials in all states said they visited agencies with identified problems more often states also varied in their interpretation of the laws requirement that they visit local grantees at least once in threeyear period and gao noted that ocs had issued guidance on this requirement states reported varying cap acities to conduct ons ite monitoring and some states cited staff shortages however the states all performed other forms of oversight in addition to onsite visits such as review of local agency reports eg local agency plans goals performance data and financial reports and review of annual single audits where re levant several states coor dinated local oversight with other federal and state prog rams and also used state associations of community action agencies to help pr ovide technical assistance gao found with regard to federal traini ng and technical assistance funds that ocs targeted at least some of these funds toward local agencies with identified financial and progra m management problems but ge nerally was not strategic in allocating these funds and had only limited information on the outcome of providing such training and technical assistance gao made five recommendations to ocs in its report and hhs indicated its agreement and intent to act upon these r ecommendations according to gao ocs should conduct riskbased assessment of states by systematically collecting and using information establish policies and pr ocedures to ensure monitoring is focused on the highestrisk states issue guidance to states on complying with the requirement that theymonitor local agencies during each threeyear period establish reporting guidance for training and technical assistancegrants so that ocs receives information on the outcomes for local agencies that receive such training or technical assistance and implement strategic plan for targeting training and technicalassistance in areas where states feel the greatest need hhs response hhs took series of steps in respons to the gao report on october 10 2006 hhs issued an information memora ndum to state agencies responding to gaos third recommendation and providi ng guidance on compliance with the statutory requirement that st ates conduct full onsite re view of each eligible

federal poverty line or maximum of 60 of state median income however th state would have had to give priority to serving individuals with the lowest income who sought services also s 1786 would have made tripartite board the sole mechanism for determining consideration of eligible entities and thus would have eliminated current provisions that allow state to specify another mechanism fo r doing so hr 3030 did not contain provisions concerning the poverty eligibility th reshold or the role of tripartite board in determining an eligible entity state plan requirements hr 3030 and s 1786 w ould

caas as institutions that organize lowincome co mmunities to identify emerging challenges to economically insecure americans and subsequently to mobilize the resources programs and partnerships needed to ddress local poverty cond itions the report further stated that csbg is unique federal resource that supports caas while they initiate creative responses to local poverty conditions and seek new sources of support and investment to implement their initiatives the committee believes that csbg funding is an investment analogous to venture capital in the future of low wage workers retirees and their families in its report the senate committee faulted the office of community services within hhs for failing to report on progress made in correcting the deficiencies in program oversight identified by gao see earlier discussion of gao report the committee also noted that ocs did not comply with directive included in the conference report on the fy 2005 appropriation regarding the

administrators regional and state community action associations and cal community action agencies urging them to take immediate steps to suppor t families disrupted by the storm then assistant hhs secretary wade horn suggested that all grantees especially those in the affected areas conduct quick inventory of services and resources they could deploy to assist victims including physical resources and the services of professionals such as doctors social workers mental health personnel and community workers the memorandum also stated that csbg funds could be used flexibly to cover the expanded services and that declarations of eligibility could be adequate at state option since many affect ed individuals would lack identification and verifying materials subsequent information
