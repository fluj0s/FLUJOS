asset database summary the office of infrastructure protection oip in the department of homeland security dhs has been developing and maintaining national asset database the database contains information on over 77000 individual assets ranging from dams hazardous materi als sites and nuclear power plan ts to local festivals petting zoos and sporting good stores the pres ence of large number of entries of the latter type ie assets generally percei ved as having more local importance than national importance has attracted much criticism from the press and from members of congress many critics of the database have assume d that it is or should be dhss list of the nations most critical assets and are concerned that in its current form it is being used in appropriately as the basis upon which federal resources including infrastructure protection grants are allocated according to dhs both of those assumptions are wrong dhs characterizes the national asset database not as list of critical assets but rather as national asset inventory providing the universe from which various lists of critical assets are produced as such the department maintains that it represents just the first step in dhss risk management process outlined in the national infrastructure protection plan dhs has developed pparently in parallel with the national asset database list of about 2200 assets that it has dete rmined are critical to the nation also while the national asset data base has been used to support federal grantmaking decisions according to dhs official it does not drive those decisions in july 2006 the dhs office of the insp ector general released report on the national asset database its primary conclu sion was that the data base contained too many unusual and outofplace assets and r ecommended that those judged to be of little national significance be removed from the database in his written response to the dhs ig report the thenundersecretary for preparedness did not concur with this recommendation asserting that keeping thes less than nationally significant assets in the database gave it situational awareness that can assist in preparing and responding to variety of incidents accepting the dhs descriptions of the national asset database questions and issues remain for example the nationa l asset database seem s to have evolved away from its origins as list of critical infrastructures perhaps causing the differences in perspective on what the databa is or should be as an inventory of the nations assets the national asset database is incomplete limiting its value in preparing and responding to wide variety of incidents assuring the quality of the information in the database is important and neverending task if dhs not only keeps the less than nationally significant assets in the database but adds more of them to make the inventory complete assuring the quality of the data on these assets may dominate the cost of maintaining the database while providing uncertain value finally the information currently contained in the database carries with it legal obligations on the owneroperators of the sset if however the database becomes the basis for regulatory action in the future what appears in the database takes on more immediate consequences for both dhs and the owneroperatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648 contents

asset database introduction the office of infrastructure protection oip in the department of homeland security dhs has been developing and maintaining national asset database the database contains information on wi range of individua l assets from dams hazardous materials s ites and nuclear power plants to local festivals petting zoos and sporting good stores the presence of large number of entrie s of the latter type ie assets generally per ceived as having more local importance than national importance has attracted much criticism from the press and from members of congress many critics of th database have ssumed that it is or should be dhss list of the nations most critical assets and are concerne d that in its current form it is being used inappropriately as the basis upon which federa l resources including infrastructure protection grants are allo cated according to dhs both of those assumptions are wrong the purpose of this report is to discuss the national asset database what is in it how it is populated what the database pparently is what it is not and how it is intended to be used the report also disc usses some of the issues on which congress could focus its oversight this report relies primarily on dhs office of the inspector general dhs ig report1 released on july 11 2006 but makes reference to other government documents as well short review of the dhs ig report the genesis of the national asset database remains somewhat unclear list of critical sites was begun in the spring of 2003 as part of operation liberty shield2 the list contained 160 assets including ch emical and hazardous materials sites nuclear plants energy facilities business and finance centers and more the assets were selected by the newly formed protective services division within the office of infrastructure protection in what was th called the information analysis andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs2 3 dhs offered assistance to help protect thes sites through its buffer zone protection plan program at times the state homeland security grants could be used to help pay for overtime of law enforcement officials and na tional guardsmen protecting critical sites 4 according to testimony by the thenunde rsecretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection list of 1700 assets according to the dhs ig report the actual number was 1849 was culled from the larger list however the dhs ig report implied that the protected measures target list grew independently to which was added additional information from the states and other sources leading to combined list of 28368 assets which then grew into the national asset database 5 in june 2004 the house appropriations committee made reference to unified national database of critical infrastructure described as master database of all existing critical infrastructures in the country see u s congress house of representatives department of homeland security appropriations bill 2005 hrept 108541 p 92 the comparable senate appropriations committee report sr ept 108280 made reference to national asset database the budget request for fy 2005 mentions the development of primary

additional security for these sites3 during the course of the year 2003 dhs continued to collect information on various assets from variety of sour ces by early 2004 dhs had accumulated information on 28368 assets although operation liberty shield was now considered over the initial list of 160 critical assets those judged to be in need of additional protection because of their vul nerability and the pot ential consequences if attacked grew to 1849 assets and becam known as the protect ed measures target list4 it is not clear when the inform ation being gathered became known as the national asset database5 by january 2006 according to the dhs ig report the data base had grown to include 77069 assets ranging from nuclear power plants and dams to casket company and an elevator company it so contains locations and events ranging from times square in new york city to the mule day parade in columbia tennessee which according to the city s website draws over 200000 spectators each year for the weeklong event the ig report categorized entries in the national asset database by critical infrastructurekey resource sector see figure 1 6 additionally the dhs ig report identified some of the entries with more specificity for example the database contained at the time 4055 malls shoppi ng centers and retail outlets 224 racetracks 539 theme parks and 163 water parks 1305 casinos 234

voluntary submittals by owners and operators periodic requests for information from states and localities and the private sector and dhs initiated studies the number of assets in the database is expected to grow as additional information is gathered the dhs ig report focused much of its attention on information provided by states and localities as the result of two data requests made by dhs

and 33419 whose significance are undeterminedaccording to the ig report the first data call to the states made by the office of domestic preparedness in 2003 yielde d poor quality data9 the ig report described the guidance given states and localities as minimal10 the guidance apparently did tell states howev er to consider any system or asset that if attacked would result in catastrophic loss of lif andor catastrophic economic loss11 as result assets such as the petting zoos cal festivals and othe r places where people within community congregate or local assets ostensibly belonging to one of the critical infrastructure sectors were among the assets reported according to the ig report many state officials were surprised to learn that additional assets from their states were added to the da tabase which raises additi onal questions about how the information was collected according to the ig report the sec ond request to the states for critical infrastructure information came from the office of infrastructure protection in july 2004 and was significantly more orga nized and achieved better results12 guidance was more specific as was the information requested dhs requested information for 17 data fields of those dhs considered the following to be most important address owner owner type phone local law enforcement point of contact and latitude and longit ude coordinates13 states were also asked to identify those assets that they felt met level of national significance criteria for identifying assets of national significance was provided by dhs the criteria described certain thresholds such as refineries with refi ning capacity in excess of 225000 barrels per day or commercial centers with potential economic loss impact of 10 billion or capacity of more than 35000 people althoug h the request was more specific states were given much leeway as to what to include and oip accepted into the database every submitted asset14 as result additional ssets of questionable national significance were adde d to the database15 the dhs ig report drew two primary conclusions the first is that the database contains many unusual or outofplace assets whose cr iticality is not readilyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs5 16 department of homeland security office of inspector general op cit p 9 17 ibid p 18 18 other examples of what the dhs ig considered to be inconsistent were some states listed schools for their sheltering function some did not indiana listed over 8000 assets more than states larger in area and population like new york texas and california and fewer banking and finance centers are listed for new york than north dakota 19 office of homeland security national strategy for homeland security july 2002 p 30 20 white house the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets february 2003 p 23apparent16 while at the same time it may have too few assets in essential areas and may present an incomplete picture17 the second conclusion was that the types of assets that were included and the info rmation provided are inconsistent from state to state locality to locality for example california entries included the entire bay area regional transit system as single entry while entries listed for new york city included 739 separa subway stations18 the ig report made 4 recommendations review the national asset database for outofplace assets and assets marked as not nationally signifi cant and determine whether those assets should remain in the database provide state homeland security dvisers the opportunity to review their assets in the database to identify previously submitted assets that may not be relevant during future data calls provide states list of their respectivedatabase assets to reduce duplicate submissions and establish milestone for the completion of comprehensive risk assessment of critical infrastruct ure and key resources and ensure they are accurately captured in the national infrastructure protection plan the national asset database what it is and what it is not the national strategy for homeland security recognized that not all assets within each critical infrastruct ure sector are equally impor tant and that the federal government would focus its effort on the highest priorities19 the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructure and key assets stated that dhs will develop methodology for identifying ssets with national level criticality and using this methodology will build comprehe nsive database to catalog these critical assets20 judging from the criticism leveled at it many believe the national asset database is or should be dhss lis t of assets critical to the nation however in his written

stated that the nati onal asset databa is not list of critical assetsbut rather national asset inve ntoryproviding the unive rse from which various lists of critical assets are produced21 according to the national infrastructure protection plan the national asset database is comprehensive catalog with descriptive information regarding the assets and systems that comprise the nations critical infrastructure and key resources22 the assistant secretary for infrastructure protection robert ste phan has called the data base phonebook of 77000 facilities assets nd systems from across the nati on needed to facilitate more detailed risk analyses23 some may ask why there should be this difference in perception regarding the national asset databa one possible explanation is that as noted above the national asset database starte d out as the protected measures target list which was prioritized list of assets considered critical at the national level also as reported in at least one media source when asked for its list of critical assets members of congress were shown the expanded list containing the questionable assets24 based on subsequent response cong ressional interest appears fo cused on prioritized list also what is meant by the term critical infrastructure continues to generate some confusion the definition provided in the usa patriot act and in other policy documents refers to specific assets or systems within selected set of sectors or categories however the term also is used often to identify the sectors and categories themselves for example the transportation sector is often called critical infrastructure when according to the statutory definition only those assets within the transportation sector whose loss w ould be debilitating to the nation should be called critical infrastructure given the varied usage of the term critical infrastructure the national in frastructure protection plan description of the national asset database above is unclear is it list of assets that are critical or is it list of assets that make up each of the critical sector s with criticality to be determined later what are its intended uses there appear to be two primary uses for the database as first step in prioritization process that ev entually will help focus ri sk reduction activities and to provide degree of situationa l awareness according to assistant secretary stephan the database does not drive the departments funding decisions25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs7 26 for discussion on common basic elements of risk management process in the context of critical infrastructure prot ection see crs report rl32561 risk management and critical infrastructure protection ssessing integrating and managing threat vulnerability and consequences by john moteff 27 as mentioned above in the second data request to the states dhs provided some characteristic thresholds by which dhs may asse ss whether or not an asset is critical at the national level also according to the nipp as the various sectors work with their sector specific agencies to develop s ectorlevel protection plans nother source of information for the database ownersoperators will have standard form containing few questions that can assist in determining criticality 28 department of homeland security office of inspector general op cit p 10 29 usa today op cit in this article the assistant secretary put the number of assets in this shorter list at about 600 in more recent testimony before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs ad hoc subcommittee on state local and private sector preparedness and integration july 12 2007 the number of such assets had grown to about 2500first step in identifying crit ical assets and prioritizing risk reduction activities taking an inventory of one s assets is standard first step for most risk management processes used to prior itize the protection of those assets26 the second step is to screen this initial list for those assets considered critical to the organization or country using specific cr iteria further analysis is focused on these critical assets the national infrastructure pr otection plan establishes dhss risk management process according to the nipp identifying the assets that comprise the nations 17 critical infrastructure sectors nd key resources within the national asset database represents the first step in its process as envisioned by the nipp dhs will then select those assets from the database it considers critical to the nation as whole27 if the asset is judged not to be critical from national perspective dhs does not re quire any further information if the asset does have the pot ential to be critical dhs will as k for more information which includes information that will support furthe r risk and risk mitigation analysis eg vulnerability to specific forms of attack or natural disasters and more detailed analysis of the consequences associated with the loss of the asset including interdependencies with other assets vulnerability consequences and threat information then will be integrated to yield risk score according to the nipp those assets that pose the greatest risk ar further analyzed to identify potential risk reduction initiatives which are then prioritized ie the risk reduction initiatives based on their costeffectiveness according to the ig report dhs officials acknowledge that many of the assets cu rrently in the data base will never be analyzed in depth or used to support any program activity28 according to the assistant secretary dhs has identified shorter list of assets that it considers high priority based on its analysis of vulnerability to attack or natural events and the possible consequences29 this list is apparently prioritizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs8 30 according to briefing received by crs august 14 2007 dhs has split this high priority list into tier 1 and tier 2 categories tier 1 assets are those which if lost or disrupted would have national impacts tier 2 assets those of more regional or local importance few dozen assets are categorized as tier 1 the rest or about 2200 assets are categorized as tier 2 apparently this high priority list is not drawn from or constitutes subset of the 77069 assets in the larger database but represents parallel list the linkage between this high priority list and the larger database is not clear 31 usa today op cit 32 gas stations of any size or location are not listed in the criteria of what dhs considers to be nationally significant asset within the il and gas sector or any other sector or key resource category 33 neither dhs or the ig report use the term situational awareness to describe the activities discussed in this section this is term crs believes captures the breadth of the statements made regarding this particular use of the database 34 department of homeland security office of inspector general op cit p 29further30 the assistant secretary asserted that this shorter list does not contain petting zoos popcorn factorie s or other such facilities31 while it may be common practice to take an initial inventory of ones assets as first step in risk management proce ss detailed informati on on individual assets is not necessarily needed to determine their criticality the presence of gas stations listed in the national asset database is case in point gas stations could be considered part of the oil and gas infrastructure subsector of the energy sector in assessi ng the oil and gas infrastructure one may want to identify in general all the assets that make up that infrastructure from production fields to refineri to distribution and all the transport elements in between gas stations would be on that list at the very end of the distribution chain in determining which assets are the most critical one does not need specific information on individual gas stations to termine that the loss of any individual gas station would have minimal effect on th distribution of gasoline throughout the country or on the economy or national pub lic health beyond the immediate vicinity of the gas station itself yet the nationa l asset database contains 127 gas stations unless these 127 specific gas stations ve some unique char acteristics perhaps being located next to an identified critical asset which could be damaged if there were loss of the gas station maintaining specific information on those gas stations seems unnecessary to determine their criticality32 situational awareness dhs justifies keeping assets that have not been judged as being critical at the national level in the database as way to provide degree of situational awareness33 undersecretary foresman noted in his response to the ig report that many assets not critical are in fact critical depending upon the circumstances34 for example as noted in the nipp the in formation may be used to quickly identify those assets that may be the subject of em ergent terrorist statem ents or interest orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs9 35 department of homeland security national infrastructure protection plan op cit p 32 36 it is not clear how or if the database was used to inform preparedness and response decisions made during the hurricanes of 2005 37 the washington post us struggles to rank potential terror targets securing all sites not financially feasible but choices are fraught with uncertainty by spencer hsu july 16 2006 p a9 38 the ipis program supports much of the partments critical infrastructure protection activities including its coordinating responsib ilities the national infrastructure protection plan the protected critical infrastructure info rmation program etc it is one of the preparedness directorates budget activities 39 for example the fy2007 budget justificati on discussed program called constellation an automated critical asset management system which would allow law enforcement to inventory categorize prioritize and databa critical assets it also includes risk assessment system compatible with the nationa l asset database and allows for automated bzpp development constellation was begun in angeles as pilot program the program is suppose to expand to other cities during fy2007 and information integrated with the national asset databasethat may be located in the areas of greatest impact from natural disasters35 according to the nipp having this information apparently regardless of the criticality level of the asset will help inform decisions made regarding preparedness response and recovery to wide range of incidents and emergencies36 in defense of the contents of the nati onal asset data base assistant secretary stephan is quoted as saying what happens the very first da that alqaeda attack s convenience store chain times dozen across the country we be tter have some of those things in the database so that we know what that unive rse of things is that we have to worry about37 according to the fy2007 congressional budget justification for the infrastructure protection and inform ation security ipis program38 the database will deliver something calle d the riskreadiness dashboa rd to dhs management the budget justification identified the risk readiness dashboard as planning and management tool that will eventually fuse threat streams with critical infrastructure vulnerability information and consequences and will visually present risk profile for critical infrastructure assets accord ing to the budget justification such capability will provide realtime knowledge that can be used to support rapid decisionmaking during periods of heightened threats also while particular asset may not be critical at the national level it may still be critical at the state or local level since dhs plans to allow many stakeholders eventually with appropriate clearances to have selected access to the database and the information in it or linked to it the database represents common picture ie standard format and taxonomy for all to use39 also according to the undersecretary dhs does not support purgi ng the database of these

12critical assets because it is important to the department to be informed about what is important to the states and localities40 the statements above raise number of issues first that assets may be critical under some circumstances and not others or become critical because they have been identified by intelligence as possible targets seems to conflict with the statutory definition of critical infrast ructures under the conditions stated above just about any asset could be considered critical and setting and implementing priorities would become even more complicated than it is now many would expect dhs to respond to such intelligence as part of its count erterrorism efforts which might include quickly deploying critical infrastructure resources such as sending out vulnerability assessment teams and establishing buffer zone protection plans however such efforts seem to lie beyond the fundament goal of the critical infrastructure protection program which is to identify those assets most critical to the nation as whole also if the national asset database is meant to be comprehensive list of the nations infrastructure assets regardless of criticality it is incomplete as noted in the previous secti on only 127 gas stations are in the database there are over 167000 gas stations in the united states41 similarly the database contains only 140 defense industrial base ssets 417 postal and shipping sites 669 banking and financial assets and 7542 agriculture and food assets according to the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets dhs estimated that there are 250000 defense industrial firms 137 million postal and shipping delivery sites 26600 fdic insure d institutions and almost 2 million farms and 87000 food processing plants42 to identify only few these assets perhaps in some states but not in others limits the utility of the current national asset database to support s ituational awareness to those re latively few instances where the database may have the appropriate information the position that the national asset data base holds data on those assets that states and localities have identified as important to them is contradicted by the dhs ig report according to the report state officials were repeatedly surprised to learn about the assets that were dded as part of the odp data call and which remain in the database43 the database include s many assets not selected by the states basis for allocating critical infrastructure pr otection grants the role that the national asset database plays

in addition changes based on new risk calculations by the dhs number of cities saw their grant levels drop some mbers believe that allocati ons were based on what they consider to be flawed national asset database over the last two grant cycles according to the dhs ig report odp has made increased use of information in the nationa l asset database to support its allocation of various critical infrastructure protection grants to states and localities however according to the assistant secretary the national asset database does not drive dhss funding decisions th exception is the buffer zone protection plan grants which were initiated to suppor t the protection efforts associated with the original protected measures target list and operation liberty shield the relationship between the odps gran tmaking process the national asset database and the nipp is not explicitly stated in dhs documents the nipp risk assessment process was fina lized june 30 2006 but odp has had some form of risk assessment process in place for determinin g initial grant allocations for programs such as the urban area security initia tive since 2003 also for the fy2006 cycle odp indicated it had evaluated over 120000 specific infrastructure assets44 but the national asset databa only contained 77069 assets as of january 2006 it would appear that odps grantmaking pro cess operates independe ntly from both the national asset database and the nati onal infrastructure protection plan45 issues assuming that the undersecretary is not changing the definition of critical infrastructure and accepting dhss argument that the national asset database is not prioritized list of critical assets and that it is not the basis for determining grant allocations two issues remain the quality of the information contained in the database and whether the va lue of keeping low criticalit assets in the database warrant the costs associated with maintaining them in the database another potential issue could arise if the current voluntary nature of the database changes congress may ultimately focus its oversight of the national asset database on these areas quality data quality is always an issue in generating

use this taxonomy in future data calls the ig report also stated that dhs intends to use expert panels to review information in their sector of expertise according the fy2007 budget justification one of the responsibilities of the protective security advisors49 is to verify critical infrast ructure information of particular concern is the complete ness of the information included beyond the issue that there appears to be an incomplete inventory of the less than critical assets as noted above the ig was particularly concerne d that the database does not include assets that one might conclude should be included the ig attributed part of this problem to reluctance on the part of private sector owneroperators to share certain information with dhs notwithstanding the protected critical infrastructure information program50 insuring the quality of the information in the database is likely to require continuous effort since quality also implies cu rrency if particular site closes moves or changes ownership the changes w ould logically need to be captured in the database the consideration of quality could incl ude also the accessibility flexibility and security of the database the nipp suggest ed that the database would be accessible to many type of queries by many types of stakeholders however it is not clear that the database yet has these capabilities dhs intends to develop second generationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs13 51 department of homeland security office of inspector general op cit p 32 52 while the nipp suggests that this would not occur the nipp also makes reference to as do the ig report and the fy2007 budget justifica tion national risk profile the nipp describes the national risk profile as high level summary of the aggregate risk and protective status across all sectors the ig re port makes reference to contractor developed gross consequences of attack tool that would automatically estimate across large number of potential targets held in

representatives making appropriations for the department of homeland security for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes hrept 109241 accompanying hr 2360 p 71database one that includes the integration of vulnerability risk threat and other relevant information according to the ig report dhs does not expect the second generation database to be ready for two more years in regard to security the undersecretary in his response to the ig re port asserted that the database currently exceeds all security nd protection standards51 assessing the accuracy of this assertion is beyond the scope of this report what to keep the ig report asserted that maintainin g unusual and outofplace entries in the database may complicate efforts to deve lop useful database make resource allocation more challenging obscure desired data waste time and money in repeatedly filtering them out of analyses or trying to prioritize them and taint credibility the dhs ig report however does not explain how these entries would necessarily complicate challenge and obscure efforts while the database may not yet be as accessible or as searchable as eventually planned it is not clear why less critical or more critical data could not be tagged as such however the presence of this data does involve cost in time and resources at th very least as discussed above the information collected on all assets must be ente red and verified even the less critical ones and missing data also may have to be locat ed also additional costs would likely be incurred if any further analysis such as vulnerability assessment or more detailed consequence analysis were done on these entries52 the budget justification documents do not pres ent data on how much money dhs spends on the database or how that expense is broken down however congress did appropriate 20 million for the database in fy200653 while the argument could be made that the costs might be marginal the dhs ig report noted that currently those entries identified as not being critical at the national level outnumber by 3 to 1 those that are identified as critical at the national level currently dhs cons iders only about 2500 assets as being the most critical indicating that less than critical sites could actually dominate the cost of maintaining the databasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs14 54 note that the database may contain informa tion associated with regulations which require submission of the information for other regulatory purposesit is not clear how to evaluate the va lue of maintaining th noncritical assets in the database especially if their numbers are unde rrepresented and the risk associated with them is relatively low potential change in status for the database currently the presence of particular asset in the database carries with it specific obligations on the part of the ow neroperator they are not required by statute or regulation to provide information to the database per or to take any specific actions as result of having an asset listed54 information solicited by dhs is voluntarily given presumably publicly available information does not require the permission of the owneroperator for it to be included in the data base however if ever having an asset on the national asset database carries with it some legal or regulatory requirements then what is in and not in the data base or adding or removing assets from it might result in much greater consequences for both the ownersoperators and dhs congressional action implementing the 911 commission recommendations the house of representatives as part of the 110th congresss first 100 hours of legislation passed hr 1 implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 title ix of this act includes section sec 902 dealing with the national asset database th section did number of things it amended the homeland security act to include the requirement that the secretary of homeland security establish national asset database it also required the secretary to establish within this database subset of assets that the secretary determines are most at risk this subset of assets shall be called the national atrisk database this requirement indicated that the house disagrees with the undersecretary that the national asset data base should not include prioritization of assets section 902 also established national asset database c onsortium made up of representatives from at least two but more than four national laboratories along with officials from other federal agencies with appropriate experience in working with and identifying critical infrastructure the consortium is to advise the secretary on how to identify generate organize and maintain the national asset database in addition the secretary is to solicit comments from the consortium on the appropriateness of the risk met hodologies employed by the national infrastructure protection plan and altern ative methods for defining risk and identifying specific criteria by which to set priorities the secretary is to secure recommendations from the consortium 60 days after this act is enactedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs15 the section also required the secretar to annually review the database to examine assets in the database to determine if the information on these assets is incorrect or if they do not meet national asset guidelines used by the secretary to determine which assets should remain in the database it required the secretary to remove from the database any asset whose information is not verifiable or which does not meet the nation asset guidelines the requirement disagrees with the undersecretarys position that lessthannationa llycritical assets should remain in the database also the secretary is to provide the data base to states for review and to meet annually with the states to discuss guidelin their submissions of information for the database this requirement is in agreement with recommendations made by the inspector general section 902 also requi red the secretary to ensure that the information contained in the database can be organized by sector state locality and region section 902 required the secr etary to report to congre ss annually on those assets in the database considered to be most at risk the report is to include name location and sector of each asset it is so to include any changes in the criteria used to define or identify critical infrastructure and any changes in the compiling of the database it is also to include the extent to which the database has been used as tool for allocating resources it is likel that dhs would classify much of the information specific to particular assets in the database title xi in the senates companion bill s 4 improving americas security act of 2007 although not mentioning national asset database also required the secretary to develop riskbased prioritized list of critical infrastructure and key resources the list should consider those assets or systems that if destroyed or disrupted by attack or natu ral catastrophe would cause sign ificant loss of life severe economic harm mass evacuations or lead to the loss of vital public services the list should reflect crosssector analysis to determine priorities for prevention protection recovery and reconstitution th act also instruct ed the secretary to report to congress annually th criteria used to create th list the methodology used to solicit and verify information submitted to the list and how the list will be used in program activities including grant making in the compromise bill implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl11053 the senate agreed with the house with some modification title x established the national asset database in statute and instructed the secretary of homeland security to establish and maintain classified prioritized critical infrastructure list of systems and assets included in the database that the secretary determines would cause regi onal or national catastrophic effects if destroyed or disrupted it instructed th secretary to annually update the database including establishing data collection guidelines reviewing those guidelines with state officials and to work with state officials befo re finalizing what should be included in the database the secretary was also instructed to identify and evaluate methods for soliciting relevant informa tion on assets from the private sector including use of the protected critical infrastructure information program the bill also required the secretary to submit an annual report that among other items should include the name location and sector classification of t hose assets listed inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33648crs16 the classified prioritized list those assets that are most at risk of terrorism and the extent to which database andor the prioritized list have been used to allocate federal funds this report shall be unclassified although classi fied annex may be included the compromise bill also required an annual report on the comprehensive assessments carried out in each sector and should include any countermeasures or actions recommended or taken to address issue identified in those assessments this report may be classified the secretary was also required to report annually on the actions taken by the federal government to ensure the preparedness of the private sector to reduce interruptions in the opera tions of critical infrastructures associated with acts of terrorism or natural catas trophe or other nati onal emergency in accordance with the defense producti on act of 1950 this report is to go to the house financial services committee and the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee in addition to the respective homeland security committees the compromise bill left the consortium concept proposed by the house to the secretarys discretion homeland security appropriations the house version of the fy2008 partment of ho meland security appropriations bill hr 2638 contained report language dir ecting the national protection and programs directorate to remove from the national asset database items it deems insignificant and encouraged the directorate to provide states and local partners the opportunity to review th eir assets listed in the database and to recommend items for removal the language also stated that th directorate should clarify its guidance when soliciting information to ensure uniform and accurate information the senate version s 1644 contained similar language
