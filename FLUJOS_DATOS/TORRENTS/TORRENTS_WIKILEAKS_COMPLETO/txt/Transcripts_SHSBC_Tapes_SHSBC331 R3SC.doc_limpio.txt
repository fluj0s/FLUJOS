r3sc lecture given on 3 september 1963 what is the wellknown date audience september 3rd ad 13 3 september ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and we have lecture on r3sc notice mom hands papers notes cold like that all right now once upon time we had something called rock slammer you remember the history of rock slammer all right you did scientology list one which is not the l1 in that bulletin but the old scientology list one and what did you find in this you found that occasionally as you went down the line you picked up tick and when you put in the big mid ruds on that particular tick you all of sudden got yourself nice handsome rock slam so you say auditing to somebody and you got rock slam right you remember this technology well this meant that something was going to go wrong in the vicinity of auditing with regard to this person by reason of aberration now of course punitively punitively we said at once all rock slammers were bad and they all ought to be shot and so forth until we found out that practically everybody rock slammed and then of course we had to come off of it but that isnt all that we came off of we just dropped that piece of knowhow in the mire and let it lie you notice suddenly we werent saying anything about that at all well that didnt mean that i forgot it completely that didnt mean that it was utterly gone as far as i was concerned but i had seen some phenomena which i definitely had to straighten out and that phenomena had to do with the reason person doesnt recover under auditing now thats the whole department head that heads up that whole department the reason the person doesnt recover under auditing now this has been with us actually since 1949 1948 it must have been present then i didnt run into it headon until about 1950 and it became very crucial in 1950 one of the reasons this would peak up is that in the type of auditing which i was doing in 1950 there was great deal of slippiness lot of it was very slippy and there was lot of this and that would work its way through and you didnt have hard tightly bound process you see and as soon as you got tightly bound process that was limited to running of engrams you ran into this phenomenon of people not getting well so again we have run into engrams and again we all of sudden come up with this interesting datumbut not for the same reasonof people who just dont recover now in my catalog of things to be done this business of rock slammers and reasons why people didnt get well continued to ride right along there and take prominent position in looking over all new things and all of sudden i collided with the old service facsimile but the collide was rather oblique and the way we collided with that was by study of the tone arm the necessity to get tone arm motion and the various positions of the tone arm now all of that material which youve had in recent lecturevery germane to this it became obvious that if an individual were audited for three sessions without tone arm action he got into pretty terrible condition bad bad show bad show therefore you had to audit with tone arm action i dont say he fell to pieces but he just wasnt feeling wellhe didnt feel so good youd find his session goals became gloomier and gloomier in other words you could predict any time that case was going to feel not so good by noting that he had tone arm action during the session you had just run and this i tested out and i tested this out i watched it coordinated it and so forthno vast series of cases but that wasnt necessary i had considerable background on all this material now there we areperson gets ta action during session person doesnt feel so good three sessionsthey feel pretty wog ta action so we mustnt run without ta action so it became very very important to find out what was stopping ta action and there are several reasons why ta actions stop the basic reasons are still those all the reasons i have given there are very valid reasons but they fall away from the very high theoretical to the very easily applied practical aspect of it and the practical aspect of it indicated just this that an individual would release charge or an individual wouldnt release charge and thats about all it came down to now that you are gettingnow get these slight divisions herethat you are getting tone arm action does not guarantee that your pc will feel better now that is one for you there doesnt guarantee your pc is going to feel better but getting ta action guarantees that your pc is going to feel worse do you see that see so you havent got quite yes or now why the individual who gets ta action doesnt necessarily feel better is contained in restimulation and overrestimulation the individual is overrestimulatedthe restimulation is too high and yet the charge is still releasing now thats quite interesting there youve got maybe fifteen sources of charge that can be released and theyre all in restimulation and youre only running one of them so youre releasing charge off of that one let your pcs attention wander off of what you are running and you instantly have added more restimulation to the case all you have to do is be clumsy auditor at level iv auditing on the itsa line and youve had it now lets grade up auditors herelets grade up auditors just in passing i well we just leave it on accident whether the guy gets ta action or not we hope he gets ta action seeclass i we just hope he does and its not going to endanger anybody very much because the fundamental questions that theyre being asked are very unfundamental theyre being asked how they cured their lumbosis or something of the sort all right so they dont get ta action so the guy gets percentage of wins and he gets percentage of loses and we just hope the percentage of wins that the auditor gets at that level are greater than the percentage of loses and that he doesnt get discouraged about it all and so forth we just hope you understand because frankly at that level of training we cant do anything else see itslook at the amount of technical material which goes into this and you see at once that its too formidable this guy would go onhed have to go on for months or years of training before he would come up to being able to cope with that situation well its very small price to pay because the funny part of it is now with the itsa line we can take that chance very nicely and come out with great deal of percentage of wins but you recognize that the auditor at that level is taking that chance that hes going to run some sessions without ta action hes going to listen to lot of natter and hes going to listen to this and hes going to listen to that and hes going to get certain number of servicefacsimiletype cases that dont get ta action you see and hes not going to get any ta action and this isnt seriously going to put somebody in the hospital or anything like that because the process isnt that strong dont you see but its going to be the guy just doesnt really think auditing is getting him anyplace that sort of thing you know and he just feels gloomier than he would ordinarily feel and so on well whats happening with all this well we cant expect at the level of training of class i for the auditor to be able to remedy it and of course the second that you instructing auditors and so forth come back to remedy this situation you are longer operating in the zone or area of class i and you are actually trying to make class ii auditor so you see that still stays with the definition you start saying to this guythe moment you start saying to this guy hey for gods sakes read those rules man read those rules in that r1c read em youre asking this person for problems problems problems what problems have they had in life and what have they been trying to solve in life thats backwards question backwards question man of course that ta is going to stick you know well youre working on class ii see straight away see so you see the condition still remains as it is in class i which is relatively uninstructed auditor all right now we move up into class ii we get with tone arm action and the way we handle it there is actually not with the change and shift of processes beyond just altering the question bit but we get listening with tone arm action and that means that certain amount of direction of attention is going to have to be done even if its just directed by the question that is being asked what have you done about your lumbosis see now hes supposed to know the rules of what not to ask and so on and to get ta action and hes got some various ramifications there that are pretty good and he can do some things in this line but its very light attention direction dont you seevery light indeed in fact we dont even instruct him to direct attention we rather tend to instruct him not to direct attention for instance dont drop the emeter you see all right we get up to class iii and what have we got what have we got at class iii weve got direction of attention at class level iii toward service facsimiles and the state of clear now were starting to drop out this endless wandering itsa line dont you see were starting to clip this guy for letting the pcs attention wander off too far into other subject matter were supposedthat auditor at the level of iii is supposed to be able to control the pcs attention to keep the pcs attention on what the pc is supposed to be talking about we getthe limitation of attention is what enters in here see to some degree we start telling the fellow now dont let this pc start wandering around on the early track and dont do this and dont do that and keep the pcs attention centered on what youre trying to run and dont let the pcs attention wander over into his environmental restimulation and if it is there clean it up with since mid ruds see at this level were using mid ruds were knocking down environmental attention were paying lot of attention to the pcs attention at class level ii now that control of the pcs attention is at very high high you see there at iii thats pretty high now this pc is really being put in the groove this pc is supposed to talk about and b and his attention is supposed to be freed up from c and d so that he will talk about and b you get the idea in other words heres controlcontrol of attention here is getting rather heavy thats fine has to be now lets take class level iv man youre living with the lightning now youve got this pc on backtrack youve got this pc there youve got him on stuff that is quite overwhelming all he has to do is skid around inside the gpm all hes got to do is say let go back up and pick up those two early items that we missed zzzzzpand he throws forty ris into restimulation why because he had to walk through forty ris to pick it up that are only you seethat are not properly discharged all right that isnt so bad you see let repairoh i see what this item is let repair it in the earlier goal and then much to your embarrassment you have missed gpm between these two goals and he returns up to the earlier goal and throws whole gpm into restimulation consisting of some 230 items in the helatrobus eeerk look youre walking across grand canyon on wire one millimeter thick now if you see the various classes in terms of expertness of control of the pcs attention all will start to make sense to you on the subject of these classes if you only see these on the complexity of the information the auditor has auditing will not occur oh well yeah you know all about gpms and you know all about engrams you know all about processes you know all about this and you know all about that and therefore youre class iv there could be that one element missingthat one element missing control the pcs attention with expertiseand you would not have class iv auditor now you start letting pc talk you start putting in the itsa line on the backtrack haaaaaaaa ive done it myself i know exactly what im talking about because ive got good subjective reality on that sort of thing hey i just had cognition theres this and that and tho and thee and down there in that engram theres spot and bolp and booh my god bow the roof falls in you got the idea suddenly throw into restimulation fifteen or twenty chains of something see just with nice cognition there is something earlier zoom see now the auditor in that particular case wouldnt even have time to open their mouth you know pc is sitting there in brown study you think hes looking over the next ri you know pc all of sudden says i think this camei think this came fromyeah theres atheres gpm there about eighteen trillion years ago oh yeah oh yes there it is and its there and there and that fits into the other two and it comes up to here and then that is what gives you the background music of all thatuhuhuh whats the matter with my throat the auditor actually doesnt have time to say word now how does that situation take place that situation takes place when the case is already overrestimulatedgreasy on the track attention hard to control greasy on the track now if this pc is quite bearcat he will go right on getting tone arm action but very uncomfortably hell go right on getting the tone arm action necessary to resolve the case thats for sure but hes running in an atmosphere of exhaustion of worry misemotion comes up here or there in other words hes bit overwhumped all the time you see youve gotten up to the point of overrestimulation and with this overrestimulation now in progress you are still discharging things do you see case still runs but the case isnt comfortable while running case will still make it but doesnt feel like hes getting many auditing wins see awful hard grind spends most of the time between sessions in fog dont you see case still making it and tone arm running now lets add this other liability now you see that weve gone over some difficulties here now lets really clobber it lets say that this case were doing this with has fragile tone arm to begin with which is susceptible to being stuck low or stuck high or stuck dead thetan lets add that liability to all this other complexity now what do you think is going to happen well the auditor is going to spend all of his sessions worrying about the pc and the pc may or may not spend any sessions worrying about auditing or between sessions but just going around being blaaah or having bad time or being very nattery or something but the auditor is wild auditor is trying to get tone arm action trying to get tone arm action and he keeps looking he comes back into the session he finally got tone arm action in the last session oh boy finally got it he got four blowdowns of one division in the whole session oh thats fine thats more than hed seen for long time and so forth and he comes back in he got this pc halfway through gpm dont you see now all hes got to do now in the next session is pick it up and finish it and that meansyou know was getting tone arm action more tone arm action and you run some gpms you know and you get tone arm action thats obvious you know wonderful thats obvious and so forth and he comes back in and theres the tone arm what the hell well he says something must have keyed in between sessions something must have keyed in this tone arm is sitting here at about six and half something must have keyed in between sessions all right all right something keyed in between sessions all right since the last time i audited you now when was that when was the last time i audited you last time last time now whenwhen was that pc finally thinks and thinks and thinks and thinks and finally remembers tone arm action now since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed there it sits right on down through all of those buttons there it sits pc tells you all sorts of things but there it sits you say thats obvious enough to give anybody tone arm action but there it sits horrible you say well if i can just finish off the rest of this gpm now in this session if i can just finish off the rest of the gpm you say all right now lets pick it up at the last item where we left it and so forth and the pc says last item whatwhats the last item well that last item it was absolutably coughing you know and so on lets pick it up and the pc says that and then the needle doesnt twitch and nothing happens and nothing moves and you realize suddenly that if you stay there any longer this pc is liable to do an aroundtheclock and go into maybe lowtonearm case or something like that you realize that youre looking at something here which cant hold because youre getting absolutely discharge at all and you bit the silk and you get out of that and you say youre going to put in the itsa line on auditing or youre going to do prepcheck on auditing or youre going to take anything that youve had as good way you know to key off the case and so forth now in this particular case were talking about this tone arm here islet us say is gone at 575 so you say all right well just destimulate the auditing thats easy just destimulate the auditing and well get tone arm action back obviously so we say all right now on auditing on auditing when waswell how many years have you been audited or something like that or how many months has anything been suppressed and of course you get the same story as the since mid ruds there it sits at 575 tone arm action the restimulation is now too great to permit even the discharge of the keyin thats what youve run into in other words youre running this case downhill on toboggan and it all traces back to what now you see this is quite problem ive outlined to you here and i see from the looks on some of your faces that you yourselves have had something like this problem now the resolution of this problem is therefore pretty gargantuan and thats whatjust to get it all in line thats whats been resolved with service facsimile service facsimile in actual fact is not an accusative thing it is simply solution that the individual has himself so restimulated that it wont discharge and nothing will discharge past it in other words its solution that is so valuable so survival so magnificent that if one got rid of it as solution one would of course perish at oncelike wax effigy you see would just melt right there you see and be gone too horrible to contemplate getting rid of this solution actually it is simply an overcharged solution that is all it is now how does it get so overcharged well its because the pc is restimulating it it isnt being restimulated by life theres volition going on here the pc himself is keeping this thing kicked in this girl has life solved has life solved dont eat every time the boss is mean to her something like that happens well she says i dont have to eat thats the good sensible solution to the whole thing therefore really i dont really need job i really dont need anything the husband hes little bit mean nattery and upset some evening so she says she knows what to do about thishe dont eat dinner accidentally burns or something like this see and one of the children gets upset something like that well she knows what to do about thatkid just wont eat thats all thats it hes had it see and all of this is so complicated and so filled with ramifications that it actually has become survival computation and it sits there it sits there like mountain rising out of the plain or dam across river and charge can flow by it because if charge were permitted to flow by it you see the difference between our rationale and so forth is we know people do things see its not on the automatic pushbutton type mentality of pavlov you see and wundt and the rest of these birdsgents jerksfellows pushbutton mentality you see so that its always caused by some mechanical thing theres also being there hes also up to something and thats the further complication dont you see the person can do something you see now if you tell somebody that the survival computation is not to eatif you told somebody elsetheyd say youre nuts but notnot this one see that is the survival computation well naturally its aberrated but unfortunately for this being it works hubby always gets in line the kids always shut up dont you see and she can relax enough about her job or doing what shes doing so that by saying well i dont have to eat you see that actually that sort ofshe stops attacking in that zone and sphere and it actually has some weird backwards upside down survival computation see so what it is is nonsurvival solution which has become survival and it doesnt make sensenot even to the person when they begin to take it apart it really doesnt make sense but it appears to make sense it appears to make sense and that solution can become so fixed in the activities of the individual that the individual feels that if it were disturbed in any way life would become unlivable and this can be pretty batty solution you maybe are looking at service facsimile when you look at suicide type of thing the way to live is to dive off the top of the empire state building see now you say thats nutty but the funny part of it is when you run it if it werent so pathetic you would probably be able to sit there and just almost ruin your stitches because thisits wild i mean how this thing works out i mean the way the puttogether the aaa and the disassociate and so forth of this is soso fantastic and very often in the early stages of it the pc will sit there and they give it to you with such straight face and with such solution to the whole thing and well yes obviously obviously the way to cure fear of height is to fall off the empire state building or something like this you see itd be something fantastic even thats too sensible but what it is is solution which has become fixed and which the individual is actually working with and maybe theyve been overwhelmed by this solutionits explainable in bank terms toobut the individual keeps that chain or channel in restimulation and then you start to audit the engrams of this thing and all the individual sells you is bring up more engrams of this thing but oddly enough they wont erase and this was another source of search the other source of search of course was why do some engrams erase and some engrams not erase that is an old idle datumbeen kicking around for long time some engrams grind out and some discharge why some pcs turn on mass when you prepcheck them and some dontmostly dontbut some do whats with this pc who does whats with this pc who cant erase this particular engram you go over on the left and right of this engram channel and you can find engrams that will erase but the pc never gives you those they only give you the engram channel thats because theyre obsessively restimulating this particular channel in the bank theyre obsessively restimulating it because its survival to have that therefore they will sell you as the auditor that particular channel if it is service facsimile because their penchant is to keep it restimulated so they always sell you that channel and then you you knucklehead you going to run it out man why youve pickedif that person is servicefacsimile case whichnot all cases run this way fortunately unfortunately for us many cases run quite easily and smoothly without any of these complications dont you see in fact little more than half of your cases will run smoothly without these computations well that makes it bad dont you see because then youre unable to understand this other percentage of cases that doesnt run smoothly see so you say these techniques work but on some cases they dont work well therefore you have to bring the broad line of restimulation and so forth aberration is always of some use at some time or another anybodys aberration on any subject has been of some use to themalways you can trace it alwaysyou can trace it back its been of some use otherwise they wouldnt keep mocking it up but it normally doesnt amount to this fixed servicefacsimilelevel crash you see and it erases and it handles up and the guy cognites on it and it straightens up and all that sort of thing happens but on service facsimile none of these things occur the engrams dont erase the prepchecks dont work the tools of the game are suddenly null and void apparently unless you know this little secret channel down through the middle of it and that secret channel is advised by any tone arm trouble that doesnt mean that for quarter of sessionsince you always get the top of gpm almost always early on in ease youre going to find the tone arm hung up high or something like that the tone arm normally will hang up on the first fifteen twenty items of gpm and then suddenly loosen up and tone arm action restores thats on helatrobus type gpm in the first stages of hitting gpm you normally will get bit of lockup thats beside the point thats just point in the session where the thing locks up were talking about the case that gives you trouble with tone arm the ease that is dead thetan lowtonearm case hightonearm case or case whose tone arm hangs up at the drop of hat the full complete diagnosis of the case is done with the tone arm not with how loopy theyre acting in life i think anybody on this planet is acting loopy in life see if you put it up against survival standards youd find it was very nonsurvival you cannot be human and be right so theres reason at all to try to trace it back analytically or medically psychiatricallysay hes got schitzobonga or something you see theres sense in any of this this is all for the birds there isnt any reason to do it off of graph there isnt any reason to do it off of any of your tests nothing the only place youll really see this is by putting the pc on an emeter and then if the pcs tone arm looks all right running the pc awhile to see if you run into the trouble you see you could even be fooledand some of you will beby dead thetan case that merely has clear read and tight needle maybe the person isnt deadthetan case maybe theyre just sitting in the middle of bump of some kind or another thats got the needle slightly tight and you ask them one question and you practically have free needle see needles change in their characteristic this may be hard to analyze but thats the only state that is hard to analyze the low tone arm the high tone armthe second you put them on the meter the low tone arm the dead thetan definitely always servicefac case dead thetan service fac bang bang thats all this person cannot get discharge in life in the process of living he discharges aberration so living is very very aberrative thing to him see hes right up against it there theres accidental discharge of anything give him birthday present he doesnt say hey what do you know you know and his tone arm moves even though you havent got him on the meter see nothing like that ever occurs this guys tone arm is fixed all the time all the time all the time you see always fixed and as he lives he just gets unhappier and unhappier life becomes crueler and crueler and eventually he becomes newspaper reporter you know or something like that its very weird thing how many newspaper reporters ive seen whore deadthetan cases restimulation of life is too high for their level of understanding now the lowtonearm case definitely service facsimile all you have to do is put somebody on the tone arm see its got low tone arm see its hanging down below 20 herenah service facsimile thats it see diagnosis right now bang you just know high questionable but probable you can question it but its probable but you just accidentally put somebody on the tone armyou just put somebody on the meter and you find his tone arm is reading high thats enough see service fac now case down here at 35 375 something like that with fairly decent needle and so forth some possibility still exists that this is servicefacsimile case so it goes from some possibility still exists to maybemaybe not but probable on the hightonearm case lowtonearm case yes yes yes yes yes yesnothing else dead thetan case well youre lucky if you can get them to talk to you long enough to give you the service facsimile definitely servicefacsimile cases so any difficulty with this tone armany difficulty with this tone arm now im talking about tone arm difficulty im not talking about difficulty with case you know difficulty getting pc into things and difficulty getting them out of things and you can have thousand different things that could be difficult in running case well justits just difficult to run cases thats not diagnosis thats just banality oh this guy every time you let him anywhere near the backtrack why he all of sudden starts picking up things at trillionseight then theres one at trillionthirteen and then theres one at trillionssix and so forth yeah you have trouble with this guy you have trouble limiting his line getting him into something and so forth well the case is simply overrestimulated you could use this same technology and possibly hope you could find service facsimile on him to cool it down wonder why this stuff doesnt bleed off faster or why the case restimulates himself to this degreemaybe it still lies in the realm and zone of service facsimile you see possibility that it does its worth scouting worth scouting but all these troubles im talking about are troubles with the tone arm anybody whos got troublesome tone arm has given you bad time wont move enough gets stuck in these three positions with great easeno man youre looking at servicefacsimile case now what youre doing is looking at the normal river of discharge blocked up with great big high stable datumhorses sleep in beds see with this slight trimmings he knows that if he gets rid of this and if he longer believed that horses slept in bed oh cut his throat finish him the hallmark of service facsimile is that some time duringin the running out of this service facsimilesome time during its run out or between sessions youll hear about it when the pc comes back into the next session person questions the wisdom of getting rid of it i dont care if its jabbing butcher knives in their right arm he will question the wisdom of getting rid of this aberration and you might miss hearing it on some cases but it is always there sometime in the process of running it out they got up to this level now lets see if i got rid of this uhhhhohhh i dont know i dont know say his service facsimile is hitting policemen see oh i dont knowif i got rid of that man i just might be in jail all the time you look at him in amazement you know if you got rid of the service facsimile of hitting policemen you would be in jail all the time you dont treat him like that as an auditor see but youll hear some weird ones the guy is in jail all the time from hitting policemen see but if he got rid of the service facsimile of hitting policemen something would go very wrong in his life and he couldnt survive and it would be finished see its where life has been so overwhelming and he has done so much overwhelming that it actuallyit makes more sensehe has abandoned it and in lieu of any good sense he has erected this monument see and that monument is monument to total asininity the way to have good health is to smoke cigarettes you see and never take any exercise and so forth and so forth and youll hear this guy going on along in this and youll hear dissertation and it seems to be just little bit offbeat and youll wonder how on earth thiswhat this really adds up to well without precise assessment you probably could not establish exactly what it was but it might be as banal as good health the service facsimile is good health how do you have good health well the best way to have good health is eat poisonous foods and throw yourself under trucks wherever possible and so forth you see the thing is completely twisted around the other way to its an aberrated survival computation is what it is now it might better be called service computation or survival computationbut we already have this term service facsimile so we might as well stay itwith it for the present at leastbecause it isnt just one facsimile it actually isnt facsimile at all its the guy himself keeping facsimiles in restimulation because he knows whats best you see all this wild aberration inside of society which compels its citizens to do this or that youre probably looking at thirddynamic service facsimiles they get stuck on these things take the jail system which is used right now in the west the jail system is rather interesting because they know for fact and all their statistics demonstrate every single one of them demonstratesthe lotthat they increase criminality with the present prison system all the penologists know this and they adhere to it slavishly in 1835 study was conducted to find out what penal systems were in use around the worldnot to find out which was most workable but what ones were in use and they adopted the present system in philadelphia they adopted this present system of the cell and the confinement and the guard and the this and that and at the time they adopted it they knew that it did the least rehabilitation i mean the committee that did this had the data in front of them that they were doing the most they possibly could to perpetuate crime by adapting the present prison system now this prison system today is so general and it is in use so far and wide and the present court system court system is not any part of itis so wide and general and so forth that everybody thinks that is the only prison system there could be that is very far from fact there are actually hundreds of prison systems and yet they have hung themselves with the one which they found was the least rehabilitative the least workable and produced the most crime and that was done by studyby careful analytical study so you must realize that there are thirddynamic service facsimiles at work its totally nonsurvival computation to choose the worst prison system you could possibly choose and yet they set out to do so so i dont think they were studying public safety see they werent any longer studying public safety they were simply studying how to make criminals wrong so penology by 1835 had ceased to be study of how to make an honest society safe from the inroads of criminal and had begun to be just system by which to dramatize the criminal is wrong see so longer had any useful application i dont care what money theyre spending on crime today if theyd stop spending it theyd have less crime i dont care how weird and aberrated that happens to look but im just showing you here is solution stuck in the society not to go on this subject because its not horse i ride it just happens to be an interesting datum i got this out originally and was rather interested that warner brothers did one on this long time ago crime colleges thats what theyve established you want toas i asked you in an earlier lecture how is it that argot is the one thing that seems to be current slingo that goes along language that carries along and yet its the most secret language there is how is this perpetuated well its perpetuated by the state with its existing prison system so with that argot then must go all the systems of defrauding robbing murdering and wrecking the society and they have gratuitously at public expense erected these universities all over the place in which these fellows can carefully communicate to one another the very best criminal methods and this is all done at great public expense and thats service facsimile at work that solutionthe prison see stands up there right now as the primary method why the society is going criminal and yet it is supposed to be the reason why the society is not criminal see its erected to protect the public from the criminal and there it is however educating criminals perpetuating crime going forward in very businesslike way at great public expense to do the least possible rehabilitation for the criminal make him feel the most outlaw of any other system make him feel the most individuated from the society spoil his reach and therefore his sanity it makes sense to scientologist particularlyput guy in his place so he cant reach anything cant itsa anything hes naturally get case deterioration well if hes already criminal because hes crazy how about deteriorating his case well naturally hell become more of criminal wont he so all kinds of actions of this characterim not even standing up for another system frankly if you just erected big stockade someplace or another and told the fellows to go in there for while and we didnt care who they took with us wed probably you know have better system if the scientologist were to go about thisi already figured this out for the federal prisons of the united states the head of all federal prisons in the united states has required dianetics to be read by the way by all his wardens and i worked out system for him too much work for to put into effect and so never went into effect we are not without friends or connections or influence in spite of the fact that some twobit some drug addicts the federal drug addicts are after us because theyre actually not under the government theyre under the ama well thats who pays them you know people work for those who pay them dont they normally naturally they by the way recently got some legislation through i see now so that anything is mislabeled all they have to do is arrest the guy and throw him in prison without hearing i was interested in this new legislation that came through from the fda when they do something like this they get level of unpopularity that has exclamation points after it so theyre doing their best and well help them out the direction which they want to go we will help them go any day now but there is service facsimile government sets itself up stable datum foods must not have noxious products in them and this outfit is now protecting the public against good electrical equipment and certifying electricshock machines that break peoples teeth and spines and they pass these but the emeterno thats deadly its pretty grimi mean its pretty gruesome when you start to think over the level of action well now that again on thirddynamic level is service facsimile in action see somebody put up this solution that the public shouldnt have to eat noxious food products or something like this or poison should be kept out of foods that basically you see is good idea and then this idea starts going all mad and madder and madder and madder till practically the only thing thatll get certified is something that kills somebody see you get the idea well all right so they must be there simply to make somebody wrong i dont think they have anything to do with anything except making somebody wrong i dont know who theyre trying to make wrong theyre not going to make us wrong but they must have somebody they want to make wrong and were not quite sure who it is but there is you might say service facsimile well now you take any good solution to situation and then plow that solution in so that it lowerharmonics it goes through several flips stays itself you see but its lower and lower and lower on the tone scale it finally gets below all other solutions and becomes itself an aberration now it isnt true that all solutions become service facsimiles you could immediately conclude this as matter of fact i have looked at it rather wildly occasionally and said my heavens if youif any time you solve something why youre in the soup that isnt it service facsimile is solution which is insisted upon but wont itsa its solution which is insisted upon but wont itsa solution to be solution leads to further ability to itsa now if you solve something on the basis of the solution reduces the itsa or the ability to itsa then youve set up potential service facsimile this is one of the reasons why scientology would never become service facsimile in society see it increases the ability to itsa now lets look back at the fda for moment they are taking over role of classifying for and protecting the public from making up their own minds about food theyre denying the public an analytical attitude toward products and they step in there and protect the public from themselves which is to say they cut the public itsa now having reduced the public itsa very severely along level where it didnt need reduction they have then set up situation where anybody they pass is okay the public then loses the criterion of inspection the public longer does its own inspection they dont buy salinas valley lettuce because its good and avoid mexican lettuce because its bad see but the fda aberratedly because its in some wild state then goes in and passesbecause somebody slipped them quick buck or something like that slipped them mexican lettuceand says well thats okay mexican lettuce thatsthats all right thats all right seal of approvalbang its fertilized with dysentery look what happens to the public suddenly the public can be caved in by it because its opened gate which is destructive see what they are they are not then increasing familiarity with the environment they are decreasing it and leaving this area in mystery and its all set up on the irrational supposition that theyre infallible they had some nonpregnancy drug the other day and it had wild side effects and they passed it they passed it theres been several drugs of recent times that have been passed that are terribly destructive one way or the other now obviously some role exists for such an agency but every time you set up such an agency you set up potential service facsimile which will then accumulate to it great deal of evil and the next thing you know you have set up situation where nobody can live with it now you get how thats done its by reducing itsa for instance youd almost never look for travel agencies to aberrate society see you wouldnt look to travel agency as primary source of aberration in the society they could bring in little bit we had situation here in england where anybody that could buy ticket in the west indies you see could come to london and some shipping company made millions shipping everybody to london and this was looked on in some particular lines as something and then oddly and wildly enough the parliament up here was faced with the embarrassing situation suddenly of limiting the amount of immigration from one of its own coloniesvery embarrassing they managed to get over it and pass it and nobody has ever heard of it since and theyve limited immigration in that particular line but im afraid this wasnt even much of an aberration i mean thats about as close as travel agency could come you see so it doesnt mean that all these sources are perfect little randomities exist around these other sources dont you see but broadly those that directly reduce the itsathose that directly reduce the itsa and dont help or support the itsa line in any wayare most likely to become service facsimiles theyre solution without inspection which is too broadly applied this girl has survival solution she simply says families are good this is what shes made up her mind to she holds that in place she proves it to herself all the time she works day and night she sits there you can see her in brown study you know shes sitting there and so on hmm yeah yeah shell say to herself yeah proves it mother didnt say anything to this afternoon so that of course proves you see families are good see and it all works out now she doesnt have to look to find out why didnt mother speak to her all afternoon and that brings about asisness of mass theres necessity to inspect shes got it solved mother didnt speak to her all afternoon because families are good thats it she didnt have to inspect the fact that she last evening when she took the car out bent the front fender and then didnt say anything about it and didnt offer to do anything about it and put it back in the garage and mama found it at noon and cut the communication line because she already knows that its disastrous to try to talk you see so youve got situation there now that little arc break is never going to blow away is it its never going to be talked about not going to be any communication on the subject and so forth well whats preventing it from being talked about families are good that proves it you understand it gets charged up because every one of these arc breaks that contributes to it in its immediate vicinity charges it up further and the person holds it in line harder and more arc breaks pile up on it until it eventually becomes an accumulation of mass and therefore when you prepcheck somebody with service facsimile around the vicinity of this service facsimile without hitting it on you turn on mass the source of the mass is nothing has been itsad now youre prepchecking them this way since the last session has anything been suppressed lets say its auditing thats the target this is in vignette this is not real service facsimilemy auditor is good there is reason to answer this question because my auditor is good because auditors are good now the ease is in solid continuous arc break so it doesnt register on your meter since the last session has anything been invalidated you see nope auditors are good wouldnt do any good to answer the question anyway because auditors are good you see yet the case isnt thinking this consciously case isnt thinking that consciously thats just everything that you ask the case comes up against this and youmy godyoure trying to talk to this ease youre trying to get this case to talk youre trying to get this ease to do something and you do know what youre doing and yet youre going up against some kind of barrier like this in this case and then all of sudden you wheel back and you say uhhuhh im failure as an auditor youre not failure as an auditor you just didnt clip the service facsimile that made auditing impossible you see that and this is expressed by the nomotion of the tone arm action because there is itsa in that immediate vicinity theres then dismissal or discharge of the charge hanging up on it you see that now youre listening to this opinion auditors are good on somebody who never inspects an auditor or auditing theres itsa in other words the whole thing is just completely unjustified how do they know whether the auditor is good or not theyve seldom heard one theyve never looked at them see how would they know and lets get another situation im very very sure that some of you have been over the coals of being considered immature or some other way by either your mother or father or familyirresponsible see now you probably have never asked yourself this other question did they ever look at now theres lots of mothers the last time they looked at little roscoe was when he was about two and theyre still trying to advise two yearold roscoe at the age of thirty what he should do about his marriage well they dont know anything about him if you want to give somebody send that has lot of family trouble just ask them questions along that particular line and so on ask them what they have observed about their family theres good r1c probably get tone arm action out of that you see because its on the fringe of something if theyre having trouble with something and theyre liable to come up with the realization that their family has never looked at them and doesnt know them see were on noitsa situation some preconceived notion societies tend to get stuck with these things to get stuck with some idea and its very interesting that this is probably the way that society reduces its strength just as an individual reduces his strength this way i feel sorry for this society in number of ways because in certain zones and areas which the society depends upon for its control of mean vicious nasty persons and things like us these guys havent got any itsa line out do you realize whats happening if you want to look at it bluntly these guys are sitting back taking the wrong actions with regard to certain situations theyre trying to preventthrough their wrong itsa on scientologytheyre trying to prevent certain zones and spheres of activity which is to say the public must not be practiced on by an unqualified guy who doesnt happen to pay dues to us and that sort of thing all right now theyre set with certain set fixed ideas see they believe these ideas and they believe that what were doing and what we have to do with is good and its corn see and that its not any advance on anything and my god during this whole period of time were moving right straight on ahead into more mental technology and more technology about life and livingness than they ever dreamed could ever exist we have actually been effectually isolated and insulated from any further interference or from having our energies drained down by being made to comply with or agree with the mores of their particular practice lines that would have slowed us down like mad dont you see were moving forward at expresstrain velocity there isnt any faculty of any college or something like that is going to tell you or whether or not we had better research or not research some particular sphere of existence if we can put an itsa line on it we look at it it doesnt then make it bad or impolite see or something like thatthis is why we shouldnt look and were actually traveling as subject without service fac and its making fantastic velocity and here these poor sods are whose whole life is bound up in theseyou know the mustardplaster level of healing and theyre not in contest to keep their developmental line coming forward so there they sit and there we go how high can it rise before the potential suddenly explodes theyre nuts thats what it makes them look to us the potential will eventually explode in their faces in what way they suddenly wont have any patients nobody will be paying any attention to them because they have wholly authoritarian educational system that is to say they put it on tv you must see your local doctor your local doctor receives you in open arms well theyre so unreal they dont realize that that isnt the public line their word of mouthi dont care how much advertising you buy you got to have good word of mouth man you can buy newspapers full of advertising to get somebody to go see movie thats good and the theater will stay empty because their word of mouth is bad you see and the word of mouth on medicine is very bad very bad and while theyre taking fortunes away from people in the united states for not healing them and not advancing their own technical lines and not really measuring up the way they should theyre not making the effort necessary to survive why because they have service facsimile on us they dont even know theyve got it its hidden down amongst their case amongst any other batty lines i had good news story on the subject i didnt release it it might have woke them up they have to reorganize the whole of mental and physical healing before they could cope with what were doing this potentialthese poles are stretching further and further and wider and wider apart and eventually they will become nofactor thats what happens to them theyre nofactor they simply are not powerful enough or influential enough or anything else enough to do anything about it you may not think that were growing but i look back over any six months of the last ten and eleven years and frankly i hardly recognize comparable sizejust six months to the next six months this is rather fantastic thing only this is going on internationally now did you ever double penny for thirtytwo days its the old mathematical trick guy says well you neednt pay anything but one cent doubled every day for thirtytwo days and somebody says thats fine but of course at the end of thirty two daysi dont know what the figure is its either million pounds or its something like that that it has grown up to dont you see it only takes this type of curve growth going on up now therefore theyre not impeding what they should be impeding if they wanted to survive themselves theyre not handling the situation within its own zone of reality and thats all aberration is is failure to handle the situation in its own zone of reality so this then is the service that service facsimile performs it makes it unnecessary for an individual to handle the situation in its own sphere of realitymakes it unnecessary to do so so nobody ever does anything about it so mass accumulates up on it now any mass that accumulates on case any mass that accumulates by reason of prepcheck any body mass that occurs by reason of processing and so forth must to some degree or another then be batting up against service facsimile and if person cannot be knocked out on the subject of psychosomatic illness of some character or another by processing then that must be part of service facsimile those things that auditing wont change are then rooted in this other mechanism theyre solution without inspection which pulls in upon it all the uninspected mass thats all and of course mass disappears because its asised and when person does not asis the mass that is there he naturally gets an accumulation of mass and the mass that accumulates around one of these service facsimiles is rather marvelous to behold and of course its that mass accumulating which holds and prevents the prepcheck action and those are the technical mechanisms which prevent tone arm action if you dont get tone arm action its because the individual does not asis and has not asised any mass in that zone or area for long time and not having asised any when you get into its vicinity you go into it with thud if it gets anywhere close to processing getting well or handling the environment in which the individual finds himself the auditing session to this effectiveness extends out to everything the individual does during the period of time that hes being audited and every environment he finds himself in so that if any service facsimile exists which is being reacted upon in any of his environment anyplace it will to some degree influence his auditing and the more of these things exist the harder it is for you to get tone arm actionuntil it gets impossible now an individual can have service facsimile and still get tone arm actionget some tone arm action and it would be better in some eases to make sure that the service facsimiles are out of the way before plunging backtrack the amount of time that you could save in processing is very large factor ive just made restudy of this and ive been brushing off clear left and right and saying good goodyou know i mean and so on keyedout clear and i recently found out that you can stabilize theres possibility here of stabilizing clear by the eradication of the things that will key in so you see if you knock out number of service facsimiles out of an individual why the case then stays stable to the degree that it doesnt still have service facsimiles now r3sc is an extremely workable process i have written it up its been released of course one can expect certain refinements of process of this particular character but this is peculiarly complete because we accidentally already had couple of types of assessment that you could do for this we have the old 212 assessment and we have the r3r assessment preliminary step theyre perfectly adequate dont you see there are slippier assessments that you can do and im sure well have some fancier assessments on it one way or the other but these happen to be adequate assessments and youll find that the mere inspection of folder from beginning to end will give you bunch of candidates just inspect the folder just start turning over things and looking at auditors notes and mentions of this and that and what the individual has had bingbang runs on of one character or anotherwhether they gave tone arm action or not you see but look particularly for periods of tone arm action and then go back before those periods and find out what was being addressed on the case and youll probably have servicefacsimile combo sitting right there and just use it in your ordinary steps of r3sc you get an idea lets take periodwe found period here the individual was audited for an intensive and toward the last half of the intensive got tone arm action we notice this from the old old old old auditors reports see we find out that on wednesday form was addressed by the auditor and that was the end of tone arm action we notice that there may have been two subjects there that could have been addressed well run them both dont be chichi see now you can run almost anything with r3sc which is what makes it very good just dont overrun it and if the pc says and he cant give it answers and so forth come off of it dont shove it down his throat with those ramifications then it doesnt much matter what you pick to be the service facsimile but if you do slippy assessment which is preliminarystep assessment its bingo assessment right deadonand something like thatboy you get action man youll get action but if you pick almost anything else you will also get some action so its not criticalthe assessment is not terribly critical of course the faster you get what is really the service facsimile on the case then the faster your tone arm action restores and the case reverts to battery so theres lot of ramifications to this sort of thing but in the final analysis is here is process fullbloom which totally replaces your r212 type processesmakes them utterly unnecessaryand takes care of this thing we call rock slammer and takes care of body mass and lot of other things in cases that weve been particularly worried about and particularly takes care of the auditors main worry which is how do i get tone arm action on this pc obviously if he cant get tone arm action on the pc the pc is sitting in service facsimile i mean thats the end product of that now you may have to run two or three or four service facsimiles but by that time youre going to clear so you might as well go ahead and clear the guy throw it all out of restimulation make the case sit there with freeflop needle and so forth and say all right i cleared you let the guy enjoy it let him enjoy it for day or an afternoon or something like that before you reach for the earlier gpm all right now thats r3sc and i hopedi noticeddo you notice that its tabulated 3 i want to make short note on that its the tabulation of 3 is because actually it is 3 processbeing clearing process we rehabilitate scientology levels against the existing scale and that means that your r3n and so forth will be called r4n its reorientation but im not going to reuse their letters when theyre moved up to 4 and there arent any other r4s so theyre very easy to recognize and they wont get you tangled up in any way and then well be able to throw these clearing techniques in straight where they belong and there are few of them there so we want them tabulated were getting our house in order and its making very good sense the way its going together that means that theres quite few cases around here will have to be cleared before they go on to ot im sorry but thats the way it is thank you
