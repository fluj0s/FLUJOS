discussion of the ada see crs report 98921 the americans with disabilities act ada statutory language and recent issues by nancy lee jones other federal statutes concerning the civil rights of individuals with disabilities also have interpreted issues relating to individuals with contagious diseases in manner similar to the ada see school board of nassau county v arline 480 us 273 1987

of the air carrier access act by anna henning 4 see bragdon v abbott 524 us 624 1998 the issues involving the definition of disability have been among the most controversial under the ada the ada was recently amended to expand the interpretation of the definition of disability see crs report rl34691 the ada amendments act pl 110325 by nancy lee jones 5 see david l heymann control of communic able diseases manual 18th ed an official report of the american public health association 2004 6 42 usc 12113bstatutory language and legislative history the americans with disabilities act often described as the most sweeping nondiscrimination legislation since the civ il rights act of 1964 provides protections against discrimination for i ndividuals with disabilities3 the threshold issue when discussing the applicability of the ada is wh ether the individual in question is person with disability generally individuals with serious contagious diseases would most likely be considered individuals with disabilities4 however this does not mean that an individual with serious contagious disease would have to be hired or given access to place of public accommodation if such an action w ould place other individuals at significant risk such determinations are highly fact specific and the differences between the contagious diseases disc ussed by the courts eg hi v infection tuberculosis and hepatitis and potential pandemic flu may give rise to differing conclusions each contagious disease has specifi c patterns of transmission that affect the magnitude and duration of potential threat to others5 title i of the ada which prohibits empl oyment discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities specifically states that the term qualifications standards may include require ment that an individual sha ll not pose direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace6 in addition the secretary of health and human services hhs is require d to publish and update list of infectioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22219crs3 7 42 usc 12113d this provision was added in an amendment by senator hatch after long debate over the chapman amendment which wa s not enacted the chapman amendment would have allowed employers in businesses involved in food handling to exclude individuals with specific contagious diseases such as hiv infection see 136 cong rec 10911 1990 8 42 usc 121823 9 42 usc 121312 10 28 cfr part 35 appx 11 srept 101116 101st cong 1st sess reprinted in vol i committee print serial 102a legislative history

communicable diseases that may be transmitted through handling the food supply7 similarly title iii which prohibits discr imination in public accommodations and services operated by private entities states nothing in this title shall require an entity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods services facilities privileges advantages and accommodations of such entity where such individual poses direct threat to the health or safety of others the term direct threat means significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by modification of policies practices or procedures or by the pr ovision of auxiliary aids or services8 although title ii which prohibits discrimination by state and local government services does not contain such specific language it does require an indivi dual to be qua lified and this is defined in part as meeting the essen tial eligibility requireme nts of the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities9 this language has been found by the department of justice to require the same interpretation of direct threat as in title iii10 contagious diseases were di scussed in the adas legisl ative history the senate report noted that the qualifica tion standards permitte d with regard to employment under title i may include requirement that an individual with currently contagious disease or infection shall not pose direct threat to the health or safety of ot her individuals in the workplace and cited to school board of nassau county v arline 480 us 273 287 note 16 1987 supreme court deci sion concerning contagious diseases and section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 197311 similarly the house report of the committee on education and labor reite rated the reference to arline and added thus the term direct threat is meant to connote the full standard set forth in the arline decision12 supreme cour t decisions school board of nassau county v arline section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 29 usc 794 in part prohibits discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with disability in any program or activity that receives federal financial assistance many of the concepts used in th ada originated in section 504 its regulations and judicial interpretations the legislative history of the ada as discussed above specifically c ited to the supreme courts interpretation of section 504 in arline which held that person with active tuberculosis was an individual with ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22219crs4 13 480 us 273 287 footnote 16 1987 14 id at

referenced in the ada s legislative history states in relevant part that person who poses significant risk of communi cating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualif ied for his or her job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk13 the court in arline examined the standards to be us ed to determine if an individual with contagious disease is otherwise qualified in most cases the court observed an individualized inquiry is necessary in order to protect individuals with disabilities from deprivation based on prejudice stereotypes or unfounded fear while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of grantees as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks14 the court adopted the test enunciated by the american medical association ama amicus brief nd held that the factors which must be considered include findings of facts ba sed on reasonable medical judgments given the state of medical knowledge about the nature of the risk how the disease is transmitted b the duration of the risk how long is the carrier infectious c the severity of the risk what is the potential rm to third parties and d the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm15 the court also emphasized that courts normally should fer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health officials and that courts must consider whether the employer could reasonably accommodate the employee16 arline was remanded for c onsideration of the facts using this standard and the district cour t held that since the teacher had had negative cultures and the possibility of infection was extremely rare the school board must reinstate her or pay her salary until retirement eligibility17 bragdon v abbott the supreme court in bragdon v abbott 18 addressed the ada definition of individual with disa bility and held that the respondents asymptomatic hiv infection was physical impairment impacting on the major life activity of reproduction thus rendering the hiv infection disability under the ada the court also addressed the questi on of what is direct threat finding that the adas direct threat language codified the courts decision in arline in bragdon the plaintiff an individual with asymptomatic hiv infection sought dental treatme nt from the defendant and was told that she would be treated only in hospital not in the office the plaintiff ms abbott filed an ada complain t and prevailed at the distri ct court court of appeals and the supreme court on the issue of whether she was an individual with disability but the case was remanded for further consideration regarding the issue of direct threat the supreme court provided some guidance regarding the direct threat issue in bragdon stating that the existence or nonexi stence of significant risk must be determined from the standpoint of th person who refuses the treatment orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22219crs5 19 abbott v

4th cir 1999 cert denied 528 us 813 1999 where the fourth circuit held that excluding child who has hiv from karate classes did not continuedaccommodation and the risk assessment must be based on medical or other objective evidence dr bragdon had the duty to asse ss the risk of infection based on the objective scientific informati on available to him and others in his profession his belief that significant risk existed even if ma intained in good faith would not relieve him from liability on remand for consideration of the direct threat issue the first circuit court of appeals held that summary judgme nt was warranted finding that dr bragdons evidence was too speculative or too tangential to create genuine issue of fact19 chevron usa inc v echazabal both arline and bragdon dealt with the issue of whether an individual was direct threat to others in chevron usa inc v echazabal 20 the supreme court dealt with the issue of whether an individual was threat to himself and held unanimously that the ada does not require an employer to hire an individual with disability if the job in question would endanger that individuals health the adas statutory language provides for fense to an allegati on of discrimination that qualification standard is job relate d and consistent with business necessity21 the act also allows an employer to impose as qualification standard that the individual shall not pose direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace22 but does not discuss threat to the individual s health or safety the ninth circuit in echazabal had determined that an employer vi olated the ada by refusing to hire an applicant with serious liver condition whose illness would be aggravated through exposure to the chemicals in the workplace23 the supreme court rejected the ninth circuit decision and upheld regulation by th eeoc that allows an employer to assert direct threat defense to an allegation of employment discrimination where the threat is posed only to the health or safety of the individual making the allegation24 justice souter found that the eeoc regulations were not the kind of workplace paternalism that the ada seeks to outlaw the eeoc was certain ly acting within the reasonable zone when it saw difference between rejecting workplace paternalism and ignoring specific and documented risks to the employee himself even if the employee would take his chances for the sake of getting job the court empha sized that direct th reat defense must be based on medical judgment that uses the most current medical knowledge lower court decisions the lower courts have dealt with num ber of direct threat cases under the ada although comprehensive survey of these cases is beyond the scope of this report they have involved number of ty pes of disabilities as well as varying occupations and accommodations the disabilities at issue have often involved aids or hiv infection25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22219crs6 25 continued
