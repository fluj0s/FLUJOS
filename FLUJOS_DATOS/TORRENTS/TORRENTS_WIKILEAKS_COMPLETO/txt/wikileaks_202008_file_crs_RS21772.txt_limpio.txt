foreign relations committee held hearing on this bill on march 25 2004 another bill amending agoa hr 3572 was introduced in the house on november 21 2003 background the african growth and opportunity act after two decades of economic stagnation and decline some african countries began to show signs of renewed economic growth in the early 1990s this growth was generally due to better global economic conditions and improved economic management however growth in africa was also threatened by new factors such as hivaids and congressional research service the library of congress crs2 high foreign debt levels the african growth and opportunity act agoa pl 106 200 title i was enacted to encourage trade as way to further economic growth in sub saharan africa and to help integrate the region into the world economy agoa provided trade preferences and other benefits to countries that were making progress in economic legal and human rights reforms currently 37 of the 48 subsaharan african countries are eligible for benefits under agoa agoa expands dutyfree and quotafree access to the united states as provided under the us generalized system of preferences gsp1 gsp grants preferential access into the united states for approximately 4600 products agoa extends preferential access to about 2000 additional products by removing certain product eligibility restrictions of gsp and extends the expiration date of the preferences for beneficiary african countries from 2006 to 2015 other than articles expressly stipulated only articles that are determined by the united states as not importsensitive in the context of imports from agoa beneficiaries are eligible for dutyfree access under agoa beyond trade preferences agoa directs the president to provide technical assistance and trade capacity support to agoa beneficiary countries various us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21772 government agencies carry out traderelated technical assistance in subsaharan africa the us agency for international development funds three regional trade hubs located in ghana kenya and botswana that provide trade technical assistance such assistance includes support for improving african governments trade policy and business development strategies capacity to participate in trade agreement negotiations compliance with wto policies and with us phytosanitary regulations and strategies for further benefiting from agoa agoa also provides for duty and quotafree entry into the united states of certain apparel articles benefit not extended to other gsp countries this has stimulated job growth and investment in certain countries such as lesotho and kenya and has the potential to similarly boost the economies of other countries such as namibia and ghana in order to qualify for this provision of agoa however beneficiary countries must develop usapproved visa system to prevent illegal transshipments of the 37 agoa eligible countries 24 are qualified for dutyfree apparel trade wearingapparel qualified these countries may also benefit from lesser developed country ldc status countries that have ldc status for the purpose of agoa and are wearingapparel qualified may obtain fabric and yarn for apparel production from outside the agoa region as long as the apparel is assembled within the ldc country they may export it dutyfree to the united states some ldc agoa beneficiaries have used this provision to jumpstart their apparel industries this provision was due to expire on september 30 2004 the agoa acceleration act extends the ldc provision to september 30 2007 with reduction in the cap on the allowable percentage of total us apparel imports beginning in october 2006 countries that are not designated as ldcs but are wearing apparel qualified must use only fabric and yarn from agoaeligible countries or from the united states the only wearing apparel qualified nonldc countries is south africa although mauritius only qualifies for ldc status under agoa for one year ending 1 the generalized system of preferences is program offering trade preferences to less developed countries including those from subsaharan africa see crs report 97389 generalized system of preferences by william h cooper crs3 september 30 2005 per the miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act of 2003 pl 108429 agoa was first amended in the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 which doubled preexisting cap set on allowable dutyfree apparel imports the cap was only doubled for apparel imports that meet nonldc rules of origin apparel imports produced with foreign fabric were still subject to the original cap the amendment also clarified certain apparel rules of origin granted ldc status to namibia and botswana for the purposes of agoa and provided that us workers displaced by production shifts due to agoa could be eligible for trade adjustment assistance three years of agoa successes and challenges us dutyfree imports under agoa excluding gsp increased dramatically in 2003 by about 58 from 836 billion in 2002 to 1319 billion in 2003 after more modest increase of about 10 in 20022 however 70 of these imports consisted of energyrelated products from nigeria excluding nigeria us imports under agoa increased 30 in 2003 to 384 billion up from 295 billion in 2002 the increase in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21772 agoa imports since the laws enactment is impressive but it must be viewed in the broader context of africas declining share of us trade over many years agoa has done little to slow or reverse this trend the growth in agoa trade can be explained by greater number of alreadytraded goods receiving duty free treatment under agoa one industry has grown substantially under agoa the textile and apparel industry much of the growth in textile and apparel imports has come from the newly emerging apparel industries in lesotho kenya and swaziland apart from the apparent success of the emergent apparel industries in some african countries the potential benefits from agoa have been slowly realized there has been little export diversification with the exception of few countries whose governments have actively promoted diversification agricultural products are promising area for african export growth but african producers have faced difficulties in meeting us regulatory and market standards many countries have been slow to utilize agoa at all others such as mali rwanda and senegal have implemented agoarelated projects but have made insignificant gains thus far in addition to lack of market access there are substantial obstacles to increased export growth in africa key impediments include insufficient domestic markets lack of investment capital and poor transportation and power infrastructures other significant challenges include low levels of health and education protectionist trade policies in africa and the high cost of doing business in africa due to corruption and inefficient government regulation furthermore the apparel industry in africa now faces challenge in the dismantled multifibre arrangement quota regime which ended as of january 1 2005 as result africa must now compete more directly with asian apparel producers for the us market agoa beneficiaries retain their dutyfree advantage but they have lost their more significant quotafree advantage apparel producers have reportedly already left lesotho with loss of 7000 jobs3 this makes export diversification in africa all the more vital 2 see us international trade commission dataweb at httpdatawebusitcgov 3 lesotho new trade regime threatens economy allafricacom january 14 2005 crs4 key provisions in agoa iii agoa iii extends the preference program to 2015 from its previous 2008 deadline agoa iii supporters claimed that many agoa beneficiaries had only recently begun to realize gains as result of agoa and that extending agoa benefits would improve the stability of the investment climate in africa agoa iii also provides for apparel rules of origin and product eligibility benefits it extends the thirdcountry fabric rule for ldcs and encourages foreign investment and the development of agriculture and physical infrastructures extension of lesser developed country provision one of the more controversial aspects of agoa iii was the extension of the ldc provision if the ldc provision had not been extended ldcs would longer have dutyfree access to the united states for apparel made from thirdcountry fabric after september 30 2004 supporters of the extension claimed that if the ldc provision was not extended the apparel industry may have contracted significantly causing loss of many of the gains from agoa as apparel assembly plants were shut down this might have occurred because all agoa beneficiaries would need to source their fabric and yarn from within httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21772 the agoa region or from the united states in order to get dutyfree access under agoa and the regional supply of fabric and yarn would likely be insufficient to meet the demand4 sourcing materials from the united states would not be viable option because it would entail greater costs some analysts argued for the ldc provision to be extended to allow more time to develop textile milling industry to support the needs of the apparel industry in africa and to prevent the collapse of the emerging apparel industry opponents of extending the ldc provision claimed that the expiration of the ldc provision would provide an incentive for further textile milling investments in africa they argued that the ldc provision has slowed fabric and yarn production investment in africa because these materials could be imported cheaply from asia for use in agoa eligible apparel with need for costly investments they feared that an extension of the ldc provision would provide disincentive to textile milling investment in africa because the deadline would lose its credibility as investors anticipated further extensions however supporters of the extension argued that investment in the textile industry would continue because of its inherent profitability despite the availability of thirdcountry fabric others worried that looser rules of origin under the ldc provision might allow companies to use africa as transshipment point between asia and the united states the outlook for the development of textile industry in subsaharan africa is clouded by the phaseout of the multifibre arrangement mfa quota regime in january 20055 now that quotas have been eliminated africa will be competing more directly with asia for the us apparel and textile market though they remain eligible for tariff preferences apparel plants are particularly sensitive to price conditions as they do not require large capital investments and can easily and rapidly be shifted to areas outside africa textile plants are more capitalintensive and more costly to move and are 4 impact of agoa extending ldc fabric import privileges beyond 2004 zambia trade and investment enhancement project supported by usaid march 2003 5 for further coverage of the phaseout of the mfa quota regime see crs report rs20889 textile and apparel quota phaseout some economic implications by bernard gelb crs5 therefore likely to remain in africa in the longterm thus it is argued that the promotion of vertical integration between apparel textile and cotton producers is necessary to keep apparel plants in africa along with the jobs they provide vertical integration is challenging prospect regardless of the ldc provision extension some investment in textile milling has occurred in africa but investors have found it difficult to consistently source high quality cotton in large volumes while there is agreement that vertical integration is the key to thriving african textile and apparel industry the question is how to facilitate this process6 agricultural products the growth of agricultural trade holds potential for improved economic growth in africa most africans rely on agricultural production for their income it is estimated that 62 of the labor force in africa works in agriculture and in the poorer countries that portion is as high as 927 by exporting to the us market african agricultural producers could receive higher prices for their goods in order for this to occur the united states may need to further open its market to african agricultural products and provide technical assistance to help african agricultural producers meet the high standards of the us market httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21772 agoa iii seeks to improve african agricultural market access to the united states by providing assistance to african countries to enable them to meet us technical agricultural standards african agricultural producers have previously faced difficulties in meeting these standards the agoa acceleration act calls for the placement of 20 fulltime personnel to at least 10 countries in africa to provide this assistance some observers are skeptical about the effectiveness of technical assistance without increased market access others are concerned that us technical assistance is hindered by laws restricting agricultural technical assistance to products that would compete with us farm products however technical assistance proponents point to the low institutional capacity in africa as the main obstacle to african exportled development they feel that us provided technical assistance can be an important factor in improving africas agricultural development and export performance 6 joop voest background information on effects of extending and not extending the september 2004 deadline for less developed agoa qualified countries to be able to
