science and industry division jeanne j grimmett legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33752softwood lumber imports from canada issues and events summary us lumber producers have long raised concerns about softwood imports from canada they argue that canada subsidiz its lumber producers with low provincial stumpage fees for the right to harvest trees in canada the provinces own 90 of the timberlands which contrasts with the united states where 42 of timberlands are publicly owned and where government timber is often sold competitively these differences in land tenure make comparisons difficult us producers also argue that canadian log export restrictions subsid ize producers by preventing others from getting access to canadian timber us log exports from federal and state lands are also restricted but logs are exported from us private lands finally us producers argue that they have been injured by imports of canadian lumber they point to the growth in canadian exports and market share from less than 3 billion board feet bbf and 7 of the us market in 1952 to more than 18 bbf per year and market share of more than 33 since the late 1990s canadians counter these arguments asserting that their stumpage fees are based on markets that the wto prohibits treating export restrictions as subsidies and that the us industry has been unable to satisfy the growth in us lumber demand for homebuilding and other uses the united states initiated investigations of canadian subsidies prerequisite for establishing count ervailing duties cvds in 1982 1986 and 1991 subsidy findings led to 15 canadi an tax on lumber exports in 1986 and 651 cvd in 1992 canada challenged the cvd which was revoked in 1994 1996 softwood lumber agreement restrict ed

december 30 1986 the day before the final doc subsidy determination was to be issued the united states and canada signed memorandum of understanding mou with canada imposing 15 tax on lumber exported

subsidies and injury annual canadian lumber im ports have risen from less than 3 billion board feet bbf about 7 of the us market in the early 1950s to more than 18 bbf more than third of the us market since the late 1990s us lumber producers argue that subsidies to canadian producers give them an unfair advantage in supplying the us market and that this has injured us producers these two issues subsidies and injury are the basis in us trade law for determining whether cvd is warranted in addition critical circumstances which allow for retroactive duties are deemed to exist if imports rise significantly after ending import restrictions finally dumping selling imports at less than th cost of their production can lead to additional duties subsidies canadian stumpage fees the us lumber industry has argued th at the stumpage fees charged by the canadian provinces are less than the mark et price of the timber would be and are therefore subsidy to canadian producers about 90 of the timberlands in the 10 provinces are owned by the provinces th provinces require management plans for forested areas and allocate the timber harvests through variety of agreements or leases often for five or more years with renewal options stumpage fees for the timber are determined administratively often with adjustments to reflect changes in market prices for lumber this contrasts with the us situation where 42 of the forests are publicly owned and where public timber is typically sold in competitive auctions thus much of the timber in the ited states is sold by public and private landowners at market prices10 the use of administered fees in canada opens the possibility that the canadian system results in transfers to the private sector at less than their fair market value as the us lumber industry has charged however comparisons of us and canadian stumpa ge fees are often disputed because of differences in measurement systems and the imprecision of converting canadian cubic meters of logs to us board feet of lumber differences in the diameter height quality and species mix of us and canadian forests differences in management responsibilities imposed on timber buyers eg road constructi on reforestation differences in environmental conditi ons and policies and other factors subsidies export restrictions in its 1992 cvd investigation the doc id entified

logs sold domestically most economists would consider restrictions that reduce domestic prices below the world market price to be subsidies and the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt generally prohibits export restrictions the doc affirmed its earlier position on the countervailability of export restrain ts in implementing the uruguay round agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures scm12 canada later challenged this approach in world trade organization dispute settlement proceeding arguing that treating export restraints in this way violated the scm
