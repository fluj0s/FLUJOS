interpretation its meaning should be taken from the following sources in order of precedence 1 this manual 2 the insurance act 1973 and publications by the australian prudential regulation authority apra 3 aasb 1023 general insurance contracts 4 other australian accounting standards 1987 act the workers compensation act 1987 accounting standard has the same meaning as it has in section 9 of the corporations act 2001 auditor the registered company auditor appointed by the scheme agent under the deed with the nominal insurer to oversee and audit the books records and systems of the scheme agent current month the month that the current financial reporting returns relate to deposit premiums the amount to be paid by policy holder who is entitled to pay their premium by instalments to enable them to have the ability to pay premiums by instalments the amount varies depending upon the instalment method chosen by the employer and is normally set out in deposit instalment notice or invitation to renew deposit premiums can in the case of those employers selecting to pay their premiums monthly cover several physical payments deposit premium forms part of premium income and is separately disclosed on the income statement direct debit an employer may provide to scheme agent permission to directly debit their bank account for the payment of premium instalments refer banking services operational instruction for details of the nominal insurers requirements for these arrangements direct debits are only to be included in financial reports once funds are received from the bank to the scheme agents wcif bank account not when request is made to bank to process direct debit request net earned premium premium earned relating to workers compensation risks covered during the financial year due to the automatic renewal of policies risks are covered even if policy is yet to be written refer also unearned premium provision 11example if policy provided coverage from 15 june 2009 and the employer has not advised that they wish to can cel the policy by 15 june 2009 the scheme agent is required to assume that the policy will be renewed as it is unlikely that the employer will provide wages estimate before the scheme agents 30 june accounts are finalised the scheme agent is to ensur that an appropriate amount 15365 of last years premium is included in earned premium for the 200809 financial year financial year period of twelve months from 1 july to the next 30 june financial year will include transactions that relate t number of policy renewal years prys hindsight or final premium adjustments the hindsight or final premium is the extra or return premium calculated at the end of the insured period after the submission of the actual wages and where applicable claims experience it is the difference between the initial premium calculation at the commencement of the insured period and the premium calculation at the end of the insured period based on the actual wages and claims experience if applicable the hi ndsight or final premium forms part of premium income and must be included in the premium information submitted to the corporate data repository for the same month in which it is processed instalment premium notices advice issued to those employers entit led to pay premium by instalments of the amount payable and the due dates these

of insurance that have been issued or renewed so as to commence during this period are classified as belonging to that premium year for example policy renewed on 30 september 2008 will form part of the 2008 premium year new policy commencing on 31 march 2009 will also form part of the 2008 premium year 12a financial year will have transactions covering number of premium years for example in the 200809 financial year an employer may pay the deposit premium and instalments for the 2008 premium year hindsight premium for the 2007 premium year and an adjusted premium for the 2005 and 2006 premium years as result of wage audit of the employer showing additional wages to be included premiums receivable premium income that remains unpaid at the end of the period premiums receivable are to

the remainder of the policy term as it relates to future periods of risk covered by the policy this provision is to be calculated using the 365ths method from the date of inception after gst charged has been excluded from gross premium income all policies where the scheme agent is on risk are to be included irrespective if the policy is yet to be written 13movements in the level of unearned premium are to be charged against the movem ent in unearned premium provision in the revenue return example 1 policy provides coverage for the period 15 june 2009 to 15 june 2010 the policy was written on 1 september 2009 for 12000 and had hindsight adjustment of 200 increasing the writt premium from 11200 to 11400 as at the time of preparing the 30 june 2009 accounts the best estimate that the scheme agent has of the premium it has earned from 15 june 2009 to 30 june 2009 is the written premium in the prior financial year 112 00 the amount of unearned premium for the policy is 460 1120036515 where 15 represents the number of days from 15 june 2009 to 30 june 2009 example 2 policy provides coverage for the period 21 november 2008 to 21 november 2009 the emplo yer elects to pay instalments quarterly and pays the deposit instalment of 4000 on 19 december 2008 being one quarter of last years premium the employer submits their estimated wages for 200809 on 21 january 2009 at 31 december 2008 the amount of earned premium for the policy is 1753 1600036540 where 16000 is last years premium for the policy and 40 represents the number of days from 21 november to 31 december written premium the total of all notices issued including dust diseases levy and mine safety levy written premium is normally determined once the employer provides the wage estimate for the current year or if this not received by the due date in accordance with the prior years wages plus the gazetted uplift factor this nables an initial premium for the year to be determined at the end of the period of insurance the employer provides an actual wages paid declaration this information together with claims experience if applicable is used to determine the actual premiu m payable for the year the actual premium is compared to the initial premium and can result in refund return premium or additionalextra premium being payable this revised amount is normally referred to as hindsight adjustment written premium is included in the financial returns in the month that the forms provided by employer are received or the transaction in the case where wages declaration is not received is processed written premium is not to be accrued written premium is required to be reconciled to information submitted monthly to the corporate data repository year to date ytd the period from the

underwriting credits if only part of an underwriting credit is allocated to an existing debt or refunded then that part which is not allocated is considered to be unallocated an underwriting credit

directly to bad debts expense writing off debt through the provision for doubtful debts is not to occur the provision for doubtful debts is to be reviewed monthl so that it reflects the anticipated collectability of debts at the end of the period in accordance with accounting standards only an individual provision for doubtful debts is to be created general provision is not to be made the accounting entr to write off bad debt should be raised against the original receivable category for example if the original entry raised premium receivable or late payment fee the write off should be raised against premium receivable where as if the write off rel ates to recoveries it is to be written off against recoveries receivable gst on bad debts written off should be included in the scheme agents bas return in the same month that any part of the debt is written off the amount of gst written off and recla imed from the ato is to be determined on pro rata basis relative to the components of the debt outstanding for example if the debt outstanding is 1000 with 770 being premium and the remaining 230 late payment fees that are not subject to gst t hen the amount of gst able to be reclaimed from the ato in the bas return if the full debt is written off is 70 77011 if 75 of the debt is being written off as the liquidator advises that return of 25 cents in the dollar is likely then the amount of gst that can be recovered from the ato is 75 of 70 or 5250 2 recovery of bad debts bad debt recovered can relate to former premium debt or other amounts formerly receivable for example claims excess or late payment fees where bad debt is re covered any gst relating to that former debt is to be determined on prorate basis and be included in the bas return in the month in which the cash was received when debt previously written off as bad is recovered full assessment should be undertaken of the ability of other amounts formerly owing by that employer to be repaid amounts viewed as recoverable should be raised as debtor with the related revenue recognised as income the gst impacts of re establishing the debt including forwarding gst t the ato also need to be considered 54appendix two agein g premium debts example employer entitled to pay by instalments employer selects 4 instalment payment option policy details policy period 30608 30609 date premium

4th instalment 3000 pay ment due date 30409 one quarter of last years premium two quarters of written premium less deposit premium one quarter of written premium as at 31 august as the premium deposit was paid on time within one month after commencement of policy period the employer is able to continue to pay by instalments debts are currently due the 2nd 3rd and 4th statutory instalment totalling 9750 would be classified future premium instalments not yet due as at 31 october if the second instalment had been paid on time the third and fourth statutory instalments would be classified as not yet due if instead the second instalment of 3750 had not been paid it would still be classified as future premium instalments not yet due as the 7 d ay grace period had not expired similarly the third and fourth statutory instalments of 6000 in total would also be classified future premium instalments not yet due as at 30 november if the second instalment was paid within the 7 day grace p eriod then the third and fourth instalments would be classified as premium instalments not yet due if the second instalment was still not paid the employer has lost the right to instalments by not paying the second instalment on time after allowing for the 7 day grace period the difference between the written premium and the deposit premium which was paid on time would now be classified as overdue less than 31 days as at 31 december if the employer had paid 5000 as part payment during decemb er then 4750 written premium less deposit instalment paid less the part payment plus late payment fees would be shown as overdue 31 to 60 days 55 appendix three directors declaration engagement of auditors auditors report additional ear end reporting requirements and audit managemen t letter the

to recover funds arises as opposed to cash basis when the funds are received when determining if right to recover exists reference should be made to the workcover nsw claims estimation manual chapter d that requires recovery to be recognised when staff member of the scheme agent with the appropriate expertise and experience in relation to recoveries considers that the right to recover is clearly apparen t sustainable at law soundly anticipated for recovery to be recognised in the financial statements it is not necessary for the party who the funds are to be recovered from to admit liability 2 estimation of recoveries the amount that is to be estima ted as recoverable is matter of judgement for the scheme agent based on the facts of each individual matter for recoveries relating to contribution by other parties to the cost of claims under section 151z of the 1987 act recovery estimates in most circumstances are expected to be based on the amount of recoverable payments made andor the notional value of the recovery as per s151z of the 1987 act the percentage expected to be recovered based on issues such as liability causation etc scheme gents are required to review recovery estimates on regular basis and adjust their estimate of the amount recoverable where appropriate movements in the estimate are to be made against the applicable recoveries income item 3 provision for doubtful debts provision for doubtful debts is to be established on recovery byrecovery basis as opposed to general provision specific recovery can only be considered doubtful when the entity that owes the monies to the scheme agent is unable to pay the reco very debt this will generally only be consideration when recovering from parties that are not insurance companies disputes between the scheme agent and the target entity for the recovery as to liability or quantum of the recovery are not to be includ ed in determining the level of the provision for doubtful debts rather they are to be taken into account in adjusting the estimated amount of the recovery to level that is regarded as collectable 654 ageing of recovery debts recovery debts are only to b aged once letter of demand or invoice has been issued to the responsible party prior to this they are to be shown as amounts not yet due on the debtors statement 5 bad debts bad debt can only arise where the entity that the funds are to be recovere d from is unable to pay its debts for recoveries under section 151z this is not expected to be significant issue as most target entities are other insurance companies 6 gst on recoveries workcover in conjunction with its advisors is assessing what g st applies to recoveries including the increasing adjustment that may arise to the scheme agent further advice will be provided on this matter
