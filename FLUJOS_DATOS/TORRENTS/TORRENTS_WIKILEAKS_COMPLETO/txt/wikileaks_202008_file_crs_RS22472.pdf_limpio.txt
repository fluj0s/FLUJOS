considerations into its decisions when the governing statute makes mention of them3 background in 1999 some 20 nonprofit groups petiti oned epa to regulate emissions of greenhouse gasses ghgs specifically co2 methane nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons from new motor vehicles the petition cited the agencys alleged mandatory duty to do so under caa section 202a14 which directs the epa administrator to prescribe emission standards for any air pollutant from new motor vehicles which in his judgment causes or contributes to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare petitioners argued that the ghgs above are air pollutants within the meaning of the caa citing the epa general counsels opinion to that effect from 1998 in addition they contended epa already has made findings that ghgs from moto r vehicles may reas onably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare standard th at does not require complete certainty further the caas definition of welfare includes effects on weather and climate5 thus they concluded epa not only may but must regulate ghg emissions from new motor vehicles under section 202a1 in 2003 after receiving almost 50000 comments epa denied the petition6 much of its rationale followed new epa general counsel opi nion issued the same day reversing the 1998 general counsel opinion by denying that ghgs are air pollutants under the caa in support of noncoverage the new opinion made arguments drawing on both the caa and other sources as fo r caabased arguments the new opinion points out that although three provisions in the 1990 caa amendments expressly touch on global warming none of them authorizes re gulation instead they seek to learn more about the problem moreover the caa contai ns

rather than leaving such issues to the general regulatory structure in the caa as for arguments based outside the caa the new opinion contends that various congressional enactments from 1978 to 1990

global warming was warranted also the conclusion of th 1998 general counsel memorandum that ghgs are air pollutants under the caa was rendere d prior to key supreme court decision in 2000 that decision fda v brown williamson tobacco corp 7 held that when congress makes facially broad grants of authority to agencies they must be interpreted in light of the statutes purpose structure nd history this decision suggests argued the new opinion that the caa should not be read to delegate an authority of such profound economic significance as the power to address global warming in so cryptic fashion as caa section 202 beyond the above issues of caa author ity epa disagreed as matter of bush administration policy with the mandatorystandards approach urged by petitioners not surprisingly epa in rejecting the pe tition endorsed president bush nonregulatory approach to global warming the court of appeals decision epas denial of the section 202 petition in 2003 was challenged in the dc circuit by twelve states ca ct il ma nj nm ny or ri vt wa three cities new york baltimore and wash ington dc two us territories american samoa and northern mariana islands nd

massachusetts v epa in july 2005 split panel rejected the challenge9 the two judges supporting rejection however did so for different reasons judge randolph author of the lead opinion bypassed the standing issue and assumed arguendo that epa has caa authority to regu late ghg emissions he then proceeded to resolve whether epa properly exercised its discretion in choosing not to wield that authority as to this discretion issue r ecall that caa section 202 a1 directs the epa administrator to prescribe standards for any motor vehicle emissions that in his judgment 10 cause harmful air pollution judge ra ndolph read in his judgment broadly to allow epa consideration of not only sci entific uncertainty about the effects of ghgs but also policy considerations that justifie d not regulating thus epa in his view was entitled to rely as it did on such factors as the existence of efforts to promote fuel cell and hybrid vehicles and the fact that new mo tor vehicles are but one of many sources of ghg emissions making regula tion of vehicle ghg emissions an inefficient piecemeal approach to global warming he concluded that epa had properly exercised its 202a1 discretion in denying the petition for rulemaking httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22472crs4 11 415 f3d at 62 emphasis added by judge 12 433 f3d 66 dc 2005 13 see note 1 supra 14 second brief in opposition largely supplementing the united states brief was filed by the states intervening on the side of epa 15 see note 2 supra by contrast judge sentelle the other j udge supporting rejection of the petition did not shy away from the standing question finding that petitioners had not suffered the requisite injury required for standing he endorsed rejec tion of the petition finally judge tatel in dissent asserted that at least one petitioner had standing massachusetts he said had shown the possibility of harm from globalwarmingcaused rising sea levels on the merits he held first that epa has authority under section 202a1 to regulate ghg emissions ting the sections coverage of any air pollutant11 second he concluded that epas 202a1 discretion does not extend to policy considerations as judge randolph hel d but relates exclusively to whether the emissions cause harmful air pollution that being so he concl uded that epa had not presented lawful explanation of its decisi on not to regulate nd would have remanded the petition denial to the agency judge tatel joined by judge rogers also dissented from the courts later rejection 43 of the petitioners request for rehearing banc12 on june 26

the questions presented by the case and epas version of the questions pres ented in its brief in opposition14 the standing issue standing is ubiquitous threshold issue in global warming litigation given the difficulty faced by plain tiffs in showing that their specific injuries were caused by the particular actions of the defendants in the case commonwealth of massachusetts fits the mold petitioners epa argu cannot establish two of the three elements of article iii standing causation and redressab ility15 as to causation epa describes petitioners declara tions as saying only that ghgs emitted from many different sources all over the world cause global warming however it points out to have standing petitioners must assert that the subject ma tter of this case emissions of ghgs from new motor vehicles in the us causes or meaningfully contributes to their injuries as to redressability epa argues that petitioners declarations do not establish that mere reduction in the specified ghgs will be suffici ent to eliminate or reduce the injury they will suffer the petitioners do not include standing among the questions presented and thus do not address

court get past th standing issue the opening question on the merits goes to epa author ity did congress in section 202a1 empower epa to regulate new motor vehicle emissi ons based on their gl obal warming effects petitioners argue that the caa text could hardly be plainer secti on 202a1 they note requires epa to promulgate emission sta ndards for any air pollutant that causes endangerment and the caa definition of ai r pollutant as any physical or chemical substance that enters the am bient air surely includes ghgs16 finally there is nothing special petitioners assert about the kind of harm ghgs produce that places them beyond the caa since section 202a1 is triggere d by endangerment of welfare term defined by the act to include effects on climate17 the epa general counsel memorandums effort to avoid this obvi ous textual mandate on the basis of fda v brown williamson tobacco corp 18 petitioners say misreads that decision in response epa notes that the authority question was not addre ssed by the majority judges below nor by any other court and that the supreme court rarely addresses an issue without the benefit of wer court explication thus th agency contends the court should resolve this case on either standing gr ounds or the in his judgment issue below if the court reaches the authority question epa maintains brown williamson counsels that the caa be read as whole and doing so shows that the act does not confer authority on epa to regulate emissions for the purpose of reducing global warming the in his judgmentpoli cy considerations issue this question asks whether as judge randolph found below epa may decline to issue the emission standards here for policy reasons not enumerated in caa secti on 202a1 petitioners of course argue to the contrary the in his judgment phrase in 202a1 they say refers only to the epa administrators judgment whether public health or welfare may reasonably be anticipated to be endangered by the pollution not to the many other consid erations many of policy nature that epa cited in rejecting the petition to th agency section 202a1s narrow focus is made all the more clear argue petitioners by the contrast with other provisions in section 202 that do mention f actors other than ndangerment of public health or welfare by allowing epa to import into section 202 a1 policy factors not mentioned there argue petitioners the appeal s court has sanctioned largescale shift of power from congress to the agency19 in response epas brief st ressed one particular reason the agency had cited for rejecting the rulemaking petition the assertedly uncertain state of the scientific record on global warming and epas desire to have the be nefit of ongoing resear ch surely epas brief argues the in his judgment phrase in section 202a1 allows epa to consider those factors in deciding whether to make an endangerment finding epa also points out the particular deference that courts owe agen cies as to their decisions whether to grant rulemaking petitions the federal brief however contains little discussion of the several policy factors on which the epa general counsel memorandum and judge randolph relied and that arguably is the nub of the issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22472crs6 the dc circuits decision in commonwealth of massachusetts was an unusual one for the supreme court to accept given that few of the factors that have traditionally interested the court in hearing case are present there is split in the circuits and the decision has little precedent value in that rationale commande d the support of majority of the dc circuit judges to be sure however cases presenting issues of unusual importance as commonwealth of massachusetts assuredly does are more likely to be accepted given that the court has accepted the case the three issues above suggest some ways the court could rule first it could find that the petitioners lack standing environmental interests and standing doctrine have long had tumult uous relationship in the supreme court and the nature of global warming exacer bates the difficulties as in the acid rain and toxicexposure cases of decades ago globa l warming is said to be caused by multiple actors millions of ghg emitters around the globe whose actions possibly combined with natural phenomena intermix in complex ways to cause adverse effects after very long time linking particular cause and particular effect in this context may be quite difficult certainly justice scalia the leader of the courts efforts to narrow standing in series of 1990s decisions would be inclined to rule against the commonwealth of massachusetts petitioners on standing grounds alte rnatively the supreme court might use the case to clarify when court may as judge randolph did bypass its general edict that jurisdictional issues such as standing be addressed first in order to decide the case on an easy merits issue if the standing hurdle is surmounted petiti oners case still could fall on either of the statutory issues raised in the briefs whether any air pollutant includes emissions regulated on the basis of th eir global warming effects nd whether in his judgment allows epa considerations of factors other than those going to whether the pollutant endangers public health or welfare in addition there is an issue sometimes raised in administrative law cases whether the epa administrator has mandatory duty to issue the judgment that triggers section 202a 1 regulation once he comes into possession of data allowing him to make it because this issue has not been raised by the parties one suspects the supreme court will not address it in sum there are multiple ways the court could resolve commonwealth of massachusetts or remand to the dc circuit for that court to resolve it is highly unlikely that the litigation will result in direct judicial order to epa to regulate newmotor vehicle ghg emissions at most if petitione rs win one or anot her court will require additional determinations by the agency should regulation of motorvehicle ghg emissions be the ultimate result however it would increase the pressure on epa to regulate the ghg emissions of stationary sources powerplants and factories as well decision by the supreme cour t is expected by june 2007
