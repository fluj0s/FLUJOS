in article i section 5 clause 2 of the constitution wh ich states in part each house may determine the rules of its proceedings puni sh its members for disorderly behaviour and with the concurrence of two thirds expel member through the years disorderly behavior has become synonym ous with improper conduct such as support of rebellion disloyalty co rruption and financial wrong doing particularly for personal gain however only within the past 40 years has c ongress systematically undertaken selfdiscip line related to conduct the constitution in article i section 6 clause 1 also provides they members of congress shall in all cases except treason felony and breach of the peace be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses and in going to and returnin g from the same according to the constitution annotated this clause does not apply to service of processin criminal cases nor does it apply to arrest in any criminal case the phras treason felony or breach of the peace is interpreted to withdraw all criminal offenses from the operation of the privilege1 footnotes omitted in other words members of congress are not exempt from prosecution while in office for violations of federal or state criminal law this report traces the evolution of enfo rcement of congressi onal rules of conduct against members by the house and senate it also traces the evolution of the house and senate ethics committees and desc ribes some of the recent changes implemented or proposed in congressional enforcement of rules of conduct the report does not deal with changes to federal or state criminal law or with criminal prosecutions of members of congress2 creation of the ethics committees the house and senate did not begin to c onsistently exercise

1964 and the house committee on standards of official conduct in 1967 ther were continuing mechanisms for congressional selfdiscipline when allegations of misc onduct were investigated the investigation was ofte n conducted by an ad hoc or select committee created for that purpose sometimes allegations were considered by th house or senate without prior committee action publicity and the test of reelection were considered the major forms of redress for allegedly unethical behavior in congress3 according to senate historian richard baker for nearly two centuries simple and informal code of behavior existed preva iling norms of general decency served as the chief determinants of proper legislative conduct4 baker further asserted that for most of its history congress has chosen to deal on casebycase basis only with the most obvious acts of wrongdoing those clearly inconsistent with the trust and duty of member5 two books published in the early 1950s cr iticized the failure of congress to investigate alleged misconduc t by members or to take disciplinary action when allegations were proven true6 congress was accused in these books of avoiding responsibility by leaving the remedies for wrongdoing in the hands of the electorate the authors cited public distrust of public officials and blamed members of congress who they said never requested an investigation of colleagues alleged misconduct the opposing view was argued by representative sam rayburn house speaker 19401947 19491953 and 19551961 who espoused the dominant view in congress at that time the ethics of member should be judged not by his peers but by the voters7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30764crs3 8 robert s getz congressional ethics the conflict of interest issue princeton nj van nostrand co 1966 p 113 9

ongressional adherence to unwritten norms of conduct visÃ vis its reluctance fo r selfdiscipline he credited the combination of historical precedent the fear of partisan motivations and the requirement of functioning in an atmosphere of mutu respect and cooperation as creating the view through the mid1960s that congress was not the forum before which the membership should be disciplined8 through the years perceptions of wr ongdoing or conflicts of interest by members of congress have changed what might be viewed today as blatant impropriety could have been an accepted norm or simply ignored years ago for example when daniel webster was ch air of the senate finance committee 1833 1837 he was also on the payroll of the bank of the united states however very few colleagues criticized him for that or for his practice of going from the senate to the supreme court which was then housed in the capitol to argue cases in which he had legislative or financial interest according to senate historian baker webster made effort to keep his business ties secret9 senator robert kerr of oklahoma 19491963 gas and oil millionaire was blunt about the correspondence of his interests and those of his constituents he was reported to have said that these constituents would not send anyone to washington who had community of interest with them since that person wouldnt be worth nickel10 in the mid1940s concerns were first heard in the contemporary era over the lack of specific standards of conduct and requirements for public financial disclosure in any of the three branches of government11 there was also criticism of some members of congress for supplementing their salaries with outside income12 in 1946 during the 79th congress senator wayne morse of oregon introduced sres 306 the first public financial disclosure gislation his resolu tion which would have applied to senators was predicated on the caesarswife principle that members behavior should be above suspicion13 senator morse continued to introduce hi s measure into the 1960s expanding it to include all three branches of govern ment and gaining suppor t from senators

is ongoing communication between the board and the house committee on standard s of official conduct the oce can recommend to the committee that it issue subpoena later in the process if necessary107 the house has already delegated subpoena authority to the committee on standards other arguments against the need for subpoena power for oce the threat of subpoena from the house committee on standards of official conduct later in the pro cess is likely to compel witness to cooperate earlie r in the process108 failure to cooperate with the oc will carry str ong consequences for members and staff such as possible referral of their case to the house committee on standards of fficial conduct for charges of false statements perjury and obstruction of justice 109 the oce is not intended to replace the house standards of official conduct committee it is designed to help move cases forward in the house ethics process110 the justice department often begins inquiries into public corruption without the use of subpoenas and the oce could work in much the same way111 the resolution of past ethics cases has been achieved without the use of subpoenas112 even without subpoena power the creation of the oce would be significant improvement to the house ethics process113httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30764crs24 113 continued pp 6 30 114 this opinion was posted on the website of democracy 21

been debated intermitten tly according to press accounts some groups advocate that such filing should not require the involve ment of member of congress121 currently in the house individuals outside congress may file complaint with the standards committee only if member of the house certifies in writing that the information submitted is in good faith and warrants c onsideration by the committee there are similar restrictions in the senate in 1997 the house ethics reform ta sk force created during the 105th congress considered changing the then limited procedures fo r nonmembers to file ethics complaints and reported by opening up the procedures for submitting information offered as complaint it will engender greater public confidence in the process and ameliorate the perception that the standards process is designed to insulate house members from legitimate allegations of misconduct from outsiders122 the task force recommended system of direct filing by nonmembers of the house who could satisfy personal knowledge test123 ultimately the house rejected this recommendation because of concern of frivolous complaints by outside groups and worries that each memb er will be subject to complaints filed for political purposes124 instead the house adopted th current rule requiring all nonmembers filing complain t to have house member sponsor the complaint125 indeed one of the most oftenheard arguments against the practice is the potential for flood of complaints some frivolous there has been documentation to support this conclusion ba sed on the experience of the senate and the limited prior experience of the house although congressional ethics cases have mostly originated in the two ethics committees b ecause of public pressure information provided to the

force was concerned with the possibility of frivolous complaints and designed the oce to dispose of such allegations efficiently it did not however specify its reasons for not providing process to

the creation of the two congressional ethics committees there have been periodic evaluations of the committees work occurring both inside and outside of congress what may have seemed acceptable enforcement of congressional conduct rules in one period of time s not necessarily been viewed this way at other times thus the episodic debate continues over whether members of congress are doing good job in follo wing the mandate of the constitution for selfdiscipline moreover congressional ethics enfor cement has often been linked to an evolving appearance ofimpropriety test127 as well as to changing perceptions of what constitutes conflict of interest128 what ethicist michael josephson wrote some 16 years ago seems still relevant today the core concept of this ethical consciousness is the demand that public servants perceive and avoid both actu and apparent wrongdoing it is defense that an act is legal or that there is actual impropriety it is enough that the conduct creates an inference of wrongdoing in the mind of reasonable observer more than ever the public dema nds that its elected officials avoid both actual and apparent wrongdoing while more standards of conduct for all government officials have been enacte d to increase public confidence each new law creates new offense129httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30764crs27 129 continued p 36evaluations often coincide with or fo llow periods when numerous or notorious ethics questions involving members arise many members experts and the public then seek to define evolving standards and create new enforcement mechanisms sometimes the house or senate or both chambers act sometimes they do not act and sometimes they act only after period of prolonged discussion or delay nonetheless over the past 40 years cong ress has developed more ela borate ethical standards and more stringent means of selfdiscipline
