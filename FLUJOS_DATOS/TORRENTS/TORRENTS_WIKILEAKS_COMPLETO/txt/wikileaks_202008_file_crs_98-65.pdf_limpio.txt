provide that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religi on or prohibiting the free exercise thereof prior to the past two decades the supreme court frequen tly construed these clauses to create in thomas jeffersons oftquoted metaphor wall of separation between church and state however ma ny of the courts decisions precipitated substantial public discontent and spawned organized effort s to overturn or otherwise alter its decisions particularly since ronald reagan was elected to the presidency in 1980 those efforts have been increasingly successful that election has proven to be critical turning point because president reagan and his successor president bush were able to replace more than half of the justices on the supreme court during their terms president reagan elevated justice rehnquist to chief justice and appointed justices oconnor s calia and kennedy while president bush appointed justices souter and thomas not all of these appointees have fulfilled the expectations of the presidents who appointed them but they have led to vigorous debates on the court about the meaning of the religion clauses and to churchstate jurisprudence that increasingly loosens the constitutional constraints on governme nt action that affects religion during the past two decades the court has been willing forum for the debate over the proper relationship between govern ment and religion from the fall of 1980 to the present the court has handed down 59 decisions on issues of church and state more than in any previous comparable pe riod in many of its decisions the court has been sharply split but the changes in the courts composition have had demonstrable effect the court has subs tantially narrowed the scope of the free exercise clause as constraint on government action and it has begun to recast its establishment clause jurisprudence as well on both clauses the courts interpretations are now giving government greater discretion than formerly to take actions that affect religious practices and institutions both positively and negatively nonetheless the court remains sharply di vided on the interpreta tion and application of the religion clauses and the outcome of particular cases is often unpredictable in sum the period since 1980 has been profoundly important time for the law of church and state in the supreme court the arguments both on and off the court about the proper relationship of governme nt and religion have been spirited and extensive and the court has issued dozens of rulings on specific issues this report summarizes the doctrinal debates and shifts on the religion clauses that have occurred on the court during this period it summari zes and examines as well the legal effect of all of the decisions the

january 1 1802 to the baptist association of danbury connecticut president jefferson stated as follows believing with you that religion is matter which lies solely between man and his god that he owes account to none othe r for his faith or his worship that the legislative powers of the government re ach actions only and not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence th at act of the whole american people which declared that their legislat ure should make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting th free exercise thereof thus building wall of separation between church and state quoted in everson v board of education 330 us 1 16 1947 the courts modern interpretation of the re ligion clauses generally dates from the time it incorporated them into the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and held them applicable to the states cantwell v connecticut 310 us 296 1940 free exercise clause and everson v board of education supra establishment clause during the previous 150 years of the nations existence the court rarely had occasion to apply and interpret the religion clauses to the actions of the national government but once it held them applicable to the states issues aros with increasing frequency and led to the development of an extensive churchstate jurisprudence by the court 2 in 1981 president reagan first proposed constitutional amendment on

shall make law re specting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof in its mode rn jurisprudence beginning in the 1940s the supreme court frequently construed these clauses to create in thomas jeffersons words wall of sepa ration between church and state1 but many of the courts decisions particularly with respect to prayer and other religious activities in the public schools were controversial and they of ten led to concerted political efforts to change the court s churchstate jurisprudence prior to 1980 those efforts were unavailin g and separationist perspective continued to dominate the courts interpretation of the religion clauses but that began to change with the election of rona ld reagan to the presidency in 1980 his election was fueled in part by opposition to the courts churchstate decisions and in response he not only became the fi rst president to propose constitutional amendment to overturn some of th courts churchstate decisions2 but alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs2 2 continued sjres 199 and hjres 493 97th cong 1st sess 1981 in 1984 the senate judiciary committee reported modified version of that amendment sjres 73 and the

united states was party fourteen as an amicus curiae and in all of them the government argued for less constrictive interpretation of the religion clauses th solicitors general under president clinton continued this effort as they filed briefs in three of the seven churchstate cases that the court decided from 19932001 they too urged th court in every instance to uphold the governments action as constitutional and in two of the cases they urged the court to do so by overturning some of its prior establishm ent clause decisions the solicitor general in the current bush administration so far has interven ed as an amicus curiae in one of the three churchstate cases accepted for review by the court and in that case he not only filed brief but also sought and gained permission to pa rticipate in the oral argument again the administrations position favored loosened in terpretation of the establishment clause see zelman v simmonsharris 122 sct 2460 2002 upholding school voucher program against establishment clause objectionsappointed public officials who vigorously and publicly challenged the courts jurisprudence3 he also oversaw energetic efforts by his solicitors general to argue for loosened interpretation of the religion clauses in cases before the court both when the government was party and as amicus curiae when it was not4 but to greater and more longlasting effect the election of president reagan and his successor president bush opened the door to the possibility of changing the courts churchstate jurisprudence by means of the exercise of the presidential powers of article ii section 2 of the constitution to nominate and appoint judges of the supreme court presidents reagan and bush replaced more than half of the court during their twelve years in office chief justice burger 1985 and jus tices stewart 1980 powell 1986 br ennan 1990 and marshall 1991 ll retired from the court during this period in their stead president r eagan elevated justice rehnquist to chief justice and appointed justices oconnor scalia and kennedy and president bushhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs3 5 see eg lee v weisman 505 us 577 1992 in which the court reaffirmed its prior school prayer decisions and held that the tablishment clause forbids public secondary school from including prayers by clergyman in its commencement ceremony the decision was 54 with justices oconnor kennedy and souter all appointed by presidents reagan and bush joining justices blackmun and stevens in the majority indeed justice souter appears to have beco one of the leading separationists on the court and justice oconnor has often been swing vote on churchstate issues 6 it might be noted that president clintons appointees have also not always fulfilled the expectations that separationist advocates might have had of them see eg city of boerne v flores 521 us 407 1997 which held the religious freedom restoration act unconstitutional justice ginsburg was part of the majority and mitchell v helms 530 us 793 2000 which upheld as constitutional the loan of instructional materials and equipment to sectarian schools justice breyer was part of the majority nonetheless they often join with justices stevens and souter in the expression of separationist views 7 this total obviously is selective in some re spects it includes all decisions involving the establishment or free exercise clauses all decisions concerning religious discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 selected decisions involving religious speech but decided under the free speech clau and selected decisions involving the taxation of religious entities it does not in clude dismissals of appeals from state court decisions or summary affirmances by an equally divided court see the appendix for listing of the pertinent cases and for breakdown of how the justices voted on each caseappointed justices souter and thomas these changes led to increasingly public criticism on the court of its prior churchstate jurisprudence and to very sharp splits among the justices on new cases that came before it it quickly became clear that chief justice rehnquist and justices sca lia and thomas staunchly favored greater government discretion with respect to religion and that justices oconnor and kennedy although not as pred ictable often decided cases from similar perspective although some of these appointees did not entirely fulfil the expectations of the presidents who appointed them5 they did precipitate vi gorous debates about the meaning of the religion clauses and did fuel the increasing dominance on the court of what are deemed conservative construc tions of the law president clinton appointed justices ginsburg and breyer to the supreme court in 1993 and 1994 respectively to replace retiring justices white and blackmun but while these justices generally favor sepa rationist constructions of the religion clauses their appointments did not reestablish c onsistent separati onist majority6 during this time the supreme court has been willing even eager forum for disputes over the proper relationship between government and religion from the fall of 1980 to the present the court has handed down 59 decisions7 in cases raising churchstate issues more than in any prior comparable time period its decisions have involved such familiar issues as re ligious activities in the public schools and direct public aid to sectarian schools but the court has also addressed such relatively unexplored matters as the constitu tionality of th public display of religious symbols legislative prayer indirect aid to sectarian sc hools government regulation of minority religious practices the accomm odation and protection of religion and the taxation and regulation of religious entities as noted the court has been sharply split in many of these decisions nearly third of the courts church state decisions since 1981 have been by margin of 54httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs4 8 these statistics are based on the annual compilations published in the november harvard law revie w and for the 2001 term in 71 united states law week 3102 july 23

decisions have been by 54 margins 288 percent these figures should not be taken too literally several of the churchstate cases and presumably of the others as well involved more than one issue and thus more than one vote by the justices but they are indicative of the sharp divisi on on the court in this area of the law 9 employment division oregon department of human res ources v smith 494 us

the narrowest of margins the changes in the courts composition have d demonstrable effect the court has dramatically altered its interpretation of the free exercise clause by generally replacing the strict scrutiny standard it formerly employed with the more lenient standard of formal neutrality9 with respect to the establishment clause the courts actions have not been quite so sweeping but it has in its most recent decisions overturned several prior rulings that were separationist in nature10 and on issues which it had not previously addressed substantia l portion of the courts establishment clause decisions since 1980 can be described as accommodationist in nature under both clauses the court s created wider constitutional space for government action affecting religious institutions and religious practices in sum the period since 1980 has been time of sustained ferment on the court about the law of church and state that ferment has produced spirited and extensive arguments about the meaning of the religi on clauses of the first amendment and the proper relationship of government and re ligion as well as plethora of specific rulings this report provides an overview of that ferment and of the changes in the courts churchstate jurispr udence it examines the doc trinal shifts and debates on the free exercise and establishment of re ligion clauses that have occurred on the court since ronald reagans election to the presidency in 1980 it summarizes and examines as well the legal effect of each of the 59 decisions the supreme court has handed down

religion the rise and fall of the strict scrutiny standard from sherbertyoderthomas to smith prior to the past decade most of the political furor over the cour ts modern churchstate jurisprudence stemmed from its decisions concerning re ligion in the public schools public aid to sectarian sc hools and the display of religious symbols in public pl aces all of which are essentially establishment clau or free speech issues but with little public attention the court has also wres tled with the question of how broadly to interpret the free exercise clause from construction of the clause in 1963 that gave special protection to religious practic the court by 1990 had moved to construction that allows government substantial discretion to regulate and even prohibit religiously motivated actions over century ago the court made clear that the free exercise clause protects religious beliefs absolutely from governmental interference11 the difficult question has been whether and the extent to which the clause also protects religiously motivated conduct or action from governmental interference in number of decisions concerning th mormon practice of polygamy at the end of the nineteenth century the court answered that question by ruling that the free exercise clause provided protection whatsoever for conduct compelled or motivated by religious beliefs12 but that interpretation gradually changed and in the two decades immediately preceding the 1980s the court settled on broad view of the scope of the free exercise clause in two seminal decisions sherbert v verner13 and wisconsin v yoder14 the court held that religious interests are to be considered of paramount importance in the constitutional scheme and that government actions infringing those interests are to be viewed as highly suspect in sherbert the court held that state c ould not consistent with the free exercise clause deny unemployment comp ensation benefits to person who was fired because she refused to work on her sa bbath the denial of benefits the court said pressured the claimant to forego her religious practice and thus could be justified only if it served some compellin g state interest standard it found thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs6 15 id at 220 16 450 us 707 1981 17 denial of unemployment benefits would not have precluded thomas from practicing his religion but only made it more expensive to do so but the court found this indirect burden to be substantial where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by religious faith or where it denies such benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs burden upon religion exists while the compulsion may be indirect the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial thomas 450 us at 71718state to be unable to meet similarly in yoder the court held the free exercise clause to mandate an exemption for the old or der amish from wisconsins compulsory education laws those laws required ll children to attend school until the age of sixteen but the amish believed that ttendance beyond the eighth grade would expose their children to worldl influences dangerous to their salvation in holding for the amish the court said that there are areas of conduct protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment and thus beyond the power of the state to control even under regulati ons of general applicability15 in these two cases in other words the c ourt held that govern ment action alleged to interfere with religious practices could be constitutional only if it were shown to serve some compelling public interest and to be more restrictive of religious practices than necessary government acti on burdening religious exercise in short was deemed to be subject to constitutional standard of strict scrutiny but in the decade after 1980 the court dram atically altered th is construction of the free exercise clause two decisions decade apart encapsulated that process in the first decision in 1981 thomas v review board indiana employment security commission 16 the court strongly reaffirmed th broad and sweeping construction it had given the free exercise clause in sherbert and yoder in thomas as in sherbert it held the clause to require state to grant unemployment compensation benefits to an individual who interpreted the bible to forbid him from accepting work on an armaments production line and who as consequence quit his job the court did so even though thomass scriptural in terpretation was pe rsonal one and was not shared by the religious community to wh ich he belonged the jehovahs witnesses and even though denial of benefits w ould have only indirec tly burdened his ability to practice his religion17 thomas thus made crystal clear that governmental actions infringing religiously motivated conduct are to be reviewed by the courts under standard of strict scrutiny the state may justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing that it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compe lling state interest however it is still true that the essence of all that has been said and written on the subject is thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs7 18 id at 718 quoting wisconsin v yoder 406 us 205 215 1972 19 494 us 872 1990 20 the case had been before the court two years previously but at that time the oregon supreme court had not ruled on whether the stat criminal drug statute applied to the sacramental use of peyote or if it did whether that application was compatible with the oregon constitution or the free exercise clau consequently the supreme court had remanded the case back to the oregon supreme court for consideration of those issues see employment division depart ment of human resources v smith 483 us 660 1988 vacating and remanding 301 or 209 721 p2d 445 1986 in that reconsideration the oregon supreme court held the states controlle d substance statute to apply to those who used peyote in religious ceremonies but held th free exercise clause to immunize such use from prosecution see smith v employment division department of human resources 307 or 68 763 p2d 146 1988only those interests of the highest order can overbalance claims to the free exercise of religion18 the decision in thomas was 81 with only thenjustice rehnquist dissenting but in decision in 1990 the court resurrected its 19th century interpretation of the free exercise clause in employment division oregon department of human resources v smith 19 the court held the free exercise clause to provide protection whatever for individuals who used peyote in the religious ceremonies of the native american church technically the issue in the case was identical to that in thomas the eligibility for unemployment benefits of two individuals who were unemployed because they had been fired fro m their jobs as drug counselors after it was discovered that they were using peyote in the religious ceremonies of their church but the determinative questions in the case were whether the sacramental use of peyote was illegal under oregons controlled s ubstances law and if so whether the free exercise cl ause nonetheless required an exemption from the law for such religious use the oregon s upreme court construed the states law criminalizing drug use and possession to apply to the sacramental use of peyote and in smith the us supreme court held the free exercise clause not to compel an exemption20 consequently the court held oregons denial of unemployment benefits to be constitutional in the context of the nations war agains t drugs that holding was not in itself entirely surprising and it could have been reconciled with the courts prior free exercise jurisprudence what was unexpected was that on the way to this conclusion majority of the court largely abandoned the strict scrutiny test established in sherbert yoder and thomas as the standard for free exercise cases the court said the compelling public interest test was simply inapplicab to the circumstances of this case moreover justice scalia wrote for the majority the free exercise clause never relieves an individual of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral law of general applicability the right of free exercise does not re lieve an

on the merits justice oconnor joined chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia kennedy white and stevens in ruling the two indians ineligible for unemployment benefits but she did so on the grounds oregon had compelling interest in regulating the use of drugs and she dissented vigorously fro m their disavowal of the strict scrutiny testthe law proscribes or prescribes c onduct that his religion

private right to ignore generally applicable laws22 religious minorities he said need to seek protection for their practices in the political process not the courts the fact that the political process will place at relative disadvantage those religious pr actices that are not widely engaged in he stated is simply an unavoidable conseque nce of democratic government23 the margin was 54 with the majority formed by the lone dissenter in thomas chief justice rehnquist two new appointees to the court justices scalia and kennedy and two who had been in the majority in thomas justices white and stevens24 the court did not abandon strict scrutiny tirely justice scalias articulation of the new standard of formal neutrality retained strict scru tiny for cases involving government programs allowi ng individualized assessment of claims for exemption such as state unemployment compensation programs the area in which the strict scrutiny test was first applied in the free exercise area in addition his opinion said strict scrutiny was still appropriate for governmental actions that discriminate against religion or deliberately impos special burdens on religion finally justice scalia suggested that hybrid claims ie those involving free exercise claim coupled with another constitutional interest such as freedom of speech or parental rights might also be constitutionally entitled to some degree of exemption from neutral generally applicable laws but his opini on left it decidedly unc lear whether strict scrutiny would apply to such cases and in any event clearly abandoned strict scrutiny for all nonhybrid cases other than those i nvolving religious claims for exemption in programs allowing individua lized assessment and deliberate governmental targeting of religion the four dissenters sharply criticized the majoritys constriction of the strict scrutiny test justice oconnor asserted that justice scalias view dramatically departs from wellsettled first amendment ju risprudence is incompatible with our nations fundamental commitment to individual religious liberty and relegates serious first amendment value to the barest level of minimum scrutiny religious

exercise of religion may stand only if the law in general and the states refusal to allow religious exemption in particular are justified by compelling interest that cannot be served by less restrictive means in short in smith the court stepped back from th separationist standard it had articulated in sherbert yoder and thomas and reinterpreted the free exercise clause to mean that in most circumstances an individual possesses constitutional right not to comply with valid and neutra l law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes25 b harbingers of smith this demise of the strict scrutiny test for most free exercise cases and the possible subordinati on of religiously motivated conduct to the will of political majorities although unexpected in smith had in fact been foreshadowed throughout the decade in eight free exercise decisions between thomas and smith the court had demonstrated incr easing discontent with the strict scrutiny test in free exercise cases four of those decisions nominally employed the test but the court held the government to have met its requirements in the four other decisions the court simply held strict scrutiny to be inapplicable in particular contexts in united states v lee 26 decided within year of thomas the court unanimously held the free exercise clause not to exempt an amish employer from paying the employers portion of social s ecurity taxes the court noted that the religious beliefs of the amish specifi cally oppose support for public system of social insurance but it held an amish employer not to be entitled to an exemption because it said mandatory par ticipation is indispensable to the fiscal vitality of the social security system27 the following term in bob jones university v united states28 the court upheld irs imposition of racial nondiscrimin ation condition on the tax exemption accorded private college notwithstanding th colleges claim that its discriminatory practices were mandated by religious belief on the free exercise claim the court applied strict scrutiny but simply asserted in conclusory fashion that the government has fundame ntal overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education and that its interest substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on petitioners exerci of their religious beliefs the courts decision on the free exercise issue was again unanimous29httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs10 29 continued impose racial

members of the church of scientology for payments made for auditing and training services the members claimed that these services were central to the practice of their faith and that the payments made for them were fixed dona tions entitled to be treated as charitable contributions under the internal revenue c ode but the court denied the claim 5 231 the court said that it doubted that th disallowance of the deduction placed any substantial burden on the scientologists practice of their religion but that even if it did the disallowance was justified by the compelling governmental interest in maintaining uniform tax system free of myriad exceptions flowing from wide variety of religious beliefs32 finally in jimmy swaggart ministries v board of equalization33 in 1990 the court unanimously upheld the imposition of general sales and use tax on religious organizations sale of religious materials nominally using the strict scrutiny test the court found the imposition of the taxes to vi olate religious precept of the religious organization and to impose burden on relig ious organizations different from that imposed on other sellers although the taxes reduced the amount of money the religious organization had to spend on its religious activities the court held that burden to be not constitutionally significant these four decisions preserved the form if not the substance of strict scrutiny four other decisions eschewed even the form in goldman v weinberger34 the court upheld military dress code against the free exercise claim of jewish psychologist who felt religiously obligated to wear yarmulke while on duty an air force regulation mandating uniform dress and barring the wearing of headgear while indoors had been construed to bar yarmulkes the court held the sherbertyoder thomas test to be inapplicable in the milita ry context and as consequence found the free exercise clause to require exception for religious apparel the military the court said is speci alized society separate fro m civilian society and thus our review of military regulations cha llenged on first amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society courts it asserted must give great deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of particular

effort to dictate the conduct of the governments inte rnal procedures and demand that the government join in the indians chosen religious practices 43 the claimants ability to believe express and exercise his religion th court held was simply not impaired by the governments administra tive use of social security number finally the court held strict scrutiny analysis to be inapplicable with respect to the governments land use decisions in lyng v northwest indian cemetery protective association 44 the proposed building of road for logging purposes in region of national forest in california had been challenged on free exercise grounds by several indian tribes that deemed the region to be sacred and used it for religious ceremonies but the court held th at even if we assume that the road will virtually destroy the indians ability to practice their religion the constitution simply does not provide principle that could justify upholding their legal claims45 the court said the critical question was whether the governments action directly coerced individuals into violatin g their religious beliefs or imposed unique disabilities on religious activities and it held that the roadbuilding plan did not the road it found would only have incidental effects that might make it more difficult to practice certain religions46 and thus the court said the government did not need to demonstrate compelling justification for the plan whatever may be the exact line between unconstitutional prohibitions on the free exercise of religion and the legitimate conduct by g overnment of its own affairs the court stated the location of the line cannot depend on measuring the effects of governmental action on religious objectors spiritual development47 again the margin of decision was 54 between thomas and smith the court did employ strict scrutiny to invalidate government action on two occasions both i nvolving state denials of unemployment compensation to individuals who were unemployed for religious reasons in hobbie v unemployment appeals commission of florida48 the court held unconstitutional floridas denial of unemplo yment benefits to person who had been fired from her retail sales job because she had joined th seventh day adventist church and was longer available for work on her sa bbath which ran from sundown friday to sundown saturday in an 81 decision the

individual who refused job that would have involved working on sunday his sabbath the allegedly unique fact of the case was that frazee belonged to organized religious sect or church and hi s refusal to work thus was based on his personal beliefs as christian and not on the tenets or teachings of any established religious body but the court found this fact not to distinguish the case from sherbert thomas and hobbie in every one of those cases it said the claimant was forced to choose between fidelity to religious belief and employment51 finding compelling justification for illinois denial of benefits the court held it unconstitutional in sum it is clear that since 1980 the court has substantia lly narrowed the scope of the free exercise clause at the beginning of the decade thomas building on the foundation of sherbert and yoder seemed to command that the government accommodate minority religious practices in all but the most compelling countervailing circumstances but after goldman shabazz roy lyng and smith that can longer be said to be the cas those decisions reassessed the balance between religious interests and governmental interests and resurrected the standard of review for free exercise cases that the court frequently used prior to its 1963 decision in sherbert that standard is essentially one of formal neutrality except in the narrow category of eligibility for governmental benefits the illdefined area of hybrid claims and overt government disc rimination the free exercise clause means only that government must regulate relig ious practices in neutral evenhanded manner the clause longer compels the government to exempt particular religious practices from the prohibitions and requirements of its stat utes and regulations or to accommodate religious needs in its actions by the beginning of the 1990s then justice rehnquists dissent in thomas had become the courts standard for most free exercise cases where state has enacted general st atute the purpose and effect of which is to advance the states secular goals the free exercise clause does not require the state to conform that statute to the dictates of religious conscience of any group52httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs14 53 508 us 520 1993 54 id at 2226 55 id at 2231c the aftermath of smith since the smith decision in 1990 the court s rendered only one other free exercise decision albeit significant one primary attention has focused on the political reaction to smith and the resulting struggle between congress and the court about which branch of government has primary responsibility for determining the scope to be afforded constitu tional rights such as the fr ee exercise of religion that struggle ultimately resulted in substantial diminution in congress ability to legislate protections for constitutional rights beyond what the court has allowed the following sections summarize these developments 1 lukumi babalu aye in church of the lukumi babalu aye inc v city of hialeah53 the court employed smiths framework of analysis but still found strict scrutiny to be applicable as result the court held unconstitutional several city ordinances prohibiting the ritual sacrifice of animals the case arose when the church of the lukumi babalu aye inc sought to bring the practices of the santeria religion into the open by establishing church and cultural center in hialeah florida the santeria faith has centralized authority or written tenets but centers on the performance of certain rituals and ceremonies for such life events as birth marriage sickne ss and death these rituals often involve the sacrifice of goats fowl sheep andor turtles by means of cutting their carotid arteries and previously had been perform ed in private homes with only limited public awareness when the proposal to establis h santeria church and cultural center in hialeah became public these pr actices aroused vehement public antipathy the city council responded by adopting series of resolutions and ordinances condemning santerias practices and making various aspects of the santeria sacrifice ritual illegal the supreme court held hialeahs ordinances to violate the free exercise clause 90 the court noted that under smith law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burde ning particular religious practice54 but it found hialeahs ordinances to be neither neutral nor of genera l applicability because they prohibited the killing of animals only for religious reasons killing for secular reasons hunting pest control euthanasia etc was not forbidden as consequence justice kennedy concluded for the court the ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion55 and strict scrutiny of the ordinances was still appropriate under the smith framework of analysis finding that hialeah failed to show either that the ordinances served any compelling governmental interests or that they were drawn in narrow terms to accomplish their objectives justice kennedy found for the court that the ordinances violated the free exercise clausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs15 56 id at 2234 57 pl 10341 103d cong 1st sess nov 16 1993 42 usca 2000bb et seq 58 521 us 407 1997legislators may not devise mechanisms overt or disguised designed to persecute or oppress religion or its practice the laws here in question were enacted contrary to these constitutional principles and they are void56 thus babalu aye made clear that notwithstanding the courts relaxation of the strictures of the free exercise clause in smith government still cannot single out particular religious practices for special burdens not imposed on analogous secular conduct the free exercise clause as construed in smith may not mandate any exemptions for religious practices from bur densome or even prohibitory laws but it does mandate that such laws be religiously neutral and generally applicable 2 rfra and city of boerne the apparent abandonment of strict scrutiny in smith aroused widespread concern in the religious community and elsewhere and led congress after three years of consid eration to enact the religious freedom restoration act rfra57 purportedly leaving smith intact as the constitutional standard for free exercise cases rfra mandated the use of the strict scrutiny test as statutory standard governing the interacti on of government and religion as enacted rfra provided that statute or regulation of general applicability could lawfully burden persons exer cise of religion only if it we re shown to be essential to further compelling governmental interest and to be the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest rfra made the standard applicable to governmental action at every level of government federal state and local and allowed aggrieved persons to bring suit if they believed their free exercise of religion had been restricted by government in violation of the statutory strict scrutiny standard however in 1997 the supreme court held rfra to be unconstitutional as applied to the states and localities in city of boerne texas v flores58 the court held 63 that congress lacks the constitutional power to impose such sweeping requirement on the states in enacting rfra congress had relied in part on its power under 5 of the fourteenth amendmen t to enact appropria legislation to enforce the substantive protections of the amendment including the religious liberty protections incorporated in the due process clause but the court said that rfra exceeded congress power under 5 in impos ing strict scrutiny standard for free exercise claims it stated congress altered the meaning of the free exercise clause as determined by the court and legislation which alters the meaning of the free exercise clause cannot be said to be enforcing the clause moreover the court assert ed rfra constituted c onsiderable intrusion into the states traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens in enacting rfra it noted congress had failed to develop legislative record that showed ex tensive denials of religious liberty yet rfra was so broad the court said that it intruded at every vel of government displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter as consequence the court concluded rfrahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs16 59 pl

necessary to maintain separation of powers and the federal balance in short the court in boerne affirmed its own primacy in determining the scope to be afforded the rights protected in the constitution congressional efforts to protect those rights it said cannot at l east in the absence of strong record of abuse needing to be rectified broade n that right beyond what the court has delineated 3 administration and congr essional response to boerne in response to the boerne decision the clinton administration adopted policy affirming that rfra remains valid for the federal government for that application it said congress did not rely on 5 of the fourteenth amendment but its legislative powers under article i of the constitution the current bush administration has continued to maintain that policy also in response congress after cons iderable debate enacted the religious land use and institutionalized pe rsons act of 2000 rluipa59 that statute is narrower in scope and relie s on different congressional powers than rfra it imposes statutory strict sc rutiny test on state and local zoning and landmarking laws that impose substantial burden on an individuals or institutions exercise of religion and on state and local actions that impair the religious practices of individuals in public institutions such as prisons mental hospitals and nursing homes but instead of using 5 of the fourteenth amendment rluipa is based largely on congress intersta commerce and spending powers under article i 8 of the constitution both the administrations contentions that rfra remains applicable to the federal government nd rluipa are being challenged in the courts case has yet been accepted for review by the supreme court d conclusion both babalu aye and city of boerne illustrate that the ferment on and off the court over the fr ee exercise clause was not ended by smith in babalu aye justices blackmun oconnor and souter although joining in the courts judgment in the case all criticized its use of the smith rule justice souter argued that the smith rule reflects particularly narrow conception of neutrality law that is religion neutral on its face or in its purpose he said may lack neutrality in its effect by forbidding something that religion requires or requiring something that religion forbids thus he argued the formal neutrality reflected in the smith rule which only bars laws which intentionally discriminate against religion needs to be supplemented with substantive ne utrality which would generally require government to accommodate religious differences by exempting religious practices from formally neutral laws he said as well that smith is in tension with the courts prior free exercise decisions and with the historical evidence of the original intent of the free exercise clause in proper case he said the court should re examine the rule smith declared justices black mun and oconnor reiterated

vehicl for overturning smith and justice souter contended that there should at least have been briefing and argument on the merits of smith before the court addressed th question of congress authority under 5 of the fourteenth amendment nonetheless the central fact remain s since 1980 the supreme court has substantially restricted the constitutional protection afforded religious practices by the free exercise clause as matter of constitutional law smith reigns intentional discrimination against religious practices violates the free exercise clause but not inadvertent discrimination that results from the application of statutes and regulations of general applicability moreover congress power to alter the smith standard by legislation has been substantially limited by the decision in boerne congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion lemon and the lessons of history the debates among the justices about the free exercise clause in the period since 1980 were at least until smith relatively sedate but that has not been the case with the establishment clause on the construction of that clause the justices have disagreed vigorously and at times tes tily the court has not yet altered its interpretation of the establishment clause as fully as it has the construction of the free exercise clause but the changing composition of the court has still had substantial impact since 1980 the court has rendere d number of decisions that affirm governments discretion to take actions protecting or benefitting religion it has substantially modified the lemon test it formulated in 1971 to guide its consideration of the constitutionality of g overnment actions under the tablishment clause and in several of its most recent rulings it overt urned or narrowed number of its prior establishment clause decisions the arguments on the court have ranged over virtually every aspect of its establishment clause jurisprudence in part the criticism of its past decisions has been wholesale in nature various justi ces have termed the courts establishment clause jurisprudence embarrassing60 unprincipled61 in hopeless disarray62 and as manifesting an unjustif

of jeffersons phrase wall of separation between church and state as meta phor for the meaning of the establishment clause 2 its reliance on european and colonial history in interpreting the clause 3

the courts establishment clause jurisprudence and all are critical to any reinterpretation the following subsections summarize the contentions made by the justices on these issues and the effect on its establishment clause jurisprudence the separationi st understanding in the seminal decisions of the courts modern establishment clause jurisprudence the court rooted its interpretation of the clause in the history of the american colonies and of the colonists european forebears the firs t amendment is at once the court said in 1947 the refined product and the rse summation of that history64 the court cited in particular the turmoil civil st rife and persecutions that had been endemic in europe in the centuries preceding and contemporaneous with the colonization of america as various religious sects allied themselves with government to establish their supremacy65 with the power of government supporting them at various times and places catholics had persecuted protestants protestants had persecuted catholics protestant sects had persecuted other prot estant sects catholics of one shade of belief had persecuted catholics of another shade of belief and all of these had from time to time persecuted jews in efforts to force loyalty to whatever religious group happened to be on top and in league with the government of particular time and place men and women had been fined cast in jail cruelly tortured and killed66 many of the early settlers came to amer ica the court said to escape the bondage which compelled them to support and attend governmentfa vored churches67 although they often engaged in the same practices themselves the court observed that over time the colonists gradually deve loped feeling of abhorrence about such practices and by the time of the revolution had begun to disestablish the unions of church and state that existed in these early decisions the court stressed as particularly relevant to the meaning of the first amendment the experience of virginia which after momentous struggle disestablished th anglican church in 1785 and adopted jeffersons bill for religious liberty virginia it said provided great stimulus and able leadership for the view that i ndividual religious liber ty could be achieved best under government which was strippe d of all power to tax to support or otherwise to assist any or all religions or to

struggle for religious freedom in america69 indeed so instructive was virginias example the court declared that the provisions of the first amendment had the same objective and were intended to provide the same protection against governmental intrusi on on religious liberty as the virginia statute70 as part of this emphasis the court so stressed the importance of the views of james madison and thomas jefferson to th interpretation of the first amendment both had played leading roles in disestablishing the anglican church in virginia madison was the author of the memor ial and remonstrance against religious assessments in 1784 that articulated numer ous arguments against taxation for the benefit of religious institutions and jefferson was the author of the virginia bill for religious liberty that ultimately was enacted in 178571 madison also was primary architect of the bill of rights in the first congress indeed so central was his role in the latter process one justice said that the establishment clause is the compact and exact summation of its authors views formed during his long struggle for religious freedom72 all the great instruments of the virgin ia struggle for religious liberty thus became warp and woof of our constituti onal tradition not simply by the course of history but by the common unifying force of madisons life thought and sponsorship he epitomized the whole of that tradition in the amendments compact but nonetheless comprehensive phrasing73 this history and the debates in the first congress on what became the first amendment the court said showed that the establishment clause was intended to do more than prohibit direct government compulsion or coercion in matters of religion it identified two broa d purposes underlying the clause its first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion the history of governmentally established religion both in england and in this country showed that whenever government had allied itself with one particular form of religion the inevitable result had been that it had incurred the hatred disrespect and even contempt of those who held contrary beliefs that same history showed that many people had lost their respect for any religion that had relied upon the support of government to spread its faith the establishment clause thus stands as an expression of principle on the part of the founders of our constitution that religion is too pers onal too sacred too holy to permit its unhallowed perversion by civil magistratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs20 74 engel v vitale 370 us at 43133 75 mcgowan v maryland supra at 44142 76 everson v board of education 330 us at 15 16 jefferson had created his wall of separation metaphor in 1802 see n 1 77 dissenting from the result but not the historic reasoning of the majority in everson 330 us 1 1947 justice rutledge asserted for hi mself and three other dissenters the following understanding of the establishment clause not simply an established church but any law respecting an establishment of religion is forbidden the amendments pur pose was not to strike merely at the official establishment of single sect creed or religion outlawing only formal relation such as had prevailed in england and some of the colonies necessarily it was to uproot all such relationships but the object was broader than separating church and state in this narrow sense it was to create complete and permanent separation of the spheres of religious activity and civil authority by comprehensively forbidding every form of public aid or support for religion 330 us at 3132 rutledge j dissentinganother purpose of the establishment cl ause rested upon an awareness of the historical fact that governmentally established religions and religious persecutions go hand in hand it was in large part to get completely away from this sort of systematic religious persec ution that the founders brought into being our nation our constitution and our bill of rights with its prohibition against any governmental establishment of religion74 thus the court concluded that the estab lishment clause in its final form did not simply bar congressional enactment establishing church it forbade all laws respecting an establishment of religion the first and fourteenth amendment afford protection against religious establishment far more extensive than merely to forbid national or state church75 in the classic statement of the separationist understanding justice black stated for the court the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment means at least this neither state nor the federal government can set up church neither can pass laws which aid one religion aid ll religions or prefer one religion over another neither can force nor influence person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess belief or disbelief in any religion person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs for church attendance or nonattendance tax in any amount large or small can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions whatever they may be called or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion in the words of jefferson the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect wall of separation between church and state76 initially every member of the court joined in this separationist reading of the historical underpinnings and consequent broad scope of the establishment clause77httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs21 78 374 us 203 1963 79 id at 222 80 397 us 664 1970 81 403 us 602 61213 1971 82 see marsh v

religion79 subsequently in walz v tax commission of new york80 in 1970 the court articulated requirement that government action not precip itate excessive entanglement between government and religion finally in lemon v kurtzman81 in 1971 the tripartite test gained its full articulation first the statute must have secular legislative purpose second its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion finally the statute must not foster an ex cessive entanglement with religion the court further held that statute or governmental action had to satisfy every

understanding of th establishment clause has come under persistent criticism indeed the courts interpretation of history and use of jeffersons phrase wall of separation as metaphor for the establishment clause was criticized by justi ce reed as early as 194884 and justice white raised questions about the excessive entanglement prong of the tripartite test in the very case in which the test was first fully articulated85 but during the 1980s criticism of the history relied upon by the court the w all of separation metaphor the tripar tite test and the courts understanding of the or

critiques have been voiced in both ma jority decisions and concurring and dissenting opinions in 1983 in marsh v chambers 86 for instance majority of the court emphasized other aspects of ameri can

religious conflict in europe and the colonies and stressed instead the ubiquity of the practice of legislative prayer from colonial times forward he also cited as critically important the fact that the first cong ress authorized the appointment of paid chaplains for itself within three days of ag reeing on the language of the bill of rights and that james madison served on the house committee to decide how chaplains should be chosen and voted for the bill au thorizing the payment of the chaplains eschewing any reference to or use of the tripartite lemon test in deciding the case the chief

justice stated fails to give wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state92 the decision was 54 dissenting in wallace v jaffree93 in 1985 justice rehnquist soon to be elevated to chief justice authored the most searing and comprehensive critique of the courts separationist construction of the establis hment clause he condemned the courts use of jeffersons phrase wa ll of separation as metaphor for the establishment clause as misleading u seless mischievous diversion and metaphor based on bad history94 jefferson justice rehnquist noted did not even play direct role in the adoption of the bill of rights as he was in france at the time as the american ambassador madis on he agreed was undoubtedly the most important architect of the bill of rights but the records of the first congress justice rehnquist claimed demonstrated th at madisons role in the drafting and adoption of the language of the religion clauses was not that of an advocate of incorporating the virginia statute of religious liberty into the united states constitution but of an advocate of sensible legislative compromise95 based on the records of the debate it is indis putable justice rehnquist asserted thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs24 96 id 97 id at 99 98 id at 113 99 id at 106 100 id at 107 101 id at 112 102 id at 108 103 id

neutrality on the part of government between religion and irreligion96 the contrary view set forth by the court in everson v board of education supra he asserted was totally incorrect97 justice rehnquist further noted that the first congress reenacted the northwest ordinance of 1787 which provided land grants in the designated territories for both sectarian and public schools and adopted re solution calling on the president to designate day of public thanksgiving nd prayer moreover he said in the nineteenth century congress routinely appr opriated money to support sectarian indian education by religious organizations and the eminent constitutional authorities joseph story and thomas cooley both asserted that the religion clauses permitted nondiscriminatory governmental assistan ce to religion agreeing with the separationists view that the true meaning of the establishment clause can only be seen in its history98 justice rehnquist nonetheless concluded that prior to the courts modern attempts to construe the establishment clause the clause had well accepted meaning it forbade establishment of national religion and forbade preference among religious sects or denomin ations it did not require government neutrality between religion and irreligion nor did it prohibit the federal government from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion99 the wall of separation metaphor he said should be frankly and explicitly abandoned100 with respect to the tripartite lemon test justice rehnquist charged that it has basis in the history of the amendment it seeks to interpret is difficult to apply and yields unprincipled results 101 the secular purpose prong he said has proven mercurial in application102 because it is not clear whether it prohibits all aid to sectarian institutions or only that which is accompanied by stated purpose to aid religion the entanglement prong he asserted had beco divorced from its use in historical context in walz and when joined with the primary effect prong had created catch22 in school aid cases the effect st required such government aid to be closely watched st it be put to sectarian us but the entanglement test rendered aid unconstitutional pr ecisely because it is closely watched finally he claimed the tripartite test has caused this court to fracture into unworkable plurality opinions has yielded unprincipled resu lts and has produced only consistent unpredictability103httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs25 104 see eg committee for public education v nyquist 413 us 756 813 1973 white j dissenting

aguillard106 in 1987 justice scalia appointed to the court in 1986 began to articulate what has become steady drumbeat of derision about the courts establishment clause jurisprudence in that case the court held unconstitutional louisiana statute that mandated that creationism be taught along with evolution in the public schools on the grounds the statute was intended to endorse and promote particul ar religious doctrine ju stice scalia dissented from that conclusion and termed the court s establishment clause jurisprudence embarrassing107 more particularly he asserted that the courts application of the purpose prong of the tripartite test had m ade such maze of the establishment clause that even the most conscientious governmental officials can only guess what motives will be held unconstitutional the purpose test he charged exacerbates the tension between the free exercise and tablishment clauses has basis in the language or history of the amendm ent and has wonderfully flexible consequences108 more generally he has bem oaned the strange establishment clause geometry of crooked lines and wavering shapes lemons intermittent use has produced and has likened the test to some ghoul in latenight horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad after being repeatedly killed and buried frightening the little children and attorneys 109 in 1989 in county of allegheny v american civil liberties union greater pittsburgh chapter110 justice kennedy appointed to the court in 1988 suggested that substantial revision of our establishment clause doctrine may be in order111 in that case the court held unconstitutional the display of creche by itself in county courthouse but found c onstitutional the display of christmas tree and menorah in front of citycounty bu ilding during the christmas and chanukah seasons justice kennedy argued in par tial dissent that the courts holding with respect to the creche disp lay reflects an unjustified hostility toward religion hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents112 government policies of accommodation acknowledgme nt and support for religion he said are

longstanding traditions of governme nt acknowledgment and accommodation of religion can not be legitimate the establishment clause he said ought to be construed to mean only that governme nt may not coerce anyone to support or participate in any religion or its exercise and it may not in the guise of avoiding hostility or callous indifference give direct benefits to religion in such degree that it in fact establishes state religion or religious faith or tends to do so114 justice thomas in concurring opinion in rosenberger v rector and visitors of the university of virginia115 took sharp issue with the separationist view that the establishment clause bars nondiscriminator assistance to religion terming the courts establishment clause jurisprudence to be in hopeless disa rray he said that virginias controversy ove r assessments in 1785 and madisons memorial and remonstrance had nothing to do with subsidy available to both religious and nonreligious entities instead he c ontended it concerned only the support of ministers and teachers of religion thus he argued that incident as well as madisons actions in bringing about bill of rights cannot be used to support the extreme view that the government must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them from more generally available financial subsidies116 moreover he asserted government in the early ears of the republic provided number of supports for religion congress hired chaplain religious properties were exempted from property taxes the rthwest ordinance of 1787 provided land grants for the benefit of schools many of which were sectarian and copyright protections included religious author s and publications he concluded thus history provides an answer for the constitutional question posed by this case there is evidence that the framers intended to disable religious entities from participating on neutral terms in evenhanded government programs the evidence that does exist points in the opposite direction 117 finally justice thomas in the courts most recent decision questioned whether the establishment clause ought to be deem ed fully incorporated in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and as consequence fully applicable to the states118 in the context of the establishment clause he said it may well be that state action should be evalua ted on different terms than similar action by the federal government the federalis m prerogatives of the stat he suggested ought to be weighed in establishing the proper c onstruction of the establishment

and dissenting in part in so doing justice stevens generally followed the historical analysis set forth in leonard levy the establishment clause religion and the first amendment 1986c the response these criticisms of the courts broad interpretation of the establishment clause of cour have not gone without re joinder in further support of the wall of separation construction for instance justice brennan cited the historical facts that the constitution broke with the common practice of the day in not invoking the name of god that madison s ubsequently recanted his views regarding the constitutionality of legislative chaplains and prayers and that presidents jefferson and jackson refused on establishment clau grounds to procla im national days of thanksgiving or fasting119 he also argued that the acts of the first congress cannot alone serve as an authoritative guide to the meaning of the establishment clause because the views of the states that ratified the b ill of rights also have to be considered120 more generally he argued that to be truly faithful to the framers our use of the history of their time mu st limit itself to broad purposes not specific practices lest their work be treated as static and lifeless121 in addition justices blackmun oconnor brennan marshall and stevens all have stressed that the people of the united states are now religiously diverse and thus that even if in the early days of the re public the religion cl auses were understood to protect only the diversity within christianity today they are recognized as guaranteeing religious liberty and equality to the infidel the atheist or the adherent of nonchristian faith such as islam or judaism122 in response to the argument that the tablishment clause wa s intended to allow nondiscriminatory government assistance to religion justice stevens brennan and marshall have contended that the religious establishments in the six states still retaining them at the time of the bill of rights were not limited to single church but were multiple in nature ie public aid was provided on nondiscriminatory basis to all christian churches or to all protes tant churches thus they asserted the prohibition of the establishment clause wa s understood by its authors to preclude not just single established church but multiple establishments as well ie it was intended to prohibit nondiscrimin atory aid to all religions123 that intent they claimed was clearly shown by the evoluti on in the wording of the religion clauses during the house and senate debates on madisons propos als in the first congress following his appointment to the cour t in 1990 justice souter joined by justices oconnor and stevens argued this view as well in concurring opinion in lee v weisman supra

only that religion enjoyed an official preference over others and deliberately chose instead prohibition extending to ws establishing religion in general the sequence of the senates treatment of this house proposal and the houses response to the senate confirm that the framers meant the establishment clauses prohibition to encompass nonpref erential aid to religion what is remarkable is that unlike the earliest h ouse drafts or the final senate proposal the prevailing language is not limited to laws respecting an establishment of religion national religion one religious sect or specific articles of faith the framers repeatedly considered and deliberately rejected such narrow language and instead extended their prohi bition to state support for religion in general124 he concluded as well that the language of the establishment clause prohibits more than just governmental coercion of religi ous belief or of support for religion the free exercise clause he noted also pr ohibits such coercion and thus literal application of the coercion test would re nder the establishment clause virtual nullity125 justice blackmun in the opinion of the court in allegheny county v aclu pittsburgh chapter termed the charge of hostility to religion leveled against the separationist construc tion of the establishment clau to be both offensive and absurd justice kennedy apparently has misperceived respect for religious pluralism respect commanded by the constitution as hostility or indifference to religion misperception could be more antithetical to the values embodied in the establishment clause secular state is not the same as an atheistic or antireligious state secular state blishes neither atheism nor religion as its official creed it follows directly from the constitutions proscription against government affiliation with religious beliefs or institutions that there is orthodoxy on religious matters in the secular state126 thus he asserted denyin g government the power to display creche on public property at christmastime does not represent hostility or indifference to religion but instead the respect for religious diversity that the constitution requires127 the constitution he said mandates that the government remain secular rather than affiliate itself with religious beliefs or institutions precisely in order to avoid discriminating among citizens on the basis of their religious faiths128 more recently in an opinion joined by justices stevens ginsburg and breyer justice souter in dissenting opinion in rosenberger v the rector and visitors of the

the establishment clause and reiterated as well the authority of madison and jefferson on its m eaning in response to justice thomas interpretation of madisons vi ews he said that nowhere in the remonstrance did madison advance the view that virginia s hould be able to provi financial support for religion as part of generally availa ble subsidy program and noted as well that the outgrowth of the remonstrance was not such bill but jefferson bill for establishing religious freedom which proscribed the use of tax dollars for religious purposes129 of the contention that the acts of congress showed that the establishment clause allows nondiscriminat ory aid justice souter rejoined that individual acts of congress especially when they are few and far between scarcely serve as an authoritative guide to the mean ing of the religion clauses and are more dispositive than the alien and sedition acts in interpreting the first amendment130 in the courts most recent decision justi ce souter joined by justices stevens ginsburg and breyer asserted that the noaid construction of the establishment clause first articulated in everson serves three fundamental objectives131 first he said it protects freedom of conscience by ensuring that in jeffersons words one shall be compelled to support any religious worship place or ministry whatsoever second he said it prot ects religion from the corruption of its mission that can come in the wake of g overnment regulation and its own eagerness for more public funding third he said it protects society from the threat of conflict along religious lines as sect compet against sect for limited public funds d modifications of the lemon test as noted above much of the debate about the meaning of the establishment clause has focused on the utility and adequacy of the tripartite lemon test nonetheless that test continues to be the one most often employed by the court bu t the debate has cause d the court to make significant modifications in the tripartite test and in recent churchstate decision the justices argued vigorously over whether neutrality ought to be the essential meaning of the test the following subsections detail the modifications in the test and the recent contentions 1 endorsement justice oconnor appointed to the court in 1981 authored concurring opinion in lynch v donnelly to suggest not rejection but clarification of the lemon test132 the essential meaning of the establishment clause she asserted is that it prohibits government from making adherence to religion relevant in any way to persons standing in the political community thus she said the clause is violated when government becomes excessively entangled with religious institutions becau that may threaten the independence of such institutions give favored institutions access to governmental powers or benefits not fully available to nonadherents of th favored religion and create politicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs30 133 id

she said the establishment clause is violated by government endorseme nt or disapproval of religion endorsement sends message to nonadherents that they are outsiders not full members of the political community and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders favored members of the political community disapproval sends the opposite message133 thus the secular purpose prong of the tripar tite test she averred should be construed to ask whether governments actual pur pose is to endorse or disapprove of religion134 the primary effect prong in turn should be construed to ask whether irrespective of purpose the practice under review in fact conveys message of endorsement or disapproval the enta nglement prong she asserted should be limited to institutional entanglement not political entanglement in county of allegheny v aclu pittsburgh chapter supra justice kennedy termed justice oconnors ndorsement test an unwelco addition to our tangled establishment clause jurisprudence and sa id it was flawed in its fundamentals and unworkable in practice the test he char ged would invalidate scores of traditional practices recognizing the place religion holds in our culture would trivialize constitutional adjudication and would require the court to sit as national theology board and decide what every religious symbol means135 justice scalia in capitol square review and advisory board v pinette supra said that in the context of the display of religious sy mbols the endorsement principle requires officials to guess when they might be perceived to be advocating religious viewpoint and forces them to weigh host of imponderables the endorsement test he said provides standard whatsoever for determining when the establishment clause is violated and creates minefield for public officials nonetheless the court has em ployed this revision of the lemon test in several cases136 2 modification of the primary effect and entanglement criteria the court still requires apparen tly without dissent that government programs and actions benefiting religion serve secular pur pose but in the context of public aid programs benefiting sectarian institutions it has significantly loosened the strictureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs31 137 wolman v walter 433 us 229 1977 nd bowen v kendrick 487 us 589 1988 138 hunt v mcnair 413 us 734 743 1973 139 lemon v

justices scalia kennedy and thomas would go even farther and allow public aid to be used for religious purposes by the recipient institutions but that is not yet the majority viewof both the primary effect and excessive entanglement prongs of the tripartite lemon test with respect to direct aid the court fo rmerly construed the primary effect prong to mean that such aid must be limited to secular use thus direct aid program could founder on this aspect of the lemon test if the aid was not limited to secular use either by its nature or by statutory or regulatory constraint in addition direct aid program could be held unconstitutional if it flowed to institutions that the court deemed to be pervasively sectarian ie entities whose religious and secular functions were so inextricably intertwined that the aid could not be limited just to secular use137 as the court summarized in one case aid normally may be thought to have primary effect of advancing religion when it flows to an institution in which re ligion is so pervasive that substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission or when it funds specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting138 moreover even if an aid program was limited to secular use it could still founder on the excessive entanglement test if it flowed to pervasively sectarian institutions in such institutions the court said the government could not simply assume that the limitation to secular use w ould be honored instead it had to engage in comprehensive discriminating and continuing surveillance to ensure that the limitation was observed but the court held these prophyl actic contacts will involve excessive and enduring entang lement between state and church139 and as consequence it would hold the aid program to be unconstitutional in its recent decisions the court has now modified both the primary effect and excessive entanglement prongs of the tripartite test140 in addition to the secular purpose requirement the court now construes the criteria of whether public aid has primary effect of dvancing religion to be whether the aid results in government indoctrination b whether the aid program defines its recipients by reference to religion and c whether the aid creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion141 most critically the court has abandoned the presumption that some religious entities are so pervasively sectarian that most forms of direct public aid to them are unconstitutional it now presumes absent proof to the contrary that direct aid to such entities will be used for the secular purposes intended142 as consequence it has also modified the assumption that government must engage in an excessivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs32 143 agostini v felton supra and mitchell v helms supra 144 in agostini v felton supra at 23233 the court stated the factors we use to assess whether an entanglement is excessive are similar to the factors we use to examine effect that is to assess entanglement we have looked to the character and purposes of th institutions that are benefited the nature of the aid that the state provides and the resulting relationship between the government and religious authority sim ilarly we have assessed laws effect by examining the character of the institutions benefited eg whether the religious institutions were predominantly religious and the nature of the aid that the state provided eg whether it was neutral and nonideolog ical thus it is simplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and treat it as we did in walz as an aspect of the inquiry in to statutes effect 145 committee for public education v nyqui st 413 us 756 1973

2002entangling policing of such institutions use of direct aid the court still deems some monitoring to be necessary but it longer views such monitoring to be constitutionally fatal143 reflecting the diminished rigor of the entanglement test the court in the context of direct public aid to sectarian entities has made the entanglement test part of the primary effect test144 in the context of voucher or other aid pr ograms indirectly benefiting sectarian schools the court has never used the full lemon test it has required such programs to serve secular purpose and not to have primary effect of dvancing religion but the critical inquiries on the primary effect test have been whether the vouchers or other aid are distributed to the initial beneficiaries on religiously neutral basis and whether the initial beneficiar ies have genuinely indepe ndent choice about whether to use the assistance at s ecular or religious schools145 in its most recent decision the court continued to ask as it also does for direct aid whether there was any religious bias in the initial distribution of the education vouchers and it also examined whether the parents receiving the vouche rs had true private choice between secular and religious options in using the aid146 but it significantly broadened the choices deemed to be relevant in evalua ting whether the parents had true private choice the court held all educational options open to th em needed to be considered not just the private secular or religious schools where the vouchers themselves could be used thus it said the range of c hoices available in the program before it included not only the private schools but so enrollment in public schools magnet schools and community schools and the option of receiving special tutoring assistance in short the court altered the true private choice criterion of the primary effect test in such way that most voucher programs ought to be able to satisfy it 3 neutrality as the governing principle the concept of neutrality has been continuing component of the court s establishment clause jurisprudence in its first establishment clause decision of th modern era the court used principlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs33 147 everson v board of ducation 330 us 1 18 1947 148 in upholding the tax exemption accorded pr operty owned by religious and other nonprofit organizations in walz v tax commission of new york 397 us 664 669 1970 the court asserted the general principle deducible from the first amendment and all that has been said by this court is this that we will not tolerate either governmentally established religion or governmental inte rference with religion short of those expressly proscribed governmental acts there is room for play in the joints productive of benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference 149 in holding state sponsorship of bible reading and unison prayer in the public schools unconstitutional in abington school district v schempp 374 us 203 225 1963 the court stated they are religious exercises required by the states in violation of the command of the first amendment that the govern ment maintain strict neutrality neither aiding nor opposing religion 150 zobrest v catalina foothills school district 509 us 1 1993of neutrality to uphold public subsidy of the costs of transporting children to and from school including parochial school stating the first amendment requires the state to be neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers it does not require the state to be their adversary 147 at times the test has been described by the court as one of benevolent neutrality148 and at other times as one of strict neutrality149 but the concept has often found expression in the second prong of the lemon test which require s government action affecting religion to have primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion thus it has sometimes been used by the court to uphold programs in which public aid is made available on religiously neutral basis ie without regard to whether the beneficiary is religi ous or nonreligious government programs that neutrally provide benefits to broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion are not readily subject to an establishment clause challenge just because sectarian institutions may also receive an attenuated benefit150 as noted in the preceding section the cept of neutrality is an element of the primary effect test for both dir ect and indirect aid programs in one of the courts recent decisions however plurality of four justices argued that the lemon test ought to be conceived almost entirely in neutrality terms for programs directly aiding sectarian institutions justice thomas in plurality opinion in mitchell v helms supra joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia and kennedy argued that so long as an aid program is religiously neutral in the manner in which it provides its benefits and the aid itself is secular in nature thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs34 151 mitchell v helms supra at 10 thomas j this contention is not wholly new but in mitchell it was expressed with particular force thenjustice rehnquist contended in wallace v jaffree 472 us 38 106 1985 re hnquist j dissenting that the original meaning of the establishment clause forbade establishment of national church and forbade preference among religious sects or denominations it did not require government neutrality between religion and irreligion nor did it prohibit the federal government from providing nondiscriminatory ai d to religion in this view religious organizations should be eligible to participate in public aid programs without giving up their religiosityprogram passes muster under the establishment clause even if the aid is subsequently diverted by the recipient to religious use in distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the state and indoctrination that is not we have c onsistently turned to the principle of neutrality upholding aid that is offered to broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religi on if the religious irreligious and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipi ent conducts has been done at the behest of the government151 but the other five justices criticized this elevation of the neutrality test justice oconnor joined by justice breyer term ed this use of neutrality unprecedented expansive in tension with our precedents and unn ecessary neutrality she said is important and rel evant in determining whet her an aid program advances religion but it is not alone sufficient the plurality opinion she said foreshadows the approval of direct monetary subsidies to religious organizations even when they use the money to advance their religious objectives justice souter in turn joined by justices stevens and ginsburg argued that the pluralitys use of neutrality had manifold errors represented sharp break with the framers consistent unde rstanding of establishment and this courts consistent interpretive course and would be the end of the principle of aid to the sectarian schools religious mission the plurality ignored the fact that neutrality had been used in several differe nt senses by the court in the past he said it had been used to describe 1 the state of ba lance between government as ally and as adversary to religion require d by the two religion clauses 2 the nonreligious and secular nature of the aid provided and 3 evenhandedness in making aid available to the religious and nonreligious alike using evenhandedness one in determining an aid programs constitutiona lity he said disregarded the courts precedents and would mean that religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the benefit of their pub lic school counterparts and religious missions would thrive on public money thus for now at least the concept of neutrality remains an essential element of the courts determination of whether an tablishment clause violation has occurred but it is not the only elementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs35 152 in several decisions in the past deca the

also on one occasion proffered and used coercion as th touchstone of an establishment clause violation in lee v weisman supra justice kennedy opined for the court that at minimum the constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in relig ion or its exercise or otherwise act in way which establishes state religion or re ligious faith or tends to do so153 in that case the court held that high schools inclusion of an invocation and benediction by rabbi in its commencement ceremony had the unconstitutional effect of coercing some students into participating in religious activity justice oconnor has criticized coercion as an exclusive test of an establishment clause violation as failing to take account of the numerous more subtle ways that government can show favoritism to par ticular beliefs or convey message of disapproval to others and thus as failing to adequately protect the religious liberty or respect the religious diversity of the members of our pluralistic political community moreover she has said to make coercion the touchstone of an establishment clause violation would make the free exercise clause redundancy154 justice souter has made similar criticism of the coercion test contending that it would make the establishment clause virtual nullity nonetheless the court has used the coercion test as rule of decision in at least two school prayer cases155 various justices have also proffered the historicity and ubiquity of given practice as test of its constitutionality in marsh v chambers156 for instance chief justice

country and had become part of the fabric of our society justice kennedy joined by chie f justice rehnquist and justices white and scalia contended in allegheny county v greater pittsburgh chapter of

american tradition of nonsectarian prayer to god at public celebrations generally as noted the court relied in part on th is test in upholding the constitutionality of legislative chaplaincy in marsh v chambers supra f conclusion in sum then the period since 1980 has witnessed profound discontent by number of justices with the historical justifica tions previously used by the court for its interpretation of the establishment clause the wall of separation metaphor and the tripartite lemon test all of the justices continue to agree that the meaning and scope of the clause are inform ed by history but they sharply disagree on what history is most relevant the critique of the separati onist understanding of the establishment clause has had substantial effect albeit not one as sweeping as the alteration of the interpretation of the free exercise clau since 1980 the court has rendered number of decisions upholding government actions protecting or benefiting religion the metaphor wall of separation has not been used as guiding principle in any majority opinion by the court159 the lemon test has been modified supplemented and sometimes replaced by other tests the court has overturned veral of its prior establishment clause decisions involving dir ect aid to sectarian institutions and it has made it considerably easier for voucher programs to pass c onstitutional muster160 but the debate about the meaning of th establishment clause continues to be intense and can be expected to persist fo r years to come the courts establishment clause jurisprudence has shifted to allow government more discretion to take actions protecting or benefiting religion but its decisions on particular issues remain to great extent unpredictable httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs37 particular issues the tumult on the court over the meaning of the religion clauses has meant that it has faced few easy cases in this area since 1980 as noted earlier nearly 30 percent of its decisions during this time have been by 54 margin and concurring and dissenting opini ons have abounded see appendix the courts narrowing of the scope of the free exercise clause has been recounted above and that discussion of the fourteen free exerci decisions rendered by the court since 1980 with the exception of the tax cases will not be repeated here with respect to the establishment clause the court in its decisions since 1980 has reaffirmed and extended its past decisions prohibiting government promotion or sponsorship of religious ex ercises in the public schools established the constitutional parameters for silent meditation and held equal access policies for student religious groups at the college and secondary school levels to be constitutional b expanded the permissible scope of religious speech in the public square whether spoken or symbolic c reaffirmed some of its precedents concerning direct public aid to sectarian schools and religious social welf are organizations but

made clear the continuing vitality of its precedents in th is area yet it has also broken new ground by making explicit constitutional distinction between the sponsorship of religious activities in the schools by g overnment and the conduct of such activities by students at their own initiative in five decisions prior to the beginning of the decade the court had construed the establishment clause to prohibit g overnment from sponsoring or promoting religious activities or doctrines in the public schools struck down by the court had been state sponsorship of regular devotional activ ities such as prayer and bible reading161 privately sponsored religious instru ction on public school premises during the school day162 and state prohibitions on the teaching of evolution163 state cannot consistently with the first and four teenth amendments the court had said utilize its public school system to aid any or all religious faiths or sects in the dissemination of their doctrines and ideals164 on the other hand the court had prio r to 1980 found the establishment clause not to be violated by released time pr ogram that permitted public school children to repair to nearby religious centers dur ing the school day for purposes of receiving religious instruction from private teachers165 it had in dicta repeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of the public schools teaching about religion and it had in two cases held the free speech and free exercise clauses to mandate exemptions for religious reasons from the otherwise compulsory practices of saluting the flag and attending school until the age of sixteen166 in the public schools the court had said the first amendment mandates government neutrality between religion and religion and between re ligion and nonreligion167 all of these precedents have remain ed intact since 1980 the court has reaffirmed its school prayer and curriculu m decisions and extended them to school sponsored prayer at commencement cerem onies and extracurricular activities such as football games displays of the ten commandments and the teaching of creationism but it has so found broad c onstitutional protection for

prayers at football games and to select student to deliver those prayers the two summary affirmances of cour involved written opinions with respect to the issue of whether public hi gh school can invite clergyman to deliver an invocation and benediction at graduation ceremony justice kennedy writing for the court in lee v weisman eschewed use of the lemon test and employed instead the principle that at minimum the constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise 171 the injury caused by the governments action in this instance he said is that the state in school setting in ffect required particip ation in religious exercise172 but the first amendments religion clauses he asserted mean that religious beliefs and religious expressi on are too precious to be either proscribed or prescribed by the state173 rejecting the notion that government could sponsor the rabbis prayer as form of civic religion in the schools he said the constitution forbids the state to exact religious conformity from student as the price of attending her ow n high school graduation174 santa fe involved policy that permitted high

discriminated against minority views and perpetuated majoritarian viewpoint it coerced some students into participating in religious exercise at the football games he said and encour aged divisiveness along religious lines moreover he stated for the court the policy in this instance failed to divorce the school from the religious cont ent of the invocation not only did the policy by its terms invite and encourag religious messages but the invocation was to be broadcast over the schools public address systems to large audience assembled as part of regularly scheduled schools ponsored function conducted on school property in this context th court said an objective observer would unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her schools seal of approval finally justice steven s asserted given the long history of pre game prayer in the school district and th evolution of the policy it was clear that the district intended to preserve the pr actice of prayer before football games in two additional cases the court held unconstitutional state statutes mandating the display of the ten commandments on the walls of the public schools and the teaching of creationism in stone v graham175 the court without briefing or oral argument struck down 54 kentucky statut which required that copy of the ten commandments purchased with private f unds be posted on the wall of each public classroom in the state notwithstanding contrary declarations by the state legislature the court found the ten commandments to be undeniably sacred text and the preeminent purpose of the posting requirement to be plainly religious in nature as consequence it held the posting requireme nt to be in violation of the first prong of the lemon test and violation of the establishment clause in edwards v aguillard176 the court reaffirmed and extended its previous ruling in epperson v arkansas177 which had held unconstitutional states ban on the teaching of evolution in the public schools aguillard involved louisiana statute that instead of barring the teaching of volution required teacher s to give balanced treatment to evolu tion and creationism ie to teach both doctrines like the statute involved in epperson the court held this statute to violate the purpose prong of the tripartite test 72 in enacting the statute justice brennan wrote for the court the preeminent purpose of the louisiana legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that supernatur being created mankind noting the historic and contemporaneous antagonisms between the teachings of certain religious denominations and the teaching of evol ution he conclu ded that it was not happenstance that the legislature required the teaching of theory which coincided with religious view178 the purpose of the act the court found was to endorse particular religious doctrine as consequence it held that the act violated thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs41 179 472 us 38

scientific community as scientific theory aguillard appears to close the constitutional door on further efforts to excise or rebut the teaching of evolution in the public schools 2 private religious expression in four other decisions since 1980 involving religion in the public schools however the court br oke new constitutional ground in each case it affirmed the constitu tionality of private religious expression and in one case in the college context even upheld the public subsidy of religious expression in wallace v jaffree179 the court for the first time addressed the constitutionality of provisions mandating mome nts of silence at the beginning of each school day180 again relying on the first prong of the lemon test the court in wallace struck down an alabama statute mandating daily moment of silence in the public schools for purposes of meditation or voluntary prayer on the grounds it had been adopted with an illegitima legislative purpose by 63 margin the court found that the alabama legisl ature had enacted the statut in question for the sole purpose of expressing the states endorseme nt of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each school day anothe r statute previously adopted by alabama justice stevens noted for the court already provided for moment of silence at the beginning of each school day for purposes of meditation the legislative history of the addition of the phrase or voluntary prayer in the later statute the court concluded clearly showed that the statut was intended to serve secular purpose and was of wholly religious character181 justice stevens stressed however that the court was not holding all moment of silence provisions to be unconstitutional the legislative intent to return prayer to the public schools is of course quite different from merely protecting every students right to engage in voluntary prayer during an appropriate moment of silence during the schoolday the 1978 statute already prot ected that right 182 thus it appears likely that statutes or regulations mandating moment of silence can pass constitutional muster pr ovided that they are not adopted for the purpose of promoting prayer and are not implemented to give governmental encouragement or preference to prayer183httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs42 184 454 us 263 1981 185 id at 277 186 see brandon v board of education of th guilderland

secondary schools to allow student initiated religious groups to use school facilities during the school day in widmar v vincent184 the court held 81 that the freedom of speech clause of the first amendment bars public university which permits some student groups to meet in its facilities from denying such use to stude nt groups wanting to engage in religious worship and discussion once university opens its fac ilities for use by student organizations justice powell wrote for the court it may not enforce contentbased exclusion of religious speech unless th ere is compelling public purpose to be served the university argued that conf ormance with the establishment clause and with missouris history of strict churchstate separation constituted sufficient justification for its ban but the court disagreed permitting student groups to use campus facilities for religious purposes it said would neither place the imprimatur of university sponsorship on any sectarian belief or practice nor single out religious groups for special benefits thus the c ourt held the universitys exclusionary policy violates the fundament principle that state regulation of speech should be contentneutral 185 before and after widmar the same constitutional question arose in the context of studentinitiated relig ious groups in public secondary schools all but one of the state and lower federal courts that examin ed that question held permission for such groups to meet on the premises of pub lic secondary schools to violate the establishment clause186 congress however found the courts reasoning unpersuasive and in 1984 after vigorous debate created statutory right at the public secondary school level that replicat ed the constitutional right at universities articulated in widmar the equal access act187 bars public secondary schools that receive federal assistance and that ve limited open forum from discriminating against any student group wishing to m eet on the basis of the religious po litical philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings the act defines limited open forum to mean the opport unity for one or more noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time in board of education of westside community schools v mergens188 the court held the equal access act to be constitutional 81 the court

discrimination against religious speech in public schools and said it pplied any time school permitted even one noncurriculum related student group to m eet the court further found the act not to promote religion or to place the imprimatur of government on the religious speech that would occur at such meetings justice oconnor joined by three other justices189 stressed that there is crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion and private speech endorsing religion we thin k that secondary school students are mature enough and are likely to understand that school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on nondiscriminatory basis190 justices brennan and marshall agreed with that reasoning but said that westside needed to take additional st eps to make clear that its recognition of student bible club did not constitute an endor sement of their views ho wever justices scalia and kennedy emphasized the absence of any coercive effect in permitting such meetings to occur despite these differing approaches to the issue the decision clearly ratified the extension of the reasoning of widmar to the public secondary school setting finally in rosenberger v the rector and visitors of the university of virginia191 the court held 54 that when pub lic university creates forum for the expression of student opinions it cannot excl ude student religious opinions in this instance the university of virginia foster ed the creation of publications by student organizations by paying their printing b ills out of the student activities fund saf however it excluded religious publications among others from the subsidy arguing that the establishment clause prohibits the funding of such religious activity but the court rejected the argument it held the object of the saf to be to open forum for speech and the universitys exclus ion of the religious publication as consequence to constitute viewpoint di scrimination violative of the free speech clause of the first amendment the saf was not tax used to support church the court said but essentially amounted to re ligiously neutral fund to promote private student speech the court said the universitys policy of exclusion itself threatened to violate the establishment clause because the university would then have to scrutinize every publication and determine when its religious content was too great justice oconnor the decisive vote in the case stressed in concurring opinion the factors that the publications were genuinely independent of the university that the payments were made not dir ectly to the sponsoring student organizations but to the printer that numerous publications were s ubsidized and that students could at least hypothetically seek refund for any portion of their fees used for speech with which they disagreed these factors convinced he r she said that providing assistance in this case would not carry the danger of impermissible use of public funds to endorse wide awakes religious message in short since 1980 the court has rea ffirmed that the establishment clause prohibits government from promoting religious faith in the public schools but it

themselves on public school premises and that the establishment clause does not trump the free speech clause with respect to religious speech in public forum created by university b religion in the public square prior to 1980 the court had rendered several decisions involving religious ex pression in settings other than the public schools in series of cases in the 1940s largely involving the jehovahs witnesses the court established that the free speech clause of the first amendment provides broad protection for religious solicitation and proselytizing held unconstitutional were ordinances and policies that gave local officials unf ettered discretion to grant or deny permits to speak in public parks192 taxed the sale of religious literature by itinerant evangelists193 and resident booksellers194 and barred the doortodoor distribution of religious handbills195 the court did affirm the legitimacy of neutral time place and manner restrictions on speech in public places where the restrictions were genuinely unrelated to th content of the speech involved196 and it affirmed as well the legitimacy of restrictions on the use of children in religious solicitations under states labor laws197 but it generally established the principle that government is constitutionally ba rred from restricting speech in public places whether religious or nonreligi ous because of its content in these and other cases the court so developed the notion of the public forum ie that certain sites are by their natu re and history par ticularly appropriate for speech activities198 it also posited

greater latitude it can impos regulations that are reasonable so long as the regulations are not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speakers view200 the court has applied this framework of analysis in six cases relating to religious speech and solicitation in such public fora as state fair an airport terminal school audito rium and other school facilities it has also addressed whether muni cipality can require doortodoor religious canvassers to first obtain license in ddition it has in three cases attempted for the first time to delineate what

by designation are devoted to expressi on government may not prohibit or censor religious speech without compelling r eason or under regulations that are not viewpoint neutral in sixth case it has held that doortodoor canvassing by religious groups cannot be subjected to muni cipal licensing and it has also held that in regulating charitable solicitations government must act in an evenhanded manner ie it cannot favor some religi ous solicitations over others but the court has also reaffirmed that government can im pose reasonable time place and manner restrictions heffron v international

distributing free religious literature on pedestrian walkway in the airport the court without d eciding whether the terminal constituted traditional public forum limited public forum or nonpublic

was not limited to expressive activity that might be disruptive or create congestion but prohib ited even talking and reading or the wearing of campaign buttons or symbolic clothing ceivable governmental interest she stated could justify ch an absolute prohibition of speech203 in international society for kris hna consciousness inc v lee204 the court did reach the question of whether public airpor t terminals are traditional or designated public fora for free speech purposes and it held that they are not as consequence the court held that the airport authority in this instance needed only rational basis for its regulations thus it held 63 that the authority could constitutionally ban the solicitation of funds in the terminals becau it was reasonable to surmise that the inperson solicitation of funds would be disruptive pose risks of duress and fraud and foster congestion but different majority of the justices held 54 that the airport authority could not prohibit religious groups from distributing literature in the airport terminals justices kennedy blackm stevens and souter asserted that the terminals were public fora and that the ban on literature distribution was unconstitutional because it was not drawn in narrow term s and did not leave open ample alternative channels of comm unication however justice oconnor casting the deciding vote

hours and that the school property was repeatedly used by wide variety of private organizations the court said there wa s realistic danger that the community would think that the district was endorsing religion or any par ticular creed and any benefit to religion or to the church w ould have been more than incidental207 similarly in good news club v milford central school208 the court reiterated that public school district cannot consis tent with the free speech clause open its facilities for general community use after school hours but deny their use for religious worship and discussion by religious club in this instance the school district had adopted policy allowing general community use but barred their use for religious purposes and pursuant to that policy it d refused permission to religious club open to elementary school children that wa nted to meet on school property after the end of the school day the court held that refusal to violate the free speech clause 63

ings of other groups allowed to use the facilities such as the boy scouts the girl scouts and the 4h club the court also rejected the argument that use of the sc hools facilities by the club would violate the establishment clause it said that allowing such use would simply treaty the club neutrally the religious conduct involve d was wholly private and not school sponsored and there was more risk th at the elementary school children would perceive such use to constitu school endorsement of re ligion than the danger that they would perceive hostility toward th religious viewpoint if the club were excluded from the public forum in watchtower bible tract society of new york inc v stratton ohio209 the court held the free speech clause to be vi olated by village ordinance that barred individuals and organizations including re ligious proselytizers from going doorto door in the community unless they first obtained permit from the mayors office the court said that if the ordinance had applied only to commercial activities and the solicitation of funds it arguably woul d have been tailored to the villages interests in protecting the privacy of its residents and preventing fraud but it asserted the fact that it applied to religious and political causes as well made it offensive not only to the va lues protected by the first amendment but to the very notion of free society the villages claimed interests in preventing fraud protecting the privacy of its residents and preventing crime it concluded could not justify such sweeping requirement on speech the decision was 81 finally in larson v valente210 the court made clear that government cannot favor some religious organiza tions and disfavor others in regulating solicitations forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs48 211 id at 244 212 465 us 668 1984contributions minnesota st atute required charitable orga nizations to register and file annual reports with the state as c ondition of soliciting funds within the state but exempted religious organizations from these requirements if they received more than 50 percent of their contributions from thei r own members the court stating that the clearest command of the establishment clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officia lly preferred over another211 held this 50 percent rule to constitute denominational preference the statute justice brennan asserted for the court distinguished between wellestab lished churches supported largely by their own members and new religious organizati ons that for practical or policy reasons sought support from the public at large because the statute i nvolved such preference the court analyzed its cons titutionality not only unde r the tripartite test but under strict scrutiny test the trip artite test was violat ed justice brennan wrote because the measure involved relig ious gerrymandering by the legislature the legislative debate on the measure he said showed an intent that certain religions were to be favored others disfavored in addition th court held the measure to violate the strict scrutiny test the protection of the states citizens from abusive practices in the solicitation of funds for charity justice brennan wrote constituted sufficiently compelling governmental intere st under the strict scrutiny test but the means chosen to effectuate that interest were not closely fitted to that purpose nothing validated the assumptions that organizations receiving more than 50 percent of their funds from their own members w ould be closely supervised by those members that such membership control was an adequate safeguard against abusive or fraudulent solicitations of th public or that the need for public disclosure rises in proportion to the percentage of nonmembe r contributions thus the court held the measure failed to meet the requirements of the strict scrutiny test the decision was by 54 margin 2 display of religious symbols none of the decisions recounted in the preceding subsection was par ticularly surprising but since 1980 the court has broken new ground in addressing the constitutional paramete rs governing the display of religious symbols on public property in two decisions the court held that government cannot itself display or give preference to the display by others of particular religious symbols on public pr operty but that it can include religious symbols in generally secular holiday displays in third decision the court made clear that private sponsors of religious sy mbols have constituti onal right to display the symbols in traditional public fora so long as the circumstances of the display do not connote governme ntal endorsement in lynch v donnelly212 the issue was the constitutionality of municipalitys inclusion of creche as part of seasona l christmas display in local park the display included not only the creche but also such items as talking wishing well santas house small village candystr iped poles grouping of carolers and musicians reindeer pulling santas sleig h hundreds of colored lights and large banner reading seasons greetings all of the items in the display including the creche had been purchased by the city nd were maintained and erected each year by city workers in 54 decision holding th inclusion of the creche in the display tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs49 213 492 us 573 1989 214 chief justice rehnquist and justices white scalia and kennedybe constitutional the court said the critical fact was that there was an unbroken history of official acknowledg ment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in american life such items as the designation of thanksgiving and christmas as national holidays the hiri ng of chaplains by the congress the designation of the phrase in god we trust as the nations motto and its inscription on our coins and currency th annual national day of pray er the display of religious paintings in public museums all gave evidence chief justice burger wrote for the court of governments accommodation of all faiths and all forms of religious expression and hostility toward none the creche he said was simply another permissible accommodation in the context of the christmas season he stated the creche was an essentially passive symbol that promoted christianity or religion generally more than numerous other in stances of government acknowledgment of religion although the creche had religious significance he conc luded its essential purpose in the display was simply to depict the historical origins of this traditional event long recognized as national holiday similarly the court in county of allegheny v amer ican civil liberties union greater pittsburgh chapter213 upheld as constitutional pitts burghs display of large christmas tree an 18foot high menorah nd sign designating the display to be salute to liberty in front of the c itycounty building during the christmas season the case produced numerous concurrences nd dissents and on this issue there was majority opinion but justice kenne dy for four members of the court214 reiterated the lynch rationale that the tree and menor ah were purely passive symbols of religious holidays and that by usin g them the city simply acknowledged the historical background and the religious as we ll as secular nature of the chanukah and christmas holidays the display he asse rted did not use the governments power to coerce to further the interests of chri stianity or judaism in any way justices blackmun and oconnor concurred in sepa rate opinions that this display was constitutional on the grounds that the displa as whole did not convey government endorsement of either chri stianity or judaism but instead communicated message of pluralism and fr eedom of belief but in county of allegheny the court also in bitterly disputed holding held unconstitutional countys display of creche by itself on the grand staircase of the county courthouse during the christmas s eason the creche bore an angel at its crest proclaiming gloria in excelsis deo and was erected each year by private catholic mens organization the count decorated the area around the creche each year with poinsettias evergreen trees and christmas wreaths and invited choirs to participate in daily program of christmas carols performed with the creche in the foreground justice blackmun writing for the court on this issue employed justice oconnors endorsement test as the applicable principl in the case and found that the creche communicated an indisputably religious message moreover he said unlike in lynch nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creches religious message its display by itself in the main and most beautiful part of the building that was the seat of county g overnment he stated sent an unmistakable message that the government supports nd promotes the christian praise to godhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs50 215 515 us 753 1995 216 463 us 783 1983that is the creches religious message by endorsing patently christian message he concluded the display violat ed the establishment clause the third case in this area involved the di splay of private religious symbol in public park adjacent to an important government building the ku klux klan sought to erect cross in the public square in front of ohios state capitol building during the christmas season but had b een rebuffed for the alleged reason its placement in that location would comm unicate governmental endorsement of religion but in capitol square review and advisory board v pinette215 the court by 72 margin held the public square to be public forum traditionally available for all kinds of expression and held the estab lishment clause not to justify the states prohibition on the erection of the cross government can censor speech in traditional public forum only if it has compelling reason for doing so justice scalia wrote for the court but the establishment clause is not such reason in this context our precedent he stated establishes that private religious speech far from being first amendment orphan is as fully protected under the free sp eech clause as secular private expression five justi ces further examined whether the placement of the cross in proximity to the state capitol might communicate governmental endorsement of religion but given the history of the squares use for expressive purposes and the presence of sign disclaiming governme ntal endorsement concluded that it would not in sum these cases confirm that the establishment clause permits government to include religious symbol in predominantly secular holiday display but also that the clause prohibits government from displaying or permitting others to display quintessential religious symbols by themse lves at governmental sites that are not public forums the cases further establish that in forums that are traditional sites of free expression the display of religious sym bols by private parties is fully protected by the free speech clause unless the circumstances communicate message of governmental endorsement of religion to reasonable obser ver but these principles are tenuous these three cases have b een among the most bitterly disputed establishment clause decisions on the court and as consequence it seems possible that the issue of the constitutional parameters governing the display of religious symbols might be revisited by the court in the future 3 legislative chaplaincies despite the long history of chaplains and prayers in legislative assemblies the c ourt did not have occasion to address the constitutionality of the practice until 1983 in marsh v chambers216 the court by 63 margin held legislative chaplain cy sponsored and funded by the state of nebraska not to violate the establishment clause as previously noted in deciding this case the court for the first time eschewed use of the tripartite test relying instead on two aspects of the history of the practice stating that the opening of sessions of legislative and other public bodies with prayer is deeply embedded in the historyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs51 217 id at 786 218 id at 788 219 id at 792 220

the court first observed th at legislative sessions had been opened with prayer for more than two centuries on the national level and more than century in nebraska but secondly and more importantly the court relied upon the acts of the first congress in concl uding that the establishment clause does not proscribe legislative prayer only three days prior to giving final approval to the bill of rights chief justice burger wrote for the court both houses of the first congress authorized the appointment of paid chaplains thus he concluded clearly the men who wrote the first amendment did not view paid legislative chaplains and opening prayers as viola tion of that amendment218 to invoke divine guidance on public body entrusted with making th laws the court found is simply tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country219 c public aid to re ligious organizations among the establishment clause issues that have stirred passionate political and legal controversy the constitutionality of public aid to religious organizations has been the subject of more supreme court decisions than any other yet the issue persists and it is one area in which loosened construction of the tablishment clause could have profound effects that reinterpretation clearly is occurring the courts ten decisions in this area since 1980 have expanded the extent to which government can assist religious enterprises both directly nd indirectly and in two of its most recent decision the court for the first time overturned some of its prior establishment clause cases which had limited particular forms of direct aid prior to the 1980s the court had construe d the establishment clause to impose substantial although not abso lute constraints on public ai d to religious institutions direct public aid the court had said must be limited to secular neutral and nonideological purposes220 direct support could be provided to the secular programs and services sponsored or provi ded by religious organizations but not to such organizations religious activities or proselytizing as consequence the court struck down numerous aid programs benef itting sectarian elementary and secondary schools because the court found these institu tions to be perva sively sectarian ie so permeated by religious purpose and ch aracter that their secular functions and religious functions were inextricably intertwined under the tripartite lemon test direct aid to such institutions was found ither to have an inevitable effect of advancing religion or if the government attempted to limit the aid to secular use only to result in the excessive entang lement of governme nt and the assisted institutions as the government monitored the institutions use of the aid to be sure the secular use limitation was honored221 on the other hand the court had found direct public aid to religious institutions that were not pervasively sectarian such

the courts rationale was that such institutions were essentially secular in nature and thus the public aid did not resulted in the advancem ent of religion and did not lead to the excessively entangling monitoring required of direct aid to pervasively sectarian entities222 indirect aid benefitting sectarian elementa ry and secondary schools had also been held unconstitutional by the court prior to the 1980s in committee for public education v nyquist and sloan v lemon223 programs providing both tax benefits and tuition grants were held unconstitutional by the court because they were designed to benefit only the parents of private schoolch ildren and most of the institutions that ultimately benefited from the assistance were pervasively sectarian224 significantly however the court in these cases specifically reserved the question of the constitutionality of public ssistance made available ge nerally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian or pub licnonpublic nature of the ins titution benefitted225 the courts indirect aid decisions si nce 1980 have addressed this reserved question and upheld as constitutional tuiti on grant tax benef it and education assistance programs that indirectly provide economic benefits to pervasively sectarian schools but that have been made availa ble without regard to the sectarian nonsectarian or publicnonpublic nature of the institution benefitted moreover in its most recent decision the court in zelman v simmonsharris loosened the constitutional strictures on ducation voucher programs in such manner that most such programs appear likely to be able to pass constitutional muster in addition the court has substantially revised its prior establishment clause jurisprudence concerning direct aid to sectarian schools it has held it to be constitutional for public school teachers to pr ovide remedial edu cational services to sectarian school children on the premises of the schools they attended and for instructional materials and quipment to be loaned to sectarian schools in both instances the court overturned prior c onflicting decisions the court has also virtually eliminated pervasive sectarianism as constitutional criterion 1 direct assistance programs in school district of the city of grand rapids v ball226 and aguilar v felton227 the court in 1985 held unconstitutional programs

agostini v felton228 the court overturned aguilar and this part of ball as well as the related parts of the earlier decisions of meek v pittenger229 and wolman v walter230 as result it is once again constitutionally permissible for public school teachers to provide remedial and enrichment educational services to sectarian school children on the premises of the schools they attend prior to 1980 in meek v pittenger supra and wolman v walter supra the court had also held unconstitutional direct aid programs that provided instructiona l materials other than text books and equipment directly to sectarian elementary and secondary schools but in mitchell v helms231 the court overturned those decisions and held such program to be constitutional the program in ball was locally funded but aguilar involved new york citys implementation of the federal title i program for educationally disadvantaged children232 in both programs the teachers were public school employees the services were provided on the premises of the pr ivate schools and the schools involved were almost all pervasively sectarian but new york citys program included as well an extensive system of controls including onsite monitoring to ensure that the teachers did not engage in religious activities or religious instruction the court by identical margins of 5 4 struck down the grand rapids program on the grounds it had primary effect of advancing religion and the new york city program for the reason it precipitated exce ssive entanglement between church and state the establishment clause justi ce brennan wrote for the court absolutely prohibits governmentfinanced or gove rnmentsponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of particul ar religious faith233 the grand rapids program he said posed substantial risk of statesponsored indoctr ination in three ways the pervasively religious nature of the schools he asse rted might cause the teachers to conform their instruction to the environment in which they teach234 the program created symbolic union of government and re ligion that conveyed message of government endorsement of the religious faith of the aided institutions and the program subsidized the religious functions of the aided schools by taking over substantial portion of their responsib ility for teaching secular subjects235 new york city argued in aguilar that its system of controls ensured that its title i program did not have these unconstitutional effects but without addressing that issue the court held that the system of monitoring and controls itself unconstitutionally

establishment clause to prevent as far as possible the intrusion of either c hurch or state into the precincts of the other236 notwithstanding the worthwhile soci purpose of the program he said it created the specter of government agents prowling the halls of religious schools to ward off the infiltration of religious thought subsequently majority of the justi ces on the court expressed desire to reconsider these decisions237 and in 1997 in agostini v felton supra the court did so along with its earlier rulings on similar programs in meek v pittenger supra and wolman v walter supra each of the assumptions on which those decisions had been based justice oconnor wrote for th court had been undermined by more recent decisions in zobrest v catalina foothills school district238 she said the court repudiated the notion that the pl acement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably leads to religious indoctrination as well as the assumption that such placement creates an impermissible symbolic link between government and religion in zobrest and witters v washington department of services for the blind239 she asserted the court rejected the notion that all government aid that directly aids the educa tional function of religious schools is unconstitutional finally she said absent the assumption that public teachers in sectarian school necessarily pose serious risk of incu lcating religion the assumption that pervasive monitoring of such teachers is required is also longer valid thus she concluded the constitutionality of the programs should be evaluated under the criterion of neutrality ie whether aid is allocated on th basis of neutral secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on nondiscriminatory basis finding the title i program to meet that test she state d accordingly we must acknowledge that aguilar as well as the portion of ball addressing grand rapids shared time program are longer good law grand rapids had also held second progra m funded and opera ted by the city to be unconstitutional and that ruling was not disturbed by the agostini decision in that program the community education program the city paid parochial school teachers to provide an array of before nd after school programs to the students who attended their schools and impos ed restrictions regarding religious content the court found the program to constitute aid to the institution rather than to the students and held it to inescapably have the primary effect of providing

items as computers computer software library books filmstrip projector s overhead projectors television sets vcrs maps globes and printers the c ourt issued majority opinion in the case however instead justice thomas joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia and kennedy held the program not to violate the establishment of religion clause because the aid was made availabl to public and private schools alike on religiously neutral basis nd was secular in content justice oconnor joined by justice breyer concurred that the prog ram was constitutional but on the grounds not only that eligibility for assistance was determined on religiously neutral basis but also that the use of the assistance was subject to number of statutory and regulatory restrictions to secular use and there was evidence the aid had been diverted for religious purposes justices souter gi nsberg and stevens dissented on the grounds the schools were pervasively sectarian and the aid consequently materially advanced the religious mission of the sectarian schools in so ruling the court overturned parts of its prior decisions in meek v pittenger supra and wolman v walter supra the reasoning of the justices in the two opinions comprising the majority in mitchell also made clear that pervasive sectarianism is longer deemed to be fatal to an aid programs constitutionality justice thomas opined that so long as aid is dispensed on religiously neutral basis and is secular in nature nothing in the establishment clause bars the recipient institution from using it for religious purposes justice oconnor asserted that public aid still had to be limited to secular use in the recipient institutions but that there was reason to assume that such limita tion could not be honored in religious elementary and secondary schools thus as in agostini she saw reason for close government monitoring of the institutions use of the aid that might be excessively entangling at the college level the court by 54 margin held in rosenberger v the rector and visitors of the university of virginia240 that when public university creates forum for the expression of student opinions it cannot exclude student religious opinions in this instance the university of virginia fostered the creation of publications by student organizations by paying their printing bills out of the student activities fund saf however it excluded religious publications among others from the subsidy arguing that the establishment clause prohibits the funding of such religious activity but the court rejected the argument it held the object of the saf to be to open forum for speech and the universitys exclusion of the religious publication as consequence to constitute viewpoi nt discrimination violative of the free speech clause of the first amendment the saf was not tax used to support church the court said but essentially amounted to religiously neutral fund to promote private student speech the court said the universitys policy of exclusion itself threatened to vi olate the establishment clause because the university would then have to scrutinize every publication and determine when its religious content was too great justi ce oconnor the decisi ve vote in the case stressed in concurring opinion the fact ors that the publications were genuinely independent of the university that the pa yments were

religious message finally outside the school context the court in bowen v kendrick241 upheld as facially constitutional 54 provisions of the adolescent family life act242 afla which permitted grants for pregnancy prevention and care services to adolescents to be made to religious organi zations and which mandated that all grantees devise ways of involving other organizations including religious ones in the delivery of such services the court applied the same principles under the tripartite test as it had in past school aid cases and held the establishm ent clause not to automatically foreclose all religious organizations from participating in public ly funded program such as afla chief justice rehnquist writing for the court reiterated that direct public grants cannot be given to pervasively sect arian organizations or otherwise used for religious purposes but he rejected the cont ention that grants whatsoever can be given under the statute to religious organizations243

sectarian and whether particular grants might have been used for religious purposes244 2 indirect assistance programs in four other decisions involving sectarian elementary and secondary sc hools

for educational expenses incurred by all parents including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools250 program that neutrally provides state assistance to broad spectrum of citizens he concluded is not readily subject to challenge under the establishment clause he stressed as well that the assistance was extended to parents rather than directly to sectarian schools because where aid to parochial schools is available onl as result of decisions of individual parents imprimatur of stat approval can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion or on religion generally251 the courts decision in mueller was 54 but in witters v washington department of services for the blind the court was unanimous in upholding as constitutional state vocational rehabilitation grant to blind person who wanted to use the grant to train for religious ministry justice marshall who had dissented in mueller made reference to mueller in his opinion for the court but he emphasized as had mueller that any aid provided under washingtons program that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as result of the genuinely independent and private c hoices of aid recipients252 the fact that aid goes to individuals he said means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual not by the state253 he also emphasized that there was likelihood that any substantial portion of the vocational rehabilitation grants would be used for such religious purposes but five justices filed concurring opinions making clear that they did not regard the substantiality of aid that might go for religious purposes to be constitutionally significant issue in zobrest v catalina foothills school district the court was again sharply divided 54 the case involved the provision of sign language interpreter pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act idea254 to deaf high school student who wanted to attend catho lic school using the reasoning of mueller and witters the court held the assistance not to violate the establishment clause the service at issue in this case the court sai d is part of genera l government program that distributes benefits neutrally to an child qualifying as handicapped under the idea without regard to the sectaria nnonsectarian or public nonpublic nature of the school the child attends thus it asserted the presence of signlanguage interpreter in sectarian school is the re sult not of state decisionmaking but

general program that is in way skewed towards religion the court conc luded does not offend the establishment clause mueller and witters it should be noted did not overturn the courts earlier decisions holding unconstitutional indirect aid to universe of private elementary and secondary schools that was predomin antly sectarian as noted above255 committee for public education v nyquist and sloan v lemon had specifically reserved the question addressed in mueller and witters ie the constitutionality of assistance made available without regard to th sectariannonsectarian or publicnonpublic nature of the institutions ultimately benefitted the critical distinction between nyquist and sloan on the one hand and mueller and witters on the other was whether the initial beneficiaries of the governments assistance possessed genuinely free choice about whether to use the ssistance at sectar ian or nonsectarian institution if the government had shaped that decision by limiting the universe of choice to institutions that were predominantly sectarian as in nyquist and sloan the assistance even though indirect was found unconstitutional if the universe of choice was genuinely unfe ttered and independent how ever the assistance was upheld even though sectarian institutions received some or even substantial economic benefit from it nonetheless in its most recent decision in zelman v simmonsharris256 the court narrowed the precedential scope of nyquist and sloan and made it significantly easier for voucher programs to pass constitutional muster again by 54 margin the court in zelman upheld as constitutional pr ogram that gave lowincome children in failing public schools in clevel and ohio voucher that they could use to attend private schools in the city more than 80 percent of the schools participating were religious in nature however and as result 96 percent of the eligible children chose to attend such schools but notwithstanding the predominance of religious schools in the universe of private schools open to the voucher children the court still found that th program gave the parents and their children true private choice in contrast to its previous decisions the court said the universe of choices available to vouc her children was not limited to the private schools where the vouchers could be redeem ed but included all of the educational choices available to them in clevela nd including various public school options chief justice rehnquist stated for the court cleveland schoolchildren enjoy range of educational choices they may remain in public school as before remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid obtain scholarship and choose re ligious school obtain scholarship and choose nonreligious private school enroll in community school or enroll in magnet school that 46 of the 56 private schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as violation of the establishment clause the establishment clause question is whether ohio is coercing parents into sending their children to religious schools and thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs59 257 id at 4688 258

thus he concluded the voucher progra m satisfied the requirements of the establishment clause the program served the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children in demonstrably failing public school system the aid was distributed to the initial recipients on religionneutral basis ie vouchers were available to all children in failing public schools finally the initial recipients had genuine choice among options public and private secular and religious in sum then the court since 1980 has va lidated broader range of both direct and indirect assistance than was thought to be constitutionally permissible prior to 1980 d governmental solicitude for religion the courts diminution of the protection afforded religious practices by the free exercise of religion clause has been detailed in the first section above and will not be reiterated here as noted there except with respect to eligibility for unemployment benefits when there is conflict between the requirements of job and an individuals religious precepts an asyet undefined area of hybrid claims and government actions that intentionally discriminate against religion the courts decisions on free exer cise since 1980 seem to mean that the free exercise clause interposes barrier to governmental restriction of religious practices thr ough evenhanded regulations but seven cases during the 1980s concerne d related dimension of the religion clauses ie deliberate government efforts to protect individual and institutional religious practices if the free exercise clause does not mandate special protection for religious practices may gove rnment nonetheless give re ligion special privileges or require private entities in society to accomm odate religious practi ces in its seven decisions the court upheld government policies that prohibit employers from discriminating on religious grounds as we ll as policies that exempt religious employers from such prohibitions but the court also made clear that government cannot in the guise of protecting religi on give religious practices an absolute preference over other individual and societ concerns nor ma it give particular religious groups special accommodations that may not be available to nonreligious groups in similar circumstances four cases in particular illuminated the limits on what government can do to protect religion in larkin v grendels den258 the court held unconstitutional 81 massachusetts statute that gave church veto power over the issuance of liquor licenses to nearby enterprises the stat ute provided that liquor licenses could not be issued for enterprises located within 500 feet of church or school if the governing body of such church or school files written objection thereto in this particular case church near harvard square in cambri dge had objected to the issuance of liquorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs60 259 472 us 703 1985 260 489 us 1 1989 261 512 us 687 1994license to an adjacent restaurant nd the cambridge license commission had in conformity with the statute denied the rest aurants application despite the fact that 25 establishments within 500 feet of the church already were so licensed chief justice burger writing for the court conceded that the state had valid secular interest in using its zoning powers to protect spiritual cultural and educational centers from the hurlyburly associated with liquor outlets but the means used in this instance he said enmeshed churches in the exercise of substantial governmental powers contrary to our consistent interpretation of the establishment clause the core rationale of the establishment clause he said was to prevent the fusion of governmental and religious functions but the statute in this case symbolically joined church and state in joint exercise of legislative authority failed to require that churches exercise their veto power in relig iously neutral way permitted religious institutions to exercise important discretionary governmental powers and created the danger of political fragmentation along religious lines for those reasons he concluded the statute br eached the figurative wall of separation that insulates religion and government from each other similarly in estate of thornton v caldor inc259 the court struck down 81 connecticut statute which gave every employee an absolute right not to work on whatever day of the week the employee designated as the sabbath chief justice burger writing for the court said that the statute imposes on employers and employees an absolute duty to conform their business practices to the particular religious practices of the employee and commands that sabbath religious concerns automatically control over all secular interests at the workplace because of the absolute nature of that preference he c oncluded the statute had primary effect of advancing the religious practice of sa bbath observance in violation of the establishment clause again in texas monthly inc v bullock260 the court struck down 63 texas statute that exempted only publications published or distributed by religious faith and advancing the tenets of that faith from the states sales tax although none of the four opinions issued on the matter had the s upport of majority of the court five of the justices held the establishment clause to forbid such an exclusive preference for religious publications justices br ennan marshall and stevens found the narrowness of the exemption to constitute s tate sponsorship of religious belief and to be blatant endorsement of religion justices bl ackmun and oconnor said that by confining the tax exemption exclusively to the sale of religious publications texas engaged in preferential support for the communication of religious messages such statutory preference they said was constitutionally intolerable finally in board of education of the kiryas joel village school district v grumet261 the court held unconstitutional new york statute which sought to accommodate the special education needs of children belonging to the satmar hasidic sect by creating public educati on district whose boundaries coincided withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs61 262 483 us 327 1987 263 42 usc 2000e et seq 264 id 2000e1 265 479 us 60 1986 266 42 usc 2000ej 1988the boundaries of the village inhabited by the sect the satmar had refused to send their special needs children to sites outside the village because of the panic fear and trauma that resulted from leaving their insular community and associating with people whose ways were so different so the new york legislature adopted special statute creating public school di strict with boundaries identical to the satmar village in order to make them eligible for special education funds to subsidize services for their special needs children within the village but the supreme court said 63 that the statute crosses the line from permissible accommodation to impermissible establishment and violates the test of neutrality there was assurance justice souter wr ote for the court that similar group would be similarly treated in the future the constitutional vice of the statute he said was that it singled out particular religious s ect for special treatment and delegated significant governmental power to an ectorate defined by common religious belief and practice in manner that fails to foreclose religious favoritism but in corporation of the presiding bishop of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints v amos262 the court unanimously upheld the exemption of religious institutions from the relig ious nondiscrimination in employment requirements of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 title vii prohibits most public and private employers from discriminating in their employment practices on the grounds of race color nati onal origin sex and religion263 section 702 of that statute however exempts religious ins titutions from the religious nondiscrimination requirement ie such institutions can discriminate in their employment practices on religious grounds although not on the other prohibited grounds264 in this case an employee dismissed for religious reasons from job with nonprofit health facility run by the mormon church challenged th constitutionality of the exemption but the court held it to be permissible for government to alleviate significant governmental interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious missions even though the exemption applied to all the activities of religious organizations and not just their religious ones and even though it applied only to religious organizations justice white wrote for the court it met the requirements of the tripartite test two other cases involving religious discrimination in employment were resolved on statutory grounds in ansonia board of education v philbrook265 the court construed the reasonable accommoda tion requirement of title vii not to require an employer to accede to an employees preferred accommodation but simply to require proffer of reasonable resoluti on of the conflict to effectuate its ban on religious discr imination in employment title vii requires employers to reasonably accommodate their employees religious observances and practices unless to do so causes undue hardship on the conduct of the employers business266httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs62 267 479 us at 68 268 481 us 615 1987 269 42 usc 1981 1988 270 jones v alfred h mayer co 392 us 409 1968 271 319 us 105 1943 272 321 us 573 1944 273 397 us 664 1970at issue in this case was whether the employer had to accept an employees preferred accommodation unless it could show that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship the court held that it di d not 72 by its very terms chief justice rehnquist wrote for the court t he statute directs that any reasonable accommodation by the employer is sufficient to meet its accommodation obligation267 finally in shaare tefila congregati on v cobb268 the court unanimously construed federal statute to permit jewish congregation to seek civil damages from persons who had desecrated its synagogue with antisemitic slogans phrases and symbols the statute in question adopt ed shortly after the civil war guarantees all citizens the same right as is enjoye d by white citizens to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property269 and has been construed by the court to prohibit private racially motivated interference with property rights270 although jews today are not considered di stinct race justice white concluded for the court that they are within the protecti on of the statute because at the time the statute was adopted jews and arabs were among the peoples then considered to be distinct races thus he said jews can bring suit for civil damages under section 1982 against persons who interfere with th eir property rights and are motivated by racial animus against jews taxation of religious entities number of cases since 1980 have concerned the constitutionality of various taxes imposed on religious organizations and individuals and in its decisions th court has made clear that government possesses substantial discretion in this area of the law the court previously had made few forays into this subject in the 1940s cases of murdock v pennsylvania271 and follett v mccormick272 the court had struck down as unconstitutional the imposition of license and ccupation taxes on itinerant evangelists the court found such taxes to operate as prior restraint on religious proselytizing and thus to tend to suppress such evangelizing in viola tion of the first amendment moreover in 1970 in walz v tax commission of new york273 the court upheld as constitutional property tax exemption afforded by new rk city to religious organizations 81 without quite saying that the exempti on was constitutionally mandated the court emphasized that the tax exemption of churches from property taxes created lesser degree of government entang lement with religion than would the contrary policy while direct money subsidy might precipitate relationship pregnant with involvement and encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory and administrative standards the court said tax exemption simply means that government abstains from demanding that the churchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs63 274 id at 673 275 id at 676 276 455 us 252 1981 277 26 usc 1402g 1988 278 455 us

but agreed that such condition did not infringe the schools free exercise rights see id at 622 n 3 281 493 us 378 1990support the state274 the court also stressed that the exemption was available not just to religious organizations but also to property owned by hospitals libraries playgrounds scientific professional historical and pa triotic groups and that the tax exemption of churches has been part of our national life since colonial times it concluded that if tax exemption can be seen as the first step toward establishment of religion the sec ond step has been long in coming275 in its more recent decisions the court while generally reaffirming these precedents has not erected any other c onstitutional barriers to the imposition of general taxes on religious indivi duals and organizations in united states v lee276 the court unanimously upheld the imposition of the employers portion of the social security tax on an amish employer notw ithstanding the amish specific religious belief against contributing to public so cial insurance system congress had by statute exempted selfemployed amish from paying such taxes277 but the court still held the extension of the exemption to mish employers holding such beliefs not to be constitutionally ma ndated the tax imposed on employers to support the social security system the court said must be uniformly applicable to all except as congress provides explicitly otherwise278 similarly in bob jones university v united states279 the court upheld the irs revocation of the income tax exemption of religious university that on the basis of its religious beliefs discriminated on the basis of race the government has fundamental overriding intere st in eradicating racial discrimination in education the court stated and that interest subs tantially outweighs wh atever burden denial of tax benefits places on petitioners ex ercise of their religious beliefs280 again in the jimmy swaggart ministries v board of equalization of california281 the court upheld californias impositi on of general sales and use taxes on religious organizations direct and mail order sales of religious literature the ministries argued that the taxes unduly bur dened its ability to carry out its religious ministry and created excessive administrative entanglement between government and itself but the court asserted that the taxes were imposed neutrally on all retail sales and did not single out religious activity for special and burdensome treatment it further asserted that any administrativ burden involved in collecting and remitting the taxes was not constitutionally significanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs64 282 490 us 680 1989 283 489 us 1 1989 284 id at 9 285 26 usc 33013311 1988 286 26 usc 3309b 1988 287 451 us 772 1981and in hernandez v commissioner of internal revenue282 the court upheld as constitutional irs denial of charitable tax deduction to members of the church of scientology for payments they had made for the church sacraments of auditing and training the charitable deduction the c ourt said was only available for genuine gifts not for payments made in return fo r goods or services such as the payments for auditing and training it said the ta x code provision was ne utral on its face was not born of animus to religi on in general or scientology in particular did not have primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting relig ion and required only routine regulatory interaction between gove rnment and religious organizations moreover while finding constitutional barriers to the imposition of taxes on religious organizations and individuals the court in one decision found the establishment clause to bar an exemption from taxation for religious entity in texas v bullock283 the court held unconstitutional 63 texas statute that exempted from the states sales and use taxes only those periodicals and books that promoted the teachings of religious faith although the justices articulated several different rationales for this conclusion majority appeared to agree that the establishment clause means not only that government may not be overtly hostile to religion but also that it may not place its prestige coercive authority or resources behind single religious faith or behind religious belief in general compelling nonadherents to support the practices or proselytizing of favored religious organizations and conveying the message th at those who do not contribute gladly are less than full members of the community284 to avoid the establishment clause flaw of appearing to sponsor or give preferen tial support to religious belief majority held tax benefit cannot be confined just to religious organizations but must flow to broad class of beneficiaries three other tax cases the court re solved on statut ory grounds without addressing any constitutional issues tw involved the federal unemployment tax act futa285 which requires employers to c ontribute to state unemployment insurance funds and both involved pr ovision of the act which exempts from coverage church or convention or association of churches or b an organization which is operated primar ily for religious purposes and which is operated supervised c ontrolled or principally supporte d by church or convention or association of churches286 the secretary of labor construed the legislative history of recent amendments to futa to mean that churchrelated primary and secondary schools were longer exempted from futa by that provision and thus were subject to the futa tax but in st martin evangelical lutheran church v south dakota287 the court held that construction of the act and its legislative history to be invalid the only reasonable construction of 26 usc 3309b1

stated is one that exempts pe titioners churchrun schools and others similarly operated from mandatory state coverage288 subsequently in california v grace brethren church289 the court refused to reach the question of whether the imposition of futa taxes on religious schools not affiliated with any church violated the establishment clause for the reason that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction to decide that issue the court held that the tax injunction act290 which generally bars the federal courts from enjoining the collection of state taxes where plain speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state applied to the case and that therefore th lower court should not have reached the constitutional issue finally in davis v united states291 the court unanimously construed the tax code not to permit the pa rents of two mormon missionaries to deduct the support they provided their sons to enable them to serve as missionaries the parents argued that their support constitute d either charitable contributions in themselves or unreimbursed expenditures incurred in the course of their sons contributions of services to the mormon church and thus should be ductible under 170 of the internal revenue code292 but the court held that their support did not constitute charitable contribution because it was not gi ven in any legally enforceable way for the benefit of the church and that they could not claim deduction for expenses incurred in the course of third partys contribution of services f other decisions of the remaining five churchstate decisions by the court since 1980 only one was decided on the merits in that case tony and susan alamo foundation v secretary of labor 293 the court unanimously upheld as constitutional the application of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the fair labor standards act294 to employees who worked in various commercial enterprises operated by re ligious organization the court found exception in the act for the commercial activities of religi ous or other nonprofit organizations and held the application of the flsa to be fully consistent with the requirements of the first amendment application of the flsa neither infringed on the employees religious convictions that they should not be paid wages for their work the court said nor did its record keeping requireme nts foster any excessive entanglement the routine and factual inquiries requi red by 211c bear resemblance the court stated to the kind of government surveillance the court has previously held to pose an

catholic conference v abortion rights mobilization inc296 held that two institutions of the church that had been held in civil contem pt for refusing to comply with discovery orders in suit challenging their taxexem pt status could even though they were non parties to the suit challenge the plaintiffs standing to institute the suit originally filed in 1981 the suit sought an injunction directing the irs to revoke the tax exempt status of the united states catholic conference and the national conference of catholic bishops on the grounds their politi cal activities with respect to abortion violated 501c3 of th internal revenue code297 the two bodies had been held in civil contempt by the district court wh they refused to comply with subpoenas from arm seeking evidence of their activities regarding abortion and the lower courts had refused to allow them to challenge arms standing to institute the suit in contesting the contempt citation the s upreme court reversed and held 81 that they could do so stating that the s ubpoena power of court cannot be more extensive than its jurisdiction on re mand federal appellate cour t brought this threat to the taxexempt status of the cat holic church to an end by holding that arm did not have standing and dismissing the suit298 in valley forge christian college v americans united for separation of church and state299 the court refused 54 to broa den the doctrine of standing to permit the disposition of surplus government property to sectarian institution to be challenged on establishment clause grounds the transaction of concern in this case was the disposition by the department of education of land and buildings worth more than half million dollars to an vowedly sectarian college without charge the court had previously held that taxpayer s have standing to challenge exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spe nding clause of article i 8 of the constitution that allegedly violate the establishment clause300 but in this case it described that exception to the general rule against taxpayer suits as narrow one and said it did not apply in this instance because the action in question was an executive one rather than congressional one and b ecause the authorizing legislation was an exercise of congress power under the pr operty clause of article iv of the constitution rather than of the taxing and spending power of article i the final two cases both involved civil rights but were dismissed for jurisdictional reasons in ohio civil rights commission v dayton

between state civ il rights statute and private schools religious belief and practice prior to the reso lution of that conflict by the state civil rights agency at issue was c onflict between the sex nondiscrimination requirements of an ohio statute302 and the nonrenewal by private christian school of the contract of teacher who had become pregnant pursuant to the schools religious belief that mothers of preschool children should remain at home lower federal appellate court had enjoined the investigation and resolution of the matter by the ohio civil rights commission on the grounds that the commissions efforts would violate the first amendment but the supreme court held that the lower courts should have abstained from deciding that issue younger v harris 303 the court said established the rule that fede ral courts should not enjoin pending state proceedings except in extraordinary circum stances both as matter of comity and out of proper respect for the fundamental role of states in our federal system the school would have ample opportunity to air its constitutional concerns the court said in the judicial review of the commissions decisions authorized by the ohio statute finally in equal employment opportunity commission v arabian american oil company304 the court held that the employ ment nondiscrimina tion requirements of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 do not apply to united states employers outside the united states naturalized us citizen claimed that he had been fired by the arabian american oil company in saudi arabia for reasons of race religion and national origin in violation of title vii but the court held that title vii could apply extraterritorially only if congress had affirmatively expressed its intention that it do so and it found the evidence that cong ress had so intended insufficient as consequence it affirmed the lower courts rulings dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction conclusion in his memorial and remonstrance against religious assessments james madison in 1785 warned of the danger that lurked if questions of religious liberty became entangled in precedents305 yet in the modern united states where the expansive claims and powers of governme nt conflict virtually daily with the requirements and expectations of one or another religious faith that is exactly what has happened the religion cl auses perhaps inevitably have become the subject of thousands of judicial precedentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9865crs68 306 engel v vitale 370 us at 431whether that fact poses danger to religious liberty is matter of opinion what is clear is that on the supreme court the struggle over the meaning and scope of the religion clauses has become both pe rsistent and intense on the one hand stands the view that union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion306 and that wall of separation best serves the interests of both on the other hand stands the pers pective that the relationship of government and religion should be predo minantly legislative matter rather than one subject to sweeping constitutional constrai nts and that government s hould be able in neutral and nondiscriminatory manner both to regulate religious practices and to accommodate and even assist religious gr oups since 1980 the latter perspective has come to predominate with respect to the free exercise clause and it has made substantial inroads with respect to the courts establishment clause jurisprudence as well it seems likely that the ferment on the court over the religion clauses will persist for some time only two of the justices that sat on the court at the beginning of the 1980s remain chief justice rehnquist nd justice stevens and they are polar opposites on the interpretation of the religion clauses but the new justices like many of their predecessors either have or are developing strong views on the meaning of the clauses thus the debate seems certain to
