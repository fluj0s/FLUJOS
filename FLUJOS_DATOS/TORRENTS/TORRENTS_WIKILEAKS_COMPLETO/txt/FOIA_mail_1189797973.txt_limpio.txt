from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu subject re recent wsj article date fri 14 sep 2007 152613 0400 replyto mannpsuedu cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk richard somerville richardsomervillewanadoofr kevin can you send the link once its up thanks mike kevin trenberth wrote mike you should have seen the first version i drafted that yesterday and then today toned it down i did add couple of points including the link you suggested will try to send off later today but just to naturecom thanks kevin michael mann wrote guys ive got few minutes before i have to head out again kevinthanks for helping return the nature blog to respectability after dubious startid like to direct realclimate readers to your piece as soon as it is up so please let know when that happens looks like phil has hit several of the key points but here are few more 1 the discrediting that akasofu cites has been discredited ipcc chapter 6 rejected the mcintyre and mckitricks claims in uncertain terms referencing the wahl and ammann work reprints attached who show that the reconstruction is readily reproducible and b mcintyre and mckitrick only failed to reproduce the reconstruction because of multiple errors on their part this is true in addition to the more general point that kevin has made that multiple independent studies confirm and in fact now extend the previous conclusions rather than contradict them 2 to the extent that the lia and mwp can be meaningfully defined there has been much work published in nature science etc showing that the main variations both in terms of hemispheric mean changes and spatial patterns can indeed be explained in terms of the response of the climate system to natural radiative forcing changes solar and volcanism only someone completely unfamiliar with the advances of the past ten years in climate science would claim that there are explanations for these 3 continuing in this theme to claim that the modern warming is some sort of rebound reflects thorough apparent lack of understanding of how the climate system works the climate doesnt rebound it responds with some lag to changes in radiative forcing the main patterns of variation of past centuries have been explained in terms of such responses to natural radiative forcing changes as shown in countless studies the late 20th century warming can only be explained in terms of the response to anthropogenic changes in radiative forcing kevin has more or less already made this point in different words in the current draft 4 the bogus talking point that co2 lagging the warming in the ice cores has been debunked countless times before and its an embarassment that it continues to be raised by one who ostensibly considers himself scientist this is total nonsense and nice refutation has been provided by eric steig on realclimate here 1httpwwwrealclimateorgindexphparchives200704thelagbetweentempandco2 perhaps worth just linking to that explanation kevin perhaps youre too gentle in attributing this simply to some confusion about the facts either mr akasofu has literally familiarity whatsoever with the advances in climate science of the past two decades or he has intentionally sought to deceive in either case his piece is embarassment finally let withdraw my initial suggestion for strategic reasons it might make sense to submit this as letter to editor to wsj easy and quick to do online and then publish it on the nature blog in short order i sea that as winwin because you can either call the wsj for refusing to run your letter which is very likely what will happen or use the nature blog piece to draw attention to your letter should wsj actually choose to publish your letter please dont hesitate to let know if i can be of any further help here will be back online bit later today mike phil jones wrote kevin few quick thoughts article is awful as we all know it is important to learn about past climate change especially over the past 1000 years but it is even important to use new and improved evidence from proxy sources ie not to cling to outdated concepts of the past such as the mwp and lia how can we ever hope to progress if we have conform to incorrect concepts on the early mid20th century warming look at the figures in ch 9 the decrease from 194075 didnt happen if you look at global records mbh was published in 1998 and wasnt just treering study the thames doesnt and never did freeze solid it did so 25 times between 1400 and 1820 only about 56 of these were frost fairs most of these have cet data so what is the use of the freeze dates he plucks various figures out of the air i think the reductions in arctic sea ice this summerseptember are alarming they are 20 below the 2005 record he comes from alaska has he not seen
