government government and finance division summary in 1990 termlimit advocates began their campaign to limit congressional terms by changing state laws amending state constitutions and passing state ballot initiatives rather than by amending the us constitution their strategy was to circumvent the more difficult and time consuming amendment process at the federal level and go directly to the voters and legislatures of each state by mid1995 voters or legislatures in 23 states had approved congressional term limits in 1995 however the us supreme court ruled that stateimposed limits on congressional tenure violate the constitution and that term limits can only be set through passage and ratification of an amendment to the us constitution since then termlimit supporters have been pressing congress to propose constitutional amendment encouraging state legislatures to pass resolutions calling on congress to propose constitutional amendment and campaign ing to elect more candidates who support congressional term limits in particular some termlimit advocates are also working to elect more candidates who pledge to limit themselves to three house terms and two senate terms background proponents contend that term limits would beneficially increase membership turnover and ensure constant influx of new members that they would partially offset incumbents builtin advantages and promote competitiveness in congressional elections and that they would enhance the role of merit rather than seniority in the distribution of power opponents argue that term limits would infringe on citizens rights to determine who serves and for how long remove many of the most competent and experienced members from office prematurely and result in shift of power from the legislative branch to the executive branch lobbyists and congressional staff proponents and opponents of term limits have sought support for their respective positions since the mid1970s when the recurring debate on congressional terms of office began to shift from length of term to length of service initially termlimit advocateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96152crs2 1 the other states are ak az ca

state level ie state initiatives and laws their objective was to bypass the cumbersome amendment process at the federal level and take the termlimits issue directly to the voters by means of ballot initiatives ballot initiatives 19901995 maximum service and ballot access laws from 1990 through mid1995 voters in arkansas and 20 other states passed ballot initiatives that would have amended their state constitutions or changed state laws to limit the tenure of their members of congress1 although the measures differed in their details most fell into one of two broad categories 1 specifying maximum number of terms or years that members would be allowed to serve either consecutively or within specified period or 2 prohibiting candidates name from appearing on the ballot if he or she had served beyond specified period or had been elected more than specified number of times measures of the latter type called ballot access proposals were part of strategy termlimit advocates adopted in an effort to deflect constitutional challenges the strategy of stateimposed limits on congressional tenure raised number of legal and constitutional questions one of which was whether state had the constitutional authority to limit the tenure of its members of congress on may 22 1995 the us supreme court in 5 to 4 decision struck down arkansas stateimposed congressional term limits as unconstitutional2 this effectively overturned the proposals in the other 22 states 20 states where voters had passed initiatives and two states where the legislature had passed congressional term limits 19961998 informed voter laws voter compliance laws and voter accountability laws some political observers believed that the thornton decision would end the effort of termlimit proponents to use the initiative process as part of their strategy to attain congres sional term limits they were wrong proponents circulated petitions to place another round of term limit initiatives on the 1996 ballot these initiatives known as informed voter laws voter compliance laws or voter accountability laws contained such provisions as the following httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96152crs3 3 only in missouri and south dakota the initiative applies solely to federal legislators and candidates for congress rather than state and federal lawmakers and candidates the states congressional delegation would be

the measure those who voted against it would have printed beside their names on ballots in subsequent elections some variation of the words disregarded failed to comply with or violated voter instructions on term limits nonincumbent candidates for congress would be offered the opportunity to sign termlimits pledge or the phrase declined to take pledge to support term limits would be printed beside their names on ballots the states secretary of state would be directed to determine which candidates and legislators were to have these statements printed beside their names candidates and legislators could appeal the states secretary of states decision to the state supreme court some opponents and political observers dubbed these measures scarlet letter laws because of the ballot notations initiatives of this type were on the november 5 1996 ballot in 14 states ak ar co id mo mt ne nv nd or sd wa and wy3 voters approved the measures in nine states ak ar co id mo ne nv and sd in seven of these states ar co id mo ne sd the initiative was challenged in the courts and invalidated in alaska the state attorney general asserted that the alaska measure was unconstitutional on

proposals had been passed by voters as ballot initiatives in ar co id mo ne nv and sd six of these seven were essentially the same with only minor technical variations such as punctuation however in order to avoid the possibility of having the ballot statement eg disregarded voter instruction on term limits beside their names on future ballots most members from the nine states voted solely for the version with the precise language of their states law hence the multiple number of virtually identical measures and the resulting splintering of votes none of the 11 versions received the twothirds majority needed for passage in 1998 voters passed informed voter initiatives in california on june 2 and in nevada on november 3 however informed voter laws had already been invalidated in eight of the states where they had been passed making proponents continued efforts to secure passage of informed voter laws unlikely on april 17 2000 the us supreme court agreed to hear case cook v

vote for federal constitutional convention to consider term limit amendment this approach led to the reemergence of number of such crucial questions as whether the convention can be limited to single subject if not runaway convention might propose any number of amendments or totally new constitution initiatives that instructed state legislators to vote for national constitutional convention to consider termlimit amendment were on the 1996 ballot in 11 states6 if state legislature failed to pass the measure dissenting legislators would have statement printed beside their names on ballots in

north dakota would have provided that the people of that state act as the state legislature for the sole purpose of applying to congress to call constitutional convention to consider term limits amendment voters in ak ar co id ne and nv approved initiatives calling for constitutional convention the arkansas initiative was challenged in the courts on february 24 1997 the us supreme court denied petition for certiorari concerning the constitutionality of this initiative thus letting stand ruling by the arkansas supreme court which had struck down the arkansas initiative since the 1996 general election some proponents of national constitutional convention to consider term limits have redirected their activities toward pressing congress to propose term limits amendment earlier this century increasing support for national constitutional convention helped proponents of direct election of senators convince congress to propose the 17th amendment7 in the early 1900s an increasing number of state legislatures were calling for constitutional convention to propose an amendment providing for the election of senators by popular vote in 1910 senator who had proposed such an amendment claimed that 33 state legislatures supported his proposal in substance if not in exact phraseology8 by 1911 another member said that 19 states had formally petitioned congress to call constitutional convent ion9 faced with increasing support for constitutional convention most members including some who opposed direct election chose to propose definitive amendment rather than risk
