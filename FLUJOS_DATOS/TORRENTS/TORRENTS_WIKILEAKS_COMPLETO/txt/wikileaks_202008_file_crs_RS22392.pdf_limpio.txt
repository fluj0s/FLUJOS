religious freedom restoration act the genesis of the religious freedom rest oration act rfra lies in the supreme courts decision in employment division oregon depar tment of human resources v smith 1 in that case decided in 1990 the cour t narrowed the scope of the free exercise clause of the first amendment which pr ovides that congress shall make law prohibiting the free exercise of religion2 the specific issue before the court in smith was whether two native americans who had been fired from their jobs as drug counselors after they were discovered to have ingested peyote in ritual of the native american church were eligible for state unemploymen t benefits the court determined that they were not and in so doing also altered the standard of review generally used for free exercise

that rfra was unconstitutional as it applied to the actions of state governments 521 us 507 1997 for discussion of the boerne case see crs report 97795 the religious freedom restora tion act its rise fall and current status by david m ackermanbefore smith the court had generally applied strict scrutiny test to government action that allegedly burdene d the exercise of religion3 that test required the government to show that an action burdening religion served compelling government interest and that less burdensome course of action was feasible if the government could not so demonstrate the test required that the religious practice be exempted from the government regulation or prohibition at issue in smith the court abandoned the strict scrutiny st and held that religiously neutral laws may be uniformly applied to all persons without re gard to any burden or prohibition placed on their exercise of religion the fr ee exercise clause the court said never relieves an individual of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes4 in the case at hand that new standard meant that the free exercise clause mandated religious exem ption from oregons drug laws for native american use of peyote in sacramental ceremony and consequen tly eligibility for unemployment benefits of the two native americans who lost their jobs because of their participation in such ceremony more genera lly the court asserted that the question of whether religious practices ought to be accommodated by government was matter to be resolved by the political process and not by the courts although it admitted that leaving accommodation to the political process will place at relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in5 in 1993 congress enacted the religious free dom restoration act rfra to restore the compelling interest test set forth in earlier cases in all circumstances where the freedom of religious exercise is being burdened and to provide claim for relief when the government substantially burdens the religi ous exercise thus rfra granted government the right to substantially burden persons exer cise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is 1 in furtherance of compelling governmental interest and 2 the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest6 gonzales v centro espirita centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal udv is

1218 at the hearing on the preliminary injunction the district court heard evidence from both parties on the health risks of hoasca and the potential for diversion from the church the government presented evidence to the effect that use of hoasca or dmt more generally can cause psychotic reactions cardiac irregularities and adverse drug interactions the udv countered by citing studies documenting the safety of its sacramental use of hoasca and presenting evidence that minimized the likelihood of the health risks raised by the government with respect to diversion the government pointed to general rise in the illicit use of hallucinogens and cited interest in the continuedalleged that the application of the controlled substances act to the churchs sacramental use of hoasca violated rfra at hearing on th preliminary injunction the government conceded that the application of the c ontrolled substances ac t would substantially burden sincere exercise of religion by the udv but argued that there was rfra violation because the application of the controlled substances act was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests protecting the health and safety of udv member s preventing the diversion of hoasca from the church to recreational users and complying with the 1971 united nations convention on psychotropic substances treat signed by the united states and implemented by the controlled substances act7 the district court found that the governme nt had failed to demonstrate compelling interest justifying what it acknowledged was substantial burden on the udvs sincere religious exercise8 the court entered preliminary injunction prohibiting the government from enforcing the controlled s ubstances act with respect to the udvs importation and use of hoasca the injunction required the church to import hoasca pursuant to federal permits to restrict control of the churchs supply of hoasca to persons of church authority and to wa rn members of the dangers of hoasca the government appealed the issuance of the in junction and panel of the ited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed as did majority of the circuit sitting banc9 the government appealed to the supreme court in making its appeal the government put forth three arguments challenging the lower courts decision first it challenged the pr eliminary injunction itself alleging that the court used the wrong test for determining whether preliminary injunction was proper second it argued that enforcement of the controlled substances act precluded any type of waiver for udv third it argued that compliance with the united nations convention on psychotropic substances also prevented it from allowing udv to use hoasca substance covered under the convention preliminary injunction standard the government did not challenge the district courts factual findings or its conclusion that the evidence presented at the hearing regarding health risks and risk of diversi on was in equipoise and virtually balanced10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22392crs4 10 continued illegal use of dmt and hoasca in particular the udv emphasized the thinness of any market for hoasca the relatively small amounts of the substance imported by the church and the absence of any diversion problem in the past 126 s ct at 1218 11 id 12 id at 1219 citations omitted 13 id 14 id 15 id citing ashcroft v american civil liberties union 542 us 656 2004 the court stated that the reasoning established in ashcroft applied in the present case even though the government failed to meet the first prong of the compelling inte rest test and did not reach the least restrictive means prong 16 id at 1220 17 id 18 idrather the government challenged the district courts determination that evidence in equipoise was sufficient for issuing preliminary injunction against enforcement of the controlled substances act11 on appeal the government noted the wellestablished principle that the party seeking pretrial relief bears the burden of demonstrating likelihood of success on the merits12 the government argued that mere tie in the evidentiary record was insufficient for issuing preliminary injunction13 along with majority of the banc court of appeals the supreme court rejected this argument finding that the government failed to dem onstrate that the application of the burden to the udv would more likely than not be justif ied by the asserted compelling interest14 the court also rejected th governments contention that the udv bore the burden of disproving the asserted compelling interests at the hearing on the preliminary injunction citing another recent case which held that r espondents must be deemed likely to prevail unless the government has shown that responde nts proposed less rest rictive alternatives are less effective than enforcing the act15 the court stated that congress express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that rfra challenges should be adjudicated in the same manner as constitutionally mandated applications of the test including at the preliminary injunction stage16 enforcement of the controlled substances act the government also challenged the district courts determination that it failed to articulate compelling governmental interest to justify its burde n on the udvs religious practices by arguing that the controlled substances act pr ecludes any consideration of individualized exceptions such as those sought by the udv17 the supreme court summarized the governments position saying that under th governments view there is need to assess the particulars of the udvs use or weigh the impact of an exemption for that specific use because the controlled subs tances act serves compelling purpose and simply admits of exceptions18 however the court re jected the governments assertion that congre sss classification of hoasca as schedule i substance relieves thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22392crs5 19 id at 1211 20 id citing 21 usc 822d see 21 cfr 130731 the government argued that the existence of congressionally mandated exemption from the controlled substances act did not mean that the act was subject to judicially mandated exem ptions the court countered that argument by noting that rfra plainly contemplates that courts would recognize exceptions that is how the law works 126 s ct at 1222 21 id the court also rejected the governments argument that the use of peyote is allowed because of the unique relationship between th united states and the tribes noting that the government never explained what about that rela tionship justifies the different treatment of the tribes versus the udv 22 id 23 id at 1223 24 id citing cutter v wilkinson 544 us 709 2005 25 126 s ct at 1224government of the obligation to shoulder its burden under rfra19 the court noted that the controlled substances act authorizes the attorney general to waive the requirement for registration of certain manufact urers distributors or dispen sers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety and that an exception has been made for the religious use of peyote by the native american church and all members of every recognized indian tribe20 the court found that if such use is permitted for thousands of native americans practicing their faith it is difficult to see how the government can preclude any consideration of similar exception for the 130 or so american members of the udv who want to practice theirs21 the court held that the peyote exemp tion not only undermined the governments contention that the act admits exceptions under rfra but that it also found that the government failed to provide evidence of how such an exemption has undercut the governments ability to enforce the law with respect to nonreligious uses22 the court rejected the governments reliance on ot her cases where the court found that the government had compelling interest in the uniform application of particular program finding that in this case the governments claim was not based on the administration of statutory program but rather on slippery slope concerns that could be invoked in response to an rfra claim for an excep tion to generally applicable law23 in so doing the court stated that rfra operates by mandating considerati on under the compelling interest test of exceptions to rules of general applicability and noted that it had recently reaffirmed the feasibility of caseby case consideration of religious exemptions to generally applicable rules24 convention on psychotropic substances with respect to its obligation to comply with the united nations convention on psychotropic substances the court also rejected the governments c ontention that compliance with the treaty itself was enough to justify the burden on the udvs religious exercises25 in so doing the court stated that it did not doubt the validity of the govern ments interests in complying with the treaty any more than it doubted the gene ral interest in promo ting public health andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22392crs6 26 id at 1225safety by enforcing the controlled substan ces act but under rfra invocation of such general interests standi ng alone is not enough26 conclusion the court proceeded to affirm the judgment of the united state court of appeals for the tenth circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings presumably the remand leaves open the possibility that the government could at some point establish compelling interest that justif ies the burden on the udv it should also be noted that the court did not address the constitutionality of rfra as it applies to the federal government as this was not stion presented to it on appeal the potential impact of the courts decision is uncertain because the court focused on the importance of casebycase approach with respect to religious exemptions from generally applicable rules the courts decision does not establish broad precedent for religious exemptions from criminal statutes it does however appear to establish precedent with respect to the type of evidence that must be presented by the government to establish compelling interest the court made it clear that the government could not establish compelling interest in simply enforcing an existing statute there must be some other justification for the burden on religious expression
