consolidated and emergency appropriations act pl 105 277 contains 59 billion in emergency spending for usda programs primarily to shore up farm income and to compensate farm ers for natural disasters more than one half of this amount 31 billion is in the fo rm of direct payments to grain cotton and dairy farmers for income assistance which was paid out shortly after enactment the secretary announced on december 12 that the 2375 billion in disaster payments provided by the act will be disbursed in the spring of 1999 to farmers who either experienced crop losses in 1998 greater than 35 percent of normal yi elds or had losses in 3 of the last 5 years portion of this money will be reserved to further subsidize farmer participation in the crop insurance program the act also includes livestock disaster assistance commodity loans for honey and mohair produ cers and additional funding for farm operating loans and overs eas commodity assistance for emerging democracies among other provisions th expectation of continued low farm commodity prices in 1999 may cause polic ymakers to consider changes to risk management and income safe ty net policies for agriculture for more

commodity prices and natural disasters in some agricultural sectors and regions the fy1999 omnibus consolidated and emergency appropriations act pl 105277 hr 4328 contains 59 billion in emergency

more than onehalf of the 59 billion emergency appropriation for agriculture 3057 billion is for grain cotton and dair farmers according to conferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98952crs2 1production flexibility contracts authorized by the 1996 farm bill pl 104627 provide participating producers of wheat feed grains cotton and rice with fixed annual payment for crop years 1996 through 2002 contract paym ents replaced the previous federal farm income support mechanism which paid partic ipating producers when market prices of commodity fell below an established target price committee report language the funds are to co mpensate for the loss of 1998 farm income caused by regional economic di slocation unilateral trade sanc tions and the failure of the government to pursue trade opportunities aggressively usda began making market loss payments to grain and cotton contract holders in early november of the amount provided 2857 billion is for grain and cotton fa rmers who were eligible for final 1998 production flexibility contract payment1 the balance of 200 million is reserved for dairy farmers among contract holders the 29 billion is to be distributed in approximately the following proportions corn contract hol ders 13 billion wheat 750 million upland cotton 332 million rice 242 million and other feed grains 212 million nearly twothirds of the market loss payments went to 10 states iowa 268 million texas 245 million illinois 235 million nebraska 201 million kansas 200 million minnesota 163 million arkansas 135 million north dakota 124 million indiana 116 million nd california 101 million pl 105277 requires that these market loss payments be paid in the same proportion as the 56 billion in fy1998 contr act payments that is farmers with production flexibility contracts will receive payment equal to about 50 of their fy1998 contract payment regardless of whet her they experienced any income losses although contract holders are the recipients of these paym ents the payments technically are not considered contract payments c onsequently these new payments do not count toward the per person limitation on contract payments of 40000 in calendar year the secretary of agriculture will have to determine how the 200 million in dairy payments will be distributed among milk producers since milk is not contract commodity distributing dairy assistance is complicated by record high milk prices recorded in november 1998 when the base price of farm milk r eached 1684 per hundred pounds some have suggested that th dairy payments should be delayed until farm milk prices retreat as they are forecasted to do in 1999 the national milk producers federation the largest trade group of dairy farmer c ooperatives has proposed that all dairy farmers receive 18 cents fo r every one hundred pounds of milk marketed in 1998 subject to ceiling of 6000 per producer crop disaster payments pl 105277 authorizes 2375 billion in direct disaster payments to crop farmers with either significant production loss of 1998 crop 15 billion available or multi year crop losses 875 million caused by natu ral disaster or crop disease the multi year disaster payments are expected to benefit primarily producers in the northern plains and upper midwest these farmers have expe rienced severe weather over the last several years coupled with wheat scab chronic crop disease that has also limited production the act gave usda significant flexibility in how to implement these two programs on december 12 1998 the secretary of agriculture announced that producers canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98952crs3 receive 65 of the relevant price 60 for those who waived 1998 crop insurance coverage on any crop losses in excess of 35 of normal yields or if the producer had losses in 3 or more years between 1994 thr ough 1998 he could receive multiyear loss payment equal to 25 of the total amount of crop insurance indemnity payments or noninsured assistance program payments recei ved during that 5year period pl 105 277 prohibits any producer from receiving both 1998 crop loss payment and multiyear loss payment the secretary also announced that 400 million of these available disaster funds will be reserved for an additional premium discount for those who purchase crop insurance coverage in 1999 another 30 million will be earmarked to compensate farmers with flooded land that is expected to be out of pr oduction indefinitely applications for all payments will be accep ted by usda between february 1 and march 12 1999 if funds are insufficient to fully fund the payment formulas available money will be proportionately paid out to all applicants payment limits are 80000 per farmer for the disaster payments and 80000 for th additional crop insurance premium subsidy as condition for receiving disaster payment the act requires any farmer who waived crop insurance coverage in 1998 to purchase crop insu rance in 1999 an d 2000 this provision was driven by concerns that future participation in crop insurance might be compromised by making disaster payments available to nonpartic ipants because the federal government pays the entire premium for the farmer for the basic level of crop insurance coverage the mandatory purchase require ment is expected to cost an additional 66 million which is factored into th 59 billion

sell off their herds this can depress market prices and farmer income prior to 1996 us da had the legislative authority to provide wide array of livestock assistance programs to help farmers purchase feed off the farm when onfarm feed losses were significant however these emergency livestock programs were suspended by the 1996 farm bill until 2002 because many felt that some of these programs duplicated the federal assist ance provided by crop insurance p l 105277 provides 200 million in emergency livestock feed assistance the law did not state how these funds are to be dist ributed leaving that to the discretion of the secretary on november 12 the secretary of agricultu re announced that usda will make assistance available to livestock gr owers in any county that experienced 40 grazing loss for 90 or more consecutive days applications will be received until early january payments will be made shortly after regulations are issued recourse loans for hone and mohair producers honey and mohair were for many years federally supported commodities mohair through direct incentive payments and honey through nonrecourse loans and direct payments the federal support programs for these two programs were terminated at the end of 1995 wool and mohair and in 1996 honey pl 105277 authorizes two separate temporary recourse loan programs for produ cers of honey and mohair these two commodities have experienced large supplies and low market prices in r ecent months recourse loan provides produ cers with interim financing to assist them in marketing their crop in an orderly manner and mu st be repaid within certain term the mohair provision in pl 105277 allows producer to borrow 200 for each pound of 1998 or previous years mohair production placed under loan these full recourse loans will have oneyear term ar interestfree and are authorized only for fy1999 the estimated cost of making and administering these mohair loans is 27 million with most of the cost attribut ed to the interestfree provision the honey loan provision in pl 105277 allows producers to place 1998 production under loan and requires the secretary of agri culture to determine fair and reasonable terms and conditions of the loan the law does stipulate that th amount producer can borrow for each pound of honey placed under loan shall be equal to 85 percent of the average market price of honey during th 1993 through 1997 crop years excluding the highest and lowestprice years the secretar is required to operate the program on netcost basis meaning that recipients must repay their loans with interest and cover any administrative costs associated with the program because some of the loans might not be repaid until after fy1999 the program is estimated to cost 1 million in fy1999 an amount which should be offset in fy2000 or subsequent years other emergency agri cultural provisions 50 million in disaster assistance to help western alaska fishermen recover from poor salmon returns the disaster

106th congress the enactment of multibillion dollar emergency relief package for agriculture following major reforms to the federal crop in surance program and federal farm price and income support policy has he ightened concern among some policymakers about the financial safety ne t for farmers the federal crop insurance program underw ent major policy reforms in 1994 the changes were intended to bolster program pa rticipation and permanently replace the need for annual ad hoc disaster payments curre nt law requires farmers who declined crop insurance coverage to sign waiver declarin g that they cannot receive disaster payments on any crop that could have been insured despite this provision farmers who signed waivers will be recipients of disaster payments under pl 105277 there are concerns about the effect such payments will have on future participation in the crop insurance program although participation rates have increased significantly since the reform some regions have complained that coverage is not adequate pa rticularly when the region is affected by multiyear disasters which have the effect of reducing insurable crop yields the omnibus 1996 farm bill replaced system of direct payments to participating farmers when crop prices were below target level with fixed but declining contract payments the intended purpose was to fr ee farmers from planting constraints and decisions driven by federally set target prices for individual crops this past year farm income in some sectors and regions conti nued to decline after record highs in 1996 in response several attemp ts were made by democratic farm state senators to raise the loan rates price guarantees for major commodities initially reluctant to raise the loan rates the president ultimately vetoed the fy1999 ag riculture appropriations bill because it did not contain the increase in the loan rates pr oposed by the democrats house and senate republican leadership strongly opposed an in crease in the loan rates because of budget cost 5 billion and because of concern that higher loan ra tes would fundamentally undermine the policy changes made in 1996 compromise agreement in pl 105 277 instead provide d the 3057 b illion in market loss payments separate law pl 105228 llowed contract holders to receive all of their fy1999 contract paymen ts in full in october 1998 to bolster 1998 income considering that 1999 crop prices are forecasted to remain low and that large portion of 1999 contract payments were advanced in 1998 the 106th congress might be asked to respond with renewed assistance the agriculture committees will likely exa mine the results of the 1998 emergency package with an eye to alternative safety net measures one option likely to receive attention is an expansion of revenue insuran ce this tool which is already in use on pilot basis guarantees certain level of an individual farmers revenue regardless of whether any shortfall is caused by low prices or production losses
