we raise awareness of the dangers of big brother state surveillance by richard stallman torture and massacres when we cannot have secrets from the state the state can keep the most horrible things secret from us sad to say the us is not alone in this india also commits plenty of torture and massacres proposals to increase the level of surveillance cite certain standard reasons typically terrorism pornography or ﬁ sharing terrorism is real danger but it is small danger when compared to state that the people can longer control as for pornography and ﬁ lesharing they should be legal if you dont like them dont use them you can resist some of these forms of surveillance by limit ing the data that you let anyone collect about your daily activities buying with credit card informs the bank and state surveillance what you bought and if youre in store where you are i pay cash carrying mobile phone tells the phone company and state surveillance everywhere you go i refuse listening to music from server account tells the company and state surveillance what you listen to and may also restrict what you can do with it i keep copies on my own computers or media i dont give personal data to websites aside from when i post comment on one and i avoid connecting my computer directly to those sites however it is impossible to fully avoid surveil lance while using certain sorts of digital technology for instance there is way to do email without surveillance you can keep the contents of the message private by encrypting it for instance with the gnu privacy guard but there is way to stop big brother from seeking out who you exchange mail with w can do better by organising co ll ectively against sur veillance this means campaigning to change laws so as to reduce general surveillance when people organise such campaigns typically the ﬁ rst proposal is to legally limit access to the accumulated data this is inadequate to solve the problem when the state wants to ﬁ nd an excuse to imprison whistleblower it will ﬁ nd ways to satisfy whatever requirements there are to avoid the total surveillance state we need to limit the col lection of data edward snowden heroically demonstrated to the world the extent to which the united states us and some other countries have converted the internet into sys tem for general surveillance of everyone they do this largely on the basis of corporations surveillance even if company only wants to know what sort of ads to show you the data it collected will be available to big brother w k n w l r d t h t t r n n i c l s t t s s u c h s c h i n tunisia libya and iran did their utmost to monitor internet u s rs w h d n p r f th t fr c tri d i d i t t f r years i have said in my speeches that i suspected the us government used the patriot act periodically to collect all the personal data from certain companies simply because i saw that that law would permit it and the us government tends to stretch its legal powers however such suspicions are easy to dismiss as paranoia thanks to snowden we know the us really does this with telephone companies meanwhile india plans to practise phone and internet surveillance without even the ﬂ imsy limits that govern the national security agency nsa this amounts to surveillance such as stalin could only dream of even he could not make list of every conversation every purchase every movement of every person the us has nearly reached this level india with its national identity cards is headed the same way but it can get even worse manufacturers of mobile devices now try to direct users to store their data in companies servers instead of their own computers if youre foolish enough to do this the nsa can ﬁ sh through your private data in addition many proprietary programs and devices spy on their users on the amazon kindle amazon has access to all the marginal notes that the user makes about book if you use windows the nsa can break the security via bugs that microsoft has reported to the nsa but has not ﬁ xed see httpwwwbloombergcomnews20130614 usagenciessaidtoswapdatawiththousandsofﬁ rmshtml the us uses its massive surveillance to imprison the whistle blowers that inform us about government crimes such as we can do better by organising collectively against surveillance this means campaigning to change laws so as to reduce general surveillanceeconomic political

is prior court order to keep the data about particular person we must replace the advertisingbased system for funding websites with an anonymous method for paying to access page to raise awareness of the issue and invite the states surveillance agents to search their consciences about what they are doing i now include the following note in most of my outgoing mail to any nsa and fbi agents reading my email please sider whether defending the us constitution against all enemies foreign or domestic requires you to follow snowdens example here i appeal to these agents in the name of their oath of ofﬁ ce snowden has demonstrated that surveillance agents can understand that the patriot act is not the same as patriotism they can recognise their duty and may have the courage to act on it however i
