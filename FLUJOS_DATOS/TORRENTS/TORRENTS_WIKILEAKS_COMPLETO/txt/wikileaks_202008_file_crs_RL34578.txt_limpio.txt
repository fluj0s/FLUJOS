government and finance division economics of guaranteed student loans summary since 1966 the federal government has provided guarantees and subsidies to approved private lenders or certain state government entities that make student loans college graduates enhanced human capital is generally not viewed as collateral lenders without federal subsidies and guarantees would charge interest rates more in line with other unsecured loans such as credit card debt that could push the financial costs of higher education beyond the reach of many students and their families although federal subsidies for student lenders have probably expanded access to higher education some observers have contended that subsidy rates were higher than necessary to ensure students access to educational loans the college cost reduction and access act pl 11084 enacted in september 2007 was motivated in part by the impression that lender subsidies within the federal family education loan ffel program had been higher than necessary the act cut interest rate subsidies to lenders and increased the proportion of default costs borne by lenders starting in february 2008 some student lenders encountered difficulties in the secondary loan market market in which securities backed by bundles of student loans often called slabs student loan assetbacked securities are sold to investors turmoil in world capital markets in late 2007 and 2008 appears to have raised interest costs to some student lenders specifically widespread failures of auctionrate securities markets beginning in midfebruary 2008 have raised costs of funds for some student lenders in early 2008 some ffel program lenders announced plans to make fewer student loans within certain market segments in response to tightened credit market and recent legislation in particular some lenders have announced plans to reduce the number of loans to students attending certain institutions such as twoyear and proprietary schools some observers contend that student lenders have overstated their recent troubles nonetheless loans remain available through the william d ford federal direct lending program fdlp in response to growing concerns about the availability of student loans for the 20082009 academic year congress passed ensuring continued access to student loans act of 2008 hr 5715 pl 110227 which was signed into law on

government entities that make student loans the aim making higher education more affordable1 because college graduates enhanced human capital is generally not viewed as collateral without federal subsidies and guarantees lenders would probably charge interest rates more in line with other unsecured loans such as credit card debt that could push the financial costs of higher education beyond the reach of many students2 recent changes in the federally guaranteed loan programs outlined below have raised concerns that the supply of student loans could be disrupted for the 20082009 academic year prompting congress and the administration to take steps to forestall possible disruptions that might affect students education plans overview of the student loan market two major student loan programs exist federally the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d ford federal direct loan fdlp program these programs provide loans to undergraduate graduate and professional students and the parents of undergraduate dependent students to help finance the costs of postsecondary education the ffel program is the largest student loan program3 subsidized and unsubsidized ffel stafford loans are made to students ffel plus loans are made to parents of students as well as to graduate and professional students loan volumes for the plus program are much smaller than ffel loan volumes the federal government absorbs interest costs of students in school or in deferment for subsidized loans which are available to students meeting certain financial need tests for unsubsidized loans which are not needbased interest costs that accrue while student attends school or is in deferment are either paid by 1 the ffel program was created by the higher education act of 1965 p l 89329

the federal government loan volumes federal student loans ffel fdlp and perkins are projected to provide 74 billion of the estimated 258 billion cost of higher education in the 20072008 academic year5 in recent years ffel loan volume has been about four times greater than fdlp loan volume6 private student loans are projected to provide another 18 billion of that total7 contributions from students and their parents are projected to cover 71 billion with scholarships and grants covering the remaining 95 billion figure 1 shows stafford loan volumes for undergraduate students attending fouryear or twoyear public institutions and figure 2 shows the same data for students attending fouryear or twoyear private institutions total stafford loan volumes for both the fdlp and ffel programs are much higher for fouryear colleges and universities than for twoyear institutions and are substantially higher than loan volumes for proprietary institutions in particular student loan volumes for twoyear private institutions are very low compared to volumes for fouryear private institutions direct loans schools or their subunits choose to participate in the ffel program or the fdlp program thus the fdlp program could provide loans in the event that private ffel lending was insufficient to satisfy student loan demand if school financial aid officials made participation decisions that would allow that to occur some have expressed concern that rapid increase in fdlp loans which might occur were significant proportion of ffel lenders to exit the market would present significant administrative

exit the market10 lender withdrawal announcements in early 2008 some student lenders announced plans to restrict loans in response to tightening credit conditions and cuts in federal subsidies put in place by the college cost reduction and access act in february 2008 the pennsylvania higher education assistance program pheaa announced they would suspend making federally guaranteed loans11 since then many other lenders announced plans to suspend participation in federally guaranteed student loan programs according to finaidorg as of july 14 2008 96 lenders had indicated that they would suspend originating ffel loans and an additional 24 indicated that they would only suspend originating consolidation loans in addition 27 lenders announced that they would suspend new private loans in total as of july 14 2008 125 lenders had indicated that they would suspend participation in private loans and some part of the ffel program12 the secretary of education in march 4 2008 letter to financial aid professionals requested that financial aid offices relay information on lenders intentions to curtail student loans to the us department of education13 9 this legislation was motivated in part by the impression that lender subsidies within the federal family education loan ffel program had been higher than necessary 10 for example joe below president of the consumer bankers association contended that loan availability could become tenuous as result of the combination of dramatically lower return coupled with significantly increased risk an ambitious student aid bill

markets or from student loan industry attempts to create pressure to reverse subsidy cuts14 further some student loan providers have encountered financial problems not directly related to the student loan market for example sallie mae slm corp took 15 billion writedown stemming from financial positions it took that would have increased in value had its stock price risen15 some observers contend that student lenders have overstated their recent troubles and that loans remain available through the federal direct lending program fdlp the following sections describe key provisions of the ffel loan program and outline changes made by the college cost reduction and access act although reductions in interest rate subsidies for ffel lenders have attracted the most attention other legislative changes may also have important effects on the student loan market lender subsidy formulae the formulae determining interest rates that student borrowers pay and the yields including certain subsidies received by ffel lenders for various types of federally guaranteed loans are set by legislation these formulae have been changed many times since 1981 other changes in program details such as higher origination fees paid to the federal government have reduced lenders profit rates on the other hand new information and communication technologies have sharply increased productivity in the banking industry reducing servicing costs for student loans and other things equal increasing lender profits lenders participating in federal guaranteed loan programs receive subsidy payments that according to language of the higher education act ensure holders of ffel loans receive at least equitable returns compared to other financial opportunities available to those lenders under current law these lenders receive yield equal to shortterm commercial paper cp rate plus legislatively determined addon which can vary by type of loan and by type of lender16 when borrower interest rates fall below the

april 1 2006 is now returned ie rebated to the federal government the college cost reduction and access act pl 11084 reduced lender subsidies in several ways for new loans originated after october 1

increased the proportion of default costs borne by lenders for loans originated after october 1 2012 lender insurance rates will be cut from 97 to 95 as of october 1 2007 the exceptional performer status enjoyed by lenders that met certain federal regulatory requirements which gave those lenders access to faster processing of default paperwork and 99 insurance rate was eliminated on the other hand average default rates have decreased sharply since the early 1990s thus generally reducing the financial risks to lenders of defaults the total default rate for ffel and fdlp loans for the fy2005 cohort calculated in july 2007 was 46 well below the peak default rate of 224 reached by the fy1990 cohort fy2005 cohort default rates for fouryear institutions were even lower averaging 30 for public

may be the guarantor itself or an eligible private ffel lender the federal government guarantees 100 of loans issued by lenders of last resort the ensuring continued access to student loans act of 2008 pl 110227 made several changes to the lenderoflastresort program21 the department of education in spring 2008 has been requiring guarantee agencies to update their lenderoflastresort programs22 were many lenders to leave the student loan market due to lower profits more students might use lenders of last resort in past years lenderoflastresort loans have comprised tiny share of the student loan market according to the department of education lenderoflastresort loans have never accounted for more than 1 of total federal student loan volume in fiscal year in recent years such loans have accounted for about onefourth to onehalf of 1 of stafford loan volume23 to understand how recent legislative changes might affect the market for student loans basic supply and demand model is presented below supply and demand for student loans the standard economic model of supply and demand provides starting point for analysis of the student loan market although federal intervention and

department of education office of the under secretary official sept 7 2007 24 the basic supply and demand model may be less applicable to the private loan market continued crs9 supply the supply for student loans is mainly determined by the cost of capital the costs of marketing and of originating loans the costs of administering loans and repayments and the costs associated with prepayment or default25 for firm in competitive market the supply curve is the firms marginal cost curve which relates the incremental cost of each additional unit of output to the volume of output26 supply curve for student loans shows the relationship between the volume of loans lenders are willing to make and the lender interest rate funding costs student lenders obtain capital in ways similar to other commercial lenders in traditional banking model banks use deposits to make student loans that they can hold on their own books lenders can also obtain funds by borrowing in the short and mediumterm commercial paper market in the past two decades however securitization has become an increasingly important source of funds for lenders many lenders in the student loan market as elsewhere use securitization procedures that allow them to sell packages of thousands of individual loans to outside investors most student lenders transform many of the loans they originate into student loan assetbacked securities slabs which can be sold to investors or financial institutions27 according to one market expert about 85 of student loans are typically securitized28 securitization allows lenders to concentrate on originating loans if they choose not to hold those loans in their own portfolios most financial analysts have viewed such securitization strategies as way to reduce the costs of lending although some lenders such as sallie mae the largest issuer of guaranteed student loans hold substantial portion of the loans they originate in their own 24 continued where adverse selection may occur adverse selection occurs when lenders cannot observe characteristics of borrowers that affect default 25 prepayment occurs when borrower pays off loan before its original maturity which reduces the amount of interest paid to the lender 26 this presumes that the firm earns enough to make shutting down an unattractive option 27 nomura securities international nomura fixed income

process of being securitized30 securitization procedures which provide student lenders access to broader capital markets also can subject student lenders to risks associated with global capital movements and developments in particular severe tightening of credit in international capital markets has had significant effects on student lenders as interest rate spreads increased in late 2007 and early 2008 the cost of funds to commercial borrowers including student lenders has increased origination fees and administrative costs origination costs include not only fees paid to the federal government for guaranteed loans but also the administrative costs of transactions with students and their schools student loan marketing costs have increased sharply as lenders have attempted to expand their market shares especially in the private loan market31 on the other hand new information and communication technologies have sharply increased productivity in the banking industry reducing servicing costs for student loans according to the department of education average student loan servicing costs range from approximately 30 basis points for larger more efficient lenders to about 60 basis points for smaller lenders and some notforprofit lenders typical student loan origination costs larger more efficient lenders about 25 per loan and costs smaller lenders about 75 per loan32 default risks student loan defaults typically rise during economic downturns although some young graduates may be able to draw upon family resources others may struggle in weak job market and become unable to pay loans33 lenders are largely insulated from the costs of default on guaranteed student loans although the college cost reduction and access act as noted above raised the proportion of default costs that lenders must bear in large part due to the elimination of the exceptional performer status lenders or those holding loan 29 slm sallie mae corp 10k filing for 2007 available at

which may be subunits of the firm which are then held in warehouse trust financed by bank loans or by other means and administered by trustee once enough loans are accumulated they are securitized and

after october 8 1998 student loans cannot be discharged through bankruptcy unless narrowly defined undue hardship requirements are met crs11 backed assets bear the costs of private loan defaults according the most recent data defaults among students attending proprietary schools are higher than among students attending public or private institutions and default rates for students at fouryear institutions are lower than for students at twoyear programs34 prepayment risk lenders face prepayment risks when borrowers can consolidate or refinance loans at lower interest rates which can reduce lender profit margins for example when students consolidate loans one or more existing loans are paid off using funds from new loan lenders who had held those existing loans receive early repayment and thus receive additional interest payments prepayment trends are highly dependent on changes in interest rates when interest rates fall more borrowers with variablerate loans find it worthwhile to prepay35 in the past year benchmark interest rates have fallen sharply which may encourage some borrowers to prepay loans federal laws however restrict consolidation options of students the introduction of fixed 68 borrower rate for stafford loans at the beginning of july 2006 as well as the scheduled reduction in borrower rates enacted in the college cost reduction and access act may reduce the value of consolidation options for many borrowers and thus may reduce prepayment risks to lenders demand demand for student loans largely depends on the costs of higher education the perceived value of obtaining higher education and the value of alternatives to attending college such as working36 demand curve for student loans shows the relationship between the volume of loans borrowers are willing to take and the price of those loans that is the borrower interest rate change in any of the factors underlying student loan demand will cause the demand curve to shift for example the college premium defined as the difference between average wages of college graduates and those who did not attend college has increased over the last quarter century giving students and their families greater incentive to invest in higher education an increase in the college premium other things equal causes the demand curve to shift so that larger volume of student loans is demanded at given borrower interest rate an appendix explains shifts in demand and supply curves in more detail other changes may have ambiguous effects on the demand for student loans the cost of college attendance has increased in real terms over the past few decades which may discourage some students from enrolling but may increase demand for 34 us dept of education office of student financial aid programs data available at httpwwwedgovofficesosfapdefaultmanagementinstrateshtml 35 the interest rate for consolidated loan is weighted average of the interest rates rounded up to the nearest oneeighth of 1 on the loans at the time of consolidation students that only hold fixedrate loans therefore cannot obtain more advantageous interest rate through consolidation 36 many college students work at least part time nonetheless time spent working can reduce the quantity of time available for studying or the intensity of study or both crs12 loans among those students who do enroll economic conditions might also have ambiguous effects on demand for student loans during economic downturns students ability to pay for higher education may decrease although the opportunity cost of going to college may fall if other options such as working or nonacademic training programs become less attractive simple model of the ffel student loan market interest rates paid by borrowers and those received by lenders for federally guaranteed loans are set legislatively because interest rates which act as the price of loan are not set by market mechanism the student loan market will not clear either lenders will be willing to supply more loans at the legislatively set lender interest rate than borrowers are willing to accept at the borrower interest rate or more borrowers will want loans at their interest rate than lenders are willing to supply at their interest rate figure 3 illustrates two cases in the first diagram demand for student loans q given the borrower interest rate falls short of loan supply qs at the lender d rate lenders profits are then represented by trapezoid below the lender interest rate and above the supply curve comprising regions c and the triangle below the supply curve and above the demand curve represents deadweight loss dwl when loans are originated above the socially efficient level indicated by the intersection of demand and supply curves so that the social costs of some loans exceed the benefits gained by society the resulting reduction in economic well being is called deadweight loss37 an inefficiently low volume of student loans would also generate deadweight loss lenders earn economic rents rectangle because they receive price that exceeds their costs an economic rent is payment above the minimum needed to induce given amount of supply small reduction in the lender interest rate shrinks rectangle hence squeezing lenders rents without reducing loan supply in the second case demand for student loans qd given the borrower interest rate exceeds loan supply qs at the lender rate38 lenders earn economic rents and some wouldbe borrowers are unable to obtain ffel loans these borrowers might obtain loans from the direct loan program if their school participated in that program or from lender of last resort otherwise students may obtain non guaranteed private loans or might go without student loans altogether 37 this discussion ignores spillover benefits to society spillover benefits can be accommodated into the analysis by adding the value of those spillovers to society to the demand curve which reflects only benefits to student or family to obtain marginal social benefit msb schedule the socially efficient loan volume is then set by the intersection of the msb schedule and the supply curve 38 if the lender rate were below the intersection of supply and demand curves then the deadweight loss triangle would lie below the demand curve and above the supply curve to the left of their intersection reflecting the loss in social wellbeing due to an inefficiently low volume of student loans the size and shape of other components would also change crs13 figure 3 simple model of the student loan market two cases source crs crs14 the effect of subsidy cuts in past discussions of changes in federal student loan subsidies lender organizations warned that subsidy cuts could either reduce the flow of private capital into student lending or increase the costs of student loans to borrowers furthermore some lenders and their representatives warned that subsidy cuts or other program changes that reduced lenders profitability would lead some lenders to exit the student loan market39 on the other hand if lenders do receive rents then small reduction in the lenders interest rate squeezes those rents but has effect on output decisions as shown in case 1 in figure 3 some economists and political scientists have argued that other market participants or political actors would try to capture some portion of those rents40 in the guaranteed student loan market many lenders provide colleges and universities with logistical and administrative support the provision of such services to schools could stem from schools ability to capture portion of lenders economic rents presumably due to their control over preferred lender lists many colleges and universities develop preferred lender lists based on lenders perceived customer service quality ability to offer borrower benefits proximity administrative convenience or according to other criteria set by the institution41 preferred lender lists typically give contact information for small 410 number of lenders students are not required to deal with lenders on the preferred list but preferred lists are considered an important determinant of students lender choices some student borrowers have been eligible for borrower benefits such as lower interest rates or the waiver of some fees42 only about one in 10 students however has been able to take full advantage of available borrower benefits some news reports in 2003 claimed that some lenders had struck deals with some university officials to switch school participation from fdlp to the ffel43 in 2007 the attorney general of new york state andrew cuomo uncovered numerous cases of conflicts of interest between college financial aid officials and 39 stephen burd clinton administration offers

induce them to supply guaranteed student loans the department of education estimated in july 2008 that pretax ffel lender yield net of servicing and financing costs was 44 74 basis points above the commercial paper benchmark rate for forprofit lenders and 59 89 basis points above that rate for notforprofit lenders46 restructuring in the student loan market student loan providers may react to recent market and legislative changes in several ways lenders may provide fewer benefits to students and schools or may redirect resources to other markets or may leave the loan market altogether47 banking along with the student loan industry has changed dramatically in the last decades mergers and acquisitions among banks and other financial institutions claimed to have increased banking sector efficiency also helped consolidate student lending lenders in the student loan market like firms in any competitive market have different cost structures and some lenders may have competitive advantages in specific types of loans or in dealing with specific types of students as margins narrow either because legislative action has raised fees and cut subsidies or because of more difficult economic conditions lessefficient firms could face strong pressures to leave segments of the student loan market if other firms can serve those markets more efficiently those firms will gain market share at the expense of exiting firms if firm can earn profits however firms exit and loan supply shrinks if economic and legislative changes affect guaranteed student loan markets some market segments are more likely to be affected than others the average size of loans for students at fouryear colleges and universities are larger than for twoyear college students which reduces the ratio of loan servicing costs relative to loan value 44 diana j schemo cuomo plans to broaden studentlending inquiry new york times june 7 2007 45 u s senate health education labor and pensions committee

street journal apr 1213 2008 p b2 crs16 if the paperwork costs of originating and servicing 5000 loan are the same as for 500 loan then the latter loan is more costly to the lender lenders may perceive that some types of students or some areas of study are more prone to default or require higher servicing costs also legislative changes may interact with financial market conditions to affect particular market segments for example salle mae announced in april 2008 that it would stop offering federal consolidation loans claiming that combination of lower federal subsidies and credit crunch made such loans unprofitable48 empirical evidence economic theory cannot predict exactly how student loan providers react to changes in financial markets andor legislation because some factors have ambiguous effects and because magnitudes of key parameters can affect the size and direction of effects on market outcomes such issues can only be resolved by empirical research few studies have examined how lenders have reacted to past changes in sap subsidy levels and have found measurable effects on the supply of guaranteed student loans 1994 study found that the supply of student loans did not respond to changes in subsidy levels49 crs analysis conducted in 2007 also found that changes in sap subsidy levels from 1997 through 2006 had statistically significant effect on the supply of student loans the analysis did find some statistically significant effects suggesting that lower interest rates for borrowers increased the demand for student loans50 analyses of historical data however may not reflect lender responses to recent subsidy cuts or during what some have termed an unusually severe credit crunch student lending and the credit crunch developments in financial markets especially those associated with mortgage securities have led many investors to become more cautious and less willing to accept risk investors therefore have been demanding greater compensation for taking risks in the form of higher interest rate spreads figure 4 shows the spread difference between 3month aarated financial commercial paper securities and the 3month constant maturity treasury rate this spread reflects financial markets assessment of the riskiness of one key class of securities issued by financial institutions relative to treasury securities of the same

fallen mostly due to developments in the real estate market in the united states and in other countries wider concerns about economic and financial conditions have affected all credit markets51 because the lender interest rates for federally guaranteed stafford loans disbursed since the start of 2000 are based on commercial paper rate student lenders are cushioned from risks associated with the spread between treasury bill and commercial paper rates52 issuers of private student loans which are not guaranteed are not protected from those risks moreover the design of federal guaranteed loan subsidies does not protect student lenders from other financial risks for example figure 5 shows the spread between 3month us dollar libor london interbank offer rate and an index of 3month rates

basis point is 1100th of 1 finally some student lenders have structured their finances in ways that have exposed them to financial risks generated by wider credit crunch in particular many student lenders have raised funds through the auctionrate securities market which has been strongly affected by the credit crunch auctionrate securities some lenders have packaged student loans into securities whose interest rates are set at given intervals by an auction procedure these auctionrate securities have been widely used in municipal finance and other financial markets interest rates for auctionrate securities are effectively tied to shortterm market interest rates even though the securities typically have long maturities53 in past decades variablerate securities have required lower interest rates than fixedrate securities on average 53 for detailed explanation of the auctionrate securities market see douglas skarr auction rate securities california debt and investment advisory commission issue brief aug 2004 available at httpwwwtreasurercagovcdiacissuebriefsaug04pdf crs19 the theory of finance implies that investors require higher interest rates to hold fixed rate securities that force them to bear more interestrate risks many borrowers such as municipalities and student loan originators therefore viewed auctionrate securities as cheaper way of raising funds compared to alternative borrowing strategies widespread auction failures starting in midfebruary 2008 however left those markets with very little liquidity casting doubt on the future viability of auctionrate securities54 an issuer of auctionrate securities such as student lender typically engages brokerdealer usually major investment bank to underwrite and distribute securities the brokerdealer and issuer choose an auction agent typically bank who oversees operation of the auction mechanism the period between auctions is not standard but is often 7 28 or 35 days before each auction interested investors state how much of an issue they wish to hold and specify the lowest interest rate they are willing to accept the auction agent then compiles these bids and parcels out holdings to investors with the lowest interest rates until the entire issue is taken up the interest rate of the last bidder assigned portion termed the clearing rate is then paid to holders until the next auction bidders who specified an interest rate above the clearing rate receive none of the issue55 if bidders requests are insufficient to take up the whole issue then the auction fails the interest rate is set by terms of the securitization contract and investors holding portion of the issue retain their stake for issuers failure of an auction often raises interest costs well above prevailing shortterm commercial paper rates for investors holding portions of auctionrate securities an auction failure often results in an attractive interest rate but with severely constrained liquidity many investors according to court documents told that auctionrate securities were cash equivalents were left with illiquid investments with maturities of 10 years or more56 on the other hand some financial institutions had warned investors in previous years of possible liquidity risks in auctionrate securities markets57 54 one financial journalist dubbed the auctionrate securities market

own accounts to avoid auction failures which could have reduced their ability to attract new underwriting clients auction failures before fall 2007 failures of interest auctions were considered unusual in august 2007 interest rate spreads between government securities and money market ratessee figure 4 exploded as concerns emerged that mortgagebacked liabilities could threaten the survival of some financial institutions the scramble for liquidity put pressure on auctionrate securities in which investors lacked guaranteed option to sell holdings back to issuers or brokerdealers so that liquidity for those securities depended on successful interest auctions according to some sources many large investment banks began to reduce holdings of auctionrate securities and began to market those securities more aggressively to small investors58 sales to small investors however provided an insufficient increase in demand to allow many auctions to run without brokerdealer support when brokerdealers support auctions to avoid failures they absorb auctionrate securities onto their own balance sheets in late 2008 some brokerdealers had accumulated substantial inventories of auctionrate securities as result of supporting auctions for example court documents indicated that ubs increased its holdings of auctionrate securities by about 500 from june 2007 to january 200859 in the first half of 2007 ubs holdings of auctionrate securities had fluctuated between 1 billion and 2 billion by february 8 2008 ubs held nearly 10 billion in auction rate securities raising serious riskmanagement concerns at time of mounting mortgagebacked securities losses on february 13 2008 most major brokerdealers ceased their support of interest auctions leading to failures in the vast majority of auctions held that day as result the auctionrate securities market has largely seized up leaving investors with illiquid investments in long maturities when auctions fail interest rates are set by terms of the securization contract in some cases default interest rates revert to high levels that have caused some issuers financial stress while in other cases interest rates are more in line with normal shortterm rates while many investors earn interest rates higher than usual money market rates the lack of liquidity has decreased the value of many of those holdings60 small investors locked into auction rate securities who have had to borrow to meet shortterm obligations typically pay much higher rates than what those securities return auction failures have occurred for assetbacked securities that have little obvious relation to mortgage markets such as student loans and municipal debt where the financial risks embedded in the loans themselves appear minimal61 even

new york times apr 13 2008 61 concern over the financial condition of some bond insurers has been cited as factor in continued crs21 though federal guarantees for student loans protect lenders or their assignees from most losses due to default administrative and legal procedures required by the default process could delay payments to asset holders that is federal guarantees ensure eventual payment of most lost earnings due to default but not prompt payment in some cases bond insurers provide guarantees of timely payment to holders of assetbacked securities concerns about the financial condition of bond insurers therefore might trigger investor concerns about timely payment even if eventual repayment were federally guaranteed problems in the vast majority of auctionrate markets however probably stem from how auctionrate securities are structured rather than from the quality of underlying assets in particular auctionrate securities provide investors with substantial liquidity so long as auctions function normally when potential investors fear that auctions may fail however which would lock them into illiquid positions they may hesitate to bid especially when shortterm credit has become more difficult or costly to obtain fears of auction failure may be selffulfilling concerns that auctions may fail will deter bidders thus increasing the chance of failure the collapse of the auctionrate securities market put substantial strains on investors who had thought they were investing in highly liquid cash equivalents that then became highly illiquid62 many investors and financial professionals claim that they were not alerted to possible liquidity risks due to auction failures furthermore many financial professionals claim that they were led to believe that dealers would play more active role in preventing auction failures one survey found that about two thirds of corporate treasurers in firms that held auctionrate securities said that dealers had implied that support for auction securities to avoid auction failures and 17 of treasurers said that dealers had explicitly promised such support63 unwinding of the auctionrate securities market will probably be complex even when the quality of underlying assets such as federally guaranteed student loans is high some municipalities have restructured auctionrate securities debt and some other issuers have redeemed portions of security issues litigation initiated by state attorneys general and by classaction suits may play an important role in this restructuring64 citibank bought back about

portion of student loan assetbacked securities slabs and hold them up to the end of september 2008 in order to provide liquidity to lenders that have relied on securitization methods of finance the secretary has stressed her intention to ensure that the program which aims to protect lenders against losses on new loans for one year will result in net cost to the government71 details of the initiative entitled the loan purchase commitment and the loan participation purchase program were published in the federal register on july 1 200872 designing and administering programs that provide insurance benefits to sophisticated financial institutions that have access to modern riskmanagement and hedging techniques and that would impose net economic cost on the federal government would seem challenging task especially if ffel lender yields were aligned closely with lender costs and if the costs of using federal funds were fully accounted for73 the department of education however contends that these loan purchase programs could save the federal government money because the reduction in interest subsidies paid to lenders would more than offset according to its calculations the costs of administering these programs and the costs of financial and operational risks that these programs might incur74 70 letter from us secretary of education margaret spellings to chief executive officers

httpwwwcbogovftpdocs82xxdoc82322007_09_studentloanspdf 74 the department of education concluded that in an extreme scenario in which the continued crs24 other federal responses and congressional proposals several members of congress and major student lenders have called for consideration of measures that might provide additional liquidity to the student loan market75 government decisions on whether to supply liquidity to financial markets in times of systemic financial stress have typically started with consideration of bagehots rule which is explained below bagehots rule and market liquidity central banks for over century have accepted responsibility for providing liquidity to markets during credit contractions to avoid serious harm to solvent financial institutions that might affect the stability of financial markets as whole central bankers however typically do not wish to reward financial institutions for having taken unwise or overly risky decisions in the phrase of the english writer walter bagehot central banks should lend freely at penalty rate on good collateral76 in other words central banks according to bagehots law should stand willing to exchange high quality but illiquid assets for highly liquid securities such as treasury bonds but on such terms that provide incentives for prudent behavior in the future77 some proposals to inject liquidity into student loan markets reflect at least in part the logic of the bagehot rule while few believe that difficulties in the student loan market which comprises small part of world financial markets are threat to the stability of national or international capital markets disruption of the student loan market could inflict substantial hardship on students or their families as well as upon colleges and universities thus offering loans or other forms of liquidity to student lenders during credit contraction can help avoid harming students and higher education institutions if such disruptions of the student loan market are due entirely to external forces then there is little need to impose penalty rate on lending to ensure prudent behavior in the future on the other hand if the availability of government liquidity on generous terms might encourage lender behavior that might lead to future financial disruptions then some financial economists would argue that lending at penalty rate would improve financial stability in the student loan market 74 continued government purchased all ffel loans originated for the 20082009 academic year costs for both the purchase program and the participation program were less expensive to the government than for the baseline subsidy costs for ffelp loans costs for the ffelp baseline in this period other scenarios according to the departments analysis the loan purchase program would be less expensive to the government than baseline scenario ibid also see discussion of the federal credit reform act of 1990 and the calculation of subsidy

consider measures that might provide additional liquidity to the student loan market78 senator dodd proposed that secretary paulson consider using the federal financing bank ffb to play role in the student loan market and that chairman bernanke consider allowing the federal reserves newly created term securities lending facility tslf to accept highquality slabs as collateral federal financing bank on april 29 2008 representative kanjorski introduced hr 5914 the student loan access act which would let the ffb buy certain securities backed by federally guaranteed loans the federal financing bank act of 1973 pl 9322412 usc 2281 et seq created the federal financing bank ffb to centralize and streamline federal debt management policies79 ffb is government corporation but acts as an arm of the us treasury the ffb provides means for federal agencies to finance their credit programs by borrowing directly from the treasury and replaces earlier arrangements that allowed agencies to issue their own offbudget debt80 in 1985 the grammrudmanhollings act pl 99 177 introduced additional controls on federal credit programs financed through ffb the federal credit reform act of 1990 fcra requires that the reported budgetary cost of credit program equal the estimated subsidy cost at the time the credit is provided81 the fcra defines subsidy cost as the estimated longterm cost to the government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs for proposed credit program congressional budget office cbo must estimate the subsidy cost and the office of management and budget omb becomes responsible for estimating the subsidy cost once legislation containing federal credit program is enacted in the view of omb fcra requires that any estimated subsidy amount even if zero be covered by an enacted appropriation of budget authority82 therefore under ombs interpretation of fcra allowing the ffb to purchase student loans or assets backed by student loans would require legislation providing budget authority to cover any subsidy or administrative costs that the federal government might incur 78 us congress senate committee on

not complete except in certain limited circumstances83 while securities backed by federally guaranteed student loans may carry other guarantees for investors those securities are not fully guaranteed by the federal government thus proposed ffb purchases of student loans or securities backed by student loans would represent significant change in ffb practices term securities lending facility the federal reserves term securities lending facility established march 11 2008 provides liquidity to financial markets by allowing primary dealers ie banks and securities brokerages that trade in us government securities with the federal reserve system to exchange high quality but illiquid assets for treasury securities which are widely considered cash equivalents84 the federal reserve announced on may 2 2008 that primary dealers may pledge aaaaaarated assetbacked securities as collateral in upcoming term secured lending facility auctions measure intended to provide liquidity to various financial markets including the market for securitized student loans85 on july 30 2008 the federal reserve said it would extend the tslf until january 30 200986 conclusion since the inception of the federal guaranteed student loan program congress has sought to allow lenders an equitable return on capital to ensure an adequate supply of student loans and to avoid disruptions that would interfere with the educational plans of students as financial markets have evolved and banking practices have become more efficient however lender yields that were once perceived to be adequate may have over time allowed student lenders to earn rents that is receive price above their costs from time to time congress has adjusted lender subsidy formulae with the aim of bringing lender yields more in line with lender costs thus reducing costs to taxpayers or making funds available for other priorities while avoiding supply disruptions because the true economic costs of lenders are not easily observed and because costs in different segments of the student loan market differ achieving precise alignment of lender yields and lender costs is difficult moreover lenders have different cost structures so that cut in lender interest rate subsidies that would allow highly efficient lowcost lender to earn profit might put considerable pressure on another lender with higher costs 83 see discussion in the

college cost reduction and access act of 2007 according to its sponsors was intended to reduce excess subsidies to student lenders87 student lenders and industry associates have claimed that those subsidy reductions would force many student lenders from the market potentially disrupting loan supply and complicating financial arrangements of many students and their families since early 2008 several dozen lenders have announced plans to leave the student loan market in part or in full raising concerns that inadequate supply of student loans could disrupt financial aid arrangements in the 20082009 academic year evaluating the effects of subsidy reductions and changes in lender insurance provisions however is difficult to separate from the effects of episodes of turmoil in global financial markets that emerged about the same time as the last stages of congressional consideration of the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 congress by passing the ensuring continued access to student loans act of 2008 and through other initiatives has sought to put in place mechanisms that would avoid or at least mitigate any such disruption in the near term the need for other measures or for more thorough going changes in federal student loan policy in the longer term may depend on how the current economic slowdown develops and how financial markets react and evolve in the face of challenging economic conditions 87 us congress house committee on education and labor website college cost reduction and access act available at httpedlaborhousegovmicroccraashtml accessed july 2 2008 crs28 appendix shifts in demand and supply of student loans this appendix explains how economic demographic and other factors can affect the demand for student loans and the supply of student loans using basic microeconomics demand curve shows relationship between price and the quantity of good or service that consumers want to buy at that price holding other factors constant in market for loans the interest rate is the price and the volume of loan originations is typical measure of quantity demand shifts demand for student loans is derived demand meaning that students and their families presumably value the benefits of higher education which loans help finance rather than the loans themselves that is the willingness of students and their families to take student loans depends on the attractiveness of higher education when some factor that helps determine the demand curve changes the demand curve shifts for example when the number of graduating high school students increases the demand curve dd in figure 6 shifts to the right dn dn so that at any given price higher quantity of loans is demanded conversely decrease in the number of new high school graduates would shift the demand curve to the left changes that most economists believe would cause the demand for student loans to shift to the right include the following increases in the college premium the average difference between wages earned by college graduates and those earned by those who have not attended college increases in the size of traditional collegeage cohorts 1821 increases in the number of nontraditional students some factors could arguably increase or decrease demand for student loans for example an increase in the unemployment rate may reduce income which could reduce demand for higher education and student loans alternatively higher unemployment could reduce the amount of income student would lose by attending school which could increase demand for higher education thus the effect of rising unemployment on demand for student loans is ambiguous the cost of higher education also may have an ambiguous effect on demand for student loans higher tuition costs could increase the demand for loans or could discourage some students from attending similarly family income could also have an ambiguous effect on the demand for student loans at some income levels an increase in income could increase the probability of attending college while at higher income levels additional income might reduce the need for loans the effect of unemployment higher tuition and family income on demand for higher education therefore can only be resolved by empirical research crs29 figure 6 shifts in supply and demand for student loans source crs crs30 supply shifts similarly supply curve shows the relationship between price and the quantity of good or service that firms are willing to supply holding other factors constant the lender interest rate or the yield lenders receive acts as the price in loan markets competitive firms supply curve is its marginal or incremental cost schedule88 the supply curve shifts when something changes lenders costs for example if lenders cost of funds then profitmaximizing lenders will be willing to offer fewer loans at given price so that the supply curve shifts to the left from ss in figure 6 to sn sn for ffel lenders who receive yield based on increases relative to an index of commercial paper rates the cost of funds rises if market interest rates used to finance loans rise relative to commercial paper rates which may occur in periods of high financial volatility on the other hand if lenders find more efficient ways to service loans thus lowering their costs then the supply curve shifts to the right other factors that economists believe would shift the supply of student loans to the left include the following increased default rates higher loan servicing costs especially in comparison to loan size higher marketing costs student loan markets differ from other markets as noted in the introduction student loan markets differ from other markets in important ways in many types of loan markets lenders and borrowers have imperfect information about each other which may lead to problems of adverse selection and moral hazard adverse selection occurs when lenders cannot distinguish between more and less risky borrowers which can prevent less risky borrowers from obtaining loans on terms that reflect their low risk of default moral hazard occurs when lenders cannot monitor borrowers so that some borrowers may take actions that increase risk to the lender for example moral hazard would occur if students were less careful with borrowed funds than with their own earnings both adverse selection and moral hazard can cause loan markets to function inefficiently or to shut down completely while some loan markets mitigate such problems via collateral requirements or the use of credit score information those approaches are not easily applied to student loan markets89 88 more precisely the supply curve of firm in competitive market is its marginal cost curve so long as the price is high enough to allow firm to recover its costs if the price is not high enough the firm shuts down at least in the short run 89 in particular the benefits of higher education are unsuited as collateral as
