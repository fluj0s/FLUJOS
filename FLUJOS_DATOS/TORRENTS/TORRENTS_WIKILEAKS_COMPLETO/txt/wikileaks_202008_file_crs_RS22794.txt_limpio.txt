updated related reports include crs report rl33453 armenia azerbaijan and georgia political developments and implications for us interests by jim nichol background political instability in georgia appeared to worsen in november 2007 after several opposition parties united in national council that launched demonstrations in tbilisi the capital to demand that legislative elections be held in early 2008 as originally called for instead of in late 2008 as set by the governmentdominated legislature the demonstrations had been spurred by sensational accusations by former defense minister irakli okruashvili against president mikheil saakashvili including that saakashvili ordered him to commit murder calls for saakashvilis resignation intensified after okruashvili claimed that he had been coerced by the government to recant the accusations on november 7 police and security forces forcibly dispersed demonstrators reportedly resulting in several dozen injuries security forces also stormed the independent imedi hope television station which had aired opposition grievances and shut it down saakashvili declared state of emergency for 15 days giving him enhanced powers he claimed that the demonstrations had been part of coup attempt orchestrated by russia and ordered three russian diplomats to leave the country us and other international criticism of the crackdown may have influenced saakashvilis decision to step down as president on november 25 2007 so that early presidential elections could be held on january 5 2008 because i as this countrys crs2 leader need an unequivocal mandate to cope with all foreign threats and all kinds of pressure on georgia1 at the same time he called for plebiscite on whether to have spring or fall legislative election and on whether georgia should join nato legislative speaker nino burjanadze became acting president she called on prosecutors to drop charges against imedi it renewed broadcasts on december 12 and became for time the main television outlet for opposition candidates in the election see also below the campaign significant amendments to the electoral code were adopted in late november and middecember to make elections more democratic including by adding some opposition party representatives to electoral commissions however the adoption of new rules shortly before the election sometimes resulted in haphazard implementation according to the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce which monitored the electoral process2 most observers considered the nomination process for presidential candidates to be inclusive and transparent besides saakashvili six other candidates were successfully httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22794 registered see table 1 among the campaign pledges made by the candidates saakashvili ran on his claimed record of reducing corruption and crime and improving living conditions and pledged to further reduce poverty and to restore georgias territorial integrity peacefully levan gachechiladze stated that he would work to create parliamentary system of rule with constitutional monarchy nominate former foreign minister salome zourabichvili as the prime minister and encourage private enterprise and poverty alleviation davit gamqrelidze pledged to consider backing either parliamentary system or constitutional monarchy and to bolster freedom of

he pledged to use his fortune to provide unemployment benefits and some free utilities to the poor mass rallies were prominent in the campaign and several candidates toured the country in contrast patarkatsishvili faced charges of involvement in coup attempt linked to the november demonstrations and conducted his campaign from abroad most observers considered much of the campaigning as focused on accusations rather than issues perhaps the most sensational event of the campaign occurred in late december when the government released recordings which it claimed incriminated patarkatsishvili in

alleviate poverty january 13 2008 also may have helped ease some grievances against his rule according to many observers the fractiousness of some of the opposition which could not agree on single candidate was major factor in the results preliminary report by observers from the osce the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace and the european parliament ep assessed the election as in essence consistent with most commitments and standards for democratic elections although significant challenges were revealed3 several positive aspects of the election were listed including that the race offered competitive choice of candidates negative aspects included pervasive violations that were not conducive to constructive issuebased election campaign these included the use of government offices to support saakashvili substantiated instances in which officials harassed opposition campaigners allegations that state employees were ordered to vote for 3 preliminary report by observers from the national democratic institute usbased ngo similarly suggested that key aspects of this election were in line with democratic principles but there were also flaws that should be addressed to enhance the integrity of future elections statement of the ndi election observer delegation to georgias 2008 presidential election january 7 2008 according to preliminary statement by observers from the international republican institute another usbased ngo the election broadly met international standards but they called for reforms regarding voter lists and for judicial impartiality preliminary statement georgias election broadly meets international standards technical improvements needed january 6 2008 see also comments by kenneth wollack and jim kolbe hudson institute january 16 2008 crs4 saakashvili the use of social services to gain support for saakashvili and tendency toward prosaakashvili bias by the cec in resolving complaints4 the monitors viewed the vote count more negatively with significant number assessing it as bad or very bad the preliminary report argued that electoral abuses varied from region to region appeared often due to incompetence or local fraud and stopped short of organized and systematic manipulation the cec and the courts eventually invalidated or corrected the results in 18 of 3511 voting precincts among other assessments of the election the prestigious georgian ngo fair elections reported on january 10 that its exit polling at 400 precincts appeared to indicate that saakashvili may have won enough votes to avoid runoff even if there were voting irregularities5 us analyst charles fairbanks however argued on january 16 2008 that the balloting reported for saakashvili was inflated so that it was unlikely that he won in the first round6 although russian election observers were invited the russian foreign ministry asserted on january 6 2008 that the election could hardly be called free and fair including because the campaign was accompanied with the extensive use of administrative resources unconcealed pressure on opposition candidates and rigid limits on their access to financial and media resources7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22794 implications for georgia and saakashvili many observers regarded the relative peacefulness of the election campaign compared to the november 2007 violence as positive sign that at least fitful democratization might be preserved in georgia among other possible signs of progress toward democratization and stability saakashvili in his inaugural address on january 20 2008 pledged to facilitate greater opposition participation in political decisionmaking some analysts also suggest that opposition parties and politicians might have benefitted from the campaign by becoming better known and might gain votes in upcoming legislative elections thereby enhancing political pluralism these observers suggest that opposition parties and politicians will soon shift from protesting the results of the presidential race to campaigning for prospective may 2008 legislative election in the economic realm these observers suggest that saakashvilis reelection reassured international investors that georgia has stable investment climate although boosted social spending could increase shortterm inflation8 the secretary general of the council of europe coe on january 6 urged opposition politicians to eschew immature rabblerousing and to show responsibility political maturity and respect for the democratic process by working through 4 the ngo transparency

january 4 2008 crs5 constitutional procedures to address electoral irregularities9 thousands of people reportedly turned out on january 13 and january 20 to peacefully protest against what they considered fraudulent election gachechiladze and other leaders of the national council asserted that saakashvili did not win enough votes to avoid runoff where he would have faced single opponent gachechiladze many observers argue that saakashvilis electoral victory with 53 of the vote contrasts sharply with the 96 of the vote he won in 2004 and illustrates that public trust in his governance has declined one georgian analyst has suggested however that despite this decline in public trust many citizens remembered the disorder of past months and years and were fearful of voting for opposition candidates who promised radical political and economic changes if elected the risk of disorder could greatly increase if public trust further declines as the result of tainted prospective may 2008 legislative election10 saakashvilis win appeared to be further blow to russias hopes of restoring its influence in georgia according to many observers these observers also raise concerns that saakashvilis campaign pledge to soon unify georgia although he called for peaceful httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22794 measures could contribute to further tensions with russia in his inaugural address however saakashvili attempted to reassure russia that georgia was intent on repairing bilateral ties one tajik analyst has suggested that saakashvilis reelection provides positive example to reformminded politicians in russia and other soviet successor states and threatens nonreformist governments in these states11 implications for us interests on november 8 2007 the us state department welcomed president saakashvilis call for early presidential elections and plebiscite on the timing of legislative elections at the same time it urged saakashvili to relinquish emergency power and to restore all media broadcasts to facilitate free and fair election and urged all political factions to maintain calm and respect the rule of law deputy assistant secretary of state matthew bryza visited tbilisi on november 1113 with letter from secretary of state condoleezza rice that listed these and other proposals to restore the momentum of democratic reform in georgia highlighting us interest in georgias fate he argued that while in the past the united states had focused on georgia as conduit for oil and gas pipelines to the west and on security assistance today what makes georgia top tier issue for the us government is democracy he held extensive talks with government and opposition politicians to urge them to moderate their mutual accusations and to make compromises necessary for democratic progress he also stressed that the united states remains firm supporter of georgias nato aspirations and called on unnamed nato allies to await further political developments in georgia

that include assessing georgias performance in holding prospective may 2008 legislative election just after the january 5 balloting the state department congratulated the people of georgia for an election that many international observers considered was in essence consistent with most osce and coe commitments and standards however the state department also raised concerns about reported electoral violations and urged that they be thoroughly investigated and remedied us ambassador to georgia john tefft likewise appeared cautious when he stated on january 10 that the united states had not yet reached an official political assessment of the election so had not congratulated winner13 after the cec announced the final election results president bush on january 14 telephoned saakashvili to congratulate him and dispatched us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez to the inauguration some opposition supporters in georgia criticized the united states for recognizing saakashvilis win perhaps reflecting some potential increase in antiamericanism but at an opposition protest at the us embassy on january httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22794 22 only one of the parties involved in the national council participated many in congress long have supported democratization and other assistance to georgia as reflected in hearings and legislation the 110th congress pl 11017

introducing the resolution senator richard lugar averred that he was strong friend of the georgian people and that the resolution indicated our strong hopes that georgia will return to the democratic path and embrace free and fair election process he also urged georgia to facilitate the work of international election monitors particularly those from the osce14 representative alcee hastings was appointed as special coordinator by the osce chairmaninoffice to lead mission of nearly 500 shortterm observers who monitored the january 5 election the day after the election representative hastings reportedly stated that he viewed the election as viable expression of free choice of the georgian people but he also cautioned that georgias future holds immense challenges because of the high degree of mistrust and polarization in georgian society15 similarly former representative jim kolbe who led delegation from the international republican institute evaluated the election as broadly free and fair but called for further reforms16 12 us fed news november 12 2007 us fed news november 13 2007 13 us department of state press statement georgia presidential election january 7 2008 reuters
