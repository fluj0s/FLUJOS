analyst in health care financing domestic social policy division summary medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments but each state designs and administers its own program within broad federal guidelines1 this report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22101 provides brief overview of medicaid program administration at the state level and includes information on organization responsibilities and expenditures it also describes issues related to program administration that have attracted recent attention organization the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms within the us department of health and human services hhs is responsible for medicaid program administration at the federal level2 but individual state medicaid agencies administer their own programs on daytoday basis federal law requires each state to designate single state agency to administer or supervise the administration of its medicaid program this agency which is usually part of welfare health or umbrella human resources agency will often contract with other public or private entities to perform various program functions an august 2000 survey by the american public human services association aphsa on operational responsibility for 16 key functions found that only five states had medicaid agencies that administered or shared in the administration of all 16 however most functions not directly administered by the medicaid agency were handled by another state agency or department one exception was the operation of medicaid management information systems mmiss which are used to process claims for payment eg from doctors and other providers who serve medicaid patients and perform variety of other tasks eg monitor service utilization and provide data to meet federal reporting requirements the aphsa survey found that 29 states contracted with 1 for program overview see crs report rl33202 medicaid primer by elicia j herz 2 discussion in this report excludes medicaid administrative activities and expenditures that are exclusively federal eg program oversight by hhs staff crs2 the private sector to administer this function3 information from cms indicates that 36 states did so as of june 15 20074 responsibilities states that opt to have medicaid program as all currently do are obligated to pay for covered services that are rendered by qualified providers to eligible individuals using methods of administration that are found to be proper and efficient by the secretary of hhs to this end state must allow individuals to apply for assistance and determine their eligibility determine which providers are qualified to furnish covered benefits and how much they will be reimbursed have system for processing claims submitted by providers monitor the quality of care provided to beneficiaries maintain control mechanisms designed to minimize improper payments resulting from unintended errors as well as fraud and abuse have system for resolving grievances by applicants beneficiaries and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22101 providers and collect and report required program information to cms although some federal guidelines for program administration are specific eg nursing facility standards quality control requirements for monitoring eligibility determinations data collection and reporting states have considerable discretion in other areas eg choice of optional eligibility groups and benefits procedures for gathering information from applicants setting provider reimbursement rates5 expenditures the federal government pays share of every states spending on medicaid services and program administration the federal share for most medicaid service costs is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage fmap which is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average and vice versa fmaps have statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 the federal match for administrative expenditures does not vary by state and is generally 50 but certain administrative functions have higher federal match those with 75 federal match include 3 american

necessary by the secretary of hhs for the proper and efficient administration of states medicaid program in recent years expenditures for state medicaid program administration have grown at about the same rate as expenditures for services as result they have remained httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22101 relatively constant share of the total for example between fy1999 and fy2006 administrative expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 78 and service expenditures grew at rate of 75 over the same period administrative expenditures as share of the total grew only slightly from 50 to 517 detailed fy2006 expenditures are provided in table 1 at the end of this report current issues program integrity discussions of medicaid program integrity are often limited to issues of fraud and abuse by medicaid providers as well as beneficiaries and efforts to curtail these problems however broader view encompasses other program management issues eg policy development and execution that affect the ability of states and the federal government to ensure that beneficiaries receive quality care and that public funds are spent appropriately8 partly in response to concerns about the level of resources devoted to medicaid program integrity activities and the programs vulnerability to significant financial losses9 congress provided new funding in the deficit reduction 6 enhanced federal matches above 50 have also been provided on temporary basis for certain administrative functions for example under section 1903a3d of the social security act states could receive 75 federal match during quarter in 1991 1992 or 1993 for expenditures attributable to the adoption of required drug use review program 7 us department of health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid

and challenges in ensuring program integrity in medicaid kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured june 2007 at httpwwwkfforgmedicaid7650cfm 9 us government accountability office medicaid program integrity state and federal efforts continued crs4 act of 2005 dra pl 109171 the dra established medicaid integrity program with an appropriation reaching 75 million annually for audits identification of overpayments education with respect to payment integrity and quality of care and other purposes it also provided an additional 25 million in each of fy2006fy2010 for medicaid activities of the hhs office of inspector general and an appropriation reaching 60 million annually for an expanded medicaremedicaid data match project referred to as medimedi that analyzes claims from both programs together in order to detect aberrant billing patterns10 more recently program integrity has been discussed in the context of controversial medicaid regulations that would restrict the ability of states to use certain financing mechanisms and receive federal reimbursement for certain services and activities11 from the perspective of the bush administration the regulations are aimed at strengthening the fiscal integrity of medicaid others acknowledge the need to examine issues that have been raised but also argue that the regulations in their current form will hinder the ability of states to appropriately serve the medicaid population12 improper payments under the improper payments information act of 2002 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22101 pl 107300 federal agencies are required to identify programs that are susceptible to significant improper payments estimate the amount of overpayments and report annually to congress on those figures and on the steps being taken to reduce such payments final rule regarding payment error rate measurement perm for medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip was effective on october 1 2007 under the final rule subset of states are selected in given year and are reviewed using statistically valid random sample of claims and eligibility determinations to determine medicaid and schip error rates states must submit corrective action plan based on the error rate analysis and must follow existing rules for reimbursing the federal government for its share of any overpayments improper payments are defined as those that should not have been made or that were made in an incorrect amount eg duplicate payment to provider or payment that was incorrectly denied the payment error rate is calculated by taking the absolute rather than net value of overpayments and underpayments and dividing by total payments13 based on six months of data for the feeforservice component of medicaid which accounts for the majority of medicaid service expenditures hhs estimated improper 9 continued to prevent and detect improper payments gao04707 july 2004 at httpwwwgaogovnew itemsd04707pdf 10 for more information see

coordination with existing rules for eligibility errors schip reauthorization bills that were vetoed in 2007 hr 976 and hr 3963 would have made various changes15 citizenship documentation due to recent changes in federal law individuals who declare that they are citizens for medicaid eligibility purposes must present documentation that proves citizenship and documents personal identity as result of the new requirement most states report that they are spending more time completing medicaid applications and redeterminations and that their administrative costs have increased states will receive federal reimbursement for these costs using the 50 rate that applies to most medicaid administrative functions because existing enrollees must present documentation at their next eligibility redetermination process that generally occurs at least once year administrative costs should peak in the year following implementation of the requirement costs in later years should be lower reflecting the ongoing expense of documenting those who are new to the program number of bills that would modify the citizenship documentation requirement have been introduced16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22101 allocation of common administrative costs because of the overlap in eligible populations states often undertake administrative activities that benefit more than one program under the former aid to families with dependent children afdc cash welfare program afdc and medicaid program eligibility were linked and many afdc families also qualified for food stamps as result states often collected necessary eligibility information for all three programs during single interview or performed other shared administrative tasks and charged the full amount of the cost to afdc as matter of convenience since the federal government reimbursed states for 50 of administrative expenditures for all three programs total federal spending was not affected by the way in which states allocated the programs common administrative costs when congress replaced afdc with the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program in 1996 the 50 federal match for expenditures related to cash welfare assistance ended and the automatic link between cash welfare and medicaid eligibility was severed later hhs clarified that states are required to allocate common administrative costs for tanf medicaid and food stamps based on the relative benefits derived by each program17 remaining issue of controversy stems from the fact that tanf block grants are calculated in part on the basis of pre1996 federal welfare spending including any amounts received by states as reimbursement for common 14 us government accountability office improper payments federal executive

fiscal year beginning on or after october 1 1998 see us department of health and human services office of grants and acquisition management ogam action transmittal 982 crs6 administrative costs as result tanf block grants are higher in many states than they would be if common administrative costs attributable to medicaid and food stamps were excluded from block grant calculations to compensate congress has permanently reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs in most states by flat dollar amount that reflects the administrative costs attributable to food stamps that are included in each states tanf block grant the annual reductions total about 200 million federal reimbursement for medicaid administrative costs has not been reduced in similar manner but proposals
