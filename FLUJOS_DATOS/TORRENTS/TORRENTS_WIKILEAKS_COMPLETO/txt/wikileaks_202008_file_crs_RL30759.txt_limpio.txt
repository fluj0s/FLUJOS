research service the library of congress child welfare implementation of the adoption and safe families act summary in response to rising numbers of children in foster care and concerns about the safety of children that remain with or return to their families after placement in foster care the 105th congress enacted the adoption and safe families act of 1997 asfa pl 10589 with two primary goals 1 to ensure that consideration of childrens safety is paramount in child welfare decisions so that children are not returned to unsafe homes and 2 to ensure that necessary legal procedures occur expeditiously so that children who cannot return home may be placed for adoption or another permanent arrangement quickly asfa is considered the most sweeping change in federal child welfare law in nearly 20 years most provisions in the 1997 law amended titles ivb or ive of the social security act which authorize grants to states for child welfare activities including foster care and adoption assistance in fy2004 titles ivb and ive received appropriations totaling 76 billion as enacted in 1980 pl 96272 the underlying law requires states to make reasonable efforts on behalf of abused and neglected children or children at risk of abuse and neglect to ensure that services are provided to their families so they can remain safely at home or return home if they have been placed in foster care states also must conduct administrative and court hearings on every childs case according to prescribed timetable and establish permanent placement plan for each child periodically since pl 96272 was enacted concern arose that some states and judges interpreted the federal child welfare laws as requiring family preservation and reunification at all costs including in cases where the childs health or safety was in jeopardy asfa was intended to clarify federal policy to ensure safety for children who come into contact with the child welfare system moreover asfa was intended to expedite permanency for foster children and to promote adoption for those children who cannot safely return home since 1997 all states have enacted their own laws to implement parts of asfa and the federal department of health and human services hhs has issued regulations to implement certain provisions of the 1997 law acting on 1994 legislative directive pl 103432 hhs also initiated review system in 2001 to monitor state compliance with federal child welfare laws including the provisions of asfa hhs also issued several reports as mandated by asfa finally asfa authorized annual incentive payments to states that exceeded their highest previous number of foster child adoptions in given year with larger payments for adoptions of children with special needs congress reauthorized and revised this program in 2003 pl 108145 to create separate incentives for adoptions of older children for adoptions in fy1998fy2003 states earned total of 178 million of which 179 million were earned by 31 states and puerto rico for adoptions finalized in 2003 hhs data indicate approximately 52500 children were adopted with the involvement of public child welfare agencies in 2002 for an increase of nearly 70

matthew shuman presidential management intern on rotation from the us department of health and human services child welfare implementation of the adoption and safe families act introduction in the mid1980s the number of children in foster care began to climb sharply while the number of children who were adopted from foster care remained static most children who enter foster care eventually return to their families but concern developed in the 1990s about the growing number of children who did not return home and were remaining in foster care for long periods of time at the same time there was growing perception that federal law needed clarification regarding the importance of child safety these factors prompted the 105th congress to enact legislation with two primary goals 1 to ensure that consideration of childrens safety is paramount in child welfare decisions so that children are not returned to unsafe homes and 2 to ensure that necessary legal procedures occur expeditiously so that children who cannot return home may be placed for adoption or another permanent arrangement quickly the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 was enacted in november 1997 and is considered the most sweeping change in federal child welfare law since 1980 when the current configuration of federal child welfare programs was established since 1997 all states have enacted their own laws to implement parts of asfa in january 2000 the federal department of health and human services hhs issued regulations to implement certain provisions of the 1997 law and acting on 1994 congressional directive pl 103432 to establish review system to monitor state compliance with federal child welfare laws including asfa provisions hhs also has issued several reports that were mandated by asfa and has awarded six rounds of annual incentive payments also authorized by asfa and subsequently reauthorized in 2003 to states that increased their numbers of foster child and special needs child adoptions this report provides background information and description of asfa with references to implementation by states and hhs and related actions that occurred after the laws

report adoption 2002 on february 14 1997 at the same time related proposals were being developed in congress in april 1997 the house passed the adoption promotion act hr 867 by vote of 4165 and bipartisan group of senators introduced the safe adoptions and family environments safe act s 511 in march 1997 the safe act was superseded by another bipartisan package the promotion of adoption safety and support for abused and neglected children pass act s 1195 that was introduced in the senate on september 18 the pass act with some changes from the introduced version was approved by the full senate on november 8 as substitute for the housepassed version of hr 867 differences between the house and senate were resolved and final amended version of hr 867 renamed the adoption and safe families act was passed on november 13 by vote of 4067 in the house and by unanimous consent in the senate president clinton signed the bill into law pl 10589 on november 19 1997 most of the provisions in the 1997 law amended title ivb or ive of the social security act which authorize grants to states for child welfare activities the majority of these grants are permanent authorizations and received appropriations totaling 76 billion for fy20043 as enacted in 1980 pl 96272 these provisions require states to make reasonable efforts on behalf of abused and neglected children or children at risk of abuse and neglect to ensure that services are provided to their families so they can remain safely at home or return home if they have been placed in foster care states also must conduct administrative and court hearings on every childs case according to prescribed timetable and establish permanent placement plan for each child periodically during the years since pl 96272 was

httpwaysandmeanshousegovdocumentsaspsection813 crs3 family preservation and reunification at all costs including in cases where the childs health or safety was in jeopardy the adoption and safe families act was intended to clarify federal policy to ensure safety for children who come into contact with the child welfare system moreover in response to concern about the growing numbers f children in foster care starting in the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s asfa was intended to expedite permanency for foster children and to promote adoption for those children who cannot safely return home the 1997 law established significant new procedural requirements to promote safety and expedite permanency which the congressional budget office cbo estimated would save federal money by shortening the time that some children spend in foster care at the same time the new law also contained some spending provisions these included financial incentive payments to states that increased their numbers of adoptions from foster care requirement that states provide health insurance coverage to special needs adopted children who are not eligible for federal subsidies provision that continued eligibility for federal subsidies to special needs children whose adoptions are disrupted and reauthorization and expansion of the family preservation program under title ivb cbo estimated the net cost of pl 10589 at 40 million over fiveyear period to offset these costs the law reduced spending for the contingency fund under the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant provisions of the adoption and safe families act child safety provisions the adoption and safe families act amended the existing federal child welfare law to require that childs health and safety be of paramount concern in any efforts made by the state to preserve or reunify the childs family and to provide new assurances that children in foster care are safe reasonable efforts to preserve families states continue to be required to make reasonable efforts to avoid the need to place children in foster care and to return them home if they are removed but asfa established exceptions to this requirement specifically states are not required to make efforts to preserve or reunify family if court finds that parent has killed another of his or her children or committed felony assault against the child or sibling or if his or her parental rights to another child were previously involuntarily terminated according to the national conference of state legislatures ncsl which tracked the enactment of state laws to implement asfa most states incorporated these exceptions in their statutes4 in addition the federal law established that efforts to preserve or reunify family are not required if the court finds that parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances each state may define these circumstances in its own laws although asfa cites abandonment torture chronic abuse and sexual abuse as examples moreover pl 10589 states that it does not preclude individual judges from using their discretion to protect childs health and safety in any case 4 national conference of state legislatures adoption and safe families act of 1997 resources at httpwwwncslorgprogramscyfasfaslrhtm crs4 regardless of whether the specific circumstances are cited in federal law at the same time the federal law does not prohibit states from making efforts to preserve or reunify family in any case according to ncsl the aggravated circumstances most typically included in state definitions are those listed in the federal law as of august 1999 some states also included other circumstances such as physical abuse assault or battery of child 21 states serious or chronic neglect 14 states discretion of the court 14 states physical or sexual abuse or assault of another child 13 states failure to comply with or make progress under treatment plan 7 states parent cannot be located after diligent search 7 states previous removal of child for physical or sexual abuse 7 states conviction of various crimes 7 states violent crimes against parent of the child 7 states parental substance abuse 6 states and mental illness or deficiency precluding care of child even with services 6 states in final regulations issued on january 25 2000 hhs specified that judicial findings of reasonable efforts including findings that reasonable efforts to prevent removal or reunification are not required must be explicitly documented and made on casebycase basis the regulations also state that such findings must be made within 60 days of the childs removal from home criminal background checks to further promote safety the 1997 law required that states conduct criminal background checks for all prospective foster or adoptive parents and deny approval to anyone who has ever been convicted of felony child abuse or neglect spousal abuse crime against children including child pornography or violent crime including rape sexual assault or homicide in addition states must deny approval to anyone with felony conviction for physical assault battery or drugrelated offense if the felony occurred within the past five years states may opt out of the asfa criminal record check provisions either through letter from the states governor to the secretary of hhs or through legislation enacted by the state legislature according to hhs as of august 2004 three states idaho oklahoma and oregon had opted out through enactment of legislation and six states arizona california new york massachusetts nebraska and ohio opted out through letter from their governors in final regulations issued on january 25 2000 hhs requires states to document that criminal records checks have been conducted if the state opts out of the specific asfa requirement the regulations specify that licensing files for foster or adoptive family or for child care institution must document that safety considerations have been addressed with respect to the family or the staff of the institution5 5 in his 2000 campaign website thencandidate bush indicated that he would propose elimination of the current law provision that allows states to opt out of the criminal record check requirement according to hhs all states that opt out of the provision do perform criminal background checks but not necessarily in the way prescribed by asfa in general these states allow agency or court personnel discretion to approve certain prospective caregivers with criminal histories that would preclude approval under the asfa standards pl 10836 requires states later than june 2005 to do criminal background checks for continued crs5 asfa also required states to develop standards to ensure quality services that protect the health and safety of children in foster care with public and private agencies these standards are in addition to licensing requirements that were already established under title ive finally the law added references to child safety in various sections of titles ivb and ive timeframe provisions asfa requires states to meet variety of deadlines regarding child welfare cases these include deadlines for permanency hearings and initiation of proceedings to terminate parental rights reasonable efforts to promote adoption if the court finds that efforts to preserve or reunify family are not required asfa specifies that permanency hearing formerly called dispositional hearing must be held for the child within 30 days of that court finding in these cases or whenever childs permanency plan is adoption or another alternative to family reunification the law requires states to make reasonable efforts to place the child in timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan which may include placement for adoption with guardian or in another planned permanent arrangement hhs specified in the january 2000 regulations that states must obtain judicial determination that such reasonable efforts were made within 12 months of the date the child entered foster care and at least once every subsequent 12 months that the child remains in care the law further provides that states must document specific efforts made to place the child for adoption in enacting these provisions congress intended to shorten the length of time that children spend in foster care once court has determined that family reunification is not feasible or likely asfa also specifies that efforts to preserve or reunify family can be made at the same time as efforts are being made to place the child for adoption or guardianship this practice is referred to as concurrent planning and allows states to develop backup plan in order to save time in the event that efforts to restore the original family are unsuccessful the adoption and safe families act also contains provisions intended to eliminate interjurisdictional issues as potential barrier to childs adoption first the law requires states to assure in their title ivb plans that they will develop plans to make effective use of crossjurisdictional resources to facilitate timely adoptions for waiting children as originally enacted the law also denied federal foster care and adoption assistance funding under title ive to any state that is found to have denied or delayed childs adoptive placement if an approved family is available outside the childs jurisdiction or has denied fair hearing to anyone who alleges 5 continued prospective foster and adoptive parents and other adults living in the household as condition of receiving state grants under the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta this provision however does not prescribe when state must deny approval of placement due to criminal background check and states that now opt out of the asfa criminal background check requirement might continue to do so for more detailed information see child care and child welfare background checks crs report rl32430 by kendall swenson crs6 violation of this provision the law was subsequently amended pl 105200 to establish graduated series of financial penalties rather than complete denial of funding in cases of such violations hhs released program instruction in october 2002 to further clarify the regulations on interjurisdictional adoptions including how penalties would be assessed6 in addition asfa directed the general accounting office gao to conduct study of interjurisdictional adoption issues including the implementation of the interstate compact on the placement of children gaos report was published in november 19997 additional legislation was considered during the 108th congress to improve and expedite interstate placements8 permanency hearings prior to the enactment of asfa federal law required that all foster children have judicial hearing known as dispositional hearing within 18 months of their placement in care to determine their future status pl 10589 now requires this hearing to occur within 12 months of the date the child is determined to have entered care and changed the name to permanency hearing asfa also requires that foster parents preadoptive parents and relative caregivers be given notice and an opportunity to be heard at case reviews and permanency hearings the law revised the list of permanency goals which had included longterm foster care to include returning home referral for adoption and termination of parental rights tpr guardianship placement with relative or as last resort another planned permanent living arrangement in its january 2000 regulations hhs specified that states must document compelling reason for selecting another planned permanent living arrangement and gave the following examples of such compelling reasons an older teen specifically requests permanency plan of emancipation from foster care parent and child are strongly bonded but the parent cannot care for the child because of an emotional or physical disability and the childs foster parents have agreed to raise the child to maturity and to enable visits with the natural parent tribe has identified another planned permanent living arrangement for the child hhs also specified in its regulations that the written case plan for child be developed within reasonable period established by the state but later than 60 days after the childs removal from home if the childs permanency plan is family reunification the regulations require that the case plan describe how the state will achieve safe placement for the child in the most familylike setting in close 6 see hhs program instruction acyfcbpi0209 issued oct 7 2002 available at httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramscblawspipi0209htm 7 foster care hhs could better facilitate the interjurisdictional adoption process hehs0012 us general accounting office nov 19 1999 8 for information on hr 4504 see the discussion of interstate placement of children in child welfare issues in the 108th congress crs report rl31746 by emilie stoltzfus crs7 proximity to the childs parents for all children the case plan must describe how the placement is consistent with the childs best interests and special needs termination of parental rights one of the most significant provisions of the 1997 law requires states to initiate proceedings for the termination of parental rights tpr for certain foster children this provision responded to concerns about the number of children who were remaining in foster care for long periods of time and who were not likely to return home prior to 1997 there was comparable provision in federal law specifically pl 10589 requires states to initiate tpr proceedings in any case where the court has found that parent has lost parental rights to that childs sibling killed another of his or her children or committed felony assault against the child or sibling or subjected the child to aggravated circumstances known as the fast track provision or for infants determined under state law to be abandoned in addition the law requires states to initiate tpr proceedings for children who have been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months known as the 15 of 22 provision states can opt not to initiate such proceedings if the child is in relatives care or if the state agency has documented in the childs case plan compelling reason to determine that tpr would not be in the childs best interest or if the state has not provided necessary services to the family regulations issued by hhs on january 25 2000 require that states must file the tpr petition by the end of the childs 15th month in care and provide methodology for calculating when this date occurs for example trial home visits or runaway episodes are not counted toward the 15 months the regulation also specifies that if the state decides not to initiate tpr proceedings at the 15month point with regard to particular child because an exception exists in that childs case as allowed under the law then the state does not need to apply the 15month tpr requirement to that childs case again in the case of an abandoned child the regulations require the state to initiate tpr proceedings within 60 days of court determination that the child is abandoned as defined by the individual state likewise in the case of child whose parent has been convicted of felony specified in the law the regulations require the state to initiate tpr proceedings within 60 days of court determination that reasonable efforts to reunite the child with that parent are not required as stated above the law allows but does not require certain exceptions to the tpr requirement including that there is compelling reason for determining that such proceedings are not in the childs best interests the january 25 2000 regulations give the following examples of compelling reasons adoption is not the appropriate permanency goal for the child there are grounds for tpr the child is an unaccompanied refugee minor there are international legal obligations or compelling foreign policy reasons that preclude tpr crs8 the law and regulations also provide that whenever state initiates tpr proceedings it must concurrently begin to seek and approve qualified adoptive family for the child for children who entered foster care after the enactment of pl 10589 states were required to comply with the tpr provision later than three months after the end of the first state legislative session that began after the date of enactment which was november 19 1997 for children who already were in care on the date of enactment states could phase in compliance with the tpr requirement but had to be in compliance for all children by later than 18 months after the end of the legislative session for purposes of the tpr provision and the 12month permanency hearing children are considered to have entered foster care on the first date that the court finds they have been subjected to child abuse or neglect or 60 days after their removal from home whichever occurs first state implementation of timeframe provisions in 2002 the general accounting office gao published report on the implementation of asfa and its effects on the child welfare system9 the report cautioned that there was limited information on these provisions due to lack of data all six states in which gao conducted site visits reported that the asfa timeframe provisions helped their child welfare agencies focus on more quickly finding permanent homes for children some child welfare agency staff stated that the timeframes helped them work more effectively with parents by being able to inform them of the steps and timelines in the reunification process some states and agencies expressed concern though that the timeframes may rush the adoption or reunification process and lead to higher reentry rates into foster care the gao study also found that few states were using the fast track provision due to variety of courtrelated issues such as judges or legal officials who are at times reluctant to approve fast track request and difficulty in scheduling tpr hearings other reported difficulties in utilizing the fast track option included fathers rights issues the desire to give parent another opportunity to demonstrate the ability to care for subsequent child and the length of time from childs removal from the home to parents conviction of an applicable crime10 some states reported using the fast track provision in cases of infant abandonment or cases involving serious abuse states are not required to collect data on their use of the fast track provision and most states are not collecting this data similarly to the fast track provision states are not required to collect data on the 15 of 22 provision and few states collect it in its report gao recommended to 9 foster care recent legislation helps states focus on finding permanent homes for children but longstanding barriers remain gao02585 us government accounting office june 2002 10 for example massachusetts officials reported that in most cases children are removed from the home after the crime is committed but judges will not approve fast track for these cases until the parent is convicted of the crime which often takes at least year after the crime was committed crs9 hhs that it review the feasibility of collecting in costefficient manner data on state usage of the fast track and 15 of 22 provisions including the number of children exempted and reasons for those exemptions of the nine states that did provide gao with information on the 15 of 22 provision most indicated there were more cases which were exempted than actually utilized it for example in oklahoma just over 1000 tprs were filed because the child was in care for 15 of 22 months however nearly 3000 children who had been in care for 15 of 22 months were exempted from the requirement to file tpr states provided number of reasons as to why they might not request tpr for child who has been in care for 15 of 22 months these reasons included adoption is not realistic option tpr would not be in the best interest of the child the childs parents need more than 15 months to address their problems and court delays for hearings and appeals11 information on state use of the asfa tpr provisions is collected during the on site portion of federal compliance reviews12 and beginning with the reviews conducted in fy2002 hhs standardized the way this information is provided in each states final report of the 35 states reviewed in fy2002 findings from 12 states indicated that agencies are not filing for tpr in timely manner and their reasons for not filing are not provided in the case files in addition 12 states said the appeals process for tpr decisions is extremely lengthy and therefore challenge to achieving permanency13 eligibility for adoption and medical assistance under title ive states may receive openended federal entitlement funds for part of the costs of operating adoption assistance programs for special needs children under these programs parents who adopt children with special needs may receive monthly adoption subsidies through agreements with their state the federal government helps states with part of these costs but only for children whose biological parents would have been eligible for the former aid to families with dependent children afdc program or who are eligible for supplemental security income ssi adoptive parents of children with special needs who do not meet these criteria may receive subsidies through statefunded programs children who are eligible for federal adoption assistance are also deemed eligible for medicaid states have the option to provide medicaid coverage to special 11 in the gao study states and agencies reported that adoption may not be realistic option for children with severe behavioral or medical problems for whom adoptive parents are often difficult to find and adoption may not be in the best interests of adolescents who are functioning well in outofhome settings and maintaining contact with their families with regards to services for parents states cited access to needed services coupled with the likelihood of reunification as factors in exempting child from the 15 of 22 provision several states highlighted lack of access to substance abuse services as barrier 12 these reviews are known as child and family services reviews they were mandated by congress in 1994 and implemented through regulations issued in jan 2000 13 general findings from the child and family services review

adopted children who do not meet the income eligibility criteria for federal adoption subsidies however asfa requires states to provide health insurance coverage to these children if they have special needs for medical mental health or rehabilitative care this health coverage may be through medicaid or another program as long as benefits are comparable according to the american public human services association aphsa all states are in compliance with this provision 46 states and the district of columbia provide coverage to these children through medicaid and the remaining four states provide coverage through fully statefunded program14 in addition to be eligible for adoption incentive payments described below in fy2001 or fy2002 states were required to provide health coverage to any special needs child living in their state whose adoptive parents had entered into an adoption assistance agreement with any other state15 when congress reauthorized the adoption incentives program in 2003 this requirement was extended through fy2007 states also must comply with this provision to be approved for child welfare demonstration project or waiver hhs reported that it had received certification from all states that they provide such coverage the adoption and safe families act also contains provision intended to ensure that children who had once been eligible for federally subsidized adoption assistance will continue to be eligible in subsequent adoption if their initial adoption is disrupted or their adoptive parents die regardless of whether they would have qualified for afdc or ssi based on the income and assets of their first adoptive family reauthorization and renaming of family preservation program the 1997 law reauthorized and changed the name of the former family preservation program which is capped entitlement under subpart 2 of title ivb and was originally scheduled to expire at the end of fy1998 under pl 10589 the program was renamed promoting safe and stable families and reauthorized through fy2001 legislation pl 107133 to extend the program through fy2006 was enacted in the 107th congress16 the entitlement ceiling was set at 240 million in fy1997 and 255 million in fy1998 and was reauthorized under pl 10589 at 275 million in fy1999 295 million in fy2000 and 305 million in fy2001 the currently authorized annual entitlement ceiling is 305 million plus an additional 200 million in discretionary funds the fy2004 appropriation for pssf was 404 million17 14 report on the interstate movement of children receiving adoption assistance by elizabeth oppenheim and shannon guiltinan american public human services association washington dc dec 1998 15 hhs reminded states of this requirement in information memorandum acyfcbim01 03 issued mar 7 2001 16 see child welfare reauthorization of the promoting safe and stable families program crs report rl30894 by emilie stoltzfus and karen spar 17 of this amount 305 million was appropriated in mandatory dollars and 99 million was appropriated in discretionary funds crs11 as enacted in 1993 the former family preservation program required states to devote significant expenditures to each of two types of services family preservation and communitybased family support the adoption and safe families act added two more categories timelimited family reunification services limited to the 15 month period that begins after child is determined to have entered foster care and adoption promotion and support services program instructions issued by hhs specify that states must have strong rationale for spending less than 20 of funds on each of the four current categories of activities in the gao 2002 study states reported they most commonly used their pssf adoption promotion and support funds to recruit adoptive parents and to provide postadoption services study by james bell associates found that the percentage of pssf funds allocated for adoption promotion and support increased from 15 in fy1999 to 20 in fy2002 and for timelimited family reunification increased from 16 in fy1999 to 21 in fy2002 the percentage allocated for family support decreased from 40 in fy1999 to 29 in fy2002 and the percentage of funds allocated for family preservation increased slightly from 29 to 3018 state accountability for performance the adoption and safe families act also aimed to increase the accountability of states for the performance of their child welfare programs the legislation required hhs in consultation with public officials and child welfare advocates to develop outcome measures in various categories ie number of foster care placements and adoptions length of stay in foster care and to rate state performance according to these measures in an annual report hhs published the final list of outcome measures in the federal register on august 20 1999 and has subsequently issued four annual reports on child welfare outcomes by state for the years 1998 through 200119 in addition the 1997 law directed hhs to conduct study and develop recommendations for performancebased financial incentive system under titles ivb and ive the law stated that to the extent feasible this system should be based on the annual performance report described above hhs was required to submit progress report to congress within six months of the new laws enactment and final report within 15 months although progress report was submitted final report has been released20 state innovation and demonstration legislation enacted in 1994 authorized hhs to approve up to 10 states to receive waivers from title ivb and ive rules in order to conduct demonstration projects the adoption and safe families act allowed hhs to approve an additional 10 demonstrations in each of fys 1998 through 2002 federal law does not mandate specific goals for these 18 analysis of states annual progress and services reports and child and family services plans 19992002 james bell associates

the adoption of children with special needs who are under age nine and provides separate incentive payment for increased adoptions of children age nine and older adoption incentive legislation as in the adoption assistance program under title ive which provides ongoing subsidies to adoptive parents of eligible special needs children the definition of special needs for purposes of the adoption incentives program is determined by each state and may include age ethnicity or membership in sibling group in addition to disability or medical condition that makes child difficult to place for adoption the adoption and safe families act originally established incentive payments equal to 4000 for each foster child whose adoption was finalized over certain base level and 6000 for each special needs adoption above the base level the law authorized 20 million annually for these incentive payments for fy1999 through fy2003 in addition the law provided for an automatic adjustment to discretionary budget caps to help ensure that these funds would actually be appropriated for adoptions finalized in 1998 the baseline was the average number of adoptions in 1995 through 1997 for adoptions finalized in 1999 through 2002 the baseline was the highest number of adoptions in any preceding year beginning with 1997 the 1997 legislation also authorized hhs to provide technical assistance to help states increase their number of foster child adoptions and authorized appropriations of 10 million annually for this purpose for each of fy1998fy2000 hhs was required to use half of any funds appropriated under this provision to provide technical assistance to the courts however funds were appropriated reauthorization legislation of 2003 the original adoption incentives program expired at the end of fy2003 and was reauthorized with the adoption promotion act of 2003 pl 108145 under the reauthorization states continue to receive credit for all increased adoptions of foster care children and receive additional incentive payments for increases in adoptions of children with special needs however the special needs payment is now limited only to adoptions of special needs children who are under age nine at the time the adoption is finalized the adoption promotion act created third incentive payment equal to 4000 for increased adoptions of children who are age nine or older at the time of adoption like the original two incentive payments states have to exceed their baseline number of such older child adoptions to earn this payment for all three incentive payments the baseline that states must exceed is revised each year to the highest annual total of such adoptions since fy2002 pl 108145 also reauthorized for fy2004 through fy2006 the provisions concerning technical assistance to states and localities including the language reserving 50 of appropriations for assistance to courts to help increase adoptions or other permanent placements for children24 24 for more details see child welfare the adoption incentives program crs report rl32296 by kendall swenson this report also contains statebystate data on performance and payments under the adoption incentives program since the programs inception crs14 appropriations the history of appropriations for adoption incentive payments is somewhat complicated because states as group exceeded lawmakers expectations and finalized more adoptions in the early years of the program than congress had anticipated pl 10589 originally authorized appropriations of 20 million annually for fy1999 through fy2003 for adoption incentive payments for adoptions finalized in fiscal years 1998 through 2002 in addition the law provided for an automatic increase in discretionary budget caps up to 20 million to help ensure that these funds were actually appropriated for each year however in some years the amount of incentive payments that states actually earned exceeded the 20 million level as result congress when necessary provided additional amounts above the 20 million usually in subsequent years appropriations bills to enable hhs to pay states the full amount of incentive payments earned see table 1 below also in each years appropriations law congress has limited the availability of these funds to certain years even though the authorizing law provides that appropriated amounts shall remain available for allocation to the states until expended state implementation gao 2002 report and cornerstone consulting group study indicate that states most commonly use their incentive awards to fund the recruitment of adoptive families and provide postadoptive services25 some states reported using their incentive funds for onetime expenses such as studies training events and the purchase of legal services due to the uncertainty of receiving future adoption incentive awards additionally states reported that because the awards were relatively small compared to their overall child welfare budgets they were able to use their funds in innovative and flexible manners state reported that the adoption incentive bonus was the primary motivator for improving its adoption system the primary concerns of states regarding the incentives were that they may give the impression that adoption is the best plan in all cases that states with increased adoptions before asfa may have trouble exceeding their baselines this concern was expressed before the 2003 reauthorization updated the baselines and that the law did not make further changes in the structure of federal funding for child welfare 25 the cornerstone study showed that states used funds in the following areas post adoption services 16 states recruitment of adoptive families 11 legal services to expedite adoption 5 contract enhancements for case management recruitment home studies etc 7 training 9 subsidy increases 4 adoption awareness 6 staff 2 general child welfare services 3 and distribution to county child welfare services in

though numerous changes to state and federal laws and programs have been amended and developed as result of the adoption and safe families act researchers have had difficulty judging asfas effects on the child welfare system many states had already begun to make adjustments to their systems before 1997 and some had previously enacted laws similar to asfa this has made it difficult to determine how much of the shift in child welfare outcomes and data was due to asfa or other state and federal laws and programs28 the lack of comparable and reliable pre and postasfa data also limits the analysis of asfas effects for example gao 2002 noted that the university of chicago collected preasfa child welfare data for several states but this data cannot be matched with data from hhs because of differences in the measurement techniques additionally children often remain in foster care for several years before being adopted and therefore evidence of the effects of the 1997 enactment of asfa were not necessarily immediately apparent nonetheless current data can provide useful information on the characteristics and experiences of the child welfare population after the enactment of the 1997 law demographics of child welfare system the number of public child welfare agency adoptions began to rise before enactment of asfa but rose more sharply after the laws passage from approximately 31000 children in 1997 to more than 52500 in 2002 see figure 1 hhs analysis of data from the adoption and foster care analysis and reporting system afcars has revealed various characteristics of children in the public child welfare system29 children in care are increasingly being adopted by relatives from 15 of adoptions in fy1998 to 24 in fy2001 black nonhispanic children comprised 43 of adoptions in fy1998 and 35 of adoptions in fy2001 hispanic children were 12 of adoptions in fy1998 and 16 in fy2001 and white nonhispanic children were 37 of adoptions in fy1998 and 38 in fy200130

legal proceedings so that children who cannot safely return to their families can more quickly move to adoption or another permanent placement several asfa provisions were intended to expedite the

crs18 state and agency views on asfa july 2002 phone poll of 41 state child welfare agency representatives conducted by the university of southern maine usm showed that child welfare agencies tended to view asfa requirements as good case practice and are continuing to train staff on their implementation32 data from the phone poll also indicate that states which have already undergone child and family services review cfsr have better understanding of the requirements of asfa and how to implement asfa than states which have yet to undergo cfsr in order to meet the requirements set forth by asfa states have made adjustments to their service delivery systems and administrative practices in response to asfa states have improved their data systems worked more closely with the courts passed legislation and hired additional staff such as attorneys and caseworkers interviews with state and local agency directors in 2000 conducted as part of the national survey of child and adolescent wellbeing nscaw found that states were focusing on developing new casework strategies to promote child safety at the front end of service delivery33 some state administrators also noted that asfa had an impact on permanency through reduction in time frames the institution of concurrent planning at the front end of child welfare reduction of time in foster care and an increase in adoptions state administrators also reported that they had experienced several unanticipated problems in implementing the asfa requirements these problems included providing substance abuse treatment to parents while maintaining the asfa time frames the lack of adoptive placements especially for hardtoplace groups such as adolescents backlogs in the juvenile courts and child welfare staff being held accountable for time frames that were dependent on other agencies such as the courts and mental health providers the nscaw study also provided information on asfas effect on local agencies for approximately 60 of local agencies asfa led to greater emphasis on childs safety when compared to family preservation programs and 93 reported that asfa shortened time frames for decision making to less than 12 months almost threequarters of respondents noted an increased emphasis on adoption for children living in kinship care and 54 indicated an increased emphasis on the adoption of older children most agencies indicated that they experienced change in caseload numbers but did report an increase in the average number of hours spent on each case thirtythree percent of local agencies reported that access to
