tr 0 lecture lecture given on 16 january 1963 okay this is few words on tr 0 this is the 16th of january saint hill special briefing course well lets give all those coaches some applause huh and lets give the students some applause thank you i dont know if you noticed it but the upper unit student confront comparison with the newer student confront well was quite marked wasnt it audience yes i thought it would be something like that thats why i chose them up that way now you know the rules about tv you know if youve been on tv you know its popularly believed if youve been on tv then youre not on tv again thatsthats normally believed but actually thats only if youre cancelled before the program you probably didnt know that part of the rule lot of rules about it they change from week to week you might as well get used to it because tvtype training is going into central orgs and youll find out its very beneficial tr 0 the original tr 0 was simply to be there and be aware and that wathat was all there was to it and in actual fact apparently people have begun to confront with that definition see if you dont let them confront with their noses or their big toes or stomachs or something like that they can always confront with that definition these arenevertheless the definition is still valid and the original tr 0 is still valid but theres some other things that have been added in on top of it theyou can make somebody confront with professional attitude and usually you find every here and there that some students got real professional attitude that he is confronting with and see its confront withthats the trouble with it and an auditing attitude and an interested attitude and so forth these things are all fine as long as theyre run out and the trick in coaching tr 0it all depends on good coachis spotting something the student is doing getting him to be aware of it and run it out thats in actual fact the systemall there is to the system of coaching but of course you can give student so many flunks that he just caves in heso what you cant win anyhow and goes into apathy now you can give student so many wins that he never learns how to confront i mean you can do this both ways too takes little wisdom in the matter but what youre actually trying to get him to do is to stand up to the duress of auditing lets get off of our basic definitions and lets get into little bit of the whys and wheres of tr 0 i well recall one of the upper indoc trs that somebody was trying to teach somebody in an acc and it was the one that teaches 8c with violence you remember that old oneyou know and all of sudden the student quit the student quit and walked out and an instructor stopped the student and said why whats the matter and very very grimly and primly the student said pcs never act like that see shethe coach had actually been giving this student bad time you know and well justpeople just dont act like that well couple of years went by and this student showed up for retread in the academy or something of this sort butor it was for some auditing and came around and had an apology to make on the subject she had audited an actual pc who had acted much worse so pcs did act like that well in actual fact in actual fact one of the things that is most disturbing to pc is to have an auditor whose confront is corned up in some wayis very unnatural confrontand who shatters under an upset in the session well normally these upsets are assignable to tr 4 and nearly everybody gives tr 4 the medal for auditor upset dont you see i mean the auditor qsandas and qsandas every time you qanda you see you make the student miss withholdi mean make the pc miss withhold see one q and aone missed withhold see so therefore an arc break gets worse and worse and worse when an auditor qsandas very very simple mechanism goes on there the pc says in answer to some question or in origin well i thought moment ago that you were nulling too fast and the auditor says all right ill null more slowly now you see it isnt the actual fact that the auditor has followed the order of the pc in tr 4 thats not what is important what is important is that hes failed to acknowledge an answer to an origin or an auditing command you see hes failed to acknowledge that answer and with some auditors you work and work and work and work and work to stop them from qandaing its so bad that the auditor says in this session is there anything you suppressed and the student says well i suppressed thinking that you were bit untidy with your paper and the auditor says okay ill straighten it up well of course thats missed withhold at once now the student is i mean the pc cant get this off because every time the pc tries to repeat this answer the auditor starts arguing that hes perfectly willing to tidy up bis papers you get the idea now lets look atlets look at why an auditor very oftenand some auditors dotake long time to get up to point where they never qanda and it isnt in actual fact the tr 4 its the tr 0 that is shot this auditor cant stand up to an auditing session with tr 0 and is so in that fashion on sort of an inflow or something you see and isnt really there and being aware but retreats any time anything looks like its little bit odd in the sessionthe auditor retreats and thats the basic well you can see these upper indoc drills theysomebody knocks the student all over the place the coach knocks the student around and the student has to stand up to it and retain control of the situation if he can you know we can see that thats all very visible but those same mechanisms are present in tr 0 exactly those same mechanisms are present now what weve seen in demonstration here is rather smoothly polished tr 0 two people who have had quite bit of tr 0 run already can be polished further but theres this additional element which isnt on those demonstrationsis pushing buttons and finally person will harden into it and then lose the hardening and then find out he can do it you know and hell be able actually to sit there with an auditing presence and have pc blowing up without getting rattled pc starts to have an arc break the auditor doesnt go into an instant lost tr 0 see tr 0 doesnt go up the spout now therefore tr 0 can alsoafter youve led person forward to getting rid of all the junkcan be stepped up can be stepped up you can start to rough it up and this is particularly what i wanted to add to this not talk more about the demonstrations but to show you that theres an additional step you can use now it requires considerable perception on the part of the coach in order to step this up accurately and you had one example of stepup now i was actually stepping it up on normans dander when he was the student there he was blowing up see but he settled back down into it and it was okay but in actual fact do you see theredo you see he was breaking bis confront do you see that now you can lead on that type of gradient to higher and higher stepups you get him just fine so he can stand up to that and then youd uncork something else but lets look at something theyre doing or something that they are incipiently doing and start punching the button and get the person to explain itexplain how hes doing it and then he starts to asis it dont you see he becomes aware of it and in essence takes over the automaticity of it and you can keep leading out that way further and further and further well until itd be matter of the coach jumping up and poking the chair you see at the student to get him to break bis confront do you see howto the degree that that could be stepped up ive noticed that in the presence of an arc break q and becomes very very grim this auditor never qsandas but in the presence of an arc break qsandas and im pointing this out to you the reason he qsandas is not that bis tr 4 goes to pieces but his tr 0 goes to pieces so therefore there is great deal that can be said for stepping up what there is there to be confronted now anybody can confront completely motionless pc see anybody can confront motionless pc but how about confronting pc in motion well the first thing you would think of is somebody shaking bis hand in front of the students eves the coach shaking his hand in front of the students eye and get the student to stop flinching see that would be very easy gradient on the thing you know but how about dodging emeter cans hm do you realize that in general practice particularly due to the arc breaks which can sometimes come up under routine 212 that i would say if you went six months without having pc throw the cans down why youyou must be either very very lucky or have very apathetic pcs and id say once year an auditor can certainly expect to get the cans in his chest now you dont want to train an auditor to point where he doesnt dodge the cans but you certainly want him trained to the point where the cans do not interrupt his command of the session see that his action of dodging doesnt interrupt the command of the session now this gets pretty grim after while you see its justthe skys the limit it gets up to one of these tom and jerry cartoons you know buildings falling down and holes going through the center of the earth but the main thing im trying to put across is that your gradient is what there is there to confront see you could add more things to confront and get him to analyze what he was doing you could actually take an old emeter can and throw it into his chest you know and get him so he would take care of the emeter can you see and still be able to confront the pc auditors do very interesting things not good auditorsbut ive seen very interesting things happen in auditing sessions i have seen person go into total silence this is more common than you would think pc all of sudden seems to be in trouble and the auditor goes into total silence that is about the grimmest thing that can happen to pc thats auditing with an exclamation point its actually worse than q and the pc has just lost his auditor that is it well now it normally happens on freeze in other words the auditor freezes becomes incapable of confronting and just goes into wood now this is much more insidious type of thing to break than action see you wouldnt want to specialize in your coaching your tr 0 in the fellow blinking the fellow twitching the fellow moving so forth dont specialize in that lets give at least 50 percent of our coaching to the fellow going into wood you see what i mean there audience yeah as you go up in upper drills if hes liable to clam up on pc you can also make him do it on tr 1 now thatits an odd mechanismthis one of just freezingjust goes into wood now good coach can recognize the fact that he hasnt got confronting pc that hes just got solid piece of granite in front of him and remember that person who thinks that confrontingness is just becoming solid piece of granite may some day merely stop auditing in the auditing session and just say nothing and thats just about the grimmest thing that can happen all right now your next action on this is an actual flee by the auditor thats not as bad as total clam up but it amounts to the same thing you see the worst frankly the more motionless or inactive person is the worse off he is but that doesnt mean that the more active he is the better off he is you see that youyou take uhyou take the p syatrist the psyatristhe hasnt got the faintest grip on this he hasnt clue about this this has totally escaped him hes always trying to put people into apathy so they will look all right now hes totally sold on the idea of insanity is motion where as matter of fact its far more often action at all see its much harder now hear now its much harder to do something for very apathetic case than it is an angry one see your tone scale tells you that of course and youve known that for long time but im pointing that out in tr 0 that you can very easily very easily slip cogwheel here and just because the guy is sitting there in total apathy think that hes doing tr 0 and let only the very apathetic and the very granitesque student get by see thats not the case at all so you might as well add something to it look alive does he look alive you can add that you know be there and be aware but that awareness lets color that with definition oflets have him be alive too you know have the blood flowing in his veins thats an important thing and actually that one little point is the one which would be most often missed by coach he can spot the fellow who goes dzzzuuuuh see he can spot the fellow whos going huh huh huh you know he can spot that dead easy but the guy whos goingdoesnt spot that see well its all right hes sitting there quietly see hes made p sychiatric mistake and this is mistake that hes made and you got to keep pointing that little point up when youre training people because its natural thing apparently to think that something is quiet is safe now of course the psyatrist is simply trying to make his patient safe see hes operating totally on the third dynamic and hes trying to protect the third dynamic you see from the first whats bad is the first dynamic see thats why you dont easily understand this psyatrist because hes not trying to make anybody any better see hes trying to make the third dynamic safe so therefore his quote cures are all cures which apparently are supposed to benefit the third dynamic none of his quote cures are ever supposed to benefit the patient he doesnt even think so you ask him have you ever cured anybody and he will say immediately yes but youve never asked him probably what have you cured him of and if he doesnt give you some long imaginary name that was dreamed up by kraepelin over in germany and you get him down to it hes cured somebody of being in motion thats what hes cured somebody of and thats all so this is very important to point up this is very important to point up because youll find as you look down whole row of people who are doing tr 0 that certain number of them have gone to granite and dropped out the bottom and something like this you want to know what their auditing responses are at that particular time and so forth and of course theyre zero they get into session auditing somebody something happens they go into inaction because theyre not confronting they cant confront this idea of the total withdraw see watch it you could actually put some kind of meter on the back of the chair to find how hard the student was pressing the back of the chair and you would get an accurate measurement of how little he was confronting because the more weight that goes against the back of the chair the more hes trying to get out of there man now this will go into total apathy of cant get away and cant speak in situation of duress itll go toactually thats very lowscale upperscale is the auditor will actually run away flee flee the session get out of there now where good auditing shows up as different than bad auditing is in moments of duress and somebody will get along beautifully auditing some chipper lady that isnt causing any trouble at all and he luckily got on the right lines and he hasnt made any mistakes and so forth and you look at him and you say well he can really audit hes just doing fine see well to really know this auditor you have to see him in moment of duress what happens in that moment of duress to his tr 0 thats the first thing to gotr 0 hell start making mistakes and of course thats the one thing you mustnt make whether he makes the mistake of shutting up or the mistake of running away or simply the mistake of bungling the auditing commands or the mistake of suddenly transferring over to new list you got that one pc arc broke so must be the wrong list so well abandon it and then we wonder why day after day thereafter the pc makes recovery well of course hes arc broke because the list was not finished see list was abandoned but hell make wrong judgment matter how well hes taught if his tr 0 is terribly bad under duress hell make wrong judgment so you might say there are two or three tr theres the tr 0 of the fellow doing the drill lets take that one as the first one he isnthasnt anything to do with auditing hasnt anything to do with anything else its something that the instructor or the coach told him to do so hes doing it you got that its not associated with anything all right your next one is the person who clams up and actively cant act and your next grade up the line is somebody who goes into an obsessive motion as sort of q and take that as three grades of things which you have to cure when youre coaching tr 0 and if youre going to do thorough job cure all of them just take them in sections now hesthis first one that were doing which is just sitting there and confronting when you add to that confronting in certain ways youre clearing up the first one well youre curing up the second one too when youre doing that but very few drills go into cureup of this dispersal in action but those drills are very easy for coach to figure out one of the things is you know that there are some auditors around who will obsessively laugh something goes off the rails or something like that they will actually laugh theyll laugh in the wrong places in the session too i guarantee you theyve got an incipient laugh and you can break them up well you just go ahead breaking them up until they dont have to its all system of taking over the automaticity and you might practice someday just throwing emeter cans at their chest see and see if they cant keep on confronting while ducking i dont care how you do this im just giving you an action level you see now one of the ways of doing this is talking confront you never heard of this before because its normally tr 1 and 2 but tr 1 and 2 are in actual fact simply actions which get command across to the pc and acknowledge what the pc said those are the purposes of those two so you can have counting confront can the fellow go on counting while youre throwing emeter cans at his chest or does he lose track of his numbers you see how he could do it you could actually have talking confront he isnt trying to reach anybody with this youre just using this as an index now there are various things then that you could do but ive given you the three zones that you actually have to cure if youre really going to cure up an auditor of doing something weird because the session goes awry now today it would be to our great interest to beef up this one point to make it stronger to strengthen it up and hit it harder because let assure you that auditors are going to get more arc breaks than ever before at the same time theyre going to get more rewards than ever before but theyre also going to get more arc breaks than ever before so youre going to have to train people to expect arc breaks and to keep on going now i recently had an arc break in an auditing session that had very puzzled i went on and handled the situation of course but i was very interested afterwards that the arc break had made think less fast i was aware of having thought less fast in that arc break than i ordinarily would have it was basically just get out of the habit of having arc breaks now oh i picked up the ball and kept it rolling but i wasi was aware of thinking less swiftly and realized that the mechanism involved wasis i didnt want to confront this because you see it was not my intention to make this pc splatter over the ceiling and this particular pc was splattering over the ceiling wasnt my intention so it was counter to what i was trying to do in the session so there was small impulse there not to confront it do you see so i myself got good subjective reality on what this is all about it was good subjective reality and i said now all i have to do is multiply that subjective reality up to point where i just stopped thinking you see and one would have goofed at that point i didnt goof but i was aware of the fact that you know what the hell am i doing you know whats the thing to tell this pc all that just slowed right on down what do i do now it was rather rough because three lists were in question i was simply trying to straighten out pc on lists see and three lists were in question i couldnt tell which one of them the pc was arc breaking on because the arc break suddenly distributed over all three lists and it just got worse oh i wasnt trying to make the pc worse so my confrontingness dropped so actually keeping the thing going i mentally sat back and confronted the situation and picked it up and kept it rolling but i could see exactly what happens i see somebody whoswhos got pc everything has been because these r212 arc breaks are sudden man they can be sudden and catastrophic when you run into them and apparently inexplicable and youre running along and everythings fine and in the best of all possible worlds you are nulling the best of all possible lists and you look up and you say to the pc all right we got your item now haha it is willow wand and watch the pc carefully and everything seems to be all right you know and the pc even has bit of cognition were being very smug about everything and arent we good and we pick up our pencil to finish off our auditors report and there come the emeter cans what the hell you know what happened well you just picked the wrong item you should go on listing little bit further thats the motto and the faster you say all right thats not your item thank you very much now were going to list little bit further and push the auditors report out from underneath your paw and push the list under it and start listing your pc will start listing instantly all right that or for other reasons these arc breaks rather take you aback because theyre quite violent the slowburning arc break the corroding type of all of this would hit somebody who tended to go numb in most horrible way the corroding type of arc break is that you have successfully listed something everything was fine and the next session you have trouble getting the pc into session and the pc is full of despair and its all just despair and hopelessness and you try to spot where this began you know and you cant quite spot where it began but there is the pc being rather critically hopeless if you get the idea and you didnt intend to do this so your intention is off your confront then bah there it goes right there so tr 0 should get lot of attention from us in academies if were going to take hpa students and get them to do r212 then weve got to beef up tr 0 thats the conclusion ive come to on it and we treat these people as though they fall into all three of these grades you see we treat them as though theyll go into total wooden nowhere and that theyll flee and that they will go into violent motion treat them in all three grades see where they break up and keep cracking the buttons until theyall of sudden theyre able to pull through it its sort of an upper indoc tr 0 i dont care what you do with the pc as long as you give him enough winsi mean studentas long as you give him enough wins to keep him going thats how many wins you give one you dont ever give them as many as they earn that would be too reasonable just give them enough to keep them going and dont give them so many that they think they can do it because the actual fact is they have to come to the independent opinion that they can do it how much and how long should you run tr 0 well actually until the person while doing all other actions and trs can keep up his tr 0 and where he can keep it up under things going wrong and duresskeep up his tr 0 with kiplings if you know if you can keep your head when all pcs about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you so we actually are moving up into higher grade requirement and i think it would be greatly to our interests in all courses that you teach to the interest of pcs and protection of things to give higher level of expectancy now we know what 212 is liable to uncork in our faces well all right lets beef up the training drills to match it and well lose less pcs that way they wont be going out and dropping off the bridge before somebody hears about it you know funny part of it is the pc usually doesnt fall off the bridge we had an interesting he usually comes back for more auditing even when hes so arc broke but the funny part of it is i had ahad pc todayi had pc today that was in an arc break that was just doing total suppresswas doing big suppress and was in violent argument with wrong item and so forth little diana shes ten very amusing suzie brought her down to get the item checked mainly so that i could see that pc at ten would arc break just as hard on wrong item as pc of fifty i tried to get her to treat it as an oppterm and tried to get the rock slam to turn on and that sort of thing and for her she had some pretty nasty things to say about the item and the whole thing she didnt want that item see it was wrong item on the list rock slamming item it was very interesting to watch this and also to watch the complete brightenup that occurred the moment i said well all right thats not your item she brightened right up and was very pleased and went right back upstairs and went on listing and so forth that was it it was interesting that you get this same pattern response the list was not quite long enough to have the right item on it well now if this is going to happen invariable and inevitably all youve got to do is flub little bit or be auditing pc who already has pt problems from some other quarter or is under little stress or duress make an accidental q and right at the exact moment they blow their skulls all over the ceiling its very interesting then tr 0 ought to be pretty good because bad tr 0 will lead to immediate q and it leads to lack of comprehension of what is going onmain thing it leads toand it leads to pc who is getting auditing and it might even lead to an auditor flying down the hall now actually its big win for an auditor sometimes when they confront an arc break and lot of insults from the pc and all that sort of thing to find out they have gotten through it even though the tears were coming out of their own eyes and they were terribly upset they were misemotional about the whole thing but they somehow or other brought it off they do one or two of those and they get lots of confidence on it well why should they have to gain all that confidence in the session now it actually takes certain amount of time to get r212 down actually takes certain amount of time the experience of delivery of routine 212 is considerably desirable you get so that you know more and more about it and feel more and more confident of what youre doing and so forth but it takes while now if person while learning 212 is also learning his trs youre liable to have quite mess on your hands now you can have somebody under guidance auditing 210 in the coaudit unit something like that but theyre under such stringent guidance that somebodys there to pick them up if they drop the ball theyre actually auditing with very little responsibility and frankly they learn only that the technique works or is violent but before they can independently run 212 and so forth why they ought to have their trs and those trs ought to be matched up to running such process and that means that whats expected of tr 0 has to be upgraded now i suppose that part of the training is you get tape recorder were talking about tr 1 nowyou see and you go down to the zoo and throw rocks at the lion until he gets real mad or something like that or go down on sunday when hes just seen too many people and get darn good recording of all of this dont you see and then put it on high volume hifi system and have the student stand there putting intention into the middle of the speaker you see that would be you get so that you could insert the auditing command into the pcs skull and get him to comply with it regardless of the volume of sound you were being greeted with you see thats another barrier that youll find necessary but if you dont handle 212 if you dont handle the arc break if you dont keep on doing the right action if you dont carry on with it boy you got somebody whos splattered all over the room and it just isnt necessary for pc to get that splattered actually the splattering is in direct proportion to the confront of the auditor it wouldnt be very bad arc break if it hadnt been accompanied by confront of the situation q and dont you see drop the ball all over the place well each one of these auditor flubs throws an actual auditing reason for an arc break in on top of the basic reason for the arc break and they dont just wrap it around the telephone pole once you see they practically put it in around the telephone pole braided there it goes and the degree then of the arc break the pc will have on routine 212 is directly proportional to the trs of the auditor do you see that youll see it borne out if you havent noticed it up to this time why youll probably see it around youll certainly see it around training somebody in an academy with this or something like that youll notice that somebodys trs are very bad and they have much worse arc breaks their pcs arc break worse any pc will arc break on wrong items and that sort of thing but of course the swiftness with which the cause of the arc break is being handled is only part of it in actual tact q and on top of the bad routine 2 flub blarr see and then mistake on top of that you see and blarrrr and then decision on the part of the auditor to go back and relist where do cats come from which was eight years ago that it was run you see blaaaaaa all it is is an incomplete list and it needed another page or something like this dont you see easily remediable but the auditor is liable to run all the way down to the earliest beginnings of the case you see rather than simply complete the list that was right in front of him his judgment goes so the judgment of the auditor must be good in this particular spot and if his trs are bad his judgment is going to be bad do you see what youre dealing with here ive often noticed that i perfect auditor as long as everything was all right somebody is perfect auditor as long as everything was all right but the moment the least little thing went wrong that auditor suddenly became one of the worlds worst auditors to point of just sitting there uhhhh finally the pc you know shake him you know tell him he needs session well now those are the modern purposes of tr 0 and i think that all of your training in this direction couldnt be better than matched up against the necessities of routine 2 at this particular time because it will make routine 2 that much easier on one and all including the auditor if his trs are almost perfect you know hell never have to use them its something like the fellow who walks out every night hes got gun and he never runs into any trouble and one night he doesnt have gun and everybody jumps him see this kind of an action if his trs are weak why hes got gun but hell get very severe arc breaks and you can trace back the pcthe severely arc breaking pcto the nonconfront and the q and and the outtrs in general of the auditor the worse these trs are the harder the pc will arc break and the first that goes out is tr 0 okay thank you very much good night thank you
