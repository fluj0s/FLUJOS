congress summary family caregiving to older individuals in need of longterm care encompasses wide range of activities services and s upports caregiving can include assistance with personal care needs such as bathing dressing and eating as well as other activities necessary for i ndependent living such as shopping medication management and meal prep aration in addition fa mily caregivers may arrange supervise or pay for formal or paid care to be provided to the care recipient family caregivers fulfill the majority of the need for longterm care by older persons with chronic disabilities in the united states as result of increases in life expectancy as well as the aging of the babyboom genera tion demand for family caregiving to the older population is likely to increase however demographic trends such as reduced fertility increased divorce rates and greater labor force participation among women may limit the number of available caregivers to older individuals as well as the capacity for caregivers to provide needed care although many family caregivers find car egiving for an older family member rewarding experience other life circumstances in addition to caregiving may increase caregiver stress for example family members may not live in close proximity to the care recipient they may face the competing demands of child care and elder care and they may have to ma nage work with caregiving responsibilities as result family caregiving can lead to emotional and physical strain and financial hardship these effects are more likely to be felt among those caring for persons with high levels of disability or cognitive impairment caregiver stress has been linked to nursing home admission for the care recipient thus interventions that can reduce stress may also reduce nursing home placement recognizing family caregivers as an important part of the nations longterm care delivery system the federal government has established programs and initiatives that provide direct supports to caregivers ch as respite care education and training tax relief and cash assistance these benefits are targeted at family caregivers to reduce stress and financial hardship and to improve caregiving skills among other things other federal programs and initiatives provide home and communitybased longterm care services and supports to the care recipient these programs can

services and supports to assist persons who are limited in their cap acity for selfcare because of physical cognitive or mental disability or condition that results in functional impairment and dependence on others those in need of assistance over an extended period of time often require longterm care services and supports although the need for longterm care affects people of all ages the like lihood of needing longterm care assistance increases with age caregiving assistance to older persons with longterm needs can be provided in variety of settings including the care recipients or caregivers home in community residential setting such as an assisted living facility or in an institution such as nursing home formal caregiving refers to care that is provided by paid individuals who are employed by longterm care service organization or agency such as nursing home or home health care agency or who are selfemployed informal caregiving refers to assistance provided by unpaid individuals such as family member friend or neighbor this report focuses on family caregiving informal care provided primarily by spous and children to the older population family caregiving activities include assistance with personal care needs or activities of daily living adls such as eating bathing and showering dressing using the toilet walking across small room and transferring getting in and out of bed or chair they may also include assistance with activities that are necessary for independent living or instrumental activities of daily living iadls such as shopping for groceries or personal ite ms performing housework or yardwork managing money preparing meals us ing telephone doing laundry getting around outside the home and taking medications other family caregiver ac tivities may include accessing the health care and social services systems communicating w ith providers and insu rers and advocating for the care recipient in addition to handson assistance caregivers may arrange supervise or pay for formal care to be provided to the care recipient either as temporary relief from the caregivers res ponsibilities ie respite care or on more permanent basis as caregiving needs change over time formal and informal care arrangements can also shift formal or paid care may supplement or substitute for the informal caregiving activities

united states more than 90 of older care recipients receive informal care either alone or in combination with formal care1 demographic trends such as increases in life expectancy as well as advances in medical care have enabled persons with disabilities to live longer as result the demand for informal care provided to older re latives can last many years the aging of the babyboom generation is also likel to increase demand for family caregiving to the older population moreover most olde r individuals prefer to remain in their own homes and live in the community for as long as possible2 finally the difficulty of recruiting and retaining paid longter m care workers has placed increased pressure on family caregivers3 the growing demand for care provided in the home has focused the attention of fe deral and state governments on efforts to expand programs that provide services and supports to family caregivers as demand for caregiving to older persons with disabilities is likely to increase other demographic trends such as smaller family sizes and increased divorce rates may limit the number of available caregivers to older individuals as well as the capacity for caregivers to provide needed care increased labor force participation among women who traditionally have assumed the role of family caregiver may make them unavailable to take on this role4 also family members who longer live in close proximity may limit the directcare assistance that families are able to provide family caregivers are diverse in terms of gender age relationship to the care recipient and life circumstances for many caregiving is rewarding activity however some may face challenges associ ated with their caregiving responsibilities adult children caring for an elder parent might experience increasing stress or financial hardship as result of the competing demands of work or child care others may experience increased physical and emotional strain sometimes associated with assisting spouse or parent who has disa bility or is cognitively impaired research indicates that over time larger propor tion of family caregivers were providinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34123crs3 5

of disability5 moreover technical advances in home care mean that caregivers are more likely to assist with medical equipment and medications that require more skilled forms of care in the home including oxygen equipment intravenous medications and catheters6 these caregivers may have little training or formal assistance in providing such care the federal government s expressed an interest in directly supporting family caregivers who provide the majority of long term care assistance to older individuals as evidenced by the national family ca regiver support program enacted under the older americans act amendments of 2000 pl 106 501 sustaini ng informal caregiving can offset the need for publicly financed care however demographic shifts that may affect the supply of family caregivers raise concerns about whether caregivers will be able to meet the potential increase in demand for longterm care assistance by older individuals in the future recent study projects that the disabled older populati on even under the most optimistic scenario will increase by 50 between 2000 and 20407 over this same period the share of older adults receiving paid longterm care is projected to incr ease from about 22 to 26 while those receiving unpaid assistance from an dult child will fall from 28 to 248 recognizing family caregivers as an important part of the nations longterm care delivery system the federal government has established programs and initiatives that provide direct support to caregivers direct supports such as respite care education and training tax relief and cash assistance are targeted at caregivers to reduce stress and financial hardship and to improve caregiving skills among other things other federal programs and initiatives provide home and communitybased longterm care services and supports to the care recipient these programs can indirectly benefit caregiver s in relieving caregiver bur den by either supplementing the informal care being provided or substituting some informal care with paid support services provided to care recipients that can indirectly assist caregivers may include formal personal care services ssistive devices and home modifications among other things access to federal rvices that provide direct and indirect benefits to caregivers have different eligibility criteria and benefits as result these

women are more likely than men to receive any help but that men receive gr eater amount of care10 older men typically receive assistance fro m one caregiver primarily their spouses whereas older women are more likely to have multiple caregivers variation in the amount of care may be related to gender diffe rences in the types of care received for example men are more likely to receive help with personal care housekeeping and meal preparation activities whereas wome n are more likely to receive help with transportation shopping and home repairs those who live with someone else receive substantially greater amount of informal care than those who live alone alternatively research has found that t hose who live alone are not married and live in public housing are more likely to use paid care11 income of the care recipient may also influence the type of care received data from 2002 nationally representative study of the older population found that poor and near poor older care

these individuals are less likely to meet income eligibility requirements for public benefits such as medicaid and may be unable to fford the costs of privately paid care who provides care how many caregivers are there estimates of the number of informal caregivers range from 7 million to 54 million see table 3 there is wide variation in these estimates for several reasons including differences in the definitions of caregiver and care recipient the amount and intensity of care provided and the da ta collection methodology methodological considerations include whether the responde nt is asked to identify themself as caregiver or whether the care recipient identifies those who provide care the time frame for reporting caregiving activities ie past year or recall period and the sample size these differences in thods make it very difficult to compare estimates across surveys table 3 shows the range of estimates of the number of caregivers from selected national surveys as well as comparison of survey characteristics and methodology estimates at the high end of the range include those individuals who provide care to the adultdisabled or to individuals of ll ages and use less restrictive measure of disability that may also include shortterm disability or acute spells of illness data from the 1999 national long term care survey nltcs the only national survey that estimates the number of persons providing care to an older population aged 65 and older estimated that 7 million individuals were providing care to individuals aged 65 and older this estimate is more conservative than other survey estimates in part because care recipients functional status or disability is measured as receiving help with adls or iadls for at least three months more restrictive definition that measures chronic disability defined as adl or iadl impairments lasting at leas t three months among the older populationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34123 crs7 table 3 alternative

attention on the sandwich generation of caregivers t hose caught between the demands of caring for their aging parents and supporting their dependent children some have expressed concerns that delayed fertility among women will lead to greater caregiving burden with demand for caregiving only increasing as the babyboom population ages approximately 35 million individuals primarily women were potentially responsible for both an ag ing parent and dependent child24 according to 2004 survey of all family caregivers including those caring for individuals under age 65 with disabilities more

that many careg ivers have been squeezed into the sandwich generation other re search suggests that only small subset of this group are simultaneously providing support to dependent child and parent

care per week these data reflect the wide variation in amount of care and much greater intensity of caregiving for relatively smaller but sizeable portion of the caregiving population34 further research indicates that the amount of time spent caring increases substantially for older persons with varying degrees of cognitive impairment individuals aged 70 and older with mentia received 46 hours of informal care per week compared with 131 hours per w eek for those with mild dementia 220 hours per week for those with moderate dementia and 461 hours per week for those with severe

years in the 2004 nacaarp survey of caregivers the average duration of care was 43 year s almost 30 of caregivers reported assisting the recipient for five years or more older caregivers were more likely to have been providing care for 10 years or more compared with caregivers under age 5036 the effects of family caregiving while many family members find caregiving rewarding and satisfying activity caregivers may also face increased physical strain emotional stress and financial hardship as result of caregiving respons ibilities moreover car egiver satisfaction and caregiver strain may be experienced simultaneously some caregivers find personal satisfaction from forming close relationship with family member they may find caregiving fulfills sense of duty to the recipient also they may find satisfaction from their personal belief that they can provide the best care to the recipient37 one factor associated with caregiver stress is whether the caregiver had choice in taking on caregiving responsibilitie s other factors associated with high caregiver stress and strain include poor car egiver health and heavy caregiving burden one study found that those caregivers experi encing high levels of stress because of heavy caregiving burden were more likely to provide more than 20 hours of care per week to provide care to recipient with more than three adls to have little to

physical health at risk researchers have documen ted several adverse health outcomes related to caregiving including elevated blood pressure impaired immune systems and potential increased risk for cardiovascular disease40 older spouse caregivers who experienced caregiverrelated stress had hi gher mortality rates than noncaregivers of the same age41 research has also linked high vels of caregiver stress to nursing home entry of the care recipient where having highly stressed caregiver increases the likelihood that chronically disabled older adult will enter nursing home by 12 percentage points within one year and 17 percentage points over twoyear followup period42 the same study concluded that initiatives to reduce stress among caregivers would also reduce the rate of nursing home admission providing care to an older person can also affect caregivers mental health several studies have documented high leve ls of depressive symptoms and other mental health problems among those who provide care compared with those who do not43 in particular higher levels of depression are associated with caregivers assisting those individuals with dementia studies have shown that

the care recipients disability status eg meal preparation shopping housework some researchers have attempted to quantify the economic costs to family caregivers and to employers that can be associated with caregiving caregivers that take time out of the work force to care for family member not only lose wages but fail to accrue savings and be nefits which may place them at economic risk over their lifetimes another measure of economic cost looks at lost economic productivity resulting from caregiving activities in small nonrepresenta tive study of family caregivers metlife found that as result

initiatives that offer direct assistance to caregivers include the family and medical leave act which provides unpaid leave to eligible employees in order to care for spouse parent or child with serious health condition furthermore tax provisions in current law offer caregivers some direct tax relief other federal programs and initiatives provide home and communitybased longterm care services and supports to th care recipient these programs can indirectly benefit caregivers by relieving caregiver burden through supplementing the informal care being provided by caregiv ers or substituting it with paid support services provided to care recipients that can indirectly assist caregivers include formal personal care services adult day hea lth care assistive devices transportation and

benefits that directly assist caregivers are often limited by program funding and may be insufficien t in coverage and duration furthermore coverage for direct benefits to caregivers may be une ven across states federal programs that provide longterm care services to care recipients that as result indirectly assist caregivers are often limited to those recipients who meet certain age requirements and financial and functional eligibility criteria eg limitations with two or more adls in addition some states use state funds to provide programs and services such as respite care or

disabilities of all ages and is intended to serve as safety net for those who cannot afford the cost of care the majority of medicaid home and communitybased services are designed to help the beneficiary live and function inde pendently in the community one optional service under medicaid that dir ectly assists family caregiver s is respite care respite care can provide direct assistance to caregivers who need short break from caregiving responsibilities states that c hoose to offer respite care may target this service to specific bene ficiaries and limit the be nefit amount available another medicaid program feature that states have experimented with is consumerdirected service delivery models these programs often allow the consumer ie the beneficiary to hire family members to provide certain longterm care services thus in some circumstances family caregivers may be paid with medicaid dollars to provide personal care services selfdirected program models can assist family caregivers by providi ng some monetary compensation cash assistance to caregivers may help caregiv ers replace lost wages from unpaid time off work or continue to provide care in the care recipients home rather than transferring the care recipient into an institution hiring family caregivers may increase the supply of direct care workers particular ly in rural and hardtoservice areas72 other medicaid home and communitybased services may indirectly benefit family caregivers by supplementing informal care provided to beneficiaries in the home or substituting some informal care for formal care these services may have an indirect effect on family caregivers by relieving the strain and physical burden often associated with handson care to disabled older family member while allowing the care recipient to remain in the home home and communitybased services may include personal care services case management homemakerhome health aide services and adult day health among other services

bor survey conducted in the late 1990s most employees reported attending to their own health as the predominant reason for taking leave under the act 487 only 106 of workers reported using the fmla to care for seriously ill parent74 as of 2008 45 states and the district of columbia had enacted family and medical leave laws generally the fmla and state family and medical leave laws are similar with regard to the availability of leave but can differ in terms of coverage and scope eg cover small firms and othe r reasons for leave in addition some employers offer paid family and medical leave benefits because fmla was intended to guarantee the minimum benefit employees are entitled to the more favorable leave benefits offered unde r state law or by an employer75 tax policy tax provisions

or dependent care is necessary for the taxpayers employment dependent care may be provided by either private individual eg personal care home health or dependent care center that meets state and local laws and regulations eg dult day health center the dctc is calculated as percentage of qualified employmentrelated expenses these expenses are limited to 3000 for one qualifying individual and to 6000 for two or more qualifying individua ls in addition qualified expenses cannot exceed the earned income of the taxpayer for married taxpayers qualified expenses are limited to the earned income of the lesser earning spouse78 the credit rate is 35 for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income agi does not exceed 15000 and is gradually reduced to 20 for taxpayers whose agi is over 43000 for example married couple with dependent frail pa rent living in their household having an agi of 50000 and 3000 in qualifying expenses would be eligible for credit of 600 ie 3000 x 2079 the dctc is nonrefundable tax credit which means that the credit is limited by the taxpayers regular income tax liability taxpayer whose tax liability is completely offset by his or her sta ndard deduction and pe rsonal and dependent exemptions does not benefit from the credit as consequence many lower income taxpayers cannot claim the credit for example in 2008 married couple with one dependent does not benefit from the credit until their agi exceeds 21400 they could not claim the full credit based on 3000 of qualifying expenses until their agi reaches 29500 depending on the couples other deductions and exemptions the income threshold could be even higher the dependent care assistance program dcap80 caregivers who work for employers with dcap may exclude up to 5000 of earnings used for qualified dependent care expenses the ex clusion applies to income taxes and employment taxes the definitions fo r qualified dependent care expenses and qualifying person are the same as the dctc the employer

qualifying ex penses applies regardless of the number of qualifying individuals for fa milies with only one qua lifying person the dcap can be more advantageous than the dctc for which the limit on qualifying expenses is 3000 taxpayers can use bot h the dctc and the dcap in the same year but not for the same expenses qua lifying dctc expenses must be reduced by the dcap exclusion thus if the married couple with the frail older parent also had child under 13 living in their household and spent 6000 on care they could use the dcap for 5000 of the expenses and th dctc for 1000 of the expenses ie the 6000 maximum expenses for the dctc minus 5000 excluded under the dcap82 income tax savings from the dcap depend on the taxpayers marginal tax rate for example taxpayer in the 10 tax bracket would save 500 from 5000 dcap exclusion ie 5000 x 10 whereas taxpayer in the 25 bracket would save 1250 ie 5000 x 25 in addition they both would save 383 in employment taxes 5000 x 765

situations may be eligible for more advantageous tax filing status generally taxpayers who are unmarried must file as single taxpayers however unmarried taxpayers can claim the more favorable head of household filing status if they paid more than half the cost of keeping up home and qualifying person lived with them for more than half the year special rule permits an unmarried taxpayer who has

congress will face decision whether to expand the role of th federal government in providing direct support to family caregivers some policy makers may favor enha ncing services and supports that provide either direct ssistance or federal income tax relief to caregivers in doing so the federal g overnment would devote additional funding to new or existing programs or reduce federal revenues implying increasingly difficult tradeoffs between support to caregivers nd federal programs that benefit other populations alternatively other policy makers may feel that greater state assistance to family caregivers is warranted and that the federal government can best serve family caregivers by providing technical assistance to states in service planning and delivery still others may believe the federal govern ment has limited responsibility in assisting families who pr ovide unpaid assistance ma ny by choice to older individuals thus congress may decide th at additional federal assistance can be made available to help family caregivers in this case federal policy makers may want to evaluate how best to spend existing funds this section briefly describes three sets of policies that would expand or enhance the federal governments role in providing direct assistance to family caregivers to older adults these policy issues which have either received recent congressional attention or otherwise been the subject of discussion among federal policy makers and other inte rested stakeholders are organized into the following topics enhancing and expanding caregiver services and supports assisting employed caregivers through flexible workplace accommodations and income security and providing caregivers with opportun ities for additional tax credits88

2006information assistance as caregiving demands change over time policy makers indicate that services such as respite care can improve care quality avoid burnout and allow caregivers to continue providing informal care to an older relative thus potentially avoiding or delaying unnece ssary institutionalization proponents of increased federal funding for services and supports to caregivers have indicated the need for enhanced education and training for caregivers so that they can develop the skills necessary to provide quality care to frail elderly population others have suggested targeting services and supports to those caring for indi viduals with specific illnesses or disease such as alzheimers advocates have also suggested adding an assessment of the caregivers needs to the existing eligibility determina tion and assessment processes for public benefits89 the caregiver assessment proce ss would identify nd link appropriate services and support for family caregivers these services could provide backup support in cases of emergency counseling or respite care caregiver assessments would also elicit information about the caregivers health willingness to provide care and training and support needs through the assessment process family caregivers could learn about the resources available to them in their communities workplace accommodations and income security employed family caregivers often face disr uptions in their work patterns as result of elder care responsibilities these disruptions may include arriving to work late or leaving early taking time off dur ing the day reducing the number of hours worked from fulltime to parttime status or taking leave of absence major changes to employee work schedules and work disruptions can affect income and job security those who do leave the workforce to care for an older disabled family member have less opport unity to save or accrue bene fits over their lifetime which may leave them economically vulnerable in retirement workplace accommodations that allow employ ees to take unpaid leave for the purposes of assisting with the longterm care needs of older relatives can directly assist caregivers requiring employers to provide paid time off to their employees to care for the medical needs of certain family members may assist in alleviating some of the financial burden associated with caring for an older family member federal policies that support flexible workplace accommodations may prevent individuals from leaving the workforce alto gether publicly funded programs that allow payment of family caregivers through consumerdirected service delivery models may provide caregivers with some income security tax credits as previously mentioned for many family caregivers providing assistance to frail older individual can im pose substantial financial burden targeted tax relief to caregivers could offset some of the direct expenses associated with caregiving including transportation for
