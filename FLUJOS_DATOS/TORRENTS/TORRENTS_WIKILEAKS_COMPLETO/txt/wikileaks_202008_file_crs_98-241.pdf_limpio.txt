httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml1 the 1946 legislative reorganization act 60 stat 812 sets the framework for the modern committee system the act organized the senate and house committees along roughly parallel lines but divergences have emerged over time within the guidelines of chamber rules each committee adopts its own rule s addressing organizational structural and procedural issues as consequence there is considerable variation among panels and across chambers by the conclusion of the 110th congress there were 20 standing committees in the house with 99 subcommittees and three select committees2 the senate has 16 standing committees with 72 subcommittees as well as four select or special committees3 in addition there are four joint committeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98241crs2 types of committees there are three main types of committees standing select or special and joint party committees task forces and congressional member organizations informal groups are not addressed here standing committees are permanent panels identified as such in chamber rules house rule x senate rule xxv because they have legi slative jurisdiction standing committees consider bills and issues and recommend measures for consideration by their respective chambers they also have ove rsight responsibility to monitor agencies programs and activities within their jurisdictions and in some cases in areas that cut across committee jurisdictions most standing committees recommend fundi ng levels authorizations for government operations and for new and existing programs few have other functions for example the appropriations committees recommend legislation to provide budget authority for federal agencies and programs the budget committees establish aggregate levels for total spending and revenue vi the annual budget resolution that serve as guidelines for the work of the au thorizing and appr opriating panels select or special committees are established generally by separate resolution of the chamber sometimes to conduct investigations and studies and on other occasions also to consider measures often select committees examine emerging issues that do not fit clearly within existing standing committee jurisdictions or which cut across jurisdictional boundaries select committee may be permanen t or temporary select committees may have certain restrictions on member tenure or may include certain specified representatives eg party leaders or certain standing committee chairs as ex officio members instead of select the senate sometimes uses the term special committee eg the special committee on aging joint committees are made up of members of both the house and senate todays joint committees are permanent panels that conduct studies or perform housekeeping tasks rather than consider measures for instance the joint committee on printing oversees the functions of the government printing ffice and general printing procedures of the federal government the chairmanship of joint committees usually alternates between the house and senate conference committee is temporary joint committee formed to resolve differences between competing house and senate versions of measure conference committees draft compromises between the positions of the two chambers which are then submitted to the full house and senate for approval subcommittees most committees form subcommittees to share specific tasks within the jurisdiction of the full committee subcommittees are respons ible to and work within the guidelines established by their parent committees in particular standing committees usually create subcommittees with legislative jurisdiction to consider and report bills they may assign their subcommittees such specific tasks as the initial consideration of measures and oversight of laws and programs in the subcommittees areas httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98241crs3 subcommittees may play an important role in the legislative process because few chamber and party rules apply to subcommittees the number prerogatives and autonomy of subcommittees vary among committees senate rules do not directly limit the number of subcommittees each committee may create house rules impose maximum of five subcommittees for most committees rule x clause 5d but sixth oversight subcommittee is permitted several committees such as the appropriations committee have been allowed via house rules larger number of subcommittees some committees create independent subcommittees with sizeable staff and budgets routinely refer measures to subcommittees for initial consideration and allow subcommittees to take the lead in framing issues drafting measures and reports and holding hearings and markups on other co mmittees most work is undertaken by the full committee some full committees repeat all actions taken by their subcommittees while others review only major subcommittee work or even forward subcommitteereported measures to the floor with little change
