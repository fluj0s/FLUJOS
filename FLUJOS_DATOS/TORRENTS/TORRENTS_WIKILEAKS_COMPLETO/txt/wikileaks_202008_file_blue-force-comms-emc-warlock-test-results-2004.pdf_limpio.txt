containing the blue force communications equipment the intent was to allow co mmunications across the 2kmlong convoy while keeping the communicati ons vehicle within the protection zone provided by nearby ied jammer in different vehicle standoff distances of 50 meters and 100 meters were chosen because they corresponded to postulated convoy vehi cle intervals after moving the ied jammer to

25215 u technical analysis 2151 s general discussion the major element affecting usable communications is the signaltonoise ratio sn at the radio receiver raising the sn increases receiver performance lowering it degrades performance the ratio can be increased by raising the desired signal strength or by lowering the undesi rable noise presented to the r eceivers antenna shortening the radio link in the preceding shortened link excurs ion reduces the rf path loss of the desired signal hence increases its strength at the receiver antenna standing off the ied jammer decreases the undesired noise presented to the receiver antenna 2152 s sincgars at least three methods are readily available to allow usable com munications via sincgars w ithin the convoy scenario s frequency coordination and hopset tailoring the first whic h was not explored in this timeconstrained test is frequency c oordination and sincgars hopset tailoring around ied jammer frequencies after reviewing the inc ountry hopset there appear s to be sufficient rf spectrum available to trade off frequencies for ja mmer use one potential problem will be the rf spectral purity and spurious signals and harmonics generated by the jammers in addition to their intended transmit frequencies this could be resolved by trading off more sincgars frequencies andor cleaning up the jammer signals via better intern filters or commercial off theshelf cots external filters another pot ential problem could be chaos within the sincgars networks if there are continuous changes to the sincgars hopsets and their distribution is not timely and t horough throughout the affected units b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the jamm ers can protect multiple vehicles c s radio repeater over shortened radio links this is probably the least desirable due to the increased hardware requirements radi and antennas manual operator message relay could also be employed but would be labor intens ive and prone to error operation at rf power amplifier power 50 w could increase the li nk distance and reduce hardware requirements 2153 s eplrsfbcb2 again at least three methods ar readily availa ble to allow usable communications via eplrsf bcb2 within the convoy scenario s frequency coordination and eplrs channel tailoring the principles discussed in the preceding sincgars method are applicable b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the ja mmers can protect multiple vehicles c s radio repeater over shortened links this option is more desirable for eplrs because every eplrs within the network automatic ally functions as re peater additionally the usable link distance is greater400 meters only five eplrs in 2kmlong convoy would be required to provide endtoend data communicati ons positional data and sa would be supported as long as plgr is working properly not fo m 9 voice communications are not supported 2154 s motorola xt s 3000 handheld radio frequency coordination and using channel

operating the ied jammers in this scenario the ied jammers were placed in separate vehicle and stood off some dist ance from the victim vehicle containing the blue force communications equipment the intent was to allow communications secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 29at the convoy element vehicle wh ile keeping it within the protec tion zone provided by nearby jammer in different vehicle standoff distances of 50 meters and 100 meters were chosen because they corresponded to postulated convoy ve hicle intervals after moving the ied jammer to another vehicle each of the above baseline performance tests was repeated while the ied jammers were turned on one at time only one ied jammer was operational at any time 224 u test findings 2241 s baseline link with ied count ermeasures colocated in same vehicle 22411 s sincgars communications across the basetoconvoy radio link were possible when the warlockred was operating within the same

vehicle the warlock green did not prevent usable communications 22413 s bftfbcb2 communications across the basetoconvoy radio link were possible when the warlockred was operating within the same vehicle the warlock green effects have not been tested testing at ypg was canceled due to time constraints the results presented here are from followon testing conducted at usaepg 22414 s spitfire communications across the baset oconvoy radio link were not affected by operation of either of the ied jammers 2242 s baseline link with ied count ermeasures located in different vehicle 22421 s sincgars using 50meter standoff distan ce between the communications vehicle and the ied jammer vehicle allowed us able communications when the warlockred was operated in the jammer vehicle 22422 s eplrsfbcb2 using 50meter standoff di stance between the communi cations vehicle and the ied jammer vehicle allowed usable communications when the warlockred was operated in the jammer vehicle 22423 s bftfbcb2 using 50meter standoff distance between the communications vehicle and the ied jammer vehicle allowed us able communications when the warlockred was operated in the jammer vehicle the warl ockgreen mitigation methods have not been tested testing at ypg was canceled due to time constraints the results presented here are from followon testing conducted at usaepg 22424 s spitfire standoff testing required comm unications across the baseto convoy radio link were not affected by opera tion of either of the ied jammers secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 210225 u technical analysis 2251 s general discussion the major element affecting us able communications is the sn at the radio receiver raising the sn increa ses receiver performance lowering it degrades performance the ratio can be increased by rais ing the desired signal strength or by lowering the undesirable noise presented to th receivers antenna the only available option to increase the sn in this scenario was standing off the ied jammer to decrease the desired noise presented to the receiver antenna 2252 s sincgars at least two methods are readily available to allow usable com munications via sincgars w ithin the convoy scenario s frequency coordination and hopset tailoring the first whic h was not explored in this timeconstrained test is frequency c oordination and sincgars hopset tailoring around ied jammer frequencies after reviewing the inc ountry hopset there appear s to be sufficient rf spectrum available to trade off frequencies for ja mmer use one potential problem will be the rf spectral purity and spurious signals and harmonics generated by the jammers in addition to their intended transmit frequencies this could be resolved by trading off more sincgars frequencies andor cleaning up the jammer signals vi better internal filters or cots external filters another potential problem could be chaos within the sincgars networks if there are continuous changes to the sincgars hopsets and their distribution is not timely and thorough throughout the affected units b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the jammers can protect multiple vehicles 2253 s eplrsfbcb2 again at least two methods are re adily available to allow usable communications via eplrsfbcb2 within the convoy scenario s frequency coordination and eplrs channel tailoring the principles discussed in the above sincgars thod are applicable b s jammer standoff easily implemented if the jamm ers can protect multiple vehicles 2254 s bftfbcb2 the warockred was not expect ed to impact bft operation since the bft receives at much higher fr equencies than the warlockred transmit frequencies additional test ex cursions show that bft degrad ation occurs only when both the low band and midband units are transmitting oper ation of only onehalf of the warlockred system does not impact bft commu nications possibilities are that s combined warlockred unwanted spurious emissions have sufficient band width to impact bft b s combined warlockred transmitter energy overloads the bft receiver c s combined warlockred transm itter energy causes intermodulation products within the active compon ent of the bft system secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 secretrel to usa aus can gbr and nzlx1 211further testing exploring addon low pass filte ring and antenna separation options should be conducted until then jammer standoff appears to be the only viable mitigation technique assuming that the warlockred can protect multiple vehicles 2255 s spitfire use
