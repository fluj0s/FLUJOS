3ga goals finding part i lecture given on 11 october 1962 good enough what is this this is the 11th oct ad 12 huh the month of the octopus and ronnie needed eight hands to do everything he has to do we have some good newssome good news and everybody around sydney can be very happy with this of course were always very happy with this bills just found ians goal audience great there are probably some more but due to the general breakdown in the auditing department i havent been informed weve stoppedwe probably have found many dynamics and items and all that sort of thing but weve gotten so we dont even announce those we have an interesting datum on this it isnt necessarily true according to the auditing section and what has been coming through the auditing section that the length of time taken to find the goal indicates the goodness or badness of the auditor that is not what indicates the goodness or badness of the auditor it is the fact that the auditor cannot find the detested person dynamic or item well according to the statistics if an auditor cant find somebodys detested person dynamic and item in fair hurry there is something wrong with his auditing see if he then doesnt find the goal in hurry this doesnt indicate much see if it takes long time to find the goal after youve got the item or something like that we have indication of this at all but the speed of finding the detested person the dynamic and the item is directly related to the smoothness of the auditor now thats one to put in your kit as an indication of whats going on if the auditor cant find the detested person the dynamic and the item in fair hurry on the pc then theres something fundamentally wrong with the auditing sessions wherever auditors have been changed on pcs here why weve gotten these first three things in rush whereas before we havent gotten them in rush in other words it wasnt the pc got that its the auditor and this has just been sorted out by mary sue and i think you might find it useful datum now to give you some idea julia out there in california is having ball these days this is getting ridiculous you know iit is its i told her thatto send cablebecause they werehad lot of offbeat goals being found out there and so forth i told her to send cable on each one found julias doing all the auditing and im getting cable or two every day and operating with terrific saint hill altitude dont you see and operating with the altitude of good auditor anyhow shes supposed to be running the show out there but shes actually the california goal finder right now and shes supposed to be checking out goals something is going here whereby somebody sits down for rock slam test and they wind up with their detested person their dynamic and their item and thenand the length of time is spent checking out the goal so theyll spend two hours finding the goal and two hours checking it out youre operating here of course without this tremendous altitude youre just student and youll just be surprised how people stand and deliver on goals from the standpoint of altitude youll also be surprised occasionally as youre auditing along how people can stand still and not deliver occasionally but the general situation is that goals are tremendously variable in length of time to find even in the hands of good auditor now finding goalsthis is lecture on goalsfinding goals is science it is not an art it is science all of sudden its science but like all sciences it has bit of luck connected with it ill give you an idea the pc puts his goal on the end of two hundred goals list and there are twelve goals on that list because its going straight down the line of the proper lineup going straight down the line these goals go out hard you know bit hard just bit hard to get rid of those two hundred goals you see and youre just taking them by routine and the goal is little bit offbeat from what both you and the pc thought it would be you know and the item is target to give you an ideaso of course to be projectile youd say boy that must be the goal you know and you and the pc are both convinced its to be projectile you know and you get down to the two hundredth goal and its to be little flower see you knowa curve in it well thats why the speed inwith which you find the goal is not necessarily an indicator but getting up to the goalsfinding step getting the detested person the dynamic and the item apparently contains less luck and more meter reading and attention and smooth auditing these are the factors there you get over into the goal and there you are now sometimes you get unlucky with your detested person somebody gives you list of 420 detested people oooh thats an awful lot you know to say consider committing overts against consider committing overts against consider committing overts against consider committing overts against consider committing overts against four hundred and some odd times see well thats merely timeconsuming because there was lot on the list and then this persons apparently well of dynamics and we get the detested person we find out what this represents to the pc and it represents 610 dynamics and thats consider committing overts against and consider committing overts against you see its justits just hard slug and so on and then we find the dynamic and we get one thousand items listed from the dynamic and thats consider committing overts against consider committing overts against and the phrase is worn out by this time so you say well think of committing trouble to or something you see youyouve actually used repeater technique and youve just actually worn out the whole english language on the subject of those words they dont mean anything anymore anyway you see that that is mainly slugfest and requires good meter attention and requires alertness now the system is fairly infallible in your hands im particularly proud of this system it almost works better for you than it works for and thats really marvelous because on couple of pcs ive had to take some wide tours but i recall that this was before the system was perfected and then i have had bad luck recently with this system ive been trying to find goals with it and heres what keeps happening to after i get the detested person and the dynamic and the item and get the goals listed very nicelyall of which proceeded with great speedit turns up that the pc had an old goal and it is now alive you know its just been happening and happening you know of course they got their goal and thats fine and it can read now and it never did before and all that sort of thing but i havent found new goal with it which i consider quite remarkable anywayand then there are some other dodges ive been working on and so forth to speed up goals finding ive been more interested in the research line than otherwise but you know its sort of disappointing thing you know you swear and spit after the session you know after you spentyou spent seven hours you see and youve just been working like mad you know and youve got it all up and it proves up beautifully and then the pc says to you well i know youll practically kill for this but i think my original goal to catch catfish should go on the front of list six of course you put it there and thats it you didnt find the goal with the system you found the old goal you say aw nuts but of course the pcs got his goal and its all fine and its unburdened and its all to the good and its just your own professional feeling of pride that is hurt you feel knuckleheaded you know because it was sitting there in the first place you already knew about this goal you know you worked seven hours on dynamic assessment and of course the dynamic assessment is necessary to make the old goal read see it wouldnt have read without it but anyhow it feels sort of weird i think ive done this too often now and i want to see brandnew bright shiny goal sitting there but my research auditing you saw piece of research auditing last night you didnt see standard session you saw meterless prepcheck to match up the goal to know and the reason that was meterless is because actually using the meter on the pc to test out the goal i thought possibly was an invalidation of the goal so the pc might prepcheck much more smoothly you see without the meter and i think you will notice that in each case the suppress fell half dial when the pc said there was none did you notice that i was quite interested in that and i thought you would be too and the pc is learning it for the first time actually then the meter knows more about suppress than the pc quite ordinarily and the pc knows more about the other buttons probably im sorry to have to reveal that but did you notice that did you actually remark that fact so of course there was meterless check and you had the pattern of the auditing and it all would have been the same except i just wasnt using meter and we did get someplace with that and the pc felt wonderful about it ordinarily in another auditing session not tv demonstration session i would have gone through that again and at that time the pc probably would have fallen into some of these suppresses see and possibly would have cleaned it up but that would have had to have been completed to make positive statement concerning the fact the pc thought the suppress button was cool and actually it was still hot only for that reason would i be willing then to go on with doing anything with that goal see suppress buttons that hot well all right did you see it though i mean did you really see that it was about thirdofadial drop when he said well thats clear and theres not any more answers there and so on now ill have to run it out of the pc but i thought that was interesting the pc then does not necessarily have any alertness to the hotness of suppress button you notice that none of the other buttons that i noticed although it was pretty hard to keep the pc on the meter did you notice that terrific amount of tone arm action i was always going off the pin of course because i didnt want to keep watching the meter because that invalidated the pc i wasnt able to put that needle back in the center of the dial as often as i wanted to did you notice that so therefore you had hard time following meter on that at all and i was trying to get it up to the middle as i said the goal so that you could see whether or not the goal was firing or not firing it was pretty hard to do particularly on the askewness of that demonstration meter in view of the fact that in my own auditing these days im beginning to audit only with the meter over on the left side of with magnifying glass and straight onauditing with meter over here askew with the other handgetting so im ambidextrous and the mark v particularlywhich i dropped and bunged up bit last night by the waylater on its all right it still operates its good test these metersthe new meter is quite indestructible therell be mark vs available to you in about three to four weeks audience good anyway lets hope they havent altered the basic structure from the one youve been watching its almost identical face face is the same almost the only thing we did was put rise in with the dashes anyway auditing with the thing over here on this side and trying to follow that confounded thing through gives you less of throw some of you by the way were beingwondering about picking up latent readswhy i was picking up latent reads on this meter the mark v is slightly latent i havent bothered to inquire why but the mark v is slightly latent as you think you see an instant read on mark iv on mark v you will begin to realize that it is falling at some split second after what you thought it was falling on on the mark iv and that is an instant read on mark v that gives you one answer to it and the other is of course that is what is known as suppressed meter and you will often have to do with suppressed meters pc has very heavy suppression well thats proven by the fact that when i asked him suppress youd see your button go and so forth but that is suppressed meter in other words that meter isnt reading deadon pc with terrifically heavy suppression on the goals line and so forth reads little early little late and so on this you will get used to you have to know this and it breaks down the rule of the exact instant read whenever you have pc who is under heavy suppressionthisd be pc who rock slammed like mad by the way at half chanceyoull notice that theres some often something little peculiar now at the time last week that you saw this meter you mainly noticed the latent reads were being taken on the first rudiment did you notice that thats probably what first attracted your attention and then it wasnt so latent on the other things well last night i straightened out the suppressions on the first rudiment in other words this pc had several sessions jammed together on the first one and we pulled those apart now you might have thought that was rather unusual to do but remember its the auditors job to get the rudiment in not to sit there like silly idiot and simplesimon the pc into the ground you understand so i was interested in getting the rudiment in which i then proceeded to do and traced the rudiment back to the first time he had trouble with it well now it was that rudimentjust to make my point hereyou saw last night that that rudiment was terrifically suppressed and week before saw that it was reading latent and prior and every other confounded way except deadon you see that all right then last night i cleaned it up and i dont think you saw too much else although there wasnt too much else in the session because i was running meterless test i think you saw far less latent read although occasionally you did possibly notice that hairlatency but that hairlatency is the mark v and man youll have to get used to calling real latent read and what is an instant read on mark v and theyre slightly different its different than mark iv theres just little bit of white space you might say injust tiny bit of white space in to the end of your statement and the beginning of the read i dont know why that is i havent bothered to inquire but i have noticed it consistently and continuously im the only one who has been operating with mark v and when you start operating with mark v youll first start noticing that it gives you lot of trouble thats yourbe the first thing youll notice that this is lot of trouble man its like you were running fanjob aircraft you know and theyre with fan and they went like mad 197 miles an hour and they struggle into the air and they fly through the air and when you first got into one having graduated from tiger moth you see this thing really looked like it was going you know tiger moth going 60 miles an hour and this thing is going 197 miles an hour well you graduated from some old type of meter to the mark iv and you really thought you were flying you know this was really flying probably at the moment perfectly happy with mark iv and then you start running mark v well thats just graduating into jets you just suddenly and inexplicably will find yourself in the world of jets as mary sue said the other day she cant call them because its gone its read before she notices it you know the jet plane has gone by overhead and she wakes up to the fact that it has read you see now the read is very positive its quite persistent read and is actually much easier to sort out than that mark iv but you wont think so at first i imagine youll go on stumbling and blundering around for week or soi didand educating your thumb all over again you just throw that tone arm up with your thumb thousandth of an inch further than you intended to and the mark vs needle goes over and hits the pin and lies there haah and youve already started your sentence or something like this you know so therefore you have to stop your sentence and put the pc on wait and adjust the thing and you eventually will get your thumb educated to where you throw this thing and it goes over and does wobble and you have to get so you can time the wobble theres shunt thats one of the reasons the mark v is so terrific on the actual meter in the mark v theres shunt there is small one in mark iv and so theres nothing steadying the mark v at all and it goes over here and it wobbles and then settles down and gives you the read well that is the education of your thumb is what that depends on anyhow thats beside the point more or less it has another characteristic is that when you have clean needle on it it flows that is the most flowing smooth needle you ever wanted to see and lets say you had flowing smooth needlethis is another reason for the latency you had flowing smooth needle are you willing to talk to about your difficulties see its flowing its smooth its nice it just looks like honey its perfect you know i mean its everything is just oh my thats very nice and thats on its highest sensitivity or its lowest sensitivity you normally run this on its second sensitivitya mark v you run mark v with the additional sensitivity knob straight up which i think is sensitivity 64 and youre running right now at sensitivity 16 there actually is that difference of multiple in the sensitivities so anyhow it runs best with that sensitivity knob straight up and you get your best reads out of it and only when youre trying to pick the pc to pieces do you shove it over to 128 see and there it is flowing smooth and you say now when was the last time i audited you when was that session how yes well fine now thank you and since the last and this needle goes krupkrup tuktuk prrbrrbrrbrrbrrbrrgone now it actually kind of doesnt matter if it reads or not this is bad thing to tell you you know theres something on the question in other words you can use this flow factor on mark v you longer have flowing needle there is something wrong with the question you are asking and when you clean it all up youll have this beautiful flowing needle back and its very easy to get it back but you can almost tell what question is hot by the fact that the needle is doing something or that you have missed something in the session something is missed in the session you can tell it from the unflowingness of the needle its going up in jerks its going up bup tek krrpbump ditdubop zztzzt trip thud you know it actually is very commotional in other words the mark v to some tiny degree registers the state of mind of the pc by its character of rise see now the mark v also picks off all analytical thoughts there isnt anything left in the pcs skull when the mark v is clean see we were with the mark iv picking off reactive thoughts only and the pc could think an analytical thought and you wouldnt see it on the meter with mark v you see every analytical thought pc says well i hope that doesnt read the mark v will go click so therefore you heard asking and have heard asking while youve been watching do this if the pc thought of anything if there are any afterthoughts in that particular case and it wouldnt matter if the thing were very latent i would still ask the pc what he thought of why because i dont want my needle brr brr brr tick tick brr thup bup now actually every analytical thought is to some degree missed withhold if it is not uttered to the auditor so if you want the pc without pestering him to deathif you want the pc really sitting insession gorgeously so forth why youve just got to keep clean flowing needle so this gives you something new that meter can do right now this is very pertinent to goals finding because youre not about to find any goals on any pc whose rudiments are out youre just not about to find any goal on pc with the outrudiments thats all man and the mark v puts rudiments in the like of which you never heard of before you really get them in you get them in including the analytical thoughts in other words you get it in reactivity and analytically and physically and every other way youve got these rudiments in of course you wont get them in as well if you are suspicious of your meter and if your meter is not quite registering everything that it might be registering therefore youll very often badger your pc and start cleaning cleans and that throws the rudiments out i know i had bad time in the session last night i got into the rudiments the pc was out of session i couldnt get the rudiments in and we had quite ruckus quite mess auditing table upset and everything this was remarkable now when this type of thing occurs it issomething else has happened and obviously i just got through missing the pcs goal i think that was what this was all about i couldnt really trace it to anything else i must have gone right over the top of the pcs goal needle was rough and registering on halftruth but i think it would have registered on have you eaten any apple pie there was lot of figurefigure going on there was lot of this and that going on so the meter is actually more sensitive thanfor everybodys good occasionally you see itsyou could get along with less do you understand but yet you actually cant get along with less so this meter delivers back to the auditor tremendous amount of skill in the order of auditing it delivers back to him lot of judgment about the thing is this pc doing all right and is this pc really insession well youve got freeflowing needle now the only thing wrong with that is you also get freeflowing needle on totally arc broke pc whether youre using mark v or mark iv or any other thing i saw that last night too see now whats the point here well meter is ever going to be made ever which lays aside the ability of the auditor to perceive the pc the auditor must be able to see the pc the auditor must be able to apprehend what the pc is doing because he could then have freeflowing needle on totally arc break pc with nothing registering anyplace now that factor will always take place because its characteristic of living being it is not characteristic of meter and theres beating that factor i assure you of this theres beating that factor so you always have two inspection systems at work you have the auditor and you have the meter and if you delete either one totally auditing doesnt become more difficult it becomes impossible thats with an exclamation and an underscore you delete either one of these systems and auditing becomes impossible now when i say when you delete the meter you of course couldnt find the pcs goal i worked and worked to find system which would meterlessly find the pcs goal and i have never succeeded in doing that i dont even have clue as to how to go about it because everythingand i mean that everything i have put together that pointed in that direction has flopped in other words there has not been one hopeful sign now how do you like that now you know you get on some goals channel with the pc and if youre on the goals channel itoccasionally goal will go zzzpp and occasionally itll rock slam and occasionally will go tap tap and rocket read see as you go over one goal or another you know thats hopeful channel all right theres been hopeful channels of any kind in the direction of well for instance writing up list so that the pc would eventually write only his goal you get the type of thing here writing up combinations of lists which would eventually get the pc to write his goal doing this or that asking questions of and so forth and this has just uniformly laid an egg i dont say that its an impossible trail but i do say that in quite some period of time now two years i have occasionally moved into that field and worked in it and every time ive come out with total skunk pockets empty and all shells intactskunked ive thought of how about having pc just write goals until the only goal he can think of is that that doesnt work either pcs can evidently write eight million nine hundred and ninetynine billion goals without ever only writing their own goal you see well lot oflot of things go into this so goals finding begins with auditing and it requires an auditor capable of inspecting the pc who is being auditedthe auditor inspecting the pc and an instrument inspecting the pc it takes both now sometimes you can lay the instrument aside but thats only when youre proving something up youll eventually have to bring that instrument back into your lap and say does that goal read do you see you eventually have to resort to the meter matter how many other approaches you make visually with your naked eye now your meter is not going to detect the arc break of the pc if it happens fast thats interesting isnt it only the auditors going to detect that and after that the meter says its all clean its all clean its all clean the pc is lying on the floor writhing quietly see the meter says hes well the meter says hes well and happy and insession you see have i missed withhold on you huhhuh clean willing to talk to about your difficulties clean do you have present time problem clean see you told halftruth clean everything clean everything clean everything clean pcs lying on the floor in total agony and total despair so therefore not this instrument but any mechanical observer i think that anybody ever cooks up will have some ceiling of limitation on its power of observation therell be some limitation upon its ability to observe which thetan can always better because remember thetan can look but machine cant look unless thetan is looking at the machine to read the answer off of the machine this is something that the scientist uniformly overlooks the psychologists dissertation on how the eye works is one of the damnedest pieces of buffoonery which has ever been perpetrated as hoaxi mean as fact it is its piece of buffoonery according to this the eye looks out here it points in that direction and by some focal system of imageswhich of course he gets out of the science of opticsthere is some kind of screen back here which registers the image and then we dont say any more about it but carrying through this reductio ad absurdum we get screen looking at screen and then we would get another screen looking at screen and then wed get another screen looking at that screen and another screen looking at that screen and at time anywhere do we have an observer in this whole system there is observer i think the reason for this is the psychologist has never been able to observe so he just discounts this very necessary thing an observer you know i did this one time with univac eniac smicksmack thingamabob whatnot that was going round and round and its wheels were churning and its valves were popping and i think it had cooling systems and so forth to cool off its fevered brow and it had all kinds of instrumentations which crossed instrumentations i busted the machine by the way i did i fed it two times two equals and it was unable to solve this problem that was the end of it the things went round and they went round and there was w to fall out see it was set up to have more complex equation and that was too fundamental an equation now it could have said two times two equals four if you had first said the derivative integral of in its ratio to x is the distance between g and its square root of q and if this were true then two plus two or two times two equals what number see the machine is set up to take that many this just left all the blank files over here see and the machine looked in vain it couldnt find anything there so it looked again and couldnt find anything there and it looked again you see and it never would pick up the two times two the cams were going mad inside the thing they had to shut the thing off spoke to rather crossly and they said this machine was not designed to solve things of that character it was an astronomical computational machine it had the distances to the moon and the lunar positions thereof as expostulated from the eclipse of something or other you know and this was all fed in and of course the cams couldnt two times two equals four well let point out something i said let point out something here the machine never has seen an answer hohohoho nahhahaha nahhahaha nahha i said wait minute now that machine has never seen an answer well they said seeing youre just using some offhanded trickery or its your writing background showing up you know just using semantic trickery or it never has who reads the answer when given up by the machine well they said the operator i said then the operator is part of the machine all right then if the operator isnt part of the machine then the machine has never inspected the answer thatcouldnt be true you see that just led up the garden path on this you hadyou put an observer into any of these systems and they go to pieces youve got to have an observer i mean you take the observer out you say toheres this system and it says well this machine observes itself and therefore integrates what it does well you can set up machine as servomechanism which will find out that its nine oclock and shut the radio off or turn the percolator on or do all kinds of things like this but its inspection is just that and actually it rarely inspects that its done it now some machines much more complicated will inspect to find out whether or not it has done this and if it hasnt done this it will shut itself off an automatic phonograph will do that itll inspect itself to find out whether or not its playing record and therefore but its inspection is limited to that one sphere see it can observe further than that now you cant expect meter to observe pc it will not an auditor has to be there to observe the meter and im stressing this point not because its just piece of ridiculousness but youre going to find people around who think that the machine observes the pc and if they simply sit there and let this machine operate theyre going to be all set and furthermore that machine can be developed which will observe the pc 100 percent and do everything there that is present in an auditing session so their total action will be to develop better and better and better meters the auditor is totally unimportant see the auditor will have nothing to do with it at all its just whether or not you have better machine sir although its very laudable to develop better and better and better meters dont develop in them the direction that they will eventually wind up with auditor because thats the trouble with any auditing session that goes wrong is auditor at some point in the auditing cycle theres auditor you can actually have the commands come out of tape recorder see you could actually fill up whole recorda whole tape full of do fish swim and then put it on with foot pedal and sit there and the tape will play and ask you the question do fish swim and so forth and then you get into an arc break well maybe then you could have another tape recorder and if you had an arc break you could take your other foot and push down on it and it would say do you have an arc break see and maybe if that registered yes you could even link that in to another machine which now said all right recall an arc break or something you see and it would go on and on and on in this particular fashion in other words you could get system of complexity operated out like this but look matter how many systems you have the only observer present is the pc so you still have an auditor present its the pc auditing himself now the question is what is he auditing and if your observer is the pc then whats the pc auditing well he must be auditing some valence well were not trying to clear valences were trying to clear pcs all right now lets study this little bit further in goals it becomes much more pertinent to this than it appears at first glance the pc must have another beingness this is peculiar to goals you realize you can sit there and chant to yourself think of problem of comparable magnitude and think of the problem of comparable magnitude to something or other and solve something you could even audit yourself through an engram you can do all kinds of interesting things with selfauditing most of them wind you up in the soup but the point im making out here is things can happen because of selfauditing see you can youre having an awful lot of trouble with some other human being you can sit there and say well think of problem of comparable magnitude to bill see think of problem of comparable magnitude to joe think of problem of comparable magnitude to and get your answer each time and first thing you know you feel better about it see thats possible of course youll probably have headache and so forth but it doesnt matter now its possible now because thats possiblebecause that is possiblethen you could extrapolate and move forward to believe that goals finding and auditing was possible you see in research and so forth ive had to and have inadvertently or on purpose run dozens of processes on myself its inevitable you say i wonder what would be the effect of see thats all you have to say you answer the question its obviously selfaudit see you say well would these people get better if you did soandso supposing you asked them think of problem of comparable magnitude well think of problem of comparable magnitude to this building yeah theres an answer thats answerable now in actual fact you in dreaming up pcs lines do little bit of selfauditing you say well lets see is that answerable or isnt that yes you could say thatd be clear sphere or something like that yeah theres an answer to that you know so you get this kind of thing in other words it starts to be borne in upon you that auditing on self is possible well its possible to say run touch assist on your own leg yeah you could probably cure up sear girls got scar or something like that that she doesnt like on her knee or something like that why she could probably do touch assist on it ten minutes day and at the end of couple of months or something like that have more scar its quite remarkable what can be done with touch assist see and because that is successful say well you could probably find and run goal on yourself see therefore goals running is possible now i collided withon this on the queen elizabeth and ive had quite goaround on this particular subject and actually have let some people list their own goals and this is what now materializes let show you here heres person see and heres valence this flashlight see now heres the valence here now this is the valence with the goal in it now to find his own goalsee youd think itd be like this see he said lets see to catch catfish i wonder if that is my goal lets see is that my goal to catch catfish sen now he says i dont know that sort of made feel dizzy lets see to catch catfish how about to be game warden yeah theres pain on that that must be right thats the oppgoal see thats the oppgoal an individual has to be over here to look at the valence in which his goal exists im making this point with you and every time the individual thinks of inspecting his goal he exteriorizes from his valence into an opposition terminal and an effort to run ones own goal or list ones own goal always finds one in the opposite lines now when one is listing opposition terminals one of course is in ones own goal terminal heres the opposition terminal see and the thetan would come around here lets say these are terminals now well take the terminal situation see and heres the thetan see now this one contains the opposition goalthe flashlight and this little microphone here contains the persons own goal see now person says to catch catfish who or what would want to catch catfish and inspectsgoes over here to the opposition terminal to inspect the terminal which contains the goal to catch catfish savvy now to inspect the opposition who or what would oppose catching catfish the person goes into the terminal in which the goal exists to look at the opposition do you understand in other words matter what he looks at he is always in the other side every time he looks at the goal or the opposition to the goaltheres looking at the oppositionhes in the terminal with the goal you got that and while looking at the goal he goes into the terminal which is in opposition to the goal you see this so there he is always on the wrong side of the fence becauseheres the trick you cant asis youre always being the thingyoure always being the thing which doesnt have in it what youre trying to asis its all exterior inspection then everything is inspected exteriorly in the mind little bit hard to put this across but the point im trying to make simply is that the individual the person the thetan in the bank stackup can never be in what hes trying to audit and therefore never turns the sen or the pain on in the right places its always in the wrong place if its lines two and four that are supposed to contain sensation and lines one and three supposed to contain pain why in selfaudit why lines one and three will contain sensation and lines two and four will contain pain this is real backwards isnt it and he can get so loused up because he never is in what he is trying to asis he starhes going to check out his own goal lets say the goal is in this microphone thats one valence hes going to check out this goal so he comes over here into the opposition to check out the goal now hes being the opposition while hes checking out the goal but this thing isnt here hes not in it to find out how it thinks so he only thinks over here in the opposition you see what this you get the idea now hes going to check out for the opposition goal of course hes in his own terminal and you know the one that does have the goal it takes an auditor all right heres let us say is the auditor and here are two terminals heres the auditor and the auditor says to catch catfish and the pc goes into the terminal of catch catfish and the auditor says who or what would oppose catching catfish and the pc goes into the terminal in opposition to catching catfish see in other words hes in the right terminals for them to asis and so you get asisingness then you get something asised and the bank starts caving in and hes always in the right viewpoint but selfauditing hes always in the wrong viewpoint because of this mechanic alone selfclearing becomes impossible also after great deal of testing and so forth although person could get away with it if his auditor was sufficiently powerful and stood over his head enough and had written the lines up and so forth for little while the person could selflist but hes actually not selflisting hes listing on ahes just writing things on list that was given to him by another person dont you see and even that one as in the main failed selflisting ive just received plea from wing angell who took somebody with selflisting and he says please please please more selflisting please he had to mop up the pc you see the pc was going into the wrong terminals and after while the pc gets so confused they dont know whether theyre coming or going see what happens its just the fact that guy on selfaudit appears in the wrong places to selfaudit on goals i hope you understand that audience yes you got to have an auditor out here and the auditor asks the questions the pc goes into the proper places to get the asisness of the situation therefore your auditing occurs and he gets the pain in the right places and the sensations in the right places and his viewpoints in the correct spots and it all starts going and thats it well now he starts looking for the goal to catch catfish he at once will exteriorize from the terminal in which the goal to catch catfish is residual and then thinking quietly to himself will realize that his goal is to be game warden hell pick for himself inevitably while he is looking for his goal only opposition goals this gets pretty fantastic if you inspect most terminals lists after youve lets say the first 850 goals listwhich is still done by the waythat list is quite remarkable for having on it so many opposition goals its got lots of them well thats something that the pc listed himself now something that is listed on the pc by an auditor is less likely to have opposition terminals on it and contains greater preponderance of his own terminals see this doesnt necessarily hold true because sometimes pc is so spattered into his item that he cant tell the difference between the items goal and his own goal see theyre smashed so close together you know had an example of that the other day you know its quite remarkable the lack of criteria the pc had between his own goal and the goal that would belong to the item youve noticed that in doing your lists sometimes you know lets say the goal was to catch catfish you know to catch catfish to bite hooks to jump out of the water see to eat well to never be scaly again you know you watch these lists and you will see that the pc is actually putting down opposition goals but thats on the item and of course when you havent got any item in sight the pc rackets around inside of his bank and so on he will put large number of opposition goals thats perfectly all right because they wont rocket read and everything is fine you never find an opposition goal with rocket reads dont worry about that some of youve got it tucked away in your head that some goal is firing and its the opposition goal and youre now very worried aw stop worrying about it some goals will continue to fire for quite while and then fold up which arent the pcs goal you should be aware of that mechanism but it isnt that they are opposition goals and opposition goals wont keep on firing forever see thats very nice youre saved by the bell in the normal checkout period an opposition goal folds up and it doesnt rocket read but sometimes youll get other goals rocket reading when theyre quite close to the real thing and then it fades and the rocket reads fade and apparently rocket read canthe reasonany goal but the goal rocket reads is because the read can possiblyand this is just suppositionaltransfer to another goal and itll stay transferred to the other goal for short time thats supposition drawn from the fact that the rocket read will transfer from the goal to the line just as you can get line rocket reading so you might be able to get very closely associated goal rocket reading for very short period of time and that accounts for your occasional rocket reads youre going down the list and you get this one you saw one on tv one night and it was something i think to be dashing and man that thing really rocket read you remember that its long time ago and it really rocket read it rocket read it rocket read it didnt rocket read and it didnt rocket read and it didnt read at all then that was it now whered it get that rocket read actually it was transfer to the goal momentarily and the goal itself was in there someplace see and it was firing and then this thing blew off the top of it and it wasnt the goal and so you longer had rocket read so because your opposition is so close to the goal occasionally opposition goals will rocket read momentarily but not for hours you know and they dont check out and they dont live up to anything so you dont worry about opposition goals its not an obstacle the only thing im trying to tell you here is selfaudit is impossible on goals thats just it i just have to come to that conclusion there is system by which you can selfaudit into your goal of course you wake up some morningyou can wake up one morning and you can say my goal is well fine fine my god for all means put it down on something even if the inside of matchbox and give it to your auditor lf you notice as you tried to tiger drill it on the way to school or somethingif you noticeit got only sen and it got kind of unreal and it got kind of fogged up and so forth thats because of course you had to become the game warden or you had to become something else or you had to become the catfish see and then youre on the wrong side of it and its valence problem see and you slide into the wrong valence and after that it doesnt work and thats goals so it takes another observer the machine cannot observe it takes another observer in the session and somebody who can sit there and issue the actual commands to degree that person does not selfaudit to find goals therefore it takes very smooth fine auditing to find goals your auditor has to have presence the pc has to know theres an auditor there otherwise the pc is just mucking around fromin the wrong valences and selfauditing into this and into that as he would do on machine so it takes machine to do detection the human being doesnt go that far the thetan doesnt go that far on observation but the machine will never be an observer and as the machine cannot be observer then human being would never be in the right valence to find the goal so thats why you have to have fine auditor to find goals and the more presence and the more altitude and the more certainty the pc has on the subject of that auditor then the easier it is to find the goal you follow that so the better the auditor the easier it is to find the goal and the weaker the auditor the harder it is to find the goal but the goalthe length of time of finding the goal as i said depends to large degree on luck but finding the item finding the detested person you know finding the dynamic finding that trioof course if the auditor has good presence good skill the pcs aware of him they go into it clank and go outside of it and say that is detested go into the next item bang they say that is detested go outside of it go into the item bang that is detested there it is bong and youve got it you understand in other words the auditors presence is sufficient and adequate to putting the pc into the valence necessary to face the valence which is the opposition see so it takes an auditor the auditor is necessary the machine is necessary we can make better auditors we can make machines but we cant i dont think make an auditor that will totally replace the machine and i know that we cant make machine that will ever replace the auditor do i make my point audience yes thank you
