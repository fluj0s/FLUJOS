airlines 742 f2d 1081 7th cir 1984 cert denie d 471 us 1017 1985 the seventh circuit found three reasons to deny title vii coverage to transsexuals first the court read the word sex in the statute to mean man or woman not an individual suffering from sexualidentity disorder second the cour t found the sparse legislative history of the sex discrimination amendment to the civil ri ghts act failed to reveal any congressional intent to protect transsexuals third the c ourt noted the fact that many bills had been offered subsequent to 1975 to add the term sexual orientation to title vii but none had passedit similar in scope to the earlier law but b ecause sexual orient ation discrimination in employment involves host of consid erations not before congress when it enacted title vii the measures also differ in several significant respects definition of sexual orientation sexual orientation is defined by the bill to mean homosexuality bisexuality or heterosexuality whether the orientation is real or perceived emphasis added in ddition 704 make s clear an individual is protected not only from discrimination based upon her own sexual orientation but also that of persons with whom the individual associates or has associated thus the bill would not be limited to protecting only gays and lesbians from sexual orientation disc rimination heterosexuals w ould also be protected from discrimination by homosexual employer or by heterosexual employer who discovers that the employee has homosexual friend or family member and then intentionally fires or otherwise discriminates against the employee on that basis note however that the scope of lega l protection afforded persons based on their perceived orientation may be difficult to gauge whose perception is the controlling factor that of the victim of xual orientation discrimination or of the alleged perpetrator is the perception to be tested subjectively or objectively for example can an employee who considers himself or herself to be homosexual or bisexual claim discrimination by an employer who may have perception nor any objective reason for perceiving one way or another also pe rceived orientation may include discrimination ag ainst transsexuals or tran svestites two groups which the courts have held to be unprotected by the sex discrimination prohibitions of title vii3 there is comparable language in title vii prohibiting discrimination on the basis of perceived characteristics applicable to discrimination prohibited by the 1964 act thus courts would appare ntly be left the task of developing appropriate standard s of proof in such per ceived orientation cases prohibited employment practices the bills delineation of prohibited employment practices substantially tracks the catalogue of employer malfeasance condemned by title vii of the 1964 act thus employers with fifteen or more employees are forbidden from taking specific actions with respect to the hiring discharge or other discr imination in employment compensation terms condition or privileges because of an individua ls sexual orienta tion or limiting segregating or classifying them in wa ys that deprive or tend to deprive themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31863crs3 4 during committee consideration in the 107th congress an associated coercion provision in the antiretaliation section of s 1284 whic h had direct parallel in the statutory language of title vii was eliminated by the collins amendment see senate report supra n 1 at p 17 5 706 of s 16 states this title does not apply to the provision of employee benefits to an individual for the benefit of the domestic partner of such individualof job opportunities or adversely affect their employment status provision without direct parallel in title vii statutory text however would also make the employer liable for such actions if they are based on the sexual orientation of person with whom the individual associates or has associated comparable range of employment agency and labor organi zation practices again largely borrowed from title vii are prohibited by the bill section 705 of s 16 incorporates language specifically prohibiting employer retaliation against employees attempting to exercise their rights under the 1964 act4 the supreme court has developed lternative methods for establishing employer liability under title vii the disparate treatment model requires proof by direct or circumstantial evidence that the employer intentionally discriminated by treating similarly situated employees differen tly because of race or gender proof of intent is unnecessary however in dispara impact cases where based on statistics company rule or policy can be shown to disproportionately affect protected class and to lack business necessity in the 1991 civil rights act congress codified the disparate impact concept in manner beneficial to title vii plaintiffs by imposing greater burden on employers for justifying the disparate impact of any challenged employment practice the bill however would narrow the evidentiary options available in sexual orientation cases by providing that only disparate treatment claims may be brought under th is title meaning that employers would be liable only where plaintiffs are able to prove intent to discriminate reinforcing this limitation is 707 of the bill which bars the eeoc from collecting statistics on sexual orientation from covered entities or compelling the collection of such statistics by covered entities exceptions to coverage s 16 carries forward various exceptions from earlier versions of enda legi slation first the armed forces which include the army navy air force marines and coas t guard would be exempt and this would extend to allocation of veterans benefits the courts have similarly held that uniformed military personnel are not covered by title vii the bill incorporates into its definition of employer an exclus ion taken from the 1964 act for bona fide private membership clubs that qualify for federal tax exemptions section 711a of the bill preserves the right of employ ers to enforce workplace rules and policies provided that they are designed for and uniformly applied to all individuals regardless of sexual orient ation and the bill seems to specifically condone an employers refusal to extend domestic partnership benefits5 section 709 of s 16 provides that t his title shall not apply to religious organization which is defined by 703a 8 to mean any religious corporation association or society or any kind of educational institution whose curriculum is directed toward the propagation of religion or which is controlled managedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31863crs4 6 42 usc 2000e1 7 see corporation of the presid ing bishop of the church of

supported wholly or substantially by religion or religious organization in its present form theref ore the bill would permit organizations including schools and learning instituti ons operated and c ontrolled by religious organizations to discriminate against gays lesbians or bisexuals in hiring and employment practices this provision of the bill appears modeled after parallel exemption for religious organizations from the religious discrimination ban in title vii of the 1964 civil rights act section 702 of the act provides this subcha pter shall not apply to religious corporation associa tion educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation associ ation educational institution or society of its activities6 current law thus allows religious institutions to discriminate but only on the basis of religion they remain covered by the statutory ban on racial ethnic and genderbased discrimination when enacted in 1964 this exemption was limited to the re ligious activities of such institutions in 1972 congress eliminated the term r eligious and thereby broadened the exemption to cover all activities of the institution7 the controlling factors for determining what constitute s religious organization under this exemption are whether the organization was created and c ontinues to serve religious purpose8 insofar as educational institutions are concerned the religious exception in s 16 appears to track the title vii statute which specifically pe rmits schools colleges universities or other educational institutions to hire and employ employees of par ticular religion if such institution is in whole or substantial part owned supported controlled or managed by particular religion or by particular re ligious corporation association or society or if the curriculum of such institution is directed toward the propagation of particular religion9 the eeoc has interpreted this provision as providing two alternative exemptions one is for school owned supported c ontrolled or managed by particular religion the other is for school whos curriculum is directed toward the propagation of pa rticular religion10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31863crs5 11 585 f supp 435 nd ill 1984 affd 803 f2d 351 7th cir 1986 12 90 f3d 458 9th cir 1993what schools or colleges are cove red sometimes is disputed in pime v loyola university of chicago 11 for example former jesuit university sought to retain its religious identity even after it had evolved into secular institution thus it reserved three tenured positions for jesuits and cla imed that it was exempt under the title vii statute as university supported controlled or managed in whole or in part by religious society the president of the university was jesuit as were more than one third of the trustees and veral university officers and ad ministrators however the society of jesus did not instruct the president or trustees with regard to university matters and did not control the decisions of other jesuits who served in official university positions hence despite jesuit presence on campus the university was held not exempt under the act by the bills terms christian and religious schools that are independent financially or in their management struct ure from churches or other formal religious entities may nonetheless qualify for the 709 exemption allowing them to take sexual orientation into account when maki ng employment decisions provided that their curriculum includes re ligious component or as th bill states is directed toward the propagation of religion the extent to which in practice schools may be required to engage in religious instruction or to integrate religious teachings into their formal curriculum is not addressed by the bill nor is it conclusively settled by existing title vii precedent eeoc v kamehameha schools12 however indicates that religious school can lose its title vii exemption when it lacks close ties to organized religion or its purpose or ch aracter is not primarily religious eeoc sued the kamehameha schools wh ich had been created by the will of member of the hawaiian royal family pr oviding that teachers shall forever be members of the protestant faith the sc hools conceded that in order to effectuate the testators intent they were required to discriminate on religious basis prohibited by title vii but were exempt as relig ious educational institutions under the 1964 act in rejecting this argument the ninth circuit held that kamehameha purpose and character were primarily secular and not religious further what religious characteristics it had namely comparative religious studies scheduled prayers and services bible quotations in school publication and employment of nominally protestant teachers were common to private schools and did not satisfy the requirements of the religious education exemption instead the court of appeals found that the schools had embraced br oad mandate to he lp native hawaiians participate in contemporar society for rewarding and productive life through solid secular education including hawaiian culture and history and moral guidance to aid students define system of values finally noting dearth of case law on the curriculum exemption the ninth circuit found that the curriculum of the schools did little to propagate protestantism courses about religion and general effort to teach good values did not c onstitute curriculum propagating religion moreover the schools publications demons trated that religion embodied more general tradition than actual mission and served primarily as means of advancing moral values within the context of genera l education as suc h the court concludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31863crs6 13 id at 461 n 7 14 113 f3d 196 11th cir 1997 15 530 us 640 2000the educational experience at kamehameha w ould not be any different if some of the teachers were not protestants the result in kamehameha schools was influenced to some degree by the absence of church ownership or control indeed the court of appeals observed that it had found case holding the title vii exemption to be applicable where the institution was not wholly or partially owned by church13 subsequently in killinger v samford university 14 the eleventh circuit held that baptist college was an exempt religious institution which could require professors to subscribe to the schools religious doctrine the court noted that baptist convention comprised the largest single source of revenue for the co llege and that the schools charter listed as its chief purpose the promotion of chri stian religion thus under title vii precedent independent christian and othe r religious schools not owned financed or controlled by church bodies may find it difficult to qualify for religious organization exemption in 709 of s 16 of course as stand alone legislation it is possible that courts would find that the policy concerns underlying the bill are sufficiently different from title vii to warrant less restrictive reading of the formers curriculum propagating religion standard absent clarification in the bill itself or its legislative history any resolution of the issue would have to await further judicial elaboration first amendment right of association rule of construction in the bill would preclude application of the sexual orientation prohibition in any manner that infringes first amendment associati onal rights of any nonprofit voluntary membership organization thus 711b of s 16 provides association nothing in this title shall be construed to prohibit any association or infringe upon any rights of association guaranteed by the first amendment to the constitution of any nonprofit voluntary membership organization whether or to what extent this provisi on would insulate the hiring and employment practices of such nonprofit organizations from the bills proscriptions may be matter of some doubt observe that 711 b neither mentions employment nor by its own force does it delineate the scope of any possible exception from the bills coverage for the designated organizations rather the provision would take its meaning from first amendment principles as established by the courts most relevant here may be the us supreme court ruling in boy scouts of america v dale 15 which considered the constitutional ramifications of applying state ban on sexual orientation discrimination to the membership policies of the boy scouts the supreme court in that case held that new jersey law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimin ation in public accommodations could not be applied so as to compel the boy scouts to reinstate an avowed homosexual scout leader in effect the new jersey law was found to burden th boy scouts first amendment right tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31863crs7 16 id at 657 17 id at 659 oppose homosexual conduct an intrusion which could not be justified by the states interest in curbing discrimination the five to four majority applied threeprong test to determine that the boy scout policy was protected by the first amendment first examination of the scout oa th law and various position statements convinced the court that the scouts di sapproved of homosexuality as lifestyle choice and forcing it to accept homosexuals as leaders would violate their freedom of expressive association second inclusion of hom osexual leaders would signal acceptance by the group and significantly mper its ability to advocate its public or private viewpoints finally while the state had an interest in eliminating discrimination it could not be exercised at the cost of another groups constitutional rights in other words the state coul d not compel the boy scouts to express position completely at odds with its organizational viewpoint the boy scouts case of course had to do with voluntary members and leaders of the organization not paid staff and employment nor do any other decisions appear to have equated discrimination in employment with an employers right to associate for constitutional purposes even assuming that the boy scouts rationale is applicable to the employment setting however it is unlikely that an organizations right to expressive associ ation would justify wholes ale exclusion of homosexuals from all consideration for employment inst ead whether there is right to exclude protected by the bill would appear to depe nd on three basic factors first is the organization in question engaged in ex pressive association on the subject of homosexuality relying on policy statem ents by bsas executive council the majority in the boy scouts case determined that the boy scouts takes an official position with respect to homosexual conduc t and that is sufficient for first amendment purposes16 presumably unless the basis for similar judgment exists with respect to other voluntary membership organizations covered by 711 b the employment practices of the organi zation would not be exempt from the requirements of s 16 sec ond the majority opinion argued that if bsa teaches by example then the leaders presence would force the organization to send message both to the youth members and the world that it accepts homosexual conduct as leg itimate form of behavior17 the courts dictum may have considerable force as applied to th message sent by individuals whether volunteers or paid employees in leadership or executive positions it may be less germane however where lower level clerical or custodial positions for example are concerned the congressional interest in ending discrimination prohibited by s 16 might be found to outweigh the burden imposed on the nonprofit organization as applied in such situations in sum the right of association pr otected by 711b may not apply to boy scout hiring practices but even if it does it is uncertain whether all job positions would be covered or what other nonprofit organizations would be able to invoke its protection remedies and enforcement administrative enforcement of s 16 with respect to private employment would be delegated to th equal employmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31863crs8 18 712a6 of s 16 19 42 usc 2000e5g 20 708 of s 16 21 section 1981ab3 describes compensatory damages as including
