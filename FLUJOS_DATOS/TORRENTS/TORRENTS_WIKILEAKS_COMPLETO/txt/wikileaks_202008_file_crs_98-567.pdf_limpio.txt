reserves now totaling more than 3 billion opic was established in 1969 amid an atmosphere of congressional disillusionment overall with us aid programs especially large infrastructure projects in his first message to congress on aid president nixon recommended the creation of opic to assume the investment guaranty and promotion functions that were being conducted by the agency for international development aid president nixon also directed that opic would provide businesslike management of investment incentives to contribute to the economic and social progress of developing nations 1 in creating opic the nixon administration indicated that it was not attempting to end official us foreign assistance because private capital and technical assistance cannot substitute for government assistance programs combination that can provide official aid on the one hand and private investment and technical assistance on the other private investment activities however were meant to complement the official assistance programs and thereby multiply the benefits of both in addition marketoriented priv ate investment was viewed as an antidote to the governmentoriented aid projects that were viewed by some as costly and inefficient opic was created as first step in the eventual overhaul of the entire us aid program in 1973 this overhaul was completed as the united states largely abandoned infrastructure building and other large capital projects in favor of humanitarian aid to meet basic human needs at present opic is directed to mobilize and faci litate the participation of united states private capital and skills in the economic and social development of less developed countries and areas and countries in transition from nonmarket to market economies 2 opics programs are intended to promote us private investment in less deve loped countries by reducing risks especially political risks including currency inconvertibility expropriation political violence and terrorism for us firms associated with overseas investment to accomplish these goals opic is authorized to finance us investment through loans and guarantees insure against political risk and provide various investor services op ics authority to guaranty and insure us investments abroad is backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and opics own substantial financial resources opics activities also were intended to assist us firms and small businesses foreign operations for instance cong ress directed opic to focus on projects that have positive trade benefits for the united states opic is required to decline its services however if it believes an overseas investment may reduce employment in the united states either because us firm shifts part of its production abroad or because output from an overseas investment will be shipped to the united states and reduce substantially the positive trade benefits of the investment 3 opic also is generally barred by its enabling legislation from participating in projects that pose an unreasonable or major environmental health or safety hazard or participating in countries that do not extend internationally recognized workers rights or that impose domestic content requirements 1 public papers of the presidents richard nixon washington us govt print off 1969 p 412 2 22 usc section 2191 3 22 usc section 2191 3k1
