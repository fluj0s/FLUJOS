major foreign conventional weapon systems that china has acquired or has co mmitted to acquire since 1990 w ith particular attention to implications for us security concerns it is not the assumption of this report that chinas military the peoples liberation army pla will engage in conflict with other forces in asia nonetheless since the mid1990s there has been increasing concern about chinas asse rtiveness in asia and milita ry buildup against taiwan since 1990 china has acquired or sought to acquire select types and modest quantities of modern foreign weapons primarily from russia these include mi17 helicopters il76 transports su27 figh ters s300 surfacetoair missile sam systems kilo submarines torm1 sam systems sovremenny destroyers with sunburn antiship cruise missiles ascms a50 airborne warning and control systems awacs israeli phalcon system canceled in 2000 and su30 longrange fighters the su27 and su30 represent significant upgrades in fighter aircraft capability over chinas indigenous aircraft the combination of the plas imported aa11 airtoair missile and highly maneuverable aircraft coul d prove vexing airtoair challenge to modern fighter aircraft of other forces in asia the russian sams represent marked improvements in chinas ability to target aircraft and missiles that threaten its airspace nonetheless the plas ability to employ its modern acquisitions is hampered by factors such as limited inventory deficient maintenance inadequate pilot traini ng outdated air doctrine rigid command disparate communications and lack of suppor ting capabilities in the near term chinas navy has been primarily coas tal defense force built around ships based largely on older or obsolete soviet technology china s two sovremennyclass ships are considerably more technologically modern complex and capable than most other pla surface combatants the ssn22sunbur n antiship cruise missile designed to defeat the us navys aegis airdefense system is considered by many to be the most threatening shiplaunched ascm in service today still chinas sovremenny class ships though fairly capable would be vulnerable to air nd submarine attack although much attention has been paid to chinas procurement of sovremennyclass ships armed with ssn22s the four quiet kilos with their potential for avoiding detection and their potent torpedoes might represent greater threat to naval forces in asia if wellmaintained and proficientlyoperated the pla navys kiloclass submarines can launch attacks against ships and submarines operating in the region kilos are nevertheless vulnera ble to detection and attack china has made some significant qualitative upgrades through foreign acquisitions but it remains to be seen how these acquisitions will be expanded and linked to other pla improvements th operational significance of chinas conventional arms acquisitions will also depend on the plas training to eventually conduct effective joint military operations and the scenario in which the systems might be used these developments in pla modernization will bear watchinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700contents p u r p s n d s c p 1 c n g r s s i n l c n c r n s n d c t

nonetheless since the mid1990s there has been increasing concern about the prcs assertiveness in the asianpacific region as well as military buildup threatening taiwan with possible us military i

expressed concerns about the efforts of the prc to moderniz the pla while many countries upgrade their militaries the plas modernization has prompted debate about the extent to which enhanced pla capabilities challenge us interests and stability in the asia pacific region this debate has covered several areas of concern including prc assertiveness in the disputed maritime areas of the east and south china seas the greater pla missile threat to taiwan as demonstrated by the missile testfirings in 1995 and 1996 persistent threats to use fo rce in the taiwan strait suspected unauthorized acquisitions of us miss ile technology associ ated with satellite launches and nuclear weapon secrets weapons proliferati on and rising arms purchases particularly from russia some members have cited the taiwan relations act tra pl 968 as basis for congressional concern over the situation in the taiwan strait the tra left the question of us involvement somewhat ambiguous section 2b4 states that the united states will consider with g rave concern any nonpeaceful means to determine taiwans future nonetheless in not wanting to predetermine us actions members of congress also adopted section 2b6 declaring it to be us policy to maintain the capacity of the united states to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardiz the security or the social or economic system of the people on taiwan5 particularly since the plas provocativ missile testfirings in 1995 and 1996 and us deployment of two aircraft carriers close to taiwan in march 1996 congress has required

capabilities in light of the acquisitions assessment of air power acquisitions132 platform comparisons the following section compares the capabilities of the fighter aircraft aams and sams that china has imported to thos produced indigenously by china as well as to those found in some other asian militari and us forces based in the region this comparison does not provide complete picture of pla air power capabilities it is however necessary first step for further assessment platformtoplatform comparison of these systems indicates that chinas imported systems appear to be notably more capable than indigenous syst ems and are roughly onpar with western aircraft aams and sams fighterattack aircraft indigenous pla fighter and attack aircraft have been described by various analysts as obs olete and antiquated there is consensus in us defense circles that the pla air force is beset with many weaknesses the foremost weakness is that the plaaf is currently saddled with over 2000 aircraft of 1950sera soviet design comparable to outdated us fighters like the f100 f8 and b47133 the su27 and su30 represent significant upgrades in fighter aircraft capability over indigenous pla aircraft making s imple performance comparisons it is clear that the russian fighters fly farther and faster than indi genous prc fighters the 27 and su30 are more mane uverable and carry more and better armament than domestic prc aircraft according to some analysts the su27and su30 that china has sought from russia are roughly comparable to the us f15c air superiority fighter134 indeed the information in table 4 below suggests that the su27 is in many ways comparable to the best fighters in other asian and us inventories the su27s flight profile and armament are similar to those of the f14 f15 f16 fa 18cd indigenous defense fighter idf f taiwan and mirage 2000 the su27 may be more maneuverable than the best western fighters the russian fighter has been described by observers as

magazine january 2000there are however additional fighterattack aircraft characteristics that are important measures of performance these factors including radar cross section and electronic countermeasures for instance are difficult to quantify or compare in the unclassified milieu comparison of these factors would provide clearer picture of how the su27 measures up to the western fighter aircraft radar cross section an aircrafts radar cro ss section has significant effect on its survivability aircraft that incorporate stealth materials and design techniques to reduce their radar cross sections are more difficult to detect track and engage than aircraft that have larger ra dar cross sections the general design of indigenous prc aircraft and th eir lack of composite mate rials strongly suggest they have large radar cross sections by co mparison the russian fighters use modern designs that while not stealthy on the scale of aircraft designed specifically to be stealthy reduce their radar cross sections appreciably relative to indigenous prc fighters us air force assessment asse rts that the su27s radar cross section is on par with the f15cs but it does not provide data to substantiate this assessment136 lacking the supporting data on rada r cross section it is impossible to make definitive statements regarding how stealthy the su27 is relative to western

1999first it can be observed that while russia does possess the ability to incorporate stealth materials and designs in its military aircraft it has not yet advanced to the level of the united states in this tec hnology furthermore the united states continues to refine its stealth technolog ies by developing third generation of stealthy aircraft the f22 raptor as the us defense establishment improves its knowledge of stealth while working on programs like the f22 and joint strike fighter it identifies radar deflecting or absorbing techniques that can be employed on existing aircraft137 another observation that suggests that the su27 radar cross section may be inferior to that of us aircraft is that the su27s operated by china are export aircraft it is usually but not always the case that an export variant of given aircraft does not incorporate the latest and most potent components thus it would be very common practice for russia to eliminate radar reducing elements of the 27 exported to china if feasible furt hermore materials and technologies that improve an aircrafts stealthiness are often costly and difficult to maintain in light of chinas maintenance shortcomings that will be outlined below the plaaf may have difficulty maintaining any stealth capabilities that its su27s may possess electronic countermeasures the effectiveness of an aircrafts electronic countermeasures ecm is strong determinant of its survivability in an era of sophisticated radar and infrared ir guided surfacetoair and airtoair missiles and radar guided antiaircraft artillery modern

that is important but difficult to assess reliably airtoair missiles prcmanufactured aams are analogous in capability to the indigenous fighters on which they ar employed they are or are based on first generation weapon systems that trace th eir lineage to 1960s era designs the pl 2 5 7 8 and 9 are shortrange aams 35 km 23 and depend on ir guidance the oldest systems pl2 4 7 can only engage

over indigenous prc fighters these missiles are effective to much longer ranges than the prc aams which adds to their operational effectiveness and increases launchaircraft survivability the russian aams especially the aa11 are highly maneuverable missiles feature that increases their lethality although the pla air force has not yet acquired the russian aa12 or israeli python 4 aams it has reportedly sought them if successfully acquired these systems will also represent significan t improvement in the plas aam capability the aa12 has been called the amraamski indicating its similarities to the premier us mediumrange 75 km 47 airtoair missile the python 4s range of 15 km 9 is more in keeping with the range of prc missiles however this missile is extremely maneuve rable and it

imported russian aams as well as othe r asian and us aams russian aams have been described generally as being of high technical quality139 one analyst has described the aa10 for instance as generally comparable to the american aim7m sparrow missile140 similar to the case of assessing fighter aircraft airtoair missiles possess additional characteristics that bear strongly on their effectiveness these characteristics including seeker disc rimination cap ability and susceptibility to electronic countermeas ures for instance are very difficult to assess due to classification and complexity even

foundation july 31 1996nonetheless some observations can be made regarding two additional characteristics that shed light on the utility of the aa10 and aa11 acquired by the pla air force visavis western aams these characteristics are fireandforget capability and the missiles offbores ight launch envelope these two characteristics are central to air superiority operations because they often determine which aircraft achieves the first shot during aerial combat fireandforget capability shorterrange aams can effectively use ir guidance once an ir missile is launched the host aircrafts role in missile guidance is complete and the aircraft can prepare another missile for launch initiate evasive action or target another hostile aircraft in essence the aircraft can fire and forget the missile however as range increases the effectiveness of irguided missiles diminishes radar guided missiles operate more effectively at longer ranges than do ir missiles active radar missiles use rada r transmitter to autonomously track targets at short and mediumranges semiactive radar missiles require the host aircrafts radar to illuminate the target until missile impact generally speaking aams that employ active radar guidance such as the aim54c aim120 and mica fly more independently after launch than do aams that empl oy semiactive radar guidance such as the aa10 and aim7r thus the aa10 is not fireandforget missile and thus not as attractive from an aircraft rvivability perspective as say an aim120 however the aa10 has lockon range of 30 km 20 against typical fighter aircraft targets142 which may make up partia lly for this disadvantage offboresight capability traditionally aams ar launched by pointing the host aircraft directly at the hostile aircraft and using sight to line up the target the requirement to fire from this position gives advantage to th most maneuverable aircraft or the pilot with the greatest tactical flying skill the ability to fire missile from off boresight also proves advantageous either by contributing by extension to an aircrafts maneuvera bility or by countering an adversarys ma neuverability the aa11s most distinguishing characteristic is its high maneuverability and its offboresight capability the aa11 is the first effective helmetsighted airto air missile with this system pilot can aim his weapon by turning his head and does not have to line up the aircraft with the target the first generation of aa11s can be fired 45 degrees off th aircrafts forward lineo fdirection or offboresight the second generation of this aam has in creased range and can be fired 60 degrees offboresight the aim9m sidewinder by comparison can acquire targets only 275 degrees off the forward line of sight and has shorter range143 some analysts assert that the aim120s long range and fireandforget capability confer much of the same tactical flexibility as the aa11144httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs30 145 german mig29s in red flag exercise aviation daily

day fighter aircraft of other asian and us forces the russian mig29 has been flown against us aircraft in red flag exercises at nellis air force base nevada at longer distances the us aircraft were found to have the advantage versus the russian plane due to superior avionics as the distance between aircraft closed however the migs high maneuverability and the aa11s offboresight capabilities defrayed the us aircrafts advantage observers noted that at distance of approximately five miles the russian aircraft enjoyed significant advantage145 the su27 is also highly maneuverable airc raft and the combination of it and the aa 11 will likely prove as dangerous combination as the mig29 and aa11 surfacetoair missiles china manufactures five different sam systems two of them the hn5 and qw1 are shor trange manportable systems based on the 1960s era russian sa7 the hn5s utility is limited by primitive ir seeker that often cannot differentiate between an aircrafts engine signature the sun or heat radiating off the ground while the qw1 ir seeker is much improved over the hn 5s this missiles engagement envelope is even more limited than its predecessors chinas hq2 sam is effective to much greater altitude and range than the manportable sams but it is based on ru ssias first generation 1950s era sa2 sam and is the oldest technology in chin as inventory the hq2 employs liquid fueled second stage rocket motor whic h requires timeconsuming preparation and cumbersome handling equipment this sam has been described by at least one analyst as antiquated146 by reverse engineering foreign sams china was able to incorporate some improvements in the pl9 and hq7 sams not found in earlier prc systems these improvements include better seekers that allow offaxis launch and reportedly electronic count ermeasures such as home on jam however these systems and the less advanced hq61 are still shortrange sams designed to defend against lowtomedium altitude aircraft the russian sams acquired by china th sa15 and especially the sa10 represent marked improvements in chinas ability to target aircraft that threaten its airspace the sa15s range and inter cept altitude are similar to chinas most modern indigenous sams however the sa 15 features number of characteristics that make it more effective system for instance the sa15 can use its surveillance and tracking radars and can fire missiles while moving it can fire two missiles simultaneously at two different targets perhaps more significantly this system can engage cruise missiles and unmanned aeria l vehicles uavs it has

the operational utility of these systems is diminished if th ey cannot be employed in large numbers generally speaking attackers tend to re quire greater numbers than defenders in planning ground operations for instance 31 ratio of attackers to defenders is traditionally considered the minimum required for success recent military operations illustrate the value of mass in air operations in the 1991 war in the persian gulf operation sert storm the coalition generated 132029 air sorties in five months during operati on allied force the 1999 conflict in kosovo 37225 combat sorties were flown in 78 days in contrast it will be difficult for the pla air force to generate even hundreds of sorties let alone t housands of sorties with its modern aircraft only around 48 27s against targets at distance from the nearest pla airbase in its 1979 border c onflict with vietnam for instance it took the plaaf 45 days to move 700 aircraft to the theater of operations once there the plaaf achieved an average operational tempo of only one flight for each aircraft every four days china did not fly single sortie over vietnamese airspace153 having about 48 su27s will not make great difference in chinas inability to generate numerous offensive sorties table 7 compares the key platforms in the inventories of the prc taiwan japan and us air forces stationed in the region this table illustrates that taiwan for instance has seven times more modern fighter aircraft than does the prc taiwan and japan also have aew and ew forces which the pla does not the implications of the plas deficiency in this regard will be discussed below disregarding arguments about the 27s technological capabilities and assuming rough parity between the su27 and mode rn western fighter ai rcraft the numerical inequity between the prcs modern fighters 48 and taiwans modern airforce 340 fighters brings into question the plaafs ability to mount effective offensive action in this scenario however force of bout 48 su27s is enough to make tangible impact on the prcs ability to conduct fensive operations especially when integrated with modern air defenses chinas procurement of four sa10 re giments appears sufficient to make an immediate operational impact an estimated 1624 batteries capable of launching over 250 longrange missiles could significantly augment chinas existing air defenses or enable the defense of additiona l assets also because it is defensive system the sa10 enjoys advantages over attacking aircraft such as the ability to prepare staging and resupply areas and pre survey launch

during the initial co production of su27s substandard work resulted in the first two aircraft manufactured by china to be abruptly reassembled after their first flights one analyst claims that chinas difficulties in maintaining advanced technology result in part from poor manufacturing pr ocesses lacking the tight tolerances required to manufacture identical parts prc aircraft are literally one of kind the implication is that there is interchangeability of parts between two unique airframes of the same type of aircraft this can be treme ndous maintenance headache involving grounding of aircraft in case of even minor unserviceabilities until i noperative parts are repaired or repl acements manufactured to tailormade specifications156 china appears to have particular deficiency in maintaining aircraft engines unable to maintain them incountry the pla has been forced to send the al31f engines which power both the su27 and the locally developed f10 fighter to russia for repair china is

finally it appears that for all intents and purposes once out of the cockpit the pla pilots training ends there is virtually simulator training except on very rudimentary systems165 this lack of

parts of its air force the plas aerial refueling capabilities in the nearterm appear to be rudimentary thus in the immediate term it does not appear that china has the ability to use their best fighter aircraft up to their full range potential however the longerterm implications of pla acquisition of aerial refueling aircraft is significant because these aircraft can greatly increase the

aircraft provide an expanded and clearer view of the battlespace and the ability to more coherently organize and employ large numbers of aircraft over great distances and against large number of targets because radar is usually effective only to the extent of its direct line of sight the earths curvature limits the ability of surf acebased radars to detect low flying aircraft at about 30 miles modern aircraft can travel this distance in less than minute eluding detection until they are literally on top of their target by elevating early warning radars say to 30000 feet low fl ying

resulting awacs aircraft can be used not just to provide warning to defenses but also to ffectively control large numbers of aircraft on both defensive and offensive missions over large area against

acquisitions for regional security as requested the discussion focuses on the implications for us naval forces notably the us forces most directly affected by these acquisitions although the discussion focuses on impli cations for us naval forces it is important to note that chinas naval acqui sitions like its naval forces generally can also be used against other naval forces in the western pacific including those of russia japan south korea taiwan the phili ppines and vietnam us naval forces in the western pacific are considerably more capable than the forces of these and all other navies in the region in general these other naval forces when compared to us naval forces would be more vulnera ble to attack by chinas russianmade ships and submarines and less able to attack them in turn partial exception to this would be the japanese navy known more formally as the japan maritime selfdefense force which is sizeable modern and capable force the japanese fleet includes

warfare ships compared to the us navy however th japanese navy lacks among other things aircraft carriers with fixedwi ng aircraft and nuclearpowered attack submarines this reduces the ability of japans navy compared to us naval forces to detect track and attack surface ships nd submarines japans navy also appears to have proportionately less extensive atsea replenishment resupply capability than the us navy which could limit the ability of japans naval forces to operate for sustained period of time in areas that are outside japans immediate home waters in assessing the implications of chinas naval acquisition for regional security in general the limitations of these other regional naval forces compared to us naval forces should be kept in mind this woul d be particularly im portant for crisis or conflict scenarios that might involve us naval forces either initially or from start to finish in addition although parts of the discussi on below are set in the possible context of

navy in general chinas navy more formally known as the peoples liberation army navy plan has been primar ily coastal defense force built around ships based largely on older or obsolete soviet tec hnology since the mid1990s china has embarked on an effort to develop navy with more bluewater capabilities and more modern technology the apparent intent of this program is to develop fleet that

into the western pacific such as the philippine sea chinas acquis itions of russianmade sovremennyclass destroyers and kiloclass submarines form key part of this effort in assessing the potential

includes embarked helicopters and gas turbine propulsion notwithstanding these improvements the backbone of the pla surface fleet remains its 16 aging ludaclass destroyers 3250 tons and 30 jianghuclass frigates 1425 tons that are largely inadequate to meet the requirements of modern warfare the planned acqui sition of two 7940ton russianbuilt sovremennyclass ddgs in the 2000 to 2001 period will improve the plans surface combatant capability the plans hq61 and hq7 systems are based on the french crotale landbased surfacetoair missile system and they do not provide surface units with an effective areadefense capability this deficiency makes plan surface units ex tremely vulnerable to air attack the chinese navy also is limited by othe r operational constraints although it has some capability to conduct shallow water antisubmarine warfare along its littoral and in the yellow and south china seas the plans antisubmarine warfare capability remains modest at best towedarray sonar and sonobuoy systems use technology that is more than 20 years old the plans damage control capability remains limited and few units have automatic firefighting or watertight door systems anticontamina tion systems also are considered to be quite basic by western standards the plan does field broad spectrum of fairly sophisticated seaskimming cruise missiles based on either russian styx ssn2 or on french exoc et technology despite this capability the lack of effective overthehorizon targeting sensors and coordinated targeting tactics limits the likely effectiveness of these systems191 the 2000 report of the secretary of defe nse to congress on chinas current and future military strategy states chinas fleet of major surface combat ants includes about 40 frigates and 20

to make major leap forward in antish ip missile design going from subsonic missile to seaskimming missile capab of multimach speeds the rationale for the increase in speed was straight forward by doubling or tripling the speed of the missile and changing the flight profile to lowaltitude approach the reaction time of shipborne defences would be greatly reduced the speed and seaskimming flight path of the new moskit missile was intended to complicate the task of these new nato defensive systems by substantially reducing the time in which they could react once the missile was first detected the missile was designed to be undetectable until it crosses the radar horizon about 1827km about 97 to 146 nautical miles away from the targeted ship and only 2535a us navy aircraft carrier and any other nearby ships even if the warhead detonates at some distance from the carrier which is possibility if the missile is equipped with socalled salvage fuze that immediately detonates the warhead if

for example states this author had the rare privilege of long and open technicaloperational discussion with prof igor s seleznyo v director of the raduga bureau and programme head for the 3m80 prof leznyov confirmed that in the russian navys view the main interest of highly supersonic antiship missile lies in exactly the same key factor as identified by western designers and users alike namely the sharp reduction in the time av ailable for the target to identify the attacking missile and react accordingly in particular prof seleznyov indicated that all the cinematic kinematic characteristics of the 3m80 have been optimised for the specific purpose of overcoming the defensive barrier of th us aegis system the starting point was an indepth analysis of the aegis characteristics as regards detection range processing speed and reaction times i judged it indelicate to enquire about how these data were obtained as well as cinematic characteristics of the standard sm2 missile in particul ar launch acceleration maximum manoeuvre factor and minimum engagement range taking it for granted that aegis will anyway be able to pick up an attacking 3m80 missile at considerable distances prof seleznyov set himself the goal of designing an extremely fast lowflying missile that would be able to breach into the target shipss inner defence zone that is come closer

limited in what it can accomplish the ship uses an olderstyle ro tating air search radar rather than more capable phasedarray air search radar like the spy1 radar on us navy aegis ships the various parts of the sovremennyclass s airdefense system may not be as fully integrated and automated as those on an aegis ship consequently the systems reaction time may be slower than that of an aegis ship also the system might have only moderate or limited abi lity to operate in the presence of enemy jamming or countermeasures in addition given the more limited airdef ense capabilities of most of chinas other surface combatants chinas sovremennyclass ships at least for the next few years may not gain much added protecti on against air attack from any other plan ships that might be operating nearby the secretary of defense s report to congress on chinas current and future military strategy states currently the plans surface naval units are ill equipped for air defense particularly ascms only handful of the plans approximately 60 destroyers and frigates are equipped with sams the remainder are outfitted with anti aircraft guns of various calibers the few existing sam systems have extremely limited ranges and are useful only for point defense ie defense of the ship on which they are installed but not of ot her ships in the area longrange shipborne sam systems currently exist in the inventory china is reportedly seeking to address its naval air defense shortcomings through the development of naval variant of the hq9 sam the plan has already deployed albeit in limited numbers naval variant of the hq7 the san7 system which will be acquired from russia as part of the sovremenny destroyer deal is modern mediumrange naval sam system however it will have only limited capability against cruise missiles212 in light of these considerations the s ovremennyclass design imported by china would likely be vulnerable to us coordinated air attack employing

many years to study the sovremennyclass s airdefense system and in all likelihood has developed tactics for saturating and overcoming it particularly when the ship is not operating in the company of other ships with capable airdefense systems airlaunched weapons that could be used in such an attack include the high speed antiradiation missile harm the airlaunched version of the radarguided harpoon antiship cruise ssile and the airlaunched standoff land attack missile version of the harpoon with manintheloop terminal gu idance that in spite of its name can be used against surface ships potential surface launched weapons that could be used depending on the tactical situation include the surfacelaunched version of the harpoon missile the standa rd missile as used in its lesserknown surfacetosurface mode and the antiship version of the tomahawk cruise missile if any are available213 vulnerability to submarine attack as noted earlier the sovremenny class design is equipped with only modest asw capability the designs asw systems include hullmounted medium frequency sonar two shortrange asw mortars for launching small antisubmarin munitions or torpedo countermeasures four torpedo tubes for launching 21inch diameter torpedoes and facilities for embarking one ka27ka28 helix as w helicopter the ka27ka28 was developed in the 1970s and first entered service in 1982 the ka27 is the basic version the ka28 is the export version chinas purchase included 3 ka27s and 5 ka28s the helicopters are equipped with dipping sona r and magnetic anomaly detector mad they can also carry up to 36 sonobuoys or single asw torpedo single asw rocket two bombs or 10 dept h charges when operated in pairs one is normally used to track the hostile submarine while the other drops depth charges214 although these systems give the s ovremennyclass design some asw capability more capable asw system w ould have included lowfrequency ie longerrange hullmounted sonar rath er than mediumfrequency hullmounted sonar an additional variabledepth or towedarray sonar shiplaunched asw rocket for rapidly delivering depth charge or lightweight asw torpedo to longer range than the asw mortars and facilities for embarking two asw helicopters rather than one the capability of the asw system on the sovremennyclass design would be further limited by its 1970sera sonar signalprocessing computers and accompanying algorithms unless these have been updated the limits of the asw system on these ships could be compounded by lack of proficiency on the part of plan crews in operating these systems to their fullest potential asw is notoriously difficult operational skill to master and maintain even western navies with their welleducated and highly trained crews sometimes find it challenging to achieve and maintain operational proficiency in aswhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs56 given the limited asw capabilities of the rest of the pla navy chinas sovremennyclass ships may not gain mu ch added protection against submarines from other plan platforms asw is often best pursued as team effort by multiple air surface and submarine platforms opera ting as part of broader asw network without the benefit of such team effort even ship with highly capable asw system might find it difficult depending on the tactical situation and environmental conditions eg local acoustic conditions to detect hostile submarine in timely manner and maintain reliable track on it in this connection it is worth recalling that the sovremennyclass sign was originally intended by the soviets to operate in conjunction with udaloyc lass asw destroyers and ot her soviet as w platforms in light of these considerations the sovremennyclass design acquired by the plan would likely be very vulnerable to ttack by one or more us navy attack submarines the us navy attack submar ine fleet has had many years to study the asw weaknesses of the sovr emennyclass design and lik ely has developed tactics for approaching and attacking it with minimu m risk of being tected particularly when the ship is not operating in the comp any of other asw platforms indeed it is conceivable that us navy attack submarines have accumulated considerable experience since the early 1980s in covertly tracking and targe ting sovremennyclass ships it is sometimes said only half in jest that us submariners divide the worlds ships into two categories submarines and targets it is quite possible that us navy submariners would rank chinas sovremenny class ships particularly when not operating in the presence of supporting asw platforms as potentially highly vulnerable sitting ducks us submarinelaunched weapons that c ould be used against the sovremenny class design include the s ubmarinelaunched version of the harpoon antiship cruise missile and the mk 48 21inch diameter heavyweight torpedo surface combatants are highly vulnerable to torpedoes explodi ng below their hulls the shock waves from such explosions can break th ships keel and quickly sink it conducting submarine attack against sovremennyclass ship would not be as simple proposition as it was for the british attack submarine conqueror when it attacked and sank the argentine cruise r belgrano in the 1982 falklandsmalvinas war unlike the belgrano which had vi rtually asw capability and was steaming in isolation the sovremenny class design does have so asw capability and could be operating in the company of other plan platforms with at least some albeit limited additional asw capability us navy attack submarine would thus have to conduct operations with some degree of care and skill particularly so as to ensure its ability to evade possible counterattack after launching its weapons still us navy attack

ships to us air and submarine attack the threat that chinas sovremennyclass ships might pose to us navy surface ships in crisis or conflict would appear to depend on the scenario in which the

retired admiral being quoted was rear admiral eric mcvadon who served as the us defense and naval attache in beijing in 19901992if crisis involving china and the united states develops in way that provides us forces with some warning of an impending pla attack us national intelligencegathering systems and us naval forces operating in or near areas where plan forces operate could c ontinuously track the locati on of the sovremennyclass ships in addition us naval forces coul d prepare to launch rapid air or submarine attack against the ships should the crisis develop into conflict keep us surface ships at distance from the sovremennyclass ships attempt to use cover concealment and deception so as to confuse pla forces as to the location and identity of us surface ships orient us ships so as to max imize their ability to defend against any ssn22s approaching from the potential general direction of attack and place the airdefense systems of us surface ships on highalert status this would put us forces at strong advantage at the outbreak of hostilities it could lead to the disabling or destructi on of the sovremennyc lass ships before they could fire many or any of their ssn22 missiles while maximizing the chances of defeating any ssn22s that are launched if on the other hand the crisis develops in way that provides us forces with little or warning of an impending pla attack and if us surface ships are operating within range of the ssn22 this could put us forces at potentially strong disadvantage if china uses its sovremennyclass ships to carry out warning attack with ssn22 missiles against unalerted nearby us surface ships then there is significant possibility th at the sovremennyclass ships would succeed in launching at least some if not all of the ssn22s they in tended to launch before being counterattacked by us forces and notinsignificant chance that one or more of these missiles would hit and significantly damage one or more us surface ships

something to worry about215 during the cold war this second scenar io nowarning closequarters attack by cruisemissilearmed ship was pa rticular concern to us naval planners because us naval forces that were forwarddeployed to the mediterranean frequently operated in close proximity to and were often trailed by soviet ships armed with ascms in the 1970s the sovi ets modified some of their kashinclass destroyers to include four aftfacing as cms some western analysts believed this modification was done specifically so that these ships could conduct nowarning closequarters attack at the outset of natowarsaw pact conflict and then quickly attempt to leave the area key issue for us military planners and policymakers is the likelihood of nowarning closequarters attack by chinas sovremennyclass ships against us navy surface ships under what circumstances might us navy surface ships be required to operate in close proximity to chinas sovremennyclass ships and to what degree are those circumstances consistent with the scenario of nowarninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs58 216 the incident which occurred in the aegean sea involved two sea sparrow air defense missiles

f14 fighterattack during the cold war the united states forwarddeployed naval forces to the mediterranean on continuous basis and soviet naval forces deployed there frequently as well it was thus comm on and often unavoidable circumstance for us naval forces to operate in proximity to soviet naval forces in the mediterranean the us navy however normally does not continuously deploy surface ships to chinas primary bluewater naval operating areas nd chinas sovremennyclass ships deploy to those waters on only an ccasional as opposed to continuous or near continuous basis thus instances of u s surface forces operating in proximity to sovremennyclass ships are pr obably infrequent moreover if china attacked us surface ships with ssn22s as part of broader attack on us forces in the area preparations for this broader attack might be detected by the united states permitting us navy surface ships to take preparatory defensive measures in this sense warning closeproximity attack by ssn22s on unalerted nearby us navy surface ships would appear to be an unlikely scenario it is not however scenario that can be ruled out particular ly if china decides than an ssn22 attack conducted in the absence of other milita ry activities would serve some political or military purpose china could for example deliberately conduct nowarning ssn22 attack against us navy surface ship to either highlight the capabilities of the ssn22 em barrass united states by demonstrating the vulnerabilities of us navy ships or exact retribution for the us attack on the prc embassy in yugoslavia during

beijing provides the following assessment of chinas submarine force and the place of its four kiloclass submarines although it deploys force of more th an 60 submarines plan units lag behind western standards and most weapons and sensor systems are based on older russian technology lack of crew proficiency and hull quieting remain significant problems and acoustic system s are two to three generations behind the worlds firstline units all units can carry either torpedoes or mines and the acquisition of wakehoming torpedo technology has significantly improved the plans submarine

and song 3 units class boats or russianbuilt kilo type 877 and 636 submarines the plans four kilo units remain the submarine forces most capable boats although the capability of their crews to operate them effectively in tactical environment is suspect the plans continuing reliance on russianbuilt hulls reflects the lack of success of the i ndigenous ming and song designs and this situation is likely to continue as the navy pursues acquisition of advanced air independent propulsion systems for its nonnuclearpowered submarines given its slow progress with indi genously produced nuclearpowered submarine units as well as the prohibitively high construction costs the plan is likely to emphasize acquisition of cheaper more efficient and less complex conventional submarines220

development with submarinerelated technology acquired thr ough direct purchase and transfer from foreign countries particularly russia chinas asw capabilities are expected to improve over time the acquisition of four kilo attack submarines from russia reportedly has provided the plan with access to technology in quieting and sonar development as well as weapon systems china can be expected to try to incorporate some aspects of these technologies into its domestic submarine construction programs although it will take the navy many years before it can use effectively the advanced technology now available although the submarine force is orie nted principally toward interdicting surface ships using torpedoes and mines china is expected to begin arming some of its submarines with submergedlaunch cruise missiles the capability of chinese submarines to conduct asw operations is expected to improve particularly in light of the acquisition of russianbuilt kiloclass submarines and the greater emphasis reportedly being placed on asw training as result chinas submarine fleet could constitute substantial force capable of controlling sea lanes and mining approaches around taiwan as well as growing threat to submarines in the east and south china seas221 kilo class as late 1970sera design the kiloclass dieselelectric submarine also known as the project 877 636 or vashavyankaclass

kiloclass design is us ually divided into two basic variants the type 877 and the type 636 the type 877 is usually described as the basic version the type 636 is usually described as an improved version with quieter propulsion and more capable firecontrol system until r ecently russia exported only type 877 boats while reserving type 636 boats exclusively fo r its own use this pattern was broken when russia agreed to sell china two type 636 boats as the second part of chinas fourboat purchase russia may have also sold type 636 boat to india as the final boat in indias 10boat purchase at least three variants of the type 877 are now recognized the basic type 877 the 877k and the 877m the k variant in cludes an improved firecontrol system while the m variant is equipped to fire wi reguided torpedoes fro m two of its tubes in addition export versions are designated with the letter chinas two type 877 boats are described as 877ekms225 the kiloclass design is quipped with six 21inch diameter torpedo tubes and can carry total of 18 torpedoes 6 in th tubes and 12 reloads in the torpedo room of various types including wakehoming torp edoes in lieu of torpedoes the kilo class design can also carry 24 mines or possibly in the future submarinelaunched ascms the kiloclass design has diving depth of 790 feet cruising or transit range of 6000 nautical miles at 7 knots using snorke ling and stealthy patrol or tactical range of 400 nautical miles at 3 knots when submerged and operating on batteries the kilo is usually described as quiet or very quiet submarine when operating on batteries graphs published by the us navys office of naval intelligence in 1996 show that at tactical speeds of 5 to 7 knot s type 877 kilo is as quiet in terms of broadband noise as germanmade type 209 dieselelectric submarine while type 636 kilo is as quiet as an improved s angeles ssn688 class nuclearpowered attack submarine ssn and quieter than either basic russian akulaclass

intent in purchasing kilo class boats could be essentially the same as its intent in purchasing sovremennyclass destroyers as 1970sera sovietdesigned submar ine chinas kilosclass boats are considerably more technologically mode rn complex and capable than chinas obsolescent romeoclass boats this fact plus chinas decision to purchase two type 877s and two type 636s has led some western obs ervers to conclude that china acquired them in large part fo r the purpose of updating its submarine technology base and accelerating its indige nous submarine design and construction efforts under this interpretation for either the type 877 or the type 636 china could keep one boat in port for purposes of studying or reverseengineering its technology while the other could be periodi cally sent to sea to gain proficiency in operating modern dieselelectric submarines as with the sovremennyclass acquisition however articles in the defense trade press have reported th at china may be negotiating with russia to purchase one or more additional kiloclass subs such reports if correct again suggest either that china might be acquiring kilos to significantly improve chinas submarine capabilities in the nearer term or that p rc officials may now have doubts about the ability of chinas naval technological nd industrial base to assimilate modern submarine technologies and produce mode rn indigenous boats quickly enough to meet its longerrun nava l modernization goals227 group of four capable submarines unlike group of two capable surface combatants can by itself easily constitute an operationally effective combat force in operations against large and capable opposing navy submarines unlike most surface ships are designed to operate effectively in combat as individual units without support from other platforms ev one capable well operated submarine can pose significant tacti cal concern for an opposing naval force even one with ample asw assets and training228 in this sense chinas acquisition of kiloclass submarines perhaps more than its purch ase of sovremennyclass destroyers may reflect as much desire to improve chinas naval capabilities in the nearer term as it does desire to provide technologi cal foundation for improving them in the longer term chinas ability to operate china reportedly has experienced difficulty keeping its kilos in

combined to crew the fourth vessel whose performance shows significant improvement additional tr aining is underway but the plan will still not take the kilos below depth of 50m about 164 feet231 an earlier report states that the chinese submarine force has had severe difficulties operating the first project 636 boat that it received last year 1997 because of lack of trained personnel the navy sent only small number of fficers to russia to train on the project 636 boat and intended to fill the rest of the crew with personnel who were proficient on the two less advanced pr oject 877ekm submarines that the plan acquired from russia in 1995 however when the plan received the project 636 boat it discovered that the vessel was significantly different from the earlier class and its project 877ekm crew were not qualified to handle the vessel adding to its difficulties one of the two project 877ekms has been out of operation for more than year because of generator problems232 comparison with western submarines although the basic kiloclass design dates to the 1970s and is referred to as elderly by janes fighting ships the design remains fairly capable one by we stern standards the kilo appears to be comparable to larger western dieselelectric submarines in terms of number of torpedo tubes total number of torpedosized weapons divi ng depth and range and as mentioned earlier the kiloclass design is also quiet by western standards as sovietdesigned submarine the k iloclass design has features intended to give it more ability to withstand attack than standard western submarines the kilo class design has reserve buoyancy of 32 pe rcent much higher figure than for typical uswestern submarines and pressure hull with multiple compartments as result

submarin kilos might be able to remain underwater for few days when lying in wait or operating at low speeds or for as little as 1 to 3 hours when operating at high speeds highspeed operations drain the boats batteries very quickly when traveling longer distances at moderate speeds dieselelectric boats must s norkel periodically making th em vulnerable to detection and tracking when they are transiting to or from operating areas that are more than couple of hundred miles from home port nuclearpowered submarine in contrast has tremendous submerged ndurance at any speed us ssns submerged

rear where th eir sound is masked by the noise of the ships propellers237 second wakehoming torpedo would not be fooled by towed acoustic decoy and the ship might find it difficult to maneuver quickly enough to reduce or eliminate its wake given these considerations us navy fficials might not be able to guarantee 100 percent effectiveness in feating an incoming torpedo some analysts in fact might argue that the chance of defeating torpedo attack would be considerably less than 100 percent if 21inch diameter torpedo detonated against or under the hull of us navy surface combatant the results could be devastating at minimum the ship would be seriously or severe ly damaged and could lose much if not most or all of its combat potential at maximum the keel of th ship could break and the ship would sink quickly if the target were larger ship such as an amphibious ship or an underway replenishment resupply ship the larger si ze of the ship might permit the ship to withstand the attack somewhat better but the damage to the ship would still be significant and the ships ability to continue performing its mission might still be compromised if the target ship were an aircraft carrier an even larger ship with high degree of compartmentalization and perhaps multiplebottom hull designed to provide protection against torpedo attack238 the ship might have some ability to withstand torpedo detonation though its ab ility to maintain flig ht operations would by means be guaranteed detonations from more than one torpedo however could well reduce or eliminate the carrie rs ability to

amount of reserve buoyancy and multiple watertight compartments242 us submarines in c ontrast are singlehulled and have much less reserve buoyancy and possibly fewer water tight compartments cruise missile attack against surface ships chinas four kiloclass boats reportedly are not equipped with antiship cruise missiles janes fighting ships however states that if china orders any additional kilos these boats might possibly come equipped with the ssn27 novator alpha ascm another source cites reports that china may be acquiring ssn27s for its current kilos243 recent press report states that china is negotiating to purchase the 3m54 ascm for its kilos244 this missile is either the ssn27 or closely related missile kilo armed with ssn27s could pose more serious threat to us surface ships than chinas ssn22armed sovrem ennyclass destroyers for two reasons first and perhaps most important the kilo s could be more difficult to detect track and attack than sovremennyclass ship they might thus be more likely to succeed in firing one or more missiles at us na vy ships than sovremennyclass destroyer second the ssn27 is considered at l east as capable as the ssn22 the ss n27 is thought to be derivative of the subsonic sovietrussian ssn21 land attack cruise missile the soviet analogue to tomahawk it has range of possibly 200 kilometers about 108 miles and cruises to the target area at subsonic speeds making it potentially less visible to infrared sensors than the ssn22 special warhead stage then separates from the missile and uses rocket booster to fly to the target at speed of more than mach 2 and at an altitude of only 5 to 7 meters as opposed to 7 to 20 meters for the ssn 22 the warhead reportedly weighs 200 kilograms 440 pounds the ability of kiloclass ship to use the ssn27 effectively however would depend on chinas overthehorizon targeting ability its ability to transmit overthe horizon targeting information to kiloclass ships and the ability of the kilo to receive this information without being det ected as noted in an earliercited passage chinas overthehorizon targeting capability is limited its ability to transmit this information in timely manner to kiloclass boats may be similarly or even more limited and receiving the information could make the kilo vulne rable to detection vulnerability of kiloclass design to attack as discussed above us forces might have difficulty under some ci rcumstances in detecting and tracking wellmaintained proficiently operated kiloc lass submarine particularly if the kilohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs69 is stationary or operating low speed or if acoustic conditions degrade the performance of us sonars us asw forces might have to commit significant asw assets and conduct sustained asw effo rt to detect and maintain reliable track on such kilo if us asw proficiency at the time were degraded due to reduced asw training the difficulty of the task would be compounded kiloclass boats are nevert heless vulnerable to detec tion and attack by us forces as dieselelectric submarine the kiloclass design has limited submerged mobility and us asw forces could explo it this limitation classic strategy is to wait in the general area where the submarine is believed to be until the submarine is forced to surface kiloclass submarines would be particularly vulnerable to detection and attack when leaving port transiting to more distant operating areas which would require periodic use of their snorkels or after firing any of their weapons which creates signifi cant noise they would also be vulnerable if they are operated in ways that compromise their stea lth this could include using periscope or datareceiving antenna or traveling quickly at shallow depth which can induce propeller cavitation significant source of noise although us and western naval officials express concern about kiloclass submarines they also appear confident in their ability to eventually detect and attack it although the kilo as discussed earlier s some builtin features for surviving hit from torpedo attack hit from single torpedo might still compromise its combat capability even if the kilo is still capable of fighting after that hit the damage to the ship could well increase the ships vulnerability to followon attack hits from additional torpedoes would then more certainly eliminate the ships combat capability or sink it entirely us naval forces have had many ears to study the kiloclass design particularly since it is operate d not only by russia but by countries in regions of the world where forwarddeployed us na val forces regularly operate as consequence the us navy probably s developed an extensive understanding of the designs capabilities as well as tactics for detecting tracking and attacking it us weapons that could be used agai nst kiloclass submarines include the submarinelaunched mk 48 heavyweight 21inch diameter torpedo or surface or airlaunched mk 46 mk 50 or mk 54 light weight 1275inch diameter torpedoes potential tactical implications if china can maintain its kilos in good condition and operate them prof iciently then the threat that these boats might pose to us naval forces in crisis or conf lict would like the case with the sovremenny class destroyers appear to depend on the scenario in which the kilos engaged us forces if at the outset of crisis involving china the united states already knows locations of chinas kiloclass boats perhaps through daytoday use of satellite observation of the kilos while in port or c overt tracking by us submarines of the kilos while at sea us naval forces coul d take many of the kinds of preparatory actions discussed earlier in relation to enga ging sovremennyclass ships this could significantly reduce the threat to us na val forces posed by the kilos at the outbreak of hostilities rapid attack by us asw forces could lead to the disablinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs70 245 eight of russias 12 kilos are based in the pacific at rakovaya several of russias nuclearpowered attack submarines are also based in the pacificor destruction of the boats be fore they could fire many r any of their torpedoes or cruise missiles while maximizing the chances of defeating any that are launched if on the other hand the united states at the outset of crisis does not know the location of one or more of the kilos or is not able to maintain reliable track on them then the threat posed by the kilos to us naval forces would likely be greater us naval forces might need to approach potential kilo operating areas more cautiously or perhaps even temporarily avoid them they might also need to increase the scale and intensity of their asw operations ships might need to position themselves to optimize their contribution to the fleets collective asw effort which could reduce their ability to perform other missions as result the time needed for us naval forces to enter and establish control over certain sea areas could increase by hours and perhaps by as much as several days this delay could significantly affect subsequent course of the conflict particularly if it permits chinese military forces to complete other key tasks in the opening phases of their military plan alternatively in the absence of cris is or regional tension china could use kiloclass ship to conduct nowarning attack on us naval forces operating near china perhaps for the kind of political purposes discussed earlier in relation to the scenario of nowarning ssn22 attack such an attack would pose grave danger to us ship that was not on asw alert and if wakehoming torpedo is used stillsignificant danger to us ship that was on asw alert in the case of an unalerted us ship the attack could barring torpedo malfunction have high chance of success following the attack china could claim that it was an accident or case of mistaken identity or even disavow responsibility for it as iran did in the case of mine attacks on some ships in the persian gulf during the iraniraq war circumstances might point strongly to ch ina as the responsible party but china could point out that it is not the only country that operates submarines in the western pacific245 or argue in defiance of any evidence to the contrary that the us ship was damaged by one or more internal expl osions the explanation which the united states told russia it believes to be the most likely for the august 2000 sinking of the russian oscarclass submarine kursk or that it was hit by an errant mine one of the alternative explanations advanced by russian officials for the sinking of the kursk although much attention has been paid in the press to chinas purchase of sovremennyclass ships armed with ssn 22s the kilos with their potential for avoiding detection and their potent torpedoes might represent greater threat to us naval forces particularly in light of the us navy s current torpedodefense capabilities the threat posed by kilos could become even greater if they are armed with the ssn27 cruise missile and chin improves its overt hehorizon targeting capabilities this would permit the kilos to launch attacks at much greater distances increasing their likelihood of being able to launch their weapons before they are attacked or even detected by us forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs71 246 prepared by ronald or ourke and christopher bolkcomchinas kiloclass submarines are by means invulnerable their limited mobility can be used against them and problems in maintaining the ships properly or operating them proficiently could easily increase their chances of being detected and tracked however there are the potential difficulty of detecting and tracking wellmaintained proficientlyoperated kilo as well as the grave danger that torpedo attack would pose to an unalerted us sh ip hence one option for the united states would be to adopt policy if china show s evidence of being able to maintain the ships properly and operate th em proficiently of atte mpting to maintain knowledge of the location of the kilos at all times and of putting all us navy ships deployed to potential kilo operating areas on asw ert when any of the kilos are not known to be in port and their location at sea is not known such policy or something like it may already be in effect integrated operations246 although previous sections of the report assessed chinas air power acquisitions and naval acquisitions parately the operational significance of chinas conventional arms acquis itions will also depend in part on the plas ability to conduct effective joint military ope rations that integrate its air force and navy as well as missile and other assets the plas ability to achieve jointness and integration might be particularly significant in exa mining potential crisis or conflict scenarios situated in the taiwan strait or the south china sea where china might be expected to employ landbased aircra ft navy and other assets in such scenarios operating air and naval assets as single integrated force could permit landbased aircraft to provide overthehorizon targeting data for missilearmed plan ships or help defend such ships against attack by opposing aircraft conversely plan ships deploy ed some distance from shore could provide early warning of opposing aircraft flying toward china which could help chinas landbased air defense systems in countering those aircraft effective integration of aircraft and ship asw operations could also improve chinas efforts to detect and counter opposing submarines as noted earlier pla military exercises to date have displayed little integration between air force and naval as well as missile and army forces as also noted earlier however the complexity and scope of pla military exercises have steadily increased and pla leaders understand the potential warfighting benefits of operating forces in joint integrated manner as result china might be expected to incorporate the concept of joint and integrated operations increasingly into its exercises and may achieve so proficiency in such operations in coming years achieving jointness and integration is more important to some kinds of military operations than others for some military operations such as amphibious assault and closeair support operations jo intness and integration can be critical to success lack of integration between air and other units in such operations could easily prove disastroushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs72 for other military operations such as air defense or cal asw operations achieving integration between air and surface units might not be essential but could still significantly improve effectiveness in these cases lack of integration could reduce the efficiency of chinas military efforts but would not prevent pla forces from achieving some degree of effectiveness for still other military operations achieving jointness and integration might be relatively unimportant these include ballistic missile attacks air intercept and strike operations by landbased aircraft attacks on surface ships by either ships or land based aircraft if the attack ing platforms can locate the target ships without outside assistance offensive mining operations p rovided that friendly ships are informed to stay away from the areas to be mined and submarine operations which traditionally have often been carried out in isolation from other military forces in these cases lack of jointness or in tegration might not significantly effect operational effectiveness potential pla operations of concern to other asian and us military planners fall into all three of these categories fullscale pla attack on and invasion of taiwan for example could require consid erable jointness and integration to have some chance of success other potential military operations of concern such as largescale ballistic missile attack intended to neutralize taiwans defense systems and intimidate taiwan generally or an offensive mining operation intended to intimidate commercial shipping in the area might require little or jointness and integration to have reasonable chance of success thus the importance of chinas ability to achieve joint and integrated military operations as factor to consider in assessing chinas conventi onal arms acquisitions coul d depend on the scenario in question and the kinds of specific poten tial pla operations associated with it in summary china has made some significant qualitative upgrades through foreign arms acquisitions but it remains to be seen how these acquisitions will be expanded and linked to other pla improve ments the operational significance of chinas conventional arms acquisitions w ill also depend on the plas training to eventually conduct effective joint military operations and th scenario in which the systems might be used these developments in pla modernization will bear watchinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30700crs73 appendix acronyms and abbreviations aam airtoair missile aew airborne early warning ascm antiship cruise missile asw antisubmarine warfare atbm
