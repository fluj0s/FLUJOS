stations by commercial entities sa tellite providers to owne rs of home reception satellite dishes for private home viewing this satellite license is form of compulsory licensing which permits the public perfo rmance of television programming without the permission of the copyright owner of the retransmitted works upon payment of the price copyright royalty and compliance with other conditions set by the statute the price or fee for the satellite license is computed by multiplying statutory rate for each retransmitted broadcast signal by the number of signals retransmitted monthly the fee or royalty must be pa id twice year at sixmonth intervals congress originally fixed the royalty ra in 1989 at 12 cents per superstation signal per month and 3 cents per network signal per month pursuant to statutory schedules the rate has been adjusted twice since 1989 by ad hoc threeperson arbitration panels in 1993 the rates were increased to 175 or 14 cents per signal per month for superstations and 6 cents for network signals in the satellite home viewer act of 1994 the arbitra tion panel was directed to t fair market value rates for the programming retransmitted under the satellite license most recently the rate was adjusted by threeperson arbitrati on panel and confirmed by the librarian of congress applying as its benchmark th average fees paid to the 12 most popular basic cable networks under volunt arily negotiated contracts the panel fixed the new rate for the satellite license at 27 cents per signal per month both for superstation and network broadcast signals

cable system might pay under the 111 cable compulsory license for the retransmission of broadcast programming notwithstanding this attempt at equivalency in compulsory licensing fees the 111 cable and 119 satellite licenses are quite different in important respects in cluding the statutory royalty formula and the criteria for rate adjust ments for additional information about the cable and satellite licenses of the copyright act see d schrader television satellite and cable retransmission of broadcast video programming under the copyright acts compulsory licenses crs report 98320 acongress extended the 119 license through december 31 199911 and among other changes amended the statutory criteria governing rate adjustments the 119 license applies to network broadcast signals only for their retransmission to households unserved by the networks nd their affiliate stations unserved households are those that fall into the socalled white areas where overtheair reception of each networks signal is not possible even with the aid of an outdoor antenna the basic theory of the shva is that there is justification for compulsory license to retransmit network signals if the signals are in fact available to household by conventiona l antennas in addition however the shva requires that former cable subscriber must wait 90 days after disconti nuing cable service before that household may r eceive network signals from satellite service provider the unserved household concept does not apply to reception of superstation signals therefore there is waiting period after discontinuance of cable service before householder may elect to receive superstations from satellite service statutory rate adjustment procedure the satellite carrier pays statutory copyright royalty to compensate the copyright owners of the programming re transmitted under the license the royalty is computed by multiplying the existing statutory rate against the satellite services subscriber base per month for each broad cast signal that is retransmitted the 119 rates were originally fixed in 1988 by the congress at 12 cents for superstations and 3 cents for network signals12 in the shva of 1988 and the shva of 1994 congress has established procedure for adjusting the copyright royalty rates paid by satellite carriers for the 119 license first the interests affected by the 119 license are encouraged to reach voluntary agreement on rate adjus tment if voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful the rate is adjusted by an ad hoc carp which is convened and supervised by the librarian of congress w ith the assistance of the copyright office the carp conducts public proceeding receives testimony evidence and arguments from the affected parties and fixes new rate by applying the relevant statutory criteria in the shva of 1994 congress directed the carps to establishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98140crs5 13 17 usc 119 c3d the fair market value standard and other new criteria apparently were intended to replace the rate adjustment criteria of the shva of 1988 the latter act required consideration of the approximate average cost to cable system for the right to secondarily transmit broadcast programming under the 111 license in an apparent technical error however the shva of 1994 di d not strike the rate adjustment criteria of the 1988 act legislation to correct this technical error passed the house on march 18 1997 in the form of hr 672 the senate passed an amended version of the bill on october 30 1997 the house agreed to the senate ame ndment and the measure was enacted as public law 10580 november 13 1997 14 satellite carrier retransmits superstations locally now the panel responded to request from american sky broadcasting wh ich asserted that it intends to retransmit signals locally and has the technical capability to do so until now satellite services have not had the technical ability to retransmit locally within the grade b contours of the broadcast station 15 since the 119 license does not apply to netw ork signals in served households the panel concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdic tion to set rate for local retransmission of network signals 16 this rate was based on analysis of fees paid for 12 popular basic cable networks these programming fees were determined by volunt ary negotiations they are unrelated to the cable compulsory license fees that cable ope rators pay for retransmission of broadcast continued119 licensing fees that most clearly re present the fair market value of the superstation and netw ork retransmissions13 the written decision of the carp adjusting the rate is reviewed by the librarian of congress who shall adopt the determination of the carp unless the librarian finds that the determination is arbitrary or contrary to the applicable provisions of law the librarian has 60 da ys to confirm or reject th carps determination if the librarian rejects the carp s decision he or she

cable networks usa and turner network television which this expert selected as the two most comparable to the programming carried by broadcast stations 18 this rate was based on the programming fees paid by the commercial networks because the commercial networks programming expenditures vastly exceed those of the basic cable networks to which the expert compared them in arriving at an estimated fee the potential for prediction error is huge this estimated ra is subject to an error margin of plus or minus 55 cents 19 these rates were based on parity with the cable compulsory license fees 20 1997 panel decision at 16 the principal rate adjustment criterion under the shva of 1988 was comparability of the 111 and 119 rates 21 fair market valuation has never been criterion in setting the 111 rates the cable rates can be adjusted only to account for inflation or deflation or to compensate for rule change by the federal communications commission 22 1997 panel decision at 1617 23 1997 panel

panel agreed that satellite carriers negotiating in free market woul d be willing to pay at least as much for the continuednetworks18 satellite carriers argued that the ra should be reduced to 9 cents for superstation signals and 3 cents for network signals satellite broadcasting communications association19 fair market value criterion the panel first determined that the shva of 1994 primarily requires it to t fair market value rates for the retransmissions of broadcast programming the panel rejected the argument of the satellite carriers that the 119 rate should be set to achieve parity with the 111 cable compulsory license rates if the panel conclude d congress intended the panel to set rate that achieves parity with cable operators congress would not have modified the 1988 statute20 the panel found that the cable 111 rate s are not fair market value rates21 and therefore cannot be considered under th shva of 1994 it decided that fair market value rate is that which most closely approximates the rate that would be negotiated in free market between willing buyer and willing seller22 the panel rejected the higher rates reque sted by some rightsholders it adopted as its benchmark the 27cent rate ascerta ined by the public broadcasting expert23 her analysis was based on the average voluntary licensing fees paid by all multichannel distributors to 12 popular basic cable networks24 although the panelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98140crs7 24continued rights to retransmit broadcast programming as are paid for these 12 popular basic cable networks 25 1997 panel decision at 31 26 in determining fair market value the pa nel was to consider economic competitive and programming information presented by the par ties including the competitive environment in the retransmission marketplace the economic impact of the fees on rightsholders and satellite carriers and the impact on the tinued availability of retransmissions to the public 27 1997 panel decision at 47 28 1997 panel decision at 40adopted the fees paid to the cable orig ination networks as its benchmark it recognized that this marketplace does not provide perfect valuation solution however those arguing for rate in exce ss of 27 cents could not persuade the panel that the fair market value of retransmitte d broadcast signals exceeds the fair market value of the 12 basic cable networks25 supplementary adjustment criteria after applying the supplementary statutory rate adjustment criteria of 119 c3d26 the panel concluded there was reason to change the benchmark rate for example with respect to the impact on satellite carriers and their subscribers the panel noted that any rate increase tends adversely to impact those who pay the fees it found credible evidence however that the availability of retransmissions to the public would be interrupted and concluded that 27 cent rate would h ave significant adverse impact upon the satellite carriers or the av ailability of secondary tr ansmissions to the public27 applying the fair market value standar d the panel conclude d that there was justification for rate differential betw een superstation and network signals we find credible evidence that retransmitted network stations are worth less than retransmitted superstations28 accordingly the panel fixed the rate for network stations at 27 cents also the librarians decision the librarian of congre ss reviews the panels rate adjustment decision under an arbitrar or contrary to law standard to assist in making his decision the librarian requested and received recommendations from the register of c opyrights the librarian adopted the registers recommendations the regi sters recommendations and her detailed analysis of the panels decision along with final rule and th librarians order were published in the federal register on october 28 1997 62 fed reg 5574259 the decision and order of the librar ian of congress wa s based on two key findings 1 the panel did not act arbitrar ily or contrary to law when it interpreted the fair market value rate adjustment criterion of the shva of 1994 as requiring the panel to set rates that most closely approximate the fees willing buyer would pay willing seller for the retransmissions of broadcast programming permitted byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98140crs8 29 62 fed reg at 55748 30 ibid 31 until now neither the statute nor any rate adjustment body had fixed rate for local retransmissions by satellite services there is an unsettled issue of statutory interpretation as to whether or not such retransmissions ar legal under the 119 license especially in the case of network signals as to served house holds the panel took the position that the act prohibits such retransmissions of network si gnals without the permission of the copyright owner the register of copyrights determined that the act is silent on this issue and therefore the register could not unequivocally say that the panels decision is arbitrary or contrary to law 62 fed reg at 55753 with respect to local retransmission of network signals to unserved households the panel pparently presumed that such retransmissions are permissible but declined to set rate beca use the likely market if any was small the register determined that such retransmissi ons are permissible under the express language of 119 62 fed reg at 55753 32 62 fed reg at 55753the 119 license29 and 2 the panels decision to use cable network license fees as benchmark for establishing the fair market value of section 119 rates was the product of rational decision making and its decision to use the pbsmclaughlin approach was not improper30 accordingly the librarian confirmed the 27cent rate set by the panel for distant superstation and network signals and the zero rate set for local retransmission of superstations if any the librarian set aside the panels conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to set rate for local retransmission of network signals to unserved households31 the librarian adopted the regist er of copyrights recommendation of zero rate for these signals if any ch retransmissions are made because there was conclusive evidence to suggest that locally retransmitted network signals would have greater value than locally retransmitted superstations32 the librarian established january 1 1998 as the effective date for the new 119 license rates under the statute th rates are in effect through december 31 1999 when the satellite license is scheduled to terminate unless it is reauthorized by new

united st ates that could not receive one or more of the three major commercial networks abc cbs and nbc overtheair the shva of 1994 expanded the definition of net work to include the fox network and probably the united paramount and warner brothers networks otherwise the definition of unserved house hold remains the same as in the original shva of 1988 an unserved household is one that cannot receive predicted grade b intensity signal through standard overt heair equipment and if former cable household cable service was terminated more than 90 days before subscribing to satellite service from the inception of the satellite license broadcasters and satellite carriers have not been able to agree on either technical or practical standard for determining what is viewable network signal in voluntary negotiations covering several years the parties have failed to agree on testing or engineering standards some satellite subscribers have paid for signal intensity tests but the costs of the tests exceed the benefit for most subscribers under the satellite license the network or its affiliate can object to retransmission of the network signal on the ground the household is already served by the network generally once the stat us of the household is challenged the satellite distributor terminates the ca rriage of the network signal unless the subscriber gets waiver from the broadcas ter or the subscriber pays for signal intensity test that proves lack of service in the unusual situation however where the satellite carrier does not terminate service and the signal measurement tests are not made broadcasters have filed copyright infringement suits against the satellite carrier recently in abc v primetime 2434 federal district court in north carolina held satellite carrier

act title 17 of the us code while h r 3210 and s 1720 would reform the administrative structure for compulsory license rate adjustments changes are proposed in the statutory criteria for th cable or satellite rate adjustments therefore under these bills th satellite rates woul d continue to be based on the fair market value of the signals retransmitted whereas the cable rates are not based on fair market value the cable rates can be adjusted only for national monetary inflation or deflation or in response to changes in the fccs cable carriage rules the statutory changes related to th last item above would be made by amendment of the communications act of 1934 and through fcc rulemaking satellite providers who retransmit local signals must obtain retransmission consent for network signals or at the option of th network station retransmit subject to the mustcarry rules the retransmissi on consent requirement does not apply to superstations in existence on january 1 1998 or to noncommercial broadcast stations also once the network nonduplication provisi ons are applied to satellite providers network stations not subject to the nondupli cation rules will also be exempt from the retransmission consent requirement the fcc would be directed to commence rulemaking proceedings within 45 days of enactment to adjust its rules cerning retransmission consent mustcarry network nonduplication syndicated exclusivity and sports blackout rules and apply them to satellite retransmission for private home viewing retransmission of local sign als by satellite distributors directtohome satellite levision distribution has until recently been national distribution service technolog ical developments now permit distribution of local signals back to the local market of the broadcast st ation although policies issues may exist about satellite retransmission of all local signals41 legislation is presumably required to authorize retransmission of local signals by satellite carriershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98140crs13 42 the copyright office on january 26 1998 opened notice of inquiry public proceeding concerning retransmission of cal signals by satellite carriers in response to rulemaking petition by satellite distributor echostar communications corporation the copyright office apparently will delay moving forward with its regulatory inquiry pending possible action on legislative proposals relating to local signals 43 note 41 supra 44 the copyright office report on compul sory licensing of broadcast signals hearing before the committee on the judiciar united states senate 105th cong 1st sess 22 1997 45 id at 31 if that is the preferre d copyright policy outcome42 the house subcommittee on courts and intellectual property held hearing on the satellite license issues including unserved households and local signal retransmission on february 4 1998 at that hearing representatives of the satellite industry told the subcommittee that the existing copyright compulsory licenses need to be changed in order to promote the development of technology for localtolocal signal service by satellite distributors43 the copyright office in its august 1997 report to congress on the compulsory licenses had recommended ame ndment of section 119 of the copyright act to allow retransmission of all television broadcast signals within each stations local market44 broadcasters however oppose the copy right office recommendation although they probably would support localto local satellite delivery of broadcast signals given appropriate protections such as must carry syndicated exclusivity and network nonduplication rules45 similar but not identical bills have r ecently been introduced s 2494 and hr 4449 for the purposes of promoting mu ltichannel video prog ramming competition and authorized localtolocal retrans mission of broadcast signals by satellite distributors multichannel video competition act s 2494 the multichannel video competition act of 1998 w ould amend the communications act of 1934 new section 337 would essentially mandate local tolocal retransmission of broadcast signals by directtohome satellite distributors through the must carry provisions of the communications act in recognition of existing technical limitations on satellite carriage of all local signals the bill establishes an interim regime for carriage of local signals and applies the full manda tory carriage provisions of 47 usc 614 to satellite distributors later than january 1 2002 as interim measures within 180 days of enactment the fcc shall adopt regulations to facilitate satellite service provider retransmission of local signals either through satellite or terrestrial means befo re 2002 or fcc adoption of new rules whichever is earlier satellite service provider must carry all local signals eligible for carriage or must compensate the station for noncarriage pursuant to compensation formula developed by the fcchttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98140crs14 the fcc must also complete rulema king proceeding by february 28 1999 in which the fcc sets an objective measure of satisfactory signal obtainable by use of generallyavailable offair reception devices used by the average television viewer this rulemaking is intended to resolve the signal measurement issues affecting retransmission of distant network signals to unserved households prior to february 28 1999 satellite carriers may continue re transmission of distant network signals that were part of their s ubscriber service on july 10 1998 even if the households are located within an area served by an affiliate of the same network s 2494 also essentially subj ects satellite service provide rs to the retransmission consent provisions of section 325 of th communications act title 47 usc 325b would be amended to provide that cable sy stem or other multichannel video programming distributor shall retransmit any broadcast signal except with the express authority of the broadcast station or pursuant to the full mandatory carriage rules of 47 usc 614 or the interim pr ovisions of 47 usc 337 subject however to certain exclusions excluded from the retransmissi on consent requirement are 1 signals of noncomme rcial pbs stations 2 the signal of station outside the local market if the station was superstation on may 1 1991 or if on december 31 1997 the station was network signal retransmitted by satellite carriers to at least 500000 subscribers 3 distant network signal retran smitted to households located in an unserved area or 4 signal retransmitted outside the stations local market by cable operator or multichannel video programming distributor other than satellite carrier if the stati on was superstation on may 1 1991 or the station was network signal on december 31 1997 and its signal was retransmitted by satellite carrier direct to its subscribers the bill eliminates the 90day waiting pe riod for former cable households to subscribe to satellite service an uns erved area would be defined as place that does not receive local network station signal offair in accordance with standards set by the fcc the amendments would take effect january 1 1999 satellite access to local stations hr 4449 the satellite access to local stations act would amend both the copy right act and the communications act to facilitate localtolocal retransmission of broadcast signals by satellite carriers and generally subject the satellite carriers to either must carry or retransmission consent requirements of the communications law the copyright act would be amended by adding new statutory license for retransmission of local signals in new s ection 122 of title 17 usc the statutory license applies to localtolocal retransmi ssions by satellite carrier to the public if the retransmission if permissible under the rules of the fcc nd the satellite carrier makes direct or indirect charge to each subscriber or if the distributor has contracted with satellite carrier to make the retran smissions to the public royalty fee is payable for retransmission of the local signals but the satellite carrierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98140crs15 must file semiannual re ports with the copyright office disclosing signal carriage and the number and addresses of its subscribers the willful or repeated retransmission of local signals without compliance w ith the reporting requirement makes the satellite carrier liable as copyright infringer hr 4449 would also amend the retransmission consent and must carry provisions of the communications act while the overall purpose of these amendments is similar to s 2494 the st atutory approaches are not the same one common amendment is that 47 usc 325b would be revised to provide that cable system or any other multichannel video programming distributor shall retransmit broadcast signal except with the express authority of the station or pursuant to the mandatory carriage provi sions of 47 usc 614 or 47 usc 337 whichever is applicable hr 4449 then differs from s 2494 in that the fcc shall commence retransmission consent rulemaking proceeding within 45 days of the effective date and shall complete the proceeding with in 180 days after the effective date the must carry provisions of hr 4449 ar more detailed than those in s 2494 in general their overall purpose is the same as the must carry amendments in the senate bill each satellite carrier serving subscribers in local market shall offer to carry all local stations subject to retransmission consent except that the must carry provisions do not apply if the satellite carrier does not invoke the new statutory license of 17 usc 122 that is to rephrase the condition satellite carriers cannot enjoy the benefits of the new statutory license in 17 usc 122 to retransmit local signals unless they carry all local signals that the broadcasters want to be carried all local signals shall be available on contiguous channels there shall be compensation for local signal carriage or for channel position except that the station may be required to bear the costs of deliv ering good quality signal to the principal headend of the satellite carrier satellite carrier is not required to carry duplicate network signals the fcc shall issue regulations to implement the must carry provisions within 180 days of the effective date the fcc also acts on complaints from broadcasters within 120 days and has the authority to order the satellite carrier to carry the broadcast signal for at least one year the act would be effective on january 1 1999 conclusion in accordance with statutory procedur revised by the satellite home viewer act of 1994 threeperson panel of ar bitrators conducted public proceeding in 1997 and set new rate for the retransmissi on of distant broadcast signals under the satellite television license the panel applied the new rate adjustment criteria of the 1994 act which directs the panel to tablish 119 satellite li censing fees that most clearly represent the fair market value of the broadcast signals the librarianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98140crs16 of congress confirmed the ne w rate of 27 cents per broadcast signal per month effective january 1 1998 the satellite license rate increase represents cost of doing business by satellite providers the rate affects how much money satellite providers must pay to copyright owners for the use of copyrighted television programming pursuant to the 119 license how must of this cost is passed through to s ubscribers to satellite programming services is business decision that is made by the satellite providers also the additional cost to subscribers is affected by the number of broadcast signals that are included in the satellite programming package the rate determination is under appeal to the court of appeals for the district of columbia since the court denied stay of the librarians order the rate increase is now in effect two pending bills s 1422 and hr 2921 propose delays in the further implementation of the rate increase pending completion of study and report by the federal communications commission bills to reform the compulsory license s of the copyright act s 1720 and hr 3210 and generally to achieve regulatory parity between the satellite carriers and cable operators are also pending s 2494 and hr 4449 would also seek to achieve regulatory parity among multichannel video programming distributors and would authorize satellite carrier retransmission of local signals
