offers the holder federal tax credit instead of interest this report explains the tax credit mechanism and describes the market for the bonds currently there are four types of tcbs qualified zone academy bonds qzabs clean renewable energy bonds crebs gulf tax credit bonds gtcbs and forestry conservation bonds fcbs qzabs which were the first tax credit bonds were introduced as part of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 and were first available in 1998 crebs were created by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 and gtcbs by the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 pl 109135 fcbs were created by the f ood conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110234 each tcb is designated for specific purpose or type of project issuers of qzabs are required to use the proceeds to finance public school partnership programs in economically distressed areas crebs are designated for clean renewable energy projects gtcb proceeds are for the refinancing of outstanding government debt in gu lf coast regions affected by hurricane katrina gtcbs could only be issued in 2006 fcbs are intended to help nonprofits or government entities purchase then conserve forest land all of the tcbs are temporary tax provisions in december 2006 congress extended the qzab program with modifications for 2006 and 2007 several bills have been introduced in the 110 th congress that would extend expand modify or create new tax credit bonds s 2886 would extend qzabs two years through 2009 and would add 400 million in capacity to the creb program hr 6049 which was approved by the house on may 21 2008 would extend qzabs one year expand crebs and create new type of tax credit bond for energy conservation similarly s 3335 would extend qzabs one year authorize 2 billion of new crebs and create energy

and local governments sell bonds to finance public projects and certain qualified private activities most of the bonds issued are taxexempt bonds because the interest payments are not included in the bondholders purchasers federal taxable income naturally interest payments not included in taxable income escape federal income taxation in contrast interest payments from other types of bonds such as corporate bonds are included in bondholders taxable income because of the difference in taxability state and local government taxexempt municipal bonds offer lower pretax interest rate than corporate bonds 1 the federal government is providing subsidy for projects that use taxexempt financing of approximately 20 to 30 of the interest cost on the bonds for example on august 7 2008 the average high grade taxable corporate bond rate was 570 and the average highgrade municipal bond rate was 475 2 the municipal bond rate is about fivesixths of the taxable bond rate considerable subsidy for the bond issuer in contrast tax credit bonds tcbs allow the holder to claim federal tax credit equal to percentage of the bonds par value face value for limited number of years this tax credit percentage is set at the current yield on taxable corporate bonds thus tcbs deliver larger federal subsidy to the issuer than do municipal bonds the subsidy to the issuer is the full 570 instead of the difference between the taxable rate and the lower taxexempt rate of 475 3 with tax credit bonds the issuer does not pay any interest currently there are four types of tax credit bonds with varied authorization periods qualified zone academy bonds qzabs clean renewable energy bonds crebs gulf tax credit bonds gtcbs and forestry conservation bonds fcbs qzabs originally enacted as part of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra 1997 pl 10534 are not permanent though congress has extended the program several times in the 107 th congress the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 pl 107147 extended qzabs through 2003 in the 108th congress pl 108311 extended qzabs through 2005 in the 109th congress the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 extended qzabs through 2007 in the 110th congress s 2886 would extend qzabs through 2009 and hr 6049 which was approved by the house on may 21 2008 would extend qzabs one year expa nd crebs and create new type of tax credit bond for energy conservation qzabs allow qualified issuers to carry forward unused capacity for up to two years thus qzabs could be issued beyond 2007 if unused capacity were carried forward by qualified issuers crebs were created by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 and the gtcbs by the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 pl 109135 the trhca increased the volume cap for crebs from 800 million to 12 billion and extended the authority to issue crebs from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 s 2886 in the 110 th congress would add 400 million to creb volume authorization to issue gtcbs expire d on january 1 2007 fcbs were created by the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110234 1 for ease of exposition the phrase s tate and local taxexempt bonds is replaced by municipal bonds for the

determined by the secretary of the treasury the rate of credit is intended to be set such that the bonds need not be sold at discount for price less than the face value or with interest cost to the issuer the government entity selling the bond is obligated to repay only the principal of the bond the federal government makes payments to the bondholder through the tax credits the tax credits delivered through the bonds are unlike typical tax credits because the credit is included in taxable income as if it were interest income the tax credit bond rate is set with the intent of compensating for the taxability the structure of each tcb is explained briefly in this section g19g28g3g4g156g561 the first tcbs were introduced as part of the qualified zone academy bond qzab program in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 under this program individual public schools through their participating state and local governments use the bond proceeds for school renovation not including new construction equipment teacher training and course materials to qualify for the program the school must also be qualified zone academy g19g158g138g149g146g143g146g142g141g561g28g152g151g142g561g3g140g138g141g142g150g162g561 qualified zone academy is any public school or program within public school that provides and develops educational programs below the postsecondary level if such public school or program as the case may be is designed in cooperation with business to enhance the academic curriculum increase graduation and employment rates and prepare students for the rigors of college and the increasingly complex workforce4 the academy must also be located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community alternatively the academy also qualifies if it is reasonably expected that at least 35 of the students qualify for the free or reduced price school lunch program at least 95 of the bond proceeds must be used for rehabilitating or repairing public school facilities providing equipment developing course materials or training teachers and other school personnel g3g151g151g158g138g149g561g19g28g3g4g561g14g146g150g146g157g561 the limit for new qzab debt is 400 million annually from 1998 through 2007 the limit is allocated to the states based upon their portion of the population below the poverty line states are responsible for the allocation of the available credit to the local governments or qualified zone academies unused credit capacity can be carried forward for up to two years 4 26 usc 1397ed4a the private entity must donate an amount equivalent to 10 of the bond pro ceeds services of employees as volunteer mentors satisfies the 10 private

the maximum term the number of years for which the credit will be paid shall be the term which the secretary estimates will result in the present value of the obligation to repay the principal on the bond being equal to 50 of the face amount of the bond5 specifically the maximum term of the bonds is determined by the prevailing interest rate for municipal debt with maturity of greater than 10 years the maximum term on qzabs issued on august 13 2008 was set at 14 years g22g145g142g561g19g28g3g4g561g22g138g161g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g20g138g157g142g561 since july 1999 the secretary of the treasury establishes national credit rate that is generally intended to allow issuers of qzabs to sell their bonds at par face value without additional interest expense the credit rate published by the us bureau for public debt on the issue sale date is the bondholders annual rate of credit for example the annual tax credit rate was 589 on august 13 2008 the bonds sold on that day would allow the taxpayer to claim federal tax credit in one year equal to 589 multiplied by the face value of the bond thus 100000 bond issued on august 13 2008 would yield tax credit of 5890 for the bondholder one year after the original issue and each following anniversary for the term of the bond however unlike interest on municipal bonds which does not create taxable income stream the credit amount is included in the bond holders gross income 6 the credit is limited to the bondholders current tax liability it is nonrefundable g3g155g139g146g157g155g138g144g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 before the 2006 extension of the qzab program qzabs were not subject to the same arbitrage rules as traditional taxexempt bonds the trhca act of 2006 requires that qzabs follow the same arbitrage limits as traditional taxexempt bonds generally issuers of qzabs must ensure that 95 of the proceeds are spent within five years of issuance g5g20g7g4g156g496g561g9g22g5g4g156g496g561g138g151g141g561g8g5g4g156g561 clean renewable energy bonds crebs are available to electric cooperatives to finance qualified energy production projects which include 1 wind facilities 2 closedloop biomass facilities 3 openloop biomass facilities 4 geothermal or solar energy facilities 5 small irrigation power facilities 6 landfill gas facilities 7 trash combustion facilities 8 refined coal production facilities and 9 certain hydropower facilities the national limit on the bonds which can be issued through 2008 is 12 billion of which maximum of 750 million can be granted to governmental bodies the term and credit rate for crebs are determined in the same manner as qzabs the creb credit is split into four quarterly payments in contrast to the annual qzab credit crebs are also subject to the arbitrage rules that require the issuer to spend 95 of the proceeds within five years of issuance 5 26 usc 1397e the term of qzabs is found by calculating the following log2log 1r the variable r is the discount rate of the average annual interest rate of taxexempt obligations having term of 10 years or more which are issued during the month 6 in special cases some insurance companies may indirectly pay income tax on otherwise tax exempt debt in addition interest paid on private activity bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax

issue these bonds expired on january 1 2007 gtcbs could have been issued by the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama to 1 refund bonds outstanding on august 28 2005 that were issued by the designated states or 2 to make loan to jurisdiction within the designated states to cover the principal interest or premium of debt issued by that jurisdiction unlike the other two types of bonds the maximum maturity was capped at two years the credit rate for the twoyear bonds was set in the same manner as the other tcbs louisiana could issue up to 200 million mississippi 100 million and alabama 50 million forestry conservation bonds fcbs are limited to 500 million to be allocated before may 22 2010 24 months after enactment of pl 110234 once the bonds are issued the proceeds must be spent within three years unique feature of fcbs is the allowance for an allocation amount to be used to offset any taxes due the federal government any allocation amount used to settle outstanding federal tax debts cannot be used for bond issuance qualified issuer is state or any political subdivision or instrumentality thereof or 501c3 organization 7 for purposes of the fcb program qualified forestry conservation purpose must meet the following criteria8 1 some portion of the land acquired must be adjacent to united states forest service land 2 at least half of the land acquired must be transferred to the united states forest service at net cost to the united states and not more than half of the land acquired may either remain with or be conveyed to state 3 all of the land must be subject to native fish habitat conservation plan approved by the united states fish and wildlife service 4 the amount of acreage acquired must be at least 40000 acres

consider using new tcbs investors and other market participants may request that tcb mechanics become more standardized as table 1 exhibits tcbs have generally the same structure though differences increase the cost to taxpayers who invest in the bonds for example qzabs pay credits once per year and the credits are not strippable whereas fcbs the newest tcb offer credits quarterly and allow investors to strip the credits from the principal and sell them 7 sec 15316a of pl 110234 8 sec 15316a of pl 110234 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34629g22g138g161g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g4g152g151

for tcbs is set higher than the municipal bond rate to compensate for the credits taxability generally to attract investors the credit rate should yield return greater than the prevailing municipal bond rate and at least equal to the aftertax rate for corporate bonds of similar maturity and risk consider the following example where we assume an average 475 interest rate on municipal debt investors in the 15 income tax bracket wo uld need credit rate of at least 559 475 divided by 1 015 is 559 to choose tcbs over municipal bonds investors in the 35 bracket would require credit rate on tcbs of 731 475 divided by 1 035 is 731 generally the tcb credit rate would have to exceed the return on municipal bonds and the after tax return on corporate bonds of like term to maturity given an investors tax bracket the summary below describes how potential bond investor would evaluate the attractiveness of tax credit bond relative to two other bond invest ments the choice between tcb and traditional taxexempt municipal bonds is dependent upon the bondholders tax rate when compared to municipal bonds bondholders in the highest tax bracket find the tax credit less attractive than those

buyer the price and yield of bonds is determined by the interaction of supply bond sellers and demand bond buyers bond prices and interest rates determine the yield or rate of return on bonds in all cases the yield on bonds moves in the opposite direction from bond prices if investors believe the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34629g22g138g161g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g4g152g151

interest rates reflect bond prices will rise lowering the yield alternatively if investors believe the expected yield on bonds is too low bond prices will fall raising the yield the market for tcbs is not like the market for traditional taxexempt bonds and corporate bonds in contrast to traditional bonds which are availa ble to almost all investors qzab credit is only available to certain financial institutions the limited number of potential buyers would likely put downward pressure on the demand for qzabs relative to other tcbs in contrast creb gtcb and fcb credits are available to any taxpayer also the federal credit from tcbs cannot be adjusted to reflect the perceived riskiness of individual bond issuers in traditional bond markets issuers with strong credit ratings can offer bonds at lower interest rates whereas issuers with weak credit ratings typically offer higher interest rates to compensate for the higher defa ult risk tcb issuers with relatively weak credit ratings can and have offered supplemental interest payments original issue discounts or bond insurance to investors to compensate for the greater risk some issuers and observers have noted that these additional payments seem contrary to the intent of congress to have the secretary of the treasury set the rate such that tcbs can be issued without discount and without interest cost to the issuer the relatively small annual tcb volume capacity400 million of qzabs per annum 12 billion total of crebs 350 million of gtcbs and 500 million of fcbs compared to 430 billion in 2007 of municipal bondsalso limits the market attractiveness of tcbs investors generally prefer deep secondary markets for assets 9 however the unique nature of the tcb tax credit and the limited volume make it difficult for investors to justify devoting resources necessary to properly evaluate tcbs even with potential weakness in the market for tcbs generally congress has extended qzabs several times and added three new types of tcbs since qzabs were first issued in 199810 analysts in the bond community generally agree that the tax credit mechanism may need further adjustments before tcbs are widely accepted by investors as alternatives to municipal bonds or taxable bonds to date comprehensive study of the tcb programs has been undertaken
