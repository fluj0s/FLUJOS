international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division globalization worker insecurity and policy approaches summary todays global economy or what many call globalization has growing impact on the economic futures of american companies workers and families increasing integration with the world economy makes the us and other economies more productive for most americans this has translated into absolute increases in living standards and real disposable incomes however while the us economy as whole benefits from globalization it is not always winwin situation for all americans rising trade with lowwage developing countries not only increases concerns of job loss but it also leads us workers to fear that employers will lower their wages and benefits in order to compete globalization facilitated by the information technology revolution expands international trade in wider range of services but also subjects an increasing number of us white collar jobs to international competition also globalization may benefit some groups more than others leading some to wonder whether the global economy is structured to help the few or the many the current wave of globalization is supported by three broad trends the first is technology which has sharply reduced the cost of communication and transportation that previously divided markets the second is dramatic increase in the world supply of labor engaged in international trade the third is government policies that have reduced barriers to trade and investment some recent research examines whether these trends are creating new vulnerabilities for workers some of the vulnerabilities for workers are underlined by changing employment patterns caused by increased foreign competition declining wage share of national income and rising earnings inequality these trends in turn have become source of economic insecurity for many americans and may be weakening public support for us engagement with the world economy to bolster public support for an open world economy the conventional wisdom is that the legitimate concerns of those who are losing in the contemporary economic environment need to be addressed to what extent the losers should be compensated and how is matter of considerable congressional and public debate because the relationship between globalization and worker insecurity is complicated and uncertain number of different approaches may be considered if the goal is to bolster public support for us trade policies globalization and an open world economy policies involving adjustment assistance education tax and trade are most commonly proposed there appears to be range of views on the merits of each of these policy approaches and the extent to which they can be designed and implemented in way that would reduce worker insecurity without undermining the benefits of globalization in the view of many economists policies that inhibit the dynamism of labor and capital markets or erect barriers to international trade and investment would not be helpful because technology and trade are critical sources of overall economic growth and increases in the us living

levels much of what americans consume or buy is produced in other countries similarly much of what americans produce is exported abroad1 huge quantities of capital or money flow into and out of the united states every day swamping the value of goods and services that are exchanged2 new technologies and business practices accompany the flows of investment capital growing number of the largest us companies rely on international markets for over 50 of their sales and employ more foreign workers than domestic3 in the process todays global economy or what many call globalization is having growing impact on the economic futures of american companies workers and families4 economic theory holds that more open and integrated world economy provides large scale economic benefits by providing for specialization in production across countries trade enhances the economic output here and abroad and in so doing boost living standards competition from economic integration is seen as making the us economy more efficient and more productive global markets give consumers more choices and help reduce the costs of goods and services thereby keeping inflation in check the institute for international economics has estimated that the integration of the global economy generates an economic gain of between 500 1 exports and imports of goods and services accounted for 292 of us gdp in 2007 up from 92 in 1960 crs calculations based on us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis data 2 by some estimates 2004 survey by central banks daily trading of foreign currencies totals more than 19

ahearn et 3 holstein william j have and havenots of globalization new york times july 8 2007 bu p 4 4 globalization can be defined in various ways but economic globalization refers to the increasing integration of national economies into world trading system globalization involves trade in goods and services sales of assets ie currency stocks bonds and real property as well as the transfer of technology and the international flows migration of labor see crs report rl33944 trade primer qs and as on trade concepts performance and policy by raymond j ahearn et and freiden jeffrey global capitalism its rise and fall in the twentieth century ww norton co 2006 crs2 billion and 1 trillion dollars to the us economy each year5 similarly gains from globalization have been large for many developing countries lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in countries such as china and india6 at the same time greater global economic integration does not always benefit everyone within country it can be accompanied by stress and anxiety as new competitors arise and compete for market share shifts in the structure of production impose costs on workers and business owners in declining sectors and thus create constituency that opposes the process of economic integration opposition may be intensified by perceptions that foreign competitors benefit from unfair trade practices furthermore rising trade with lowwage developing countries may drive down the wages of domestic lowskilled workers even as they benefit from cheap imports and prompt them to wonder whether the united states can continue to compete in vastly changed world economy7 increased economic openness and interdependence may also engender opposition as some groups benefit more than others from globalization leading some to question whether the global economy is structured to help the few or the many8 on balance todays integrated global economy provides substantial net benefits but it also creates substantial economic losses that are borne by specific groups while the us economy as whole benefits some workers firms and communities are made worse off even as new technologies create new jobs and lead to greater productivity and output overall many americans worry that their losses will outweigh their gains and as consequence they and their children will face stagnant or declining standard of living widespread insecurity in turn may affect how members of congress view globalization generally and specifically its most visible manifestation new trade agreements9 moreover popular

httpwwwustreasgovpressreleaseshp95htm 7 since the united states tends to export goods that use skilled labor intensively and to import goods that use lessskilled labor intensively increased trade on balance raises the demand for skilled labor and reduces the demand for lessskilled labor thus it is reasonable to expect that as the united states increases its trade with lowwage and low skilled developing countries wages of lowskilled us workers will face downward pressure an influx of immigrants with less than highschool education by increasing the relative supply of lowskilled labor may further intensify pressures on wages at the bottom end as does technological change 8 bernanke ben s remarks at the federal reserve bank of kansas citys thirtieth annual economic symposium jackson

congress see crs report rl33463 trade negotiations during the 110th congress by ian f fergusson crs report continued crs3 be raising concerns that the process of economic integration will be interrupted or reversed10 some congressional opposition to selective efforts to expand world commerce has been linked in part to public unease over globalizations impact on us economic security and prosperity for example the house democratic leadership stated in 2007 that the benefits of globalization must be expanded to all americans first before congress would consider president bushs request to extend his authority to negotiate new trade agreements that would receive expedited consideration that is trade promotion or fasttrack authority11 to bolster public support for an open world economy conventional wisdom suggests that the legitimate concerns of those who are losing in the contemporary economic environment need to be addressed yet compared to the benefits of globalization us programs geared towards compensating the losers have been quite modest12 to what extent the losers should be compensated and how however is matter of considerable congressional and public debate currently approaches affecting adjustment assistance education tax and trade policies are most commonly being put forth to address these concerns the costs and whether the programs will directly address economic insecurities are some of the questions being raised trends driving global economic integration economic integration of widely separated regions is hardly new phenomenon it has been going on for hundreds of years the current wave of globalization which may be unprecedented in terms of its scale and pace is supported by three broad trends the first is technology which has sharply reduced the cost of communication and transportation that previously divided markets the second is dramatic increase in the world supply of labor engaged in international trade the third is government

economics for example estimates that the lifetime costs of worker displacement to be roughly 50 billion per year but calculates that the united states spends about 2 billion per year to address the costs connected to displacement crs4 research examines whether these trends are combining to create new vulnerabilities for workers13 technology in the current phase of globalization economic distances have shrunk because of the increasing ability to communicate nearly instantaneously at costs that continue to decline these advances in communication have allowed firms to break up the production process into discrete steps and to produce goods in whatever location allows them to minimize costs the information technology revolution also facilitates international trade in wider range of services from call center operations to sophisticated financial legal medical and engineering services in the process more jobs in the us labor force become increasingly vulnerable to international competition14 global labor supply the integration of brazil russia india and china into the world economy over the past two decades means that the greater part of the earths population is now engaged in the global economy the addition of several billion new workers to the global supply of labor an estimated 50 increase combined with the lessening of time and distance by the information technology revolution creates more competitive environment for workers in the united states and other developed countries integrating the economies of poor and rich countries means that workers in rich countries are often now in direct competition with workers in emerging market economies who may on average be paid 90 less yet are still highly educated15 not only does this integration increase fears of job loss among workers in rich countries but it leads to concerns that employers will have to lower their wages and benefits in order to compete16 government policy government policy has played critical role in supporting or at least permitting global economic integration to proceed over the past 60 years government restrictions on trade and capital flows have gradually declined making it easier for

unit labor costs or productivity are also 90 lower in lowwage countries then us workers are not at disadvantage 16 the actual impact of trade from lowwage countries on us wages is controversial some analysts point to the fact that high wage and high standards developed countries still account for over 50 of us imports others point to the fact that the share of us imports accounted for by the two most populous lowwage countries china and india have risen from 18 1985 to 167 in 2006 for more on trends on us trade with developing countries see crs report rl33945 us trade with developing countries trends prospects and policy implications by william h cooper crs5 companies to act as global players by providing an institution in which all members are on roughly equal footing the world trade organization wto greatly facilitated the inclusion of several billion new workers in the global system the wto also has developed rules and disciplines that make it easier for companies to move production to lowwage countries with more businessfriendly regulations in addition agreements such as nafta have provided an additional spur to economic integration between lowwage eg mexican economy and the highwage us economy17 sources of worker insecurity there is little question that by many measures economic growth productivity growth inflation and unemployment the us economy has been strong over the past decade for most americans this has translated into absolute increases in living standards as measured by gains in real consumption and real disposable incomes18 growing engagement with the world economy has been an important factor facilitating robust overall economic performance however these positive developments have coincided with changing employment patterns caused by increased foreign competition declining wage share of national income and rising earnings inequality these trends in turn have become source of economic insecurity for many americans and may be contributing to declining public support for us engagement with the world economy and for additional trade agreements19 job losses and fears much of the public anxiety about the economy and globalization may be related to job losses in the manufacturing sector and fears that many service sector jobs previously thought immune to the pressures of the global economy are being 17 prestowitz clyde three billion

february 6 2007 19 for example an nbc news wall street journal poll found that from december 1999 to march 2007 the share of american public opinion that believes trade agreements have hurt the united states increased by 16 percentage points to 46 while the share of those who thought trade agreements have helped the united states fell by 11 points to just 28 2000 gallup poll found that 56 of respondents saw trade as an opportunity and 36 saw it as threat by 2005 the percentages had shifted to 44 and 49 respectively especially noteworthy is the decline in support from americans with

that growing shares of respondents feel that their children will experience diminished quality of life in coming years cited in speech by janet l yellen president federal reserve bank board of san francisco center for the study of democracy november 6 2006 crs6 outsourced to other countries20 some critics of globalization maintain that americas manufacturing base is being eroded and the longstanding belief that americas economic future rests increasingly in the creation of highpaid service sector jobs is being jeopardized21 while some of these job fears rest on misconceptions others reflect problems that may require new or different policy responses main anxiety about the us manufacturing base stems from sharp drop in us manufacturing employment the total number of manufacturing jobs fell by 23 million from 158 million in november 2001 the trough of the latest recession to 135 million in mid200822 despite growing economy and near fullemployment many of those who lost jobs have found it more difficult to secure new employment or had to accept lower paying jobs in order to become reemployed and most workers who permanently lose jobs in mass layoffs that involve outsourcing offshore or domestic had been employed by manufacturers23 this has been combined with internetfacilitated outsourcing of service jobs that were previously only tangentially involved in the global economy the fact that the work of wide range of us knowledge workers in business services medicine accounting and computer programming can now be done much more cheaply by workers residing in lowerwage countries has led to rising anxiety among white collar workers about international competition at the same time many businesses that are not shedding workers are pulling back or reneging on decadesold commitments to provide health insurance and traditional pensions as they search for ways to stay competitive in todays global economy all of this may be factor in the erosion of traditional sources of security for workers not only job security but the confidence of families in their own health and pension benefits and their childrens college prospects24 other economists maintain that worker fears of deindustrialization and massive offshoring of highpaid jobs are vastly overblown while rising foreign competition together with technical change will reduce employment in sectors of the economy most sensitive to foreign competition they point out that increased competition has 20 outsourcing also known as offshore outsourcing involves the contracting out of service sector activities eg call center operations to businesses outside the united states for background and analysis see crs report rl32292 offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity among us workers by linda levine 21 ibid p 6 for example while us workers have been encouraged to focus on obtaining information technology or it skills to position themselves for highpaying jobs some of these jobs now appear at risk of being exported 22 bureau of labor statistics data from the employment situation june 2008 23 crs report rl32292 offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity of us workers by linda levine and crs report rl30799 unemployment through layoffs what are the underlying reasons by linda levine 24 see edward gresser healthy factories anxious workers progressive policy institute policy report february 2007 found at httpwwwfrbsforgnewsspeeches 20061106html crs7 not been barrier to creating near fullemployment they also maintain that us manufacturing is healthy and strong as reflected by data showing that 1 manufacturing accounted for 117 of the us economy in 2007 in real dollars down from 145 in 2000 and 2 that the us share of world manufacturing output dropped 04 from 214 in 1993 to 210 in 200625 they also emphasize that much of this is being accomplished by heavy investment in robots and computers which allow companies to produce more goods with fewer workers domestic factors such as technological innovation not trade they argue have been the dominant factors in the loss of manufacturing jobs while services offshoring may be growing rapidly most studies find the extent of job losses from services offshoring to be relatively small in the aggregate but concentrated in few industries and occupations26 also most estimates do not take into this account the new jobs that offshoring may create as result of making domestic firms more competitive or jobs that are offshored back to the united states thus offshoring appears not to be on scale so far that is major source of job destruction especially compared to the normal churning of jobs in the us economy27 yet anecdotes of higher skilled and highereducated computer programmers or medical technicians being outsourced combined with estimates by some reputable economists that onequarter of all us jobs could be potentially off shore generates fears over the kind of jobs that will be available for american workers in the future as result many more workers that have not been affected by foreign competition in the past may now feel concern that global competition is potential threat to their job security and future earnings28 rising income inequality second source of anxiety or insecurity may stem from the impact that globalization immigration and automation are having on the bargaining power of workers under this view while most workers have continued to stay employed the pressures of the global marketplace and technological change have forced them to accept modest or wage increases29 as result workers are seen as increasingly isolated in competitive squeeze and not receiving their fair share of the benefits of 25 us department of labor manufacturing output as percent of world manufacturing output 2006 26 see crs report rl32292 op cit pp 79 by linda levine and crs report rl32484 foreign outsourcing economic implications and policy responses by craig k elwell 27 the us labor market reflects an economy that creates and destroys millions of jobs each year in 2005 for example 314 million jobs were created and 293 million were lost for net expansion of 21 million more than half of the jobs losses were voluntary see financial services forum report p 29 28 testimony of alan s blinder princeton university to the joint economic committee will the middle class hold two problems of american labor january 31 2007 29 interestingly europes much higher minimum wage and greater labor protections against layoffs may make the competitive pressures from developing country trade felt more through lower job creation higher unemployment rather than wages see jeffrey freiden op cit p 465 crs8 globalization30 alternatively us companies as seen through the lens of corporate profitability are thriving as never before support for this view may be found in data that indicates little or wage and salary growth for all but the highest earners over the past six years31 one data set of real earnings growth by educational level shows that only 34 of workers those with doctorates and professional graduate degrees in business law and medicine enjoyed any increases in average real money earnings from 20002006 stated differently more than 96 of us workers are in educational groups high school dropout high school graduate some college college graduate and nonprofessional masters for which mean average money earnings fell during this period for college graduates constituting 29 of the workforce this was new experience since real pay increase rose steadily between 1980 and 200032 another indicator that the average worker may not be getting ahead is captured by data linking productivity growth to growth in average real hourly wages while productivity growth or output per worker rose by 71 from 1980 to 2005 the real compensation of nonsupervisory workers comprising 80 of the work force grew by 4 the gap in the manufacturing sector was even greater productivity rose 131 while compensation of nonsupervisors grew only 733 according to this view the strong us productivity growth of the past several years has not been reflected in wage and salary earnings for most american workers whether the rest of the income generated by increased productivity is being captured by the top 1 of income earners by corporate profits or in nonwage compensation such as health benefits of nonproduction workers is major unresolved question one recent study found that 60 of the gap is mostly accounted for by rising nonage benefits such as health insurance using an alternative measurement this study also found that the real incomes of hourly paid workers have not in fact been flat since the early 1980s but have risen by 15 per year34 at the same time while the vast majority of american workers may not have received any boost in their real takehome pay the richest americans were doing quite well the share of national income accounted for by the top 1 of earners as 30 many economists maintain that total compensation which has risen over the period under review is more appropriate measure 31 growing unequal trend of earnings from work started many years ago for example according to irs data the average taxpayer in 1979 in the top 110th of one percent of all wage and salary earners earned about as much as 44 average taxpayers in the bottom half this number had risen to almost 160 by 2001 cited in blinder jec testimony 32 kenneth f scheve and matthew j slaughter new deal for globalization foreign affairs julyaugust 2007 33

robert z lawrence harvard university as cited in clive crook why middle america needs free tradefinancial times june 28 2007 crs9 reported on tax returns reached 218 in 2005 level not seen since 1928 in addition to high labor earnings income growth at the top is being driven by corporate profits which accrue mainly to those with high labor earnings in 2006 corporate profits totaled 124 of national income level not reached in 50 years the corporate profit share of national income is also at or near record levels in japan and europe35 variety of explanations trade with developing countries foreign investment an increase in lowskilled immigration the business cycle and skill based technological change have been put forth to explain these income trends but there is consensus on what weight each factor may have thereby making it difficult to prescribe an approximate policy remedy nor is it known whether these wage trends will persist but it is clear that the market starting over two decades ago turned strongly against less skilled and less educated workers36 policy approaches the relationship between globalization and worker insecurity is complicated and uncertain there are many different components of globalization and it is not easy to discern which components are most linked to rising worker insecurity most research indicates that trade plays only limited role in generating the economic losses or concerns but that it gets most of the blame because of its visibility particularly in the guise of new trade agreements while this report has identified three components of worker insecurity job losses outsourcing fears and downward pressures on wages there easily could be other material and psychological factors that are involved as well as result number of different approaches might be required if ones goal is to maximize american economic well being with the derivative need to bolster public support for globalization and an open global economy approaches involving adjustment assistance education taxes and trade are most commonly put forth in this context adjustment assistance is designed primarily to address job dislocation concerns education is generally considered means to foster skillsets demanded by globalizing economy as well as vehicle for promoting greater equality tax policy is the primary means of affecting changes in income distribution and trade policy tends to affect the kinds of jobs available in an economy but not the overall level of employment additional perspectives are offered at both ends of the political economy spectrum at one end there are those who call for setting higher standards at home higher minimum wage union friendly workplace universal health care stricter corporate governance laws more

the politicization of the uschina trade relationship february 13 2007 p 6 36 alan blinder jec testimony p 2 crs10 industries as way to create high wage jobs37 at another end there are those who call for primary reliance on market forces and deregulation as the best way to promote robust economic growth and vibrant job creation key question may be the extent to which any of these approaches can be designed and implemented in way that would reduce worker insecurity without undermining the benefits of globalization38 in the view of many economists policies that inhibit the dynamism and flexibility of labor and capital markets or raise barriers to international trade and investment would not be helpful because technology and trade are critical sources of overall economic growth and increases in the us standard of living39 what follows is short description of the main policy approaches each section discusses how each policy is intended to affect worker insecurity as well as concerns and criticisms of the approach none of the approaches alone may be an answer to the adjustment problems globalization is posing for workers adjustment assistance the primary government program to compensate us workers who are disadvantaged by trade competition is the trade adjustment assistance taa program40 established in 1962 the program aids workers in certain industries if they can show that increased imports have contributed importantly to loss of jobs workers certified for taa can access variety of benefits including income support job training job search and relocation allowances41 in 2002 the program was reformed and expanded secondary workers became eligible for taa benefits wage insurance or supplement was created for older workers and tax credit was instituted to help tradeaffected workers pay for health insurance42 in fy2007 congress appropriated 572 million for taa income support payments 66 37 galbraith james k why populists need to rethink trade the

the house committee on ways and means june 14 2007 crs11 million for job search and relocation expenses and 235 million for alternative trade adjustment assistance ataa for older workers taa has had some notable successes over the past 30 years particularly in the area of training while number of studies suggest workers trained through taa have had much better success in finding jobs than workers who have not received training many observers maintain that the current program is too narrow too bureaucratic and underfunded to alleviate worker anxiety by itself43 current options for reform being proposed range from small to large while the bush administration has called for streamlining the processes of eligibility determination and assistance implementation many in congress have proposed broadening and expansion of the program in addition to funding increases the most prominent proposals include extension of eligibility to service workers and to workers displaced by trade with nontrade agreement countries number of other proposals call for streamlining the program and integrating it with other programs for displaced workers44 education while taa focuses directly on those workers who appear to be visible losers from globalization some analysts believe that priority needs to be placed on ensuring that all americans are in position to take advantage of globalization support for increasing the skill level of the labor force through more education is based on the notion that higher skilled workers generally earn more have lower unemployment rates and are more likely to be better able to adapt to changing demands of the workplace45 some research also suggests that the higher rate of return to education and skill training is likely the single greatest source of the longterm increase in inequality thus policies that boost national investment in education and training may also help reduce inequality while expanding economic opportunity46 beyond the view that the provision of more education is way for more workers to benefit from globalization there appears to be less consensus on what kind of education to emphasize does the best return on government expenditures come from spending on early childhood development and preschool primary school high school or college how much spending should be devoted to improving math and 43 ibid according to the gao taa data make it difficult to provide complete and credible picture of the programs performance 44 for background and analysis of current congressional proposals see crs report rl34383 trade

careereducation and onthejob training should more money be put into federally subsidized retraining programs particularly for economically disadvantaged populations47 given the increasing globalization of labor markets the question also arises as to what kind of skills to promote those at the top end of todays income distribution have skills that enable them to perform nonroutine kinds of problem solving often within the context of large complex global operations in contrast an increasing share of domestic workers in the middle of the wage spectrum have experienced lower demand because companies can now look all over the world for workers able to perform computer programming tasks communications tasks and similar jobs whose tasks can be routinized but do not require facetoface contact with others in this context it is not selfevident what kind of education or training will foster labor skills that will be immune to outsourcing and global competitive pressures in the future other than that they require facetoface contact for work that does not involve codifiable information48 another consideration in evaluating education as policy approach for dealing with worker insecurity about globalization may be the amount of time for educational changes to achieve the objective one analyst maintains that education as policy approach to worker insecurity could take more than generation to make difference for example it took 60 years to boost the share of college graduates in the work force from 6 at the end of wwii to 33 today and that required major government programs such as the gi bill49 tax policy calls for more progressive form of taxation is one of the more recent policy approaches for lessening resistance to globalization based on view that the current pattern in us income distribution is the most pressing issue to address report funded by the countrys top financial firms argues that some direct form of income redistribution is necessary for ensuring that globalizations benefits are shared more widely accordingly the report calls for making the federal insurance contribution fica social security tax more progressive either by integrating it into the income tax or by adding progressivity into fica itself50 number of tax policies such as the earned income tax credit which supplements the earnings of lowincome workers are already in place to diminish economic inequality most prominently the individual income taxs graduated rate structure is progressive with higher income earners assessed higher tax rates unemployment insurance cushions family income in the face of job loss and illness of course numerous other alternative tax changes are possible if the goal is income 47 yellen janet p 8 48 yellen janet p5 49 shreve kenneth f and matthew jslaughter p5 50 financial services forum report p 45 crs13 redistribution but the question whether government should move in this direction is controversial51 on the one hand most economists maintain that some market determined income differences are needed to create incentives to work invest and take risks without the incentives economic growth would be less robust to the detriment of everyone on the other hand there are signs that rising inequality is intensifying resistance to globalization and some observers maintain that it is important to act quickly if public support for global integration is to be maintained trade policy trade policy can also play role in reducing worker insecurity traditional us policies toward free trade agreements ftas and unfair foreign trade practices in particular have been pointed to by labor activists as contributing to job loss and job insecurity if the united states adopted and successfully implemented more muscular policies in these areas proponents of this view posit that some alleviation of job loss and worker anxiety could materialize bilateral and regional ftas and us ftas with countries such as canada mexico chile and australia have played role in accelerating the integration of global markets through mutual reduction in trade barriers countries entering into an fta accelerate specialization in production and trade by opening new opportunities for the export of us goods and services ftas support jobs associated with increased exports at the same time some us jobs and production shift to fta partners who can offer lower costs of production including labor cost while most labor activists accept that lower labor costs are legitimate source of comparative advantage that many developing countries can offer they challenge any incremental cost advantage that these countries may gain from the suppression of workers rights to deal with concerns raised by unfair worker rights practices bipartisan policy position was agreed to by congressional leadership and the bush administration as outlined in the new trade policy for america us ftas will begin incorporating enforceable labor standards52 thus countries that sign an fta with the united states will have to allow collective bargaining and abolish forced labor among other requirements but it is uncertain how much relief this provision will provide for american workers according to one analyst matter how free developing and newly industrializing country workers are to organize they are still going to be paid very little mexican wages are only 11 of the us level and chinese wages 3 of the us level and trade is likely to continue to pressure us wages53 51 yellen janet p8 52 released march 27 2007 and available on the websites of the house ways and means committee and the united states trade representative ustr 53 krugman paul divided over trade new york times may 14 2007 p 16 crs14 us efforts to eliminate foreign country unfair trade practices could also serve to reduce pressures on workers foreign practices such as subsidies and predatory pricing strategies can encourage shift in investment and employment to their markets thereby displacing us workers from the perspective of us workers whose jobs are displaced by these kinds of foreign government interventions the financial and psychic costs of dislocation are not insignificant accordingly some maintain that forceful us policy towards these practices may be justified in order to prevent unnecessary job displacement and churning in the domestic economy although measures that restrict trade are likely to be opposed by stakeholders who may be disadvantaged by higher import prices54 nevertheless as economists constantly point out the role of trade policy in preserving or creating jobs in the overall economy is very limited while trade policy measures to increase market access for us exports and investments or to impose restrictions on us imports can affect the composition of employment the overall level of employment is determined primarily by fiscal and monetary policies and by business cycles dislocation moreover is an inevitable byproduct of capitalism with or without trade domestic standards finding ways to create more highwage jobs in the united states is another approach that has been proposed for helping those who lose out to the global economy number of different elements are sometimes included in this approach including higher minimum wage universal health care unionfriendly workplace and expanded funding for research and development for new industries particularly in the area of alternative energy55 this approach is based largely on the model of universal unions high minimum wages and strong welfare state benefits provided by norway and sweden these two scandinavian countries which enjoy among the lowest unemployment rates in europe are highly open to international trade and to job churning hiring and firing in their economies in the view of one proponent the key to their success is high wages firms are not free to compete by undercutting the union rate but must try to keep productivity high if they are to survive56 the premise of this high standards job creation approach is that the foundation of strong american middle class rests with laws regulations and standards developed at home instead of worrying about what impact trade with lowwage developing countries has on us wages this approach maintains that highwages domestic economy will have favorable impact on trade the big problem is simply that unions laws regulations and standards have been undercut by conservative 54 drezner daniel w council on foreign relations us trade strategy free versus fair 2006

ability of companies to invest in capital and technology to generate high labor productivity to pay for the wages free markets and limited government in stark contrast to the domestic standards job creation approach this approach touts the principles of free enterprise open markets and limited government as the best way to achieve economic prosperity and security for all americans the basic idea of this approach is that individuals are best helped not by government intervention but by making their own choices in free marketplace58 under this view todays global economy provides unprecedented opportunities for the united states to derive largescale economic benefits free trade policies are seen as creating higherpaying jobs for growing number of americans working in exportoriented industries high corporate tax rates relatively high minimum wage domestic subsidies and weak protections of property rights are viewed as the real threats to american jobs59 when it comes to policies for alleviating worker anxiety most supporters of this school of thought oppose government programs that redistribute income or protect workers from market forces rather many supporters of this approach urge focus on removing barriers to job creation as well as various forms of retraining and relocation aids to help workers find new jobs in growing economy 57 ibid 58 griswold daniel free
