country and the maoists ended with the king relinquishing power to the democrats in april 2006 after large scale popular demonstrations against him king gyanendras inability to subdue the maoist insurgency and his repression of prodemocratic elements in the country undermined his legitimacy and led to his fall from power the united states sought to assist the government of nepal in its struggle against the maoist armed insurgency and has promoted the democr atic development of nepal it has also sought to promote stability in nepal to keep it from becoming destabilizing element in the region this shift of power from monarchy to democracy was followed in november 2006 by peace agreement between the maoi sts and the new government which led to the laying down of arms parliament that includes maoists and the scheduling of elections for constituent assembly the constituent assembly is to address the question of whether the king is to have place in the future government of nepal and if so to what extent the constituent assembly is also expected to act on calls for nepal to become republic and redraw constituencies to more equitably represent the nepali people

following democratization movement it became parliamentary democracy under constitutional monarch although this led to process of economic restructuring and market liberalization the countrys economic growth and reform effort was unde rcut by political instability and years of increasingly dire internal security challenges brought on by the civil war with the maoists compounding the countrys difficu lties was the june 2001 tragedy in which ten members of the royal family including king birendra were killed in an assassinationsuicide re portedly carried out by crown prince dipendra nepal has long way to go before its democratic gains can be effectively consolidated the need to more fully integrate the maoists into the political process and ensure that they or any splinter groups do not resort to the force of arms or coercion in the leadup to the constituent assembly elections remains key challenge in addition mounting political tension over madhesi calls for greater representation in the political process will demand attention the madhesi s are an indigenous ethnic group that inhabit the lowlands of nepa l who feel they have not been fairly represented some madhe

the conflict with the maoists was not achievable and that concerted effort by the king and the democrats was needed to establish unified front to defeat the maoists21 when the king assumed power he

with the people was weakened due to the circumstances under which he assumed the throne the way he seized direct rule and due to poor popular perceptions of his prince paras shah24 maoist reaction from february 1327 2005 the maoists reacted to the kings actions by blockading major highwa ys linking the countrys 75 districts as well as international road links to india and china25 this led to clashes between maoists and the rna and reportedly brought trade by road to standstill the army organized armed convoys which allowed limited trade to continue26 the maoists had earlier cut off land

minister agreed to accept the verdict they emphasized the difficulty of holding free and fair elections two years ahead of sc hedule when much of the country was under either rebel or army control32 meanwhile these events effectively split the nepali congress into two factions first the nepali congress party nc led by former prime minister koirala expelled deuba from the party for three ears for his unilateral actions then in midjune prime minister uba called an nc conven tion that overturned his expulsion and elected him rather than ko irala as nc president supporters of koirala however argued that the nc c onvention led by deuba who was an expelled party member at the time was invalid in september nepals election commission ruled that koirala was the president of the nc and
