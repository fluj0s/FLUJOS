the partys leaders announced that they would reorganize rather than disband the party in the face of its poor showingas the dpp in the past has been associ ated with proindependence views the election results also are likely to disturb beijing which still claims that taiwan is breakaway province belong to the peoples republic of china prc1 next steps coa lition governance taiwans december elections signal the start of new fluid and uncertain period of political realignment for taipei that makes policy predictions difficult some observers for instance point out that party affiliation is not the only motivating criteria in taiwans political culture which also is heavily influenced by personal relationships generational divisions educational and institutional affiliations and other motivating factors more will be known as the new gislature the legisl ative yuan continues through its first year which began in februa ry 2002 observers will be watching how the taiwan government and the new legislature handle number of key political issues selection of the legislatures president the presidentspeaker of taiwans legislature is elected by majority of the body s members in previous legislatures the post was easily won by member of the kmt which had legislative majority as there now is legislative majority the question of who would be elected to this post became an early topic of political discussion one vi ew was that the post should go to member of the dpp since it is now the largest party in the legislature but kmt members wanted the current holder of the position kmt member wang jinpyng to remain in the post ultimately wang the early fr ontrunner was elected as the new assemblys speaker largely because of dpp decision to support his candidacy in exchange for kmt backing for the dpps own candidate for deputy sp eaker but in subsequent kmtdpp legislative showdown the dpp candidate lost and kmt candi date chiang pinkung was elected deputy speaker of taiwans legislature leaving the top two legislative spots in the hands of the kmt minority pangreenpanblue combinations taiwan news reports leading up to the elections often linked together parties that shared similar interests referring to the kmt the pfp and the new party2 as the panblue alliance and to the dpp and tsu as the pangreen alliance while this terminolog is convenience formal party alliances exist and so it is unclear how the new legislature will perform with its diverse party memberships given its disastrous losse s the kmt faces significant difficulties in recovering semblance of its former political standing absent panblue coalition arrangement most likely with the pfp which did astonishingly well in its first legislative outing this december if such an alliance is formalized this would give the kmtpfp an effective voting bloc of 114 votes but pfp leader james soongs departure from the kmt in 2000 was not without rancor also he is popular in his own right and is thought to have presidential ambitions fo r 2004 some believe he may have calculated that his and his partys future interests will be be tter served without formal alliance with the tottering kmt even so on decembe r 6 2001 kmt chairman lien chan and pfphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21093crs3 chairman james soong announced that they would informally cooperate in policy coordination mechanism to counter balance administration initiatives while it controls the presidency the d pp still did not emerge from the december elections with legislative majority if as some have predicted the dpp establishes formal pangreen coalition w ith the tsu party this bloc would still not be enough to exercise consistent legislative control some have suggested that the prospects for further kmt defections to other more robust parties coul d strengthen president chens hand and ultimately give him an effective voting majority but the proindependence views and rhetoric of former president lee tenghui founder of the tsu party and one of the strongest proponents of taiwans inte rests may be viewed as liab ility by many moderates including some in the dpp who prefer to avoid antagonizing beijing prospects for nationa l stabilization alliance in november 2001 as taiwan news reports were proj ecting that single party would win legislative majority in the december elections president chen shuibian proposed forming crossparty alliance for national stability or national stabilization alliance opposition parties criticized the plan even before the elections saying it was an election gambit designed to shield the dpp from blame for economic probl ems and political instability on december 6 2001 both the kmt and the pfp announced form ally that they would not participate in an alliance as proposed by president chen and the president announced on february 22 that he was shelving the proposal because of opposition still the prospects for some form of formal coalition remain viable and could prompt some unexpected developments in taiwans political processes government reform on december 7 2001 the dpp announced plan for reorganizing and reforming taiwans legi slative structure over the coming year the dpps proposal included changes in election ru reduction by 50 in the size of the legislature and new laws to limit conflicts of interest since legislative reform has also been endorsed in the past by the pfp the ts u and some in the kmt partly in response to polls showing widespread public dissatisfaction with the legislatures performance the support for some type of reform seem s broad in addition proposals for broader government reform reducing the number of taiwan government branches from 5 to 3 for instance have been debated increas ingly in the past in meeting of the government reform committee on may 5 2002 pr esident chen further discussed his political reform plans including electoral reforms reduction of the legislative yuan to 150 legislators and extension of legislative terms to four years ultimately any reform plan will have to be approved by the legislature background to political liberalization in taiwan taiwans december 2001 elections are only the latest milestone in process of political transformation that began in the mid 1980s during the tenure of president chiang chingkuo prior to this the government on taiwan was dominated by the only permitted political party the nationalist party also known as the kuomintang kmt founded by sun yatsen in 1912 the remnants of the kmtled republic of china roc government had fled from mainland china to taiwan in october 1949 after defeat by communist forces for the next 37 years the kmt government on taiwan claimed that it remained the sole legitimate government of all china and that the fledgling communist government of the peoples republic of china prc in beijing was not credible thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21093crs4 prc government insisted on its own legitimacy and claimed taiwan was breakaway province that beijing was committed to reunify ing one day by force if necessary still officially at war with the communists during these years the kmt government ruled taiwan using martial law and other draconian mechanisms it pursued policies of strong national defense against the ma inland and highly successful program of exportoriented economic growth it tolerated little open political dissent and allowed opposition parties elections were held fundamental factor in the kmt policy rationale was that all this was temporary justifiable by wartime status and that normality could resume once the military c ould retake the mainland this situation began to change for taiwan in the 1970s when the united states and most developed countries blished official relations w ith the prc and broke official ties with taiwan taiwan lost the china seat in the and in other international bodies setbacks that challenged major source of the political legitimacy of the nationalist regime it became harder for kmt leaders to argue that people on taiwan should accept an elaborate central government administration that included majority of representatives who were elected on mainland china prior to the communist victory there in 1949 kmt leaders came under increasing pressure to ope n up positions in the government to more taiwanese the 85 of the islands populati on whose roots go back to taiwan prior to the influx of two million mainlanders fleeing from communist chinese forces in 1984 president chiang chingkuo named native taiwanese lee tenghui as his vice president in september 1986 politi cal activists founded taiwans first formal opposition party the democratic progressive party dpp ma rtial law was ended in july 1987 following president chiangs death in january 1988 president lee tenghui reaffirmed commitment to reform that w ould legalize opposition par ties and restructure parliamentary bodies in 1991 president lee decl ared an end to the state of civil war with the prc and the associated temporary provisions that had given nationalist leaders emergency powers for decades to deal with di ssent and appoint public officials members of legislative bodies elected in th mainland over 40 ears earlier retired in elections held since then the kmt s incrementally lost ground to the dpp and other oppos ition parties in presidentia l race on march 23 1996 the first time taiwan residents ever were able to vote for president kmt candidate lee tenghui was elected with 539 of the vote while the dpp candidate received 211 and two conservative independents 149 and 99 respectively in islandwide elections for 23 mayors and magistrates on n ovember 29 1997 the dpp for the first time outpolled the nationalists in the popular vote 434 to 42 the results left dpp leaders in charge of local government for 72 of taiwans pe ople while kmt leaders were in charge of only 22 in taiwans second presidential election on march 18 2000 the kmt received nearfatal blow when its candidate the lacklu ster incumbent vicepresident lien chan was soundly defeated in threeway race the stunning loss ended the partys unbroken 50year tenure in power the winning candi date and current taiwan president dpp member chen shuibian won with 39 of the popular vote while an independenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21093crs5 3 after running as an independent in the presidential race the popular soong once kmt member and number of kmt defectors formed new political party the people first party 4 in june 1995 yielding to heavy congressional pr essure president clint on issued lee visa to travel to the united states for his college reunion the visit was protested vigorously by beijing and contributed to sinous military tensions in the taiwan strait later that year and in 1996 5 former president lee once the standardbearer of the kmt was expelled by the party challenger james soong ran cl ose second with 365 of the vote3 vicepresident lien chan ran distant third garnering only 23 of the vote still when president chen took office on may 20 2000 the kmt retained sizeab majority in the legislature so that chen was unable to gain much legisl ative support for his policy initiatives taiwan politics and taiwanprc relations since the beginning of political pluralizati on attitudes toward what is often referred to as the taiwan question the relationship of taiwan to the prc have been key factors in shaping taiwans domestic political environment on one side were those who favored the eventual reunification of ta iwan with mainland china albeit under democratic government having come from the mainland originally the kmt remained strongly associated with this view the main alternative view was that taiwan should reject any notion of reunifying with the p rc and instead declare itself an independent country despite beijings threat to use force in such situation support for an independent taiwan was written into early political platforms of the taiwanese dominated dpp the proindependence stand served as useful tool in setting the party apart from the kmt and in garnering broader political support but in the 1990s faced with his partys eroding support base kmt president lee earned beijings unrelenting contempt with his efforts to exploit the gray areas between these positions in 1995 for instance lee said that the prc and taiwan were governed by two governments and he proposed that each side enter international organizations on an equal footing lee also initiated what came to be known as vacation diplomacy traveling to countries with which taiwan had official relations ostensibly as private citizen not an elected official4 on july 9 1999 lee said ties between taiwan and china should be considered on special statetostate basi s remark seen by many as the most direct challenge yet concerning beijings claim to sovereignty over taiwan beijing objected strenuously to such st atements and repeated ly threatened the use of force against taiwan if the gove rnment there declared its independence the landmark election of dpp candidate as presiden t in march 2000 appeared to raise the stakes concerning the taiwan question settin g the stage for chain of dramatic developments in taiwans pol itical landscape on june 16 2001 former president lee made joint appearance with president chen shuibian and urged his own followers to support chen observers speculate d that the joint appearance meant that lee was forming political alliance with chen and the dpp subsequently on july 24 2001 president lee and some kmt members closel associated with him announced they were forming new political party the taiwan solidarity union tsu5 this damaged the fragile kmt party still more and sparked heated debate in taiwan over the implications of the new party for taiwans loomin g legislative elections on december 1 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21093crs6 ultimately the kmt lost heavily in the d ecember elections with votes being siphoned away by the surprisingly strong showings of the dpp the tsu which favors separate identity for taiwan and the pfp which like the kmt adheres more to the reunification view policy implications the december 2001 elections have ushered in new political environment in taiwan unseen before first the results of the 2000 presidential and the 2001 legislative elections may spell the beginning of the end for the once venerable kmt despite the credit it deserves for taiwans astounding past gr owth and economic success the kmt today is identified as fairly corrupt oldstyle part out of touch with public sentiment without credible vision for sinotaiwan relations headed by an uncharismatic leader and with noncompetitive campaign strategies the di sintegration of the kmt would mean the disappearance of the historical political link between the taiwan government and the chinese communist party in beijing link that other political party in taiwan has second the dpp has been considerably successful politically in the last two elections suggesting that public sentiment and momentum are increasingly behind the party and its platform the kmt and pfp will have to find ways to acknowledge and respond to these public sentiments while s till differentiating themselves as opposition parties thus for the next two and half years each legislative vote on president chens policy initiatives is likely to involve political compromise and dealmaking if handful of kmt and pfp members are willing to suppor t key dpp initiatives they stand to gain significant leverage in the political process if not the result could be continuing legislative stalemate third based on the positions of the various parties on the taiwan question the december election results appear to reinforce polling data suggesting that the majority of taiwans electorate favors the status quo rather than reunifi cation or independence the proreunification new party all but disappeared in the december elections the kmt which since its loss of the presidency had adopted the unusual stra tegy of independently holding discussions with prc officials did not appear to be well served by this approach and again lost heavily although the dpp is still associated with proindependence views as party since his election as president chen shuibian has backed away from those views and tried to distance his dpp government from the more radical elements of his party some suggest that it is this moderation of chens and the dpps views that helped contribute to the partys strongerthanexpected showing in the december elections finally taiwans december election results pose another thorny problem for be ijing in its relations with taiwan prc leaders already viewed the dpp with deep suspicion because of its past association with proi ndependence sentiments prior to the march 2000 presidential election senior prc leaders had warned taiwan voters not to vote for dpp candidate chen strategy later seen to have backfired for the december 2001 elections beijing ma intained very low profile prior to the election again obviously to avail moreover since 2000 p rc leaders have refused to entertain the notion of resuming crossstrait talks with pr esident chen despite number of overtures he is seen to have made the seeming inexorability of political trends in taiwan have led some to suggest that the prc may be read to embark on reassessment of its taiwan strategy
