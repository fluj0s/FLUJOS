of information bruce k mulock specialist in business and government government and finance division summary this report seeks to respond to inquiries from congressional staff who request information about major legislation affecting small business more specifically staffers often ask crs to furnish list of bills of interest to small firms and their owners for reasons discussed below including conceptual problems related to constructing such list it seems unwise and inadvisable to do so there are host of resources including numerous crs reports dealing with issues important to small business this report considers some of the general subject areas that tend to be of particular significance to smaller firms and suggests approaches member and committee staff may wish to use in deciding which small businessrelated legislation is of consequence this report will be updated should circumstances warrant it which legislation is important to small business small business is not precise economic term and single definition commands consensus but even using the most narrow definitions there are in excess of 6 million of them operating in the united states1 while they frequently share common concerns about legislative issues under consideration by congress it is not too much of stretch to say each business has its own views and priorities many small businesses have employees indeed the sole proprietorship an organization owned and usually operated by single individual is by far the most common form of private business ownership relatively few of the nearly 18 million sole 1 how many small businesses are there is the united states single answer suffices by the broadest measure there are about 25 million this is the number of business tax returns filed with the internal revenue service irs in 1999 an estimated 248 million nonfarm business tax returns were filed for 53 million corporations including about 16000 large firmsthose with 500 or more employees 18 million partnerships and 177 million sole proprietorships for detailed statistical information go to the sbas office of advocacy website httpwwwsbagovadvo congressional research service the library of congress crs2 proprietorships are much interested in legislation having to do with minimum wages pension funds or group health insurance on the other hand most of these issues would be of considerable interest to many or most of the nations nearly 5 million small corporations and much tax legislation and many bills concerned with banking and other financialrelated issues are of widespread interest to businesses of all sizes firms in different industries often have specialized legislative interests whether an enterprise is engaged in manufacturing services retail trade etc would almost surely determine the bills to be included in list major small businessrelated legislation for all these reasons and more any list would have to be considered arbitrary furthermore it is prudent to keep in mind that legislation which often does not appear to be small businessrelated will in reality have more of an effect on more small businesses than many bills specifically tailored to assist small firms legislative decisions relating to the hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending for highways and national defense to name two areas have huge consequences for small business nevertheless it is understandable that from timetotime congressional staff find it necessary to seek information and analysis of certain bills that have relevance to particular segments of the small business community or to compile lists of small businessrelated legislation so that crs may best respond to those requests seeking information and analysis it is suggested congressional staff endeavor to be specific and focused and to the extent possible indicate the intended purpose of the request with regard to compiling lists congressional staff will find the world wide web has greatly simplified such task useful websites abound key internet resources perhaps the best starting points are the house small business committee httpwwwhousegovsmbiz and the senate small business committee
