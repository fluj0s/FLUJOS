3036 summary this report examines six studies that project the costs of s 2191 s 3036 to 2030 or 2050 it is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030 much less beyond the already tenuous assumption that regu latory standards w ill remain constant becomes more unrealistic and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled longterm cost projections are at best speculative and should be viewed with attentive skepticism despite models inability to predict the future cases examined here do provide insights on the costs and benefits of s 2191 first the ultimate cost of s 2191 wo uld be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill the potential for technology to reduce s 2191s costs is not fully analyzed by any of the cases nor can it be technology development is not sufficiently understood currently for models to replicate with confidence likewise it is difficult to determine if available incentives are directed in an optimal manner the cases suggest that s 2191s carbon capture and storage ccs bonus allowances would encourage deployment of ccs accelerating development by 510 years second considerable amount of lowcarbon generating capacity will have to be built under s 2191 in order to meet the reducti on requirement how much capacity will be necessary depends on ne w and replacement capacity needs along with consumer demand response to rising prices and incentives contained in s 2191 third offsets could be valuable tool not only to potentially reduce costs but also to buy time to permit further development of new more efficient technologies cost could be lowered further by greater availability of offsets and international credits and with broader definition of eligible international credits fourth the carbon market efficiency board could have an important effect on the cost of s 2191 through its power to extend the availability of offsets and international credits in this sense the boards powers could mesh with the previous insight about the potential effect of offsets on the bills overall costs fifth the low carbon fuel standard could significantly raise fuel prices and limit supply the effects will depend on what fuels are included the emissions reductions achieved by altern atives and the ability to produce those alternatives finally s 2191s clima terelated benef it is best considered in global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort the united states and other developed countries agreed both to re duce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases ghgs and to take the lead in reducing ghgs when they ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc this context raises two issues for s 2191 1 whether s 2191s ghg program would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become mo re likely and 2 whether s 2191s reductions meet us commitments under the unfccchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489contents overview of the major provisions of s 2191 s 3036 3 r l i r v

in this report are published as presentations with limited documentation making comparative analysis difficult each presentation has selected features or impacts it is particularly interested in highlighting the more comprehens ive analyses are the work by epa eia and mit in order to increase the comparability of the various cases examined here crs has converted all publicly avail able data presented by the cases to 2005 dollars where appropriate and interpolated missing data where possible likewise where studies have stated they used specific projections as base case such as eias annual energy ou tlook 2007 or preliminary 2008 projections crs has assumed those assumptions have not been altered except as specifically stated by the study this analysis cons iders the bill as orde red reported by the senate committee on environment and public works incorporating the proposed deficit reduction amendment s 3036 is identical to that version including the deficit amendment other pr oposed amendments are likely if the bill moves to the floor and these amendments if adopted coul d affect the costs and benefits of the overall bill overview of the major provisions of s 2191 s 3036 s 2191 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 was introduced october 18 2007 by senator lieberman on december 5 2007 the senate committee on environment and public works ordered reported an amended version of the bill that would establish mandatory capandtrade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from most sectors of the economy11 as ordered reported s 2191s emissions cap is estimated by its sponsors to require 71 reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 from covered entities estimated by th sponsors to account for 87 of total us greenhouse gas emissions overall the sponsors estimate that s 2191 would reduce total us greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66 from 2005 levels by 2050 s 2191 would establish an absolute cap on the emissions from covered sectors and would allow trading of emissions permits allowances among covered andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs4 12 see common terms box for definitions for more detailed definitions see crs report rl33846 13 in addition to allowances given at cost to covered sectors the bill also allocates allowances to states and tribes for various policy objectives to local energy distribution companies to reduce costs to low and middleincome energy consumers to the us department of agriculture to fund sequestrati on projects and other purposes noncovered entities must sell their allowances for fair mark et value within one year of receipt and use the proceeds from those sales for specified purposes 14 for more detailed description of the allocation of allowances and auction revenues under s 2191 see crs general distribution memo allocations of carbon allowances and auctions under s 2191 as ordered reported by the senate committee on environment and public works dated may 13 2008noncovered entities12 the bill achieves its broad coverage through an upstream compliance mandate on petroleum natural gas and fluorinated gas producers and importers and downstream mandate on coal consumers such as electric generators specifically the bill w ould limit greenhouse gas emissions from all petroleum producersimporters all natural gas processors all facilities that use more than 5000 tons of coal per year and tities that produce or import more than 10000 tons annually carbon dioxide equivalent of fluorinated gases and other greenhouse gases s 2191 does not have safety valve an alternative compliance option that permits covered entities to pay an excess emissions fee instead of reducing emissions instead the bill creates carbon market efficiency board with authority to temporarily adjust the availability of allowances through borrowing and other techniques however it is zerosum game allowances borrowed must be repaid so the emissions cap is maintained the bill limits the availability of domestic offsets to 15 of the allowance requirement with allowances bought in an eligible international allowance market also limited to 15 both percentages may be increased by the carbon market efficiency board if market conditions suggest such action the bill would permit banking of allowances for each year 2012 through 2050 the bill specifies the total number of allowances available then explicitly states the percentage of those allowances that will go to covered and noncovered sectors13 as well as the share that will be auctioned see table 1 over time an increasing share of the allowances are auctioned while the allowances to covered sectors decrease to zero auction proceeds are allocated for various purposes including technology development and deployment transition assistance ad aptation and progra m administration14 see table 2 under proposed amendment to make the bill reve nue neutral percentage of allowances starting at 61 increasing to 1599 would be auctioned offthetop for deficit reduction defic it reduction fund after the deficit reduction allowances are allocated the rest of the allowances remainder allowances are allocated according to th bill as reported for example in 2012 61 of the total number of allowances are auctioned for deficit reduction and an additional 215 of the remainder allo wances are auctioned for program management technology deployment adaptation and other purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs5 common terms allowance limited authorization by the government to emit 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent lthough used generically an allowance is technically different from credit credit represents ton of pollutant that an entity has reduced in excess of its legal requirement however the terms tend to be used interchangeably along with others such as permits auctions auctions can be used in marketbased pollution control schemes to allocate some or all of the allowances auc tions may be used to 1 ensure the liquidity of the credit trading program andor 2 raise potentially considerable revenues for various related or unrelated purposes banking the limited ability to save allowa nces for the future and shift the reduction requirement across time capandtrade program an emissions reduction program with two key elements 1 an absolute limit cap on the emissions allowed by covered tities and 2 the ability to buy and sell trade those allowances among covered and noncovered entities coverage coverage is the breadth of economic sectors covered by particular greenhouse gas reduction program as well as the breadth of entities within sectors emissions cap mandated limit on how much pollutant or greenhouse gases an affected entity can release to the atmosphere caps can be either an absolute cap where the amount is specified in terms of tons of emissions on an annual basis or ratebased cap where the amount of emissi ons produced per unit of output such as electricity is specified but not the absolute amount releas ed caps may be imposed on an entity sector or economywide basis greenhouse gases the six gases recognized under the united nations framework convention on climate chan ge are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o sulfur hexafluoride sf6 hydrofluorocarbons h fc and perfluorocarbons pfc leakage the shift in greenhouse gas ghg emissions from an area subject to regulation eg capandtrade program to an unregulated area so reduction benefits are not obtained this would happen for exam ple if ghg emitting industry moved from country with an emissions cap to country without cap offsets emission credits achieved by activities not directly related to the emissions of an affected source examples of offs ets would include forestry and agricultural activities that absorb carbon dioxide and reductions achieved by entities that are not regulated by greenhouse gas control program revenue recycling how program disposes of revenues from auctions penalties andor taxes revenue recycling can have significant effect on the overall cost of the program to the economy sequestration sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide from emission streams or from the atmosphere and th storing it in such way as to prevent its release to the atmospherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs6 15 for further discussion of title vi see jeanne grimmett and larry parker

memorandum mar ch 27 2008 available from the authors 16 for more information on carbon sequestration see crs report rl33801 carbon capture and sequestration ccs by peter folgerin addition to the capandtrade progra m s 2191 has other key provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions title vi imposes an internati onal reserve allowance requirement on certain covered impor ted goods as prerequisite for entry into the country15 unlike importers of covered fuels that create greenhouse gases when used which are directly controlled as covered facilities under s 2191 title vi w ould affect certain bulk goods manufactured in processes that generate greenhouse gases eg iron paper etc that would not be allowed into the country if the allowance requirement were not met the amount and allocation of international reserve allowances would be determined by epa and separate allowance tradin g system could be established international reserve allowances could not be used for domestic compliance title v iii on car bon sequestration16 requires 1 epa to amend regulations under the safe drinking water act to allow commercial scale underground injection of car bon dioxide for sequestration and to monitor such activity to reduce adverse impacts from such injection 2 the department of the interior to assess us capacity for geological sequestration 3 th department of energy to assess the feasibility of co2 pipelines and 4 epa to establish task force to study the issues related to federal assumption of liability for sequestration sites title ix permits the president to temporarily adjust or waive any regulations promulgated under the b ill if national security emergency exists and it is in th paramount interest of the united states to modify the requirement s in response to that emergency in addition to the limits under the capandtrade program title x requires epa to establish program limiting us consumption of hydrofluorocarbons under sepa rate hfc allowance

ericas climate security act of 2007 as introduced october 18 2007 by senator lieberman would cap greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation indus trial and transportation sectors for facilities that emit more th an 10000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent as introduced the cap wa s estimated by the sponsors to reduce emissions to 15 below 2005 levels in 2020 declining steadily to 63 below 2005 levels in 2050 the program would be imple mented through an expansive allowance trading program to maximize opportunitie s for costeffective reductions credits obtained from increases in carbon sequestra tion and acquisition of allowances from foreign sources could be used to comply with 30 of reducti on requirements the bill also establishes carbon market effi ciency board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary bill as reported by subcommittee on november 1 2007 the senate committee on environment and public work s subcommittee on private sector and consumer solutions to global warming and wildlife protec tion reported out revised version of s 2191 as reporte d from subcommittee s 2191 was estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 19 below 2005 levels by 2020 up from 15 as introduced and 63 below 2005 levels by 2050 the increase in the estimated reductions in 2020 is the result of amende d text that includes greenhouse gases from all natural gas uses under the overall missions cap other amendments approved included modifications to eligibility re quirements for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program and the advanced coal generation technology demonstration program modifi cations were also made to the proposed allocation of allowances to help tribal communities

vised version of s 2191 by an 11 to 8 vote the revised bill expands the greenhouse gas reduc tion program coverage by replacing the previous definition of covered facility ba sed on the electric power transportation and industrial sectors with an upstream defin ition for oil refineries and natural gas processing plants and downstream defi nition for coal consumers among the amendments agreed to by the full committ ee were new low carbon fuel standard lcfs that would require the carbon intensity of transportation fuel to be frozen in 2011 and then reduced by 5 in 2015 nd 10 in 2020 other amendments agreed to would increase incentives for states to modify their utility regulatory structures to encourage energy efficiency and would broaden the ability of states to use their allowance allocations to mitigate advers economic impacts resulting from the bills implementation deficit reduction amendment finally in april 2008 proposed amendment to s 2191 was submitted by the committee to the congressional budget office cbo to be included in the scoring of the bill the amendment would provide for some of the au ctioned revenues to be put aside for deficit reduction purposes introduction models cannot predict the future costs of climate change program lessons from so2 cap and trade program during the clean air act debate in 1990 on the title iv sulfur dioxide so2 capand trade program crs found it difficult to analyze the cost of the bill beyond the first 10 years 19902000 and consider ed any breakdown of even 2000 data on statebystate basis as not useful for any more than illustrative purposes18 as stated in 1990 it is difficult and some would consider it unwise to project costs up to the year 2000 much less beyond the already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic and other unforeseen events such as electric utility deregulation loom as critical issues which can not be modeled hence cost projections beyond the year 2000 are at best speculative and are more function of each models assumptions and structure than they are of the details of proposed legislation projections this far into the future are based more on philosophy than analysis19 emphasis in original the history of resulting so2 capandtrade program costs has proven illuminating as indicated in table 3 the 2010 cost estimates for the so2 capand trade program made in 1990 proved to be substantially higher than what is now estimated to be the programs actual costs indeed the epaicf low estimate thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs11 20 the only 2010 national utility cost estimate mentioned in the summary of findings is for the high case longerterm costs reach about 5 billion 1988 dollars per year by 2010 under both the high house and senate cases due to the provisions requiring new source emissions to be offset the low house and senate cases for 2010 are not mentioned see epaicf icf resour ces incorporated comparison of the economic impacts of the acid rain provisions of the senate bill s 1630 and the house bill s 1630 prepared for the us environmental protec tion agency july

explore the potential for technological breakthroughs and enhancements costs are lower than originally predic ted primarily because flexibility occurred in areas that were thought to be infl exible and technical improvements were made that were not anticipated factor s contributing to the lower costs included lower transportation costs for lowsu lfur coal attributed to railroad deregulation

flexibility and responsiveness of the us economy resulted in some interesting reversals 1 the miteppa model which has the closest relationship between ghgs and gdp in the reference case has the most responsiv assumptions resulting in the greatest reduction in ghg and ghg intensity under s 2191 2 in contrast the epaadageref model which has the west ghg intensity assumption in its reference cases has the highes t ghg intensity result under s 2191 the miteppa model assumes more economic growth per capita and more responsiveness by the economy to ghg constraints the epaadage model assumes the most ghgefficient economy but the least amount of flexibility to respond to ghg constraints and the epa igem model assumes the fastest growth in population the result of these different views of the economy is that the economic impact is less than the differences in the mode ls reference case assumptions as indicated in table 4 the miteppa model projection of the countrys 2050 gdp per capita

bullets identifying various limitations on its modeling exercise and four pages of additional qualitative considerations27 this is good indicator of the modeling complexity in attempting to estimate the impact of greenhouse gas reduction bill these m odeling limitations reflect the inherent complexity of such strategies that cannot be quantif ied or predicted complexity of the problem compared with the complexity of imp lementing greenhouse gas capand trade scheme the so2 program was trivial conceptually co2 tradeable permit program could work similarly to the so2 program however significant differences exist between acid rain and possible global warming that affect current abilities to model responses for example th acid rain program involves up to 3000 new and existing electric generating units that contri bute twothirds of the countrys so2 this concentration of sources makes the logis tics of allowance trading administratively manageable and enforceable the impos ition of the allowance requirement is straightforward the acid rain program is downstream program focused on the electric utility industry the allowance re quirement is imposed at the point of so2 emissions so the participant has clear pr ice signal to respond to the basic dynamic of the program is simple althoug h not necessarily predictable comprehensive greenhouse gas capandtrade program would not be as straightforward to implement gr eenhouse gas emissions sources are not concentrated although over 80 of th greenhouse gases generated comes from fossil fuel combustion only about 33 comes from electricity generation transportation accounts for about 26 dir ect residential and commercial use about 8 agriculture about 6 and di rect industrial use about 1628 thus small dispersed sources in transportation resi dentialcommerc ial agriculture and the industrial sectors are far more important in controlling greenhouse gas emissions thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs17 29 this is particularly true if allowances are allocated to upstream entities at cost see sergey paltsev et assessment of us c apandtrade proposals mit joint program on the science and policy of global change april 2007 p 5 they are in controlling so2 emissions this greatly increases the economic sectors and individual entities that may be required to reduce emissions it also affects the operation of capandtrade program as the diversity of sources creates significant administrativ and enforcement problems for tradeable permit program if it is meant to be comprehensive downstream approach is impractical for comprehensive greenhous gas program where the transportation sector and dispersed residential commercial and agricultural sources emit almost half the total emissions one alternative is to move the imposition point more upstream in those sectors as is done by s 2191 this complicates the economics of the program as the price signal has to work its way through multiple paths to the particular entities u tilities consumers industry th at are the ultimate sources of the greenhouse gases arguably the prima ry purpose of an economic mechanism such as capandtrade program is to put price on greenhouse gas emissions in the case of comprehensive capandtrade program the impact of that price signal will not be simple or straightforward with unintended consequences likely29 in addition attempts by analysts to capture the general equilibrium effects of the programs interaction with the overall economy add yer of assumptions and opaqueness to the analysis that can hide in sights the analysis may have on program design and implementation flexibility of capandtrade program the flexibility envisioned by most capa ndtrade programs exceeds that of the so2 program acid rain is regional probl em that resulted in independent responses by the united states and canada the ited states chose capandtrade program that included important flexibility mechanisms like banking canada chose variety of approaches and the entire process was later codified by treaty offsets emission reductions made by entities not directly covered by the program are not major component of the so2 program uncovered industrial entities that want to participate in the program must become covered entities with their own baselines and monitoring equipment the bill also sets up small reserve of allowances to reward reductions through conservati on and renewable energy efforts with the sulfur dioxide capandtrade system being limited to the united states there is international trading in the acid rain program in contrast most ghg capandtrade pr oposals expand the supply of available allowances by permitting offsets from wide variety of sources including agricultural practices forestry projects sequestration activities and alternative energy projects these diverse sources multiply as the trading extends globally and as other nonco2 greenhouse gases are included in the supply mix finally the interaction of these various supply sources and the demand of other countries also reducing emissions or who may decide to re duce in the future provide for an almost infinite number of possible scenarios crucially the availability of offsets may have significant impact on compliance costs particularly in the shortterm httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs18 30 john houghton introduction

and ec onomic growth are generally not elements targeted for reduction under gree nhouse gas reduction programs ind eed by any federal program the key factor in reducing the intensity driver over the

deployment and the in itiation of efforts to develop new generations of technology the effectiveness of these initiatives and price signals would be pivotal to the ultimate cost of any re duction strategy partic ularly in the long term as stated by houghton technology change is particularly critical component of the climate change debate for example the cost of meetin g stabilization levels is very sensitive to assumptions about future technologies if assumed technology improvements lead to relatively low emissions then it is relatively inexpensive to meet stabilization levels and vice versa furthermore technology research and development is very significant policy instrument in the portfolio of options30 increasing problems wi th ceteris paribus31 analysis as was the case with analyses of the so2 capandtrade program current studies of greenhouse gas reduction propos als assume that in the ab sence of new legislation epa would take action in this area be tween now and the year 2050 and future initiatives would be enacted in related areas such as energy policy this seems unlikely indeed the potential for fu ture requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emission may already be having an effect on decisions by industry and consumers as noted by eia while forecasting policy change is beyond eias mandate an argument can be made that all else being equal public and industry awareness of climate change as major policy issue can potentially impact energy investment decisions even if specific policy change actually occu rs any adjustment to reflect the influence of climate

mobile s ources of all kinds their fuels with the exception of jet fuel and both large and small stationary sources the possibility for regulation through existing clean air act authority was recently outlined by epa in congressional testimony36 the key to such regulation is that the epa administrator issue appropriate findings on whether greenhouse gases contribut to air pollution that is reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare it is difficult bordering on impossible to determine where such fi nding would lead the administrator has substantial discretion in defining what emission limits should be set once he or she makes such finding and what sections of the act he or she might use greenhouse gases could be defined as cr iteria air pollutants or not they could be controlled in mobile sources of all kinds they coul d be subject to new source performance standards nsps prevention of significant deterioration psd or maximum available control technology mact requi rements each of these has its own standardsetting process and criteria to some extent the important questi on may be how an administrator would define the source categories if all power plants were considered in the same category then the acts authority could be used to require the use of natural gas or cleaner fuels or at least to set emission standards based on the emissions from plants using such fuels if coalfired plants were their own categor or technological approach were taken the be st technology could be carbon capture and storage ccs how the sources would be categorized would be at the discretion of the administrator the administrator would also get to make technical judgments concerning whether technologies were available or achievable these judgments could be crucial in

households investments by business and households in capital including new house purchases government expenditures on goods nd services but not transfer payments such as social security and net importsmeasuring the noise web of cost measures because of the economic complexities nd interactions noted above analysts have generally chosen to focus on timating the macroeconomic effects of proposals such as gdp imp acts there are two components of macroeconomic cost measures 1 the direct abatement or compliance cost of greenhouse gas reduction program and 2 the general equilibrium effects of gree nhouse gas reduction program ie the inte ractions of the direct abatement costs with the rest of the economy the most common measure presented is gross domestic product gdp gdp measures the total value of goods and rvices produced within nations borders37 although it is commonly used as measure of quality of life this application is problematic generally it incl udes only those items for which there is value defined in market and does not take into account some activities that have economic value but market valuation eg leisure time environmental quality etc gdp is intended to be measure of economic activity not quality of life second measure sometimes presented is consumption effects sometimes called welfare effects unfortunately th models do not measure consumption or welfare effects in consistent fashion the primary advantage of measuring gdp for example the miteppa analysis presents welfare effects in terms of changes in aggregate market consumption plus leis ure measured as equivalent variation the change in welfare represents the amount of income needed to compensate for the change in contrast the eianems mode l presents real consumption impacts in terms of consumer expenditures this ma kes comparisons difficult and lessens the utility of the measure for example when analyzing proposed legislation the welfare effects of legi slation under the miteppa are usually less than the gdp effects while the real consumption imp acts under eianems are usually greater than the gdp effects on percentage ba sis in addition like gdp none of the definitions of consumption or welf are currently employed quantify any environmental effects third measure generally presented is llowance prices these generally reflect to some degree the aggregate marginal cost of the program as estimated by the models marginal cost is the cost of re ducing the last ton and therefore the most expensive of greenhouse gases required by the program at specific point in time marginal costs are very useful to affect ed entities in choosing what reduction strategy would be the most costeffective in achie ving their assigned reduction requirement they are not an average cost and ther efore cannot be simply multiplied by the greenhouse gases reduced to estimate total co mpliance cost they also need to be put into the context of the overall reduction achieved at the given point and time being examined httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs22 38 w david montgomery and anne smith economic analysis of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2007 using cras mr nneem model cra international april 8 2008 p 18 prices are in 2007however allowance prices in most analyses are actually different from marginal costs because of program provisions such as banking banking activity reflects the assumed foresight of affect ed entities to the likelihood of increasing allowance prices in real terms as the cap tightens as indicated by the experience with the so2 program entities will bank substantial allowances early and use them later as theprograms requirements tighten this results in allowance prices being higher than marginal costs in the early years of the program and lower in later years for example the nmacra international anal ysis of s 2191 has 2050 allowance price of about 352 under banking assumptions but an allowance price of about 195 with banking in contrast 2015 allowance prices are estimated at 51 for the banking scenario but only 38 under the banking scenario 38 this ability to timeshift reduction requirements and compliance costs means that allowance price projections reflect the assumed foresight of affected entities as much as they do actual marginal costs in presenting cost measures most analyses overemphasize aggregate welfare indicators such as gdp as illustrated bove aggregate macroeconomic cost results for s 2191 fall into the noise of uncertain ty about future conditions in addition aggregate macroeconomic measures redu ce the transparency of the analyses compliance strategies and as result make them easier to dismiss for example figure 1 below shows 1997 scatterplot by world

denny ellerman the cost of reducing so2 its higher than you think public utilities fortnightly may 15 1998 pp 2229this fog is inherent when analysts choose to include the general equilibrium effects of program in their cost measure fog that can limit the explanatory value of the analysis while supporting use of aggregate welfare cost measures mit notes ge general equilibrium effects can st em from interactions with preexisting distortions eg taxes from externally induced termsoftrade effects from the fact that the domestic policy itself creates termsoftrade effects and from other rigidities in the economy many aspect s of model structure produce ge effects that are not easy to separately measure because of the inherent interactions in the economy39 generally the cases examined here have not chosen to separate the two components of macroeconomic cost meas ures 1 the direct abatement or compliance cost of greenhouse gas reduction program and 2 the general equilibrium effects of greenhouse gas reduction program ie the interactions of the direct abatement costs with the rest of the economy40 the availability of compliance cost estimates would allow po licymakers to put current greenhouse gas reduction proposals in the context of other environmental initiatives be they acid rain or toxic air pollutants and indee d to the overall envir onmental agenda and greatly increase the transparency of the analyses insights it would also help relieve confusion between compliance costs averag costs per ton reduced and the other commonly presented costs such as allowance prices41 it is argued that an aggregate macroeconomic cost measure provides more complete view of the economic impact of proposed legislation nd helps identity potential uni ntended economic effects of compliance strategies this may be true par ticularly if for example auction revenues are being recycled via reformed tax code however as indicated here aggregated macroeconomic cost measures ch as gdp can also be interpreted to merely show that the united states has massive economy that can absorb substantial shocks with limited longterm effect three perspectives getting out of the noise

obvious most casual users would never di ve deep enough into model documentation to ascertain that igem and adage u tilize different assumption about the tradeoff between consumption and leisure for this reason it is very important that model developers make transparent their assumptions and inputs as jo rgenson goettle and poss do and b to the extent possible characterize principal source s of

indicated in figures 6 and 7 the epaigem cases produced 2050 estimates that were more than twice those of the other models the high estimates for gdp per capita reduction by the epaigem cases result from its structure and assumptions contai ned in the model for example the assumption about the relations hip between leisure and consumption in igem is quite different from the other models essen tially as prices for goods and services increase igem assumes highly respons ive relationship with people deciding to work less and buy less as result sma ll increase in prices will produce relatively large loss of consumption resulting in larger impact on gdp and other cost measures in contrast ot her models are less responsiv assuming people will absorb higher prices without changing their wo rk or consumption habits very much50 other factors influencing igems results include 1 somewhat higher emissions baseline 2 the lack of some less carbonemitting t echnological alternatives such as carbon

focus on technological alternatives in the electric power sector availability of technology when and how quickly technology will be available is difficult but critical issue indeed the models examined here do not agree on the availability of current electric generating technology such as nuclear or wind power much less emerging technolog ies such as carbon capture and storage ccs or the potential for breakthroughs ove r the next 40 years the general lack of detailed technology desc riptions in the cge models does not help in this regard for example the epaigems pr esentation of the energy s ector and technology options is too aggregated to be analyzed in terms of technology velopment under s 2191 current technologies several currently availa ble technologies emit less greenhouse gases or none compared to conventional coalfired facility those technologies include electri c generation from wind bioma ss landfill gas nuclear geothermal and natural gas some of thes sources such as biomass and natural gas have some repowering pot ential with respect to coalfired generation the models do not provide much insight on the likely mix of these technologies under s 2191 some cases like the accfnamnems cases strictly define the availability of these technologies while others like the catfnems and eianems cases allow the model to meet the requirements without any additional constraints table 11 identifies some of the tec hnologyavailability limits assumed in the different model runs along with the resulting capacity built to meet electricity demand from 2010 to 2030 b ecause the accfnamnems cases heavily constrain the availability of most altern atives to naturalgas genera tion it is not surprising that substantial amount of natural gas capacity is assumed to be built under these cases during this time period this result is conf irmed by sensitivity analysis conducted by eia that shows movement to natural gas if the availability of nuclear power renewable power and coal

standards by brent d yacobucci and robert bambergerfor ccs and extending the wind produc tion tax credit to 2030 catfnems also used eias best available technology case as proxy for the appliance and building standards included in the bill the results are some of the lowest overall cost estimates of any of the cases along with substantial development of coalfired ccs nuclear power and renewables other innovative approaches were taken by eianems to attempt to mimic the impact of energy efficiency incentives by reducing the incremental cost of the most energyefficient residential appliances by half simulating rebate for buying more efficient appliances likewise eianems mimicked the incentives for stronger building codes by tightening the residentia l codes in the model by 30 in 2015 and 50 in 2025 compared with basecase levels these proxies come in addition to the eisa provisions that are contained in the preliminary aeo 2008 basecase used by eianems the proxies contribute to some of the lowest cost estimates of any of the cases the only other model to incorporate these initiatives was mnacra which incorporated the preliminary aeo 2008 baseline that includes the eisa provisions however the nmacra results do not sepa rate out the efficiency standards from the new corporate average fu economy cafe or renewa ble fuel standard rfs requirements see next section on transportation sector transportation sector the transportation sector presents particular problems for capandtrade system first the sheer number of motorized and aviation vehicles effectively necessitates an upstream regulation of transportation fuels it would be impracticable to place emissions monitors on the hundreds of millions of cars trucks motorcycles offroad vehicles boats trains and aircraft in the united states75 likewise requiring each motori st to submit allowances for his or her fossil fuel use would greatly increase the administrative costs of an emission reduction program therefore any regulation of transporta tion especially motor vehicles would likely occur upstream of the emitting source as is the case with s 2191 emissions reductions from transportation generally must come in one of three ways 1 reduce fuel consumption through more efficient vehicles or through reduction in vehicle miles traveled eg mass transit carpoolin g etc 2 reduce the carbon content of transportation fuels through the blending of lowercarbon fuels in conventional fuels 3 switch from conventional fuels to alternatives with lower lifecycle emissions current federal policy attempts to addre ss

httpwwwarbcagov fuelslcfslcfshtm 80 further epa currently does not have the au thority to regulate aviation fuels under the clean air act that authority rests with th federal aviation administration since this provision would amend the clean air act epa may not have the authority to include aviation fuel in the defin ition of transportation fuel 81 eia annual energy outlook table 11transportation fuel and that an increasing share of that fuel have lower greenhouse gas emissions77 both of these programs should help reduce the number of allowances needed by the petroleum industry by reducing the amount of fuel consumed and the carbon conten t of the fuel supplied the capandtrade restrictions on petr oleum would most likely be felt by transportation users through higher prices users would receive the price signal and decide whether to invest in new capital g purchase new car use less fuel and drive less or change fuels if possible low carbon fuel standard one key feature of s 2191 and its impact on the transportation sector is the low car bon fuel standard lcfs in section 11003 the lcfs requires 5 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels from 2008 levels by 2015 and 10 reduction from 2008 by 2020 this is similar to the proposed w carbon fuel standard established in california by governor arnold schwarzenegger78 major question on the effects of the lc fs is the definition of transportation fuel in discussions over the californi program most stakeholders including california air resources board staff ar gued that aviation fuel and bunker fuel should not be included in the standard79 simply put the more fuels included in the program and the greater the volume that mu st be displaced the more stringent the standard becomes this is especially tr ue for aviation fuel since there are currently few or options to reduce jet fuel lifecycle greenhouse gases80 therefore the more jet fuel included in the program the greater the reductions necessary from other fuels for example eia projects 1579 million barre ls per day of transportation fuel demand in 2020 or roughly 240 billion gallons annually81 to meet 10 reduction requirement 24 billion gallons of zerocarbon fuel would be needed assuming equivalent energy content per gallon however many lowcarbon fuels have less energy per gallon than petroleum fuels and all have some associated carbon emissions if cellulosic ethanol is f ound to have 90 reduction in lifecycle emissions and the fuel has 23 the energy content of gasoline then roughly 40 billion gallons would be required this is considerably more than the existing rfs mandatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs55 82 it should be noted however that the r fs mandates only require 15 billion gallons of advanced biofuel with 50 reduction in lifecycle emissions as opposed to the 90 reduction in the example the remaining 15 billion gallons of the rfs mandate are not required to have any emissions reductions 83 cra international economic analysis of the lieberm anwarner climate security act of 2007 using cras mr nneem model april 8 2008 p 29 84 ibid p 22of 30 billion gallons of renewable fuels82 in the same year if however only motor gasoline and diesel fuel are considered then the total volume is reduced to 1347 million barrels per day or 206 billion gallons annually the equivalent amount of cellulosic ethanol required would be roughly 35 billion gallons still significant target the assumptions for the amount of wcarbon fuel available the expected emission reductions for that fuel and th total amount of fuel subject to the requirements would significantly affect the costs and feasibility of the lcfs program the way the provisions are written in s 2191 the lcfs program is separate from the capandtrade program and there is way to purchase credits or offsets from other sectors if the n ecessary amount of lowcarbon fuel is not available then under the program fuel provi ders must reduce the amount of fuel they sell or pay civil pe nalties in its analysis of s 2191 nmacra states that in 2015 the lcfs can only be met by decrease in gasoline consumption to allow the limited s upplies of low carbon biofuel to meet the averaging requirements of the standard83 further the model estimates that b ecause of the decrease in supply motor fuel prices increase 140 in 2015 over the baseline case84 the nmacra analysis suggests that if the lcfs is c onstrued to include ll ground transportation fuels without exception then it may be di fficult to achieve it without reducing fuel demand depending on the design of the program and what fuels are included the effects on fuel supply and prices coul d be dramatic however if plugin hybrid vehicles or large amounts of cellulosic biofuel are ava ilable earlier than expected or if certain fuels such as aviation fuel and nonroad fuels are excluded from the mandate the costs could be lower impact on fuel prices given the divergent projec tions by the various cases about future electric genera ting capacity illustrated in tables 11 and 12 and with the exception of nmacra detailed modelin g of the transport sector it is not surprising that their estimates of the fuel price impacts of s 2191 vary widely also perhaps more than any other results the cases were very selective in terms of the results they chose to highlight in their st udies and how they chose to present them hence crs highlighted general themes coming out of the cases to focus on the insights this wide variety of assumptions and calculations has to offer further discussion of the impact of energy co sts on households and energyintensive industries is presented later natural gas prices some of the most confusing results presented by the cases are for natural

while others do not likewise some cases include the free allowance allocations provided under s 2191 others do not in general the cge models present natural gas prices w ithout the added cost of allowances nems cases present natural gas prices that include allowance costs in general the incremental impact of s 2191 on natural gas prices depends on the degree to which natural gasfired generation is used to back out existing coal fired capacity and to meet future dema nd as discussed above the cases fall into three categories with respect to future natural gasfired generation 1 little or increased generation 2 modest increased generation or 3 substantial increased generation of the three cases include d in the first categ ory the epaadageref and epaadagetech cases project declin ing natural gas prices that do not include any allowance costs this compar with the catfnems case that projects natural gas prices increasing only 3 in 2030 over baseline leve ls with allowance costs included the potential modest impact on natural gas prices would be consistent with future generation mix th at is not heavily reliant on natural gas the three cases that project some additional natural gasfired capacity miteppa eianems and nmacra vary in their results for the two cases that do not include allowance costs the miteppa case projects substantial decline in natural gas prices through 2050 while nmacra projects wellhead natural gas prices increasing over basecase levels about 20 by 2020 then declining to increase by 2035 and declining steadily af terwards to about 25 below baseline projections by 2050 for delivered natura l gas nmanems projects prices with allowance costs at about 20 above ba secase levels around 2025 and accelerating rapidly after 2040 for the eianems case that includes allowance costs prices for natural gas delivered to electric generators are projected to increase about 23 in 2020 and 40 in 2030 the price for natural gas delivered to re sidential consumers increases about 14 in 2020 increasing to 26 in 2030 compared with basecase in contrast to the cases above the two accfnamnems cases which project substantial increases in natural gasfired capacity estimate natural gas prices with allowance costs increasing 108 low case and 146 high case by 2030 for both residential and industr ial consumers this result is consistent with the assumptions used by accfnam in its analysis as identified in tables 7 8 and 11 petroleum prices with the exception of nmacra the cases examined here do not model the transpor tation sector in detailed manner as noted in the transportation sector discussion perhaps the most important impact on petroleum prices under s 2191 may come from the low carbon fuels standard lcfs at least in the short term for the cases that did not model the lcfs three cases the two epaadage cases and the miteppa case project either modest increases or declines in petroleum prices compared with basecase projections substantial decline in the case of miteppa these models are all global in scope with the petroleum price reflective of what they see as occurring in the international oil market and do not include the incr eased cost of carbon allowances the other four cases the two accfnamnems cases eianems and catfnems focus on gasoline prices and the price increases from the allowancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs57 85 electricity prices vary substantially by sector and region for example in 2006 eia reports residential rates of 3052 per million btu compared with industrial rates of 1797 2006 requirement the catfnems case estimates gasoline price increases reaching about quarter 025 per gallon by 2030 while eianems estimates 2020 gasoline price increase of about 022 per gallon and 2030 price increase of about 040 per gallon eianems also provides timates for other transportation fuels including diesel and jet fuel the two accfnamnems cases project more dramatic gasoline price increases of about 325 high case and about 170 low case per gallon by 2030 2005 electricity prices electricity price calculations by the various cases include allowance prices however like the presenta tion of natural gas prices the cases use confusing array of different baselines indices values and target categories residential industrial average etc this can lead to some misleading conclusions when comparing different cases for ex ample the miteppa case estimates 2030 electricity prices under s 2191 at 57 above 2005 prices compared with epaadagerefs 2030 estimate under s 2191 of 29 bove 2005 prices however reflecting the critical role of basecase assumptions the miteppa basecase 2030 electricity price estimate is 39 above 2005 prices thus the incremental difference between the ba secase and the s 2191 estimate is 18 percentage points in contrast the epaadageref basecase 2030 electricity price estimate is an 11 decline below 2005 pri ces thus the incremental difference between the basecase and the s 2191 estimate is 40 percentage points the only metric for which the cases pr ovided sufficient data was percentage increases from basecase levels for th epaadage cases the basecase assumes decline in electricity prices from 2005 levels in 2030 1115 this compares with 29 increase in basecase prices for miteppa 56 increase for the eianems nmacra and accfnamnems cases and 05 decline for catfnems relative to 2005 prices it s hould be noted that several cases do not state precisely what the 2005 elect ricity prices refers to residential industrial all users or something else85 relative to their respective baselines three cases estimate electricity price increases under 15 catfnems eia nems and miteppa and three cases estimate price increases between 35 45 the two epaadage cases and the nmacra case in contrast the two accfnamnems cases project prices substantially higher 101 low case and 129 high case in 2030

the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade program potential benefits and concerns by jonathan l ramseur 91 because the united states has not ratified the kyoto protocol it is not eligible to continuedeconomic issues availability of offsets along with technology development the availability and price of offsets is one of the critical factors determining the costs of s 2191 particularly in the short to midterm as noted by eia the highest prices in the first 5 years of the capandtrade program occur when international offsets are not assumed to be available86 as stated more forcefully by epa from the various scenarios analyzed the use or limitation of offsets and international credits has larger impact on allowance prices than the modeled availability or constraint of key enabling technologies87 however this conclusion is not obvious from first read of the cases in its heavily constrained cases accfnamnems notes that the purchase of relatively inexpensive offsets significantly constrai ns allowance prices until the early 2020s when the available offsets run up against the limits contained in the bill or in the models assumptions88 in contrast the nmacra finds such relief stating that since the limit on domestic offsets is proj ected not to be reached until after 2025 allowing greater use of domestic offsets does not reduce near term costs89 obviously there is significant disagreement on the availability and costeffectivenessof domestic and inte rnational offsets 90 critical factor in this uncertain situation is the availability of international credits the epaadage epaigem and eianems cases assume the availability of substa ntial international credits at reasonable prices sensitivity analysis by epa indicates that if domestic and international credit availability were unlimited 2050 allowance prices would fall by 71 it should be noted that subject to changes in the international framework for international commitments and trading s 2191 would not allow us companies to obtain credits via mechanisms such as the clean development mechanism cdm either directly or through secondary market as currently written section 250291

subtitle g agriculture and forestry and title iii subs title j landfill and coal methanevia substitutions of cdmstyle credits for eligible allowances such as those used by the euets by other contro lled countries and then sold to us companies the epaadage epaigem and eianems cas assume this interpretation of section 2502 of course given the long time frame of s 2191 proj ecting the availability and prices of international credits is an certain business for example the european commission ec has not decided on the status of credits from the clean development mechanism cdm for the postkyoto period given the indirect arrangement necessary for those credits to impact s 2191 compliance costs this uncertainty can not be readily resolved nmacra disagrees that substantial international credits would be available at reasonable prices nmacra argues th at since the countries involved must have programs of comparable stringency the allowance prices are likely to be similar to us prices and excludes them from its analysis as suggested by sensitivity analysis conducted by epa eia and t restrictions on international credits substantially increase the cost of s 2191 eia estimates that the unavailability of international credits would increase llowance prices 39 in 2030 for 2050 mit estimates an allowance price increase of 15 while epa projects that increase at 34 the impact of domestic offsets in reducing costs is projected to be less dramatic than for international credits although th incentives available for domestic offsets could alter this epa sensitivity analysis indicates that unlimited domestic offsets would reduce allowance prices by 26 p 692 impact of banking experience with the acid rain program strongly indicates that participants bank allowances in the face of price uncertainty in the case of greenhouse gas reductions the availability of offsets and international credits also interacts with the banking provisions as noted earlier the accfnamnems cases do not include banking this fact helps explain their dramatically increasing allowance prices all other cases include banking the models suggest two important results from banking first as noted earlier banking has flattening effect on allowance prices as participants buy more than they need early raising prices and use them later lowering prices from the levels they would be otherwise second and perhaps more critically banking allows participants more control over the schedu ling of reduction efforts given the pivotal nature of technology development to the ultimate success of any greenhouse gas reduction program the ability to delay making major capital investments is very important in the epaadage and epaig em cases entities bank allowances until around 2030 depending on the scenario

the carbon market efficiency bo ard established by title i subtitle f however one can infer from the models results that the most important power that the board may have is the ability to increase the availability of domestic offsets and international credits as noted increasing the availability of domestic offsets and international credits could have significant effect on overall costs if the board chose to loosen the limitation on offset and international credit availability the cost reductions could be substantial as indicated by the epa cases in addition if the board determined that t echnology development was not occurring on schedule and causing volatility in the allowance markets loosening constraints on offsets and international credits could allow covered entities to bank more allowing more time for technology development if necessary however the board is primarily designed to deal with shortterm volatility due to episodic events in the allowance market and has only shortterm powers whether it could coordinate longer term strategy if necessary with its proposed authority is not known impact of revenue recycling as indicated in the auction revenue estimates section s 2191 could redirect hundreds of billions of dollars annually through the economy only the nmacra cas states it captured the effects of this redirection the other models generally ssume the effect on the economy is similar to lumpsum adjustment to taxes design ed to keep s 2191 deficit and revenue neutral international leakage international leakage is the shift in ghg emissions from country subject to regulation eg capandtrade program to an unregulated country so reduction benefits are not obtained this w ould happen for example if ghg emitting industry moved from country with an

effect of discounting is so great on longterm marginal damage estimate of climate change that using standard assumptions about discounting ie 45 and aggregation the marginal damage costs of carbon

co2 span over three orders of magn itude from zero to over 500 ton100 however most current attempts to monetize environmental benefits are incomplete the matrix presented in table 15 illustrates the problem most studies that attempt to monetize benefits focus on the market impact of predictable average changes in climate the easiest to measure box of table 15 only few attempt to value nonmarket impacts or extreme ev ents and fewer still consider catastrophes or socially contingent impacts101 in reviewing 28 studies the uk government had analyzed in reexamining its estimate of an appropriate

only the simplest and most predictable corner of the vast troubling canvas that has been painted by climate science there is of course way to assign monetary values to the global response to the

scenario where abatement efforts occur in developing countries developed only under scenarios 2 3 and 4 developed countries including the ited states are assumed to have reduced emissions by 50 below 1990 levels by 2050 and held them there through 2100 this assumption is in the ballpark of u s reductions anticipated under s 2191 for developing countries scenario 2 assume s their emissions reductions begin in 2025 with emissions returning to their 2015 levels and with additional reductions beginning in 2035 with emissions returning to their 2000 levels and are held there scenario 3 assumes emissi ons reductions are delayed until 2050 at which point they return to 2000 levels and scenario 4 assu mes developing country emissions are not stabilized at all the climate effects of these scenarios as simulated by mit igsm replication of the three ao gcms identified above is shown in figure 11 as indicated by the red line the impact of s 2191 combined with th at of the other developed countries all of which have ratified the kyoto protocol is to reduce by 05 degrees c the projected 35 degrees c to 45 degrees c increase in global mean temperatures suggested by the simulations if the united states chose not to reduce the impact would be to move the red green and blue lines closer to the reference case line with respect to the red line it should be noted that in 2000 the united states greenhouse gas emissions were about 40 of the developed worl ds total emissions in terms of the effect of any us reduc tions on global mean temperatures that is about all that can be said in isolation as noted by mit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs67 112 ibid p 55it is not possible to connect specific u s policy targets with particular global concentration or temperature target and therefore the avoided damages because any climate gains depend on efforts in the rest of the world if cooperative solution is at all possible therefore major strategic consideration in setting us policy targets should be their value in leading other major countries to take on similar efforts112 instead s 2191s climatere lated environmenta l benefit must be considered in global context and the desire to engage th developing world in the reduction effort it is in this context that the united stat and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases when they ratified the 1992 united nations fram ework convention on climate change unfccc this global context raises two i ssues for s 2191 1 whether s 2191s greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely and 2 whether s 2191s reductions meet us commitments to stabilization under the unfccc and occur in timely fashion so

19822003 energy policy 34 2006 p 3475nonclimate change ai r quality benefits as noted earlier only the epaipm study included any estimates of emission reductions from nongreenhouse gas air pollutants only two pollutants were analyzed and the resulting estimates reflect shortterm interac tions between s 2191 and existing cap and trade programs however it should be noted that values ve been assigned to these pollutants from time to time for example in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the new average fuel economy standard the partment of transportati on assigned emission damage costs of 3900 short ton for nitrogen oxides 16000 short ton for sulfur dioxide and 164000 short ton for par ticulate matter all polluta nts that are also emitted from coalfired generating facilities113 this is an incomplete set of pollutants that would be reduced by s 2191 other benefits may occur from reductions of pollutants such as mercury and carbon monoxide impact on behavior the impact of any price increases from s 2191 on households industries and businesses would depend on th eir responsiveness to the price signal the distribution of safety net funds under s 2191 and the impact of various other provisions of the bill that encourage or could be used to encourage conservation and new tec hnology development simp attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism114 for at least two reasons first baseline forecasts are even less accurate at sector level than they are at an aggregate national level as noted by winebrake and sakva sector level baseline forecasts have significantly higher errors compared with aggregate estimates nor have sector estimates improved over the past two decades we find that low errors for total energy consumption are concealing much larger sectoral errors that cancel each other out when aggregated for example 5year forecasts made between 1982 and 1998 demonstrate mean percentage error for total energy consumption of 01 yet this hides the fact that the industrial sector was overestimated by an averag of 59 and the transportation sector was underestimated by an average of 45 we also find evidence that forecasts within each sector have improved over the two decades studied here115 second particularly w ith respect to industry the effect of s 2191 is likely to be very sitespecific particularly as the primary impact will be indirect in terms of added energy costs not direct complian ce costs an industrybyindustry approach masks the interplay of companies that w ould be affected differently by s 2191 most industries face competitive market sometimes intern ational in scope both in terms of producers of the same pr oducts and producers of substitute productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs70 also in some cases an industry may face fairly elastic demand for its product thus most industries are price sensitive and therefore any increase in manufacturing costs hurts the competitiveness of firm this complex situation is further complicated for ener gyintensive industries in the case of s 2191 as competitors within the same industry may experience diffe rent energy price increases particularly for electric power depending on thei r individual energy needs and power arrangements thus individual facilities w ithin the same industry will be affected differently by s 2191 and other unforeseen events in the future for example an aluminum plant receiving power from hy droelectric facility may not be affected the same way as similar plant with power contract with coalfired power supplier this differential effect on indivi dual companies under s 2191 could have several potential impacts first as noted above it may affect th competitive balance of specific facilities in the united states second investment decisions by industries could be affected particular ly with respect to technology new more efficient technology is emerging for some processes the combination of current price signals being sent from the energy markets and potential ones from s 2191 could speed their development if commercia lized new technology would reduce the impact of s 2191 and indeed improve competitiv eness not surprisingly none of the cases presented here have sufficient industry sect or detail to examine this possib ility nor did any attempt to develop pr oxies to explore the possibilitie s for industrial technology over the next 40 years s 2191 attempts to ameliorate these ffects somewhat by providing subsidy for such industries facing international competitiveness issues the degree to which the subsidy could address the issue was not examined by any of the cases presented here likewise the sufficiency of the funds was not examined interestingly such an approach to exposed industry has some parallels to reco mmendations that have been made with respect to carbon intensiv industries in europe facing reduction requirements and increased fuel cost from the eus kyoto protocol and postkyoto commitments for example one such recommendation by the uk carbon trust suggested the following for very small number of carbonintensive internationally exposed activities headed by steel and cement production governments should establish transitional compensating rate of free allocation on an activityspecific basis based upon the likely degree of cost passthrough given international trade conditions the scale of free allocation to electricityintensive activities in the euets notably pulp and paper should also take account of their electricity consumption whilst manufacturing of fertilisers and basic chemicals might benefit from being brought into the eue ts on similar basis together with aluminium smelting these constitute four tradeexposed electricityintensive activities for which additional measures linked to redistribution of auction revenues or equivalent downstream allo cation of electricityrelated

conservation and regulations is difficult to separate in the cge models such as adage igem and eppa nems does break down the residential sector into both residential energy consumption and residential prices by fuel however any estimates from such breakdown can only be considered illustrative at best for example the catfnems analysis illustrates that if s 2191 results in only moderate in crease in electricity and natural gas prices then households could on average re spond with sufficient conservation and efficiency improvements to overcome the projected price increases and reduce their monthly bill compared with business as usual levels if allowance prices are higher this become more difficult an effort by keohane and goldmark to estimate the monthly increase in residential electric bills based on miteppas higher allowance prices resulted in 6 increase in those bills in 2030117 impacts on residential monthly natural gas bills would follow similar pattern the catfnems analysis indicates that an aggressive demand res ponse by consumers almost eliminates the projected modest increase in natural gas prices in contrast keohane and goldmark calculations based on the higher allowance prices of the miteppa analysis result in 14 increase in monthly natural gas prices in 2030118 as with the energyintensive industr ies discussed above s 2191 attempts to ameliorate the impact of projected energy price increases for low and middleincome households by providing funds for states to provide electricity and natural gas impact assistance the eianems analysis breaks out the estimated impact of the electricity impact assistance funds in its calculation of household impacts assuming the value of the allowances allocated woul d be passed on to all consumers not just lowincome eianems estimates the re duction at onehalf cent per kilowatthour kwh or about 5 reduction in rates if the money were directed toward low income consumers the impact would be greater including the effects of the impact assistance eianems estimates the av erage monthly household energy bill excluding transportation under s 2191 would increase about 3 month in 2020 rising to about 6 month in 2030 overall eianems estimates that the consumer price index cpi for energy in 2030 would be 18 higher for residentia l consumers and 29 higher for industrial consumers than basecase levels to put these potential increased costs into context eianems compared its estimated increm ental consumer nd industrial energy prices increases under s 2191 with those of the past 5 years as indicated in figure 12 and stated by eianems if measured from 2008 energy prices it takes 22 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs72 119 eia energy market and economic impacts of s 2191 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2007 april 2008 p 32in the s 2191 core case to reach the same percentage change that current energy prices have increased from 2003 to 2008119 source energy information administration energy market and economic impacts of s 2191 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2007 april 2008 p 34 conclusion this report examines six studies that project the costs of s 2191 to 2030 or 2050 it is difficult and some would consid er it unwise to project costs up to the year 2030 much less beyond the already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic and other unforeseen events such as technological breakthroughs loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled hence longterm cost projections are at best speculative and should be viewed with attentive skepticism in the words of the late dr lincoln figure 12 energy price change recent history versus the s 2191 core casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs73 120 lincoln moses administrator energy information administration annual report to congress 1977 volume 2 1978moses the first administrator of the energy information administration there are facts about the future120 models cannot predict the future but they can indicate the sensitivity of programs provisions to varying ec onomic technological and behavioral assumptions that may assist policymaker s in designing greenhouse gas reduction strategy the various cases examined here do provide some important insights on the costs and benefits of s 2191 and its many provisions first if enacted the ultimate cost of s 2191 would be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill the bill provides numerous price research and development deployment and regulatory incentives for technology i nnovation the potential for new technology to reduce the costs of s 2191 is not fully an alyzed by any of the cases examined nor can it be the process of technology development and dissemination is not sufficiently understood at the current time for models to replicate with any longterm confidence in the same vein it is difficult to determine whether the various incentives provided by s 2191 are dir ected in the most optimal manner second in some ways the interplay between nuclear power renewables natural gas and coalfired capacity with ccs among the cases is proxy for the need for lowcarbon source of electric generating capacity in the mid to long term considerable amount of lowcarbon generation will have to be built under s 2191 in order to meet the reduction requirement the cases presented here do not agree on the amount of new generating capacity necessary under s 2191 or the mix of fuels and technologies th at would be employed the estimated amount of capacity constructed depe nds on the cases assumptions about the need for new capacity and replacementretirement of existing capacity under s 2191 along with consumer demand response to the rising pr ices and incentives contained in s 2191 third the cases suggest that the ccs bonus allowance allocation under s 2191 is effective in encouraging deployment of ccs accelerating development by 510 years however the cases disagree on whether the bonus amount provided by s 2191 is sufficient or need s to be extended additional years fourth the cases generally indicate that offsets could be valuable tool for covered entities not only to potentially reduce costs but perhaps more importantly to buy time to further develop new more efficient technologies the availability of offsets could be complemented by the bills provisions permitting banking allowing companies more time to develop longterm investment and strategic plans and to pursue technology velopment cost coul d be lowered further by allowing greater availability of offsets and international credits and with broader definition of eligible international credits more direct path for permitting international credits from mechanisms such as the cdm would also reduce one of the more important cost uncertainties revealed by the cases varying interpretations of international credit eligibility requirements and their projected pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34489crs74 fifth the carbon market efficiency board could have an important effect on the cost of the progr am through its power to increase the availability of offsets and international credits the cases generally do not consider the board in their analyses however one can infer from the cases results that the most important power that the board may have is the ability to increase the availability of domestic offsets and international credits although not the authority to change the eligibility requirements for domestic offsets and international credits in this sense the boards powers could mesh with the previous in sight about the importance of offsets and banking to the costeffectiveness of s 2191 however the board is primarily designed to deal with shortterm volatility due to episodic events in the allowance market and has only shortterm powers wh ether it could coordi nate longer term strategy if necessary with its proposed authority is not known sixth the low carbon fuel standard could significantly raise fuel prices and limit supply the effects will depend on what fuels are included in the lcfs the level of emissions reducti ons achieved by alternatives and the ability of suppliers to produce those alternatives if plug in hybrid vehicles or large amounts of cellulosic biofuel are available early or if certain fuels such as aviation fuel are excluded from the mandate the costs could be lower only one case provided any analysis of the lcfs seventh s 2191s climaterelated environmental benefit is best considered in global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort it is in this context that th united states and other developed countries agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases when they ratified the 1992 united na tions framework convention on climate change unfccc this global scope raises two i ssues for s 2191 1 whether s 2191s greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely and 2 whether s 2191s reductions meet us commitments to stabilization under the unfccc and occur in timely fashion so that global stabilization may occur at an acceptable level
