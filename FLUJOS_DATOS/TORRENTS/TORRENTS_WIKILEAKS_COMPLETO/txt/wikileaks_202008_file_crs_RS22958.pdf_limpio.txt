mental illness and other physical illnesses partial federal mental health parity law which requires parity only for annual and life time limits in coverage has been in existence since 1996 efforts to expand mental health parity to include provisions like treatment limitations and outofnetwork coverage passed in the 110th congress after failing to pass in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses on october 24 2008 president george bush signed into law pl110343 which provided for this expanded mental health parity in addition to providing rescue package for the us financial system the mental health parity provisions of this law seem to be wi dely supported by advocates for individuals with mental illnesses as well as insurers in the 110th congress legislators from the house and senate struggled to reach compromise language on mental health parity and in the last days before its passage they st ruggled to develop appropriate offsets to pay for the 34 billion that mental health parity is estima ted to cost over the next 10 years despite the passage on this act some issues persist which may lead to continued disparity in coverage of mental illnesses and persiste nt barriers

other physical illnesses this disparity can include noncoverage of mental illnesses or higher copayments and lower treatment limits for mental illnesses mental health parity laws aim to eliminate these disparities through two approaches one type of parity law involves requiring the insurer to cover certa in or all mental illn esses another type involves parity in the provisions of coverage eg

health plans and the irc covers group health plans using slightly broader definition than erisafederal mental health parity law which has been in existence since 1996 addresses the issue of disparity in treatment limits the expanded federal mental health parity law also addresses the issue of dispar ity in copayment requirements so far federal mental health parity bill has required full parity which is defined as requiring insurance companies to provide mental h ealth coverage and provide th is coverage on par with that for physical health while federal parity gislation requires par ity for mental health coverage only when an insurer has chosen to provide mental health benefits also called minimum mandated parity some states have taken di fferent approaches some states require full parity in which an insurer providing medi cal and surgical benefits must also provide comparable mental hea lth benefits some other states require insurers to provide mental health benefits but at minimum level also called mandated offering parity private health insurers providing less coverage for mental illnesses than for other medical conditions in part reflects insurers beliefs that mental disorders are difficult to diagnose and that mental health care is expensive and often ineffective however these concerns have been addressed by re searchers in the past decade 1 999 surgeon generals report on mental health concluded that effective treatments exist for most mental disorders1 several studies have found that when mental health parity is implemented in the context of managed care there is little or increase in costs to the insurer2 possibly as consequence of these findings americas health insurance plans ahip which represents the major insura nce companies supports the federal mental health parity law which requires parity coverage of mental illnesses if the insurer chooses to provide mental health coverage for detailed analys is of economic issues surrounding mental health

110th congress in the 110th congress the senate and hous passed different versions of expanded mental health parity legisl ation s 558 and hr 1424 aside from some differences in extent of parity requirements in the two bills they expanded the requirements for mental health parity beyond mhpa which only requires parity in annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage the bills required parity for mental health coverage in number of additional matters including copayments deductibles annual treatment limits eg number of covered visits to provider in calendar year and in and outofnetwork coverage these bills had always been str ongly supported by advocates for the mentally ill and had broad bipartisan support in congress although employers and health insurance groups opposed the legislation in the past because of concern that it would drive up costs the provisions in s 558 appeared to have their support s 558 is very s imilar to the final version of expanded par ity legislation contained in pl110343 senate and house action on february 12 2007 sena tors pete domenici and edward kennedy introduced the mental health parity act of 2007 s 558 to amend and expand the mhpa by requiring employers ponsored group health plans to impose the same treatment limitations and financial requirements on their mental health coverage as they do on their medical and surgical coverage the bill was referred to the senate health education labor and pensions committee where it was marked up on february 14 20076 the senate passed s 558 with an amendment by unanimous consent on

5 2008 in june 2008 senate and hous negotiators reached agreement on bill language that was compromise between s 558 and hr 1424 number of subsequent efforts to pass this compromise language were unsucce ssful primarily due to disagreement on the offsets to be developed to pay for the estima ted 34 billion that mental health parity will cost over 10 years some of the proposed ffsets used tax measures and restrictions on the financing of physicianowned hospitals and deferred the break on worldwide income tax for two years cost the congressional budget office cbo scored the housepassed and senatepassed mental health parity bills and estimated that if enacted parity legislation would increase health insurance premiums by 048 cbo also estimated that if enacted these bills would cost the federal govern ment approximately 34 billion over 10 years in lost tax revenues because of higher insurance premiums which then would result in more of an employees compensation be ing received in the form of nontaxable employerpaid premiums and less in the form of taxable wages final passage on september 23 2008 the house introduced and passed the compromised mental health parity bill as hr 69839 the senate did not take any action on this bill on september 29 2008 the sena passed the compromised mental health parity bill by including it in hr 604910 the house did not take any action on this bill finally key negotiators in the senate used hr 1424 the original mental health parity legislation passed in the house in the 110th congress as the vehicle to pass the compromised mental health parity legislation within the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 while this bill did not include specific offset for mental health parity the entire bill was offset by taxing individuals on current basis if such individuals receive deferred compen sation from tax indifferent party comparison of bills the original mental health parity bills passed in the senate and the house in the 110th congress were largely similar to each other as well as the final compromise legislation with few key differe nces like the mhpa these bills apply only to group plans that choose to offer mental health coverage th bills include parityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22958crs5 for substance abuse treatment services the bi lls also exempt small employers defined as having 50 or fewer employees and employ ees who demonstrate specific cost increase as result of compliance with the requirement s of parity legislati on they require the government accountability office gao within two years to evaluate the impact of the new federal parity standard s on access to insurance coverage and on insurance costs the key elements of the final law are as follows applies mental health parity provisions to all group health plans for employers larger than 50 employees adds on to the 1996 parity law sta ndard for annual nd lifetime dollar limits expands definition of mental health to include substance use disorders allows insurance companies to determine which mental illnesses they cover this was point of difference between the house and senate bills where the house bill required coverage for all mental illnesses defers to hipaa preemption standa rd thus forming the floor and not preempting more restrictive state mental health parity laws requires plan to provide parity outofnetwork mental health and substance abuse benefits if it pr ovides outofnetwork medical and surgical benefits this was point of difference between the house and senate bills where the senate bill did not require outofnetwork mental health or substance abuse benefits but requires parity if plan chooses to provide these benefits includes reference that recognizes that this act would not affect the terms and conditions of the managed care plan requires plan administrator to make information about medical necessity requirements and any denial availa ble to any current or potential participant beneficiary or contracted provider allows health plans that experience cost increase of at least 1 2 in the first year of this act as re sult of complying with this act to be exempt from parity requirements for one year goes into effect at the start of plan year one year after enactment of pl110343 requires gao to conduct study analyz ing specific rates pattens and trends in coverage any exclusion of specific mental

health workforce issues see crs report rl32546 title vii health professions ducation and training issues in reauthorization issues for congress this section discusses several policy issues that are not addressed by the federal mental health parity law these factors ma lead to continued disparity in coverage of mental illnesses and pers istent barriers to access mental h ealth care some experts believe that the current downturn in the economy could increase the need for mental health services thus straining the behavi oral health care delivery system federal mental health parity law does not require health plan to provide coverage for mental health it requires parity coverage for any mental illnesses that an insurer chooses to cover some anal ysts believe this could lead insurance companies to drop coverage for mental health ra ther than provide on par covera ge in addition mental health parity laws do not ddress the issue of mental hea lth care need of the uninsured the act allows insurers to provide parity coverage within the context of managed care some advocates for people with mental illnesses believe this will cause more aggressive management of mental health be nefits because insurers can longer impose differential treatment and financial limits it is not easy to come up with exact equivalence to determine parity in treatment options for mental health and physical health for example cognitive behavior therapy cbt is one treatment option that has been shown to be effective for treating some mental illnesses but cbt is not comparable to treatment for any physical illnesses the federal parity laws do not address quality of care issues such as training for providers of behavioral health care as well as basic mental health training for primary care providers due to this lack of training of pr oviders some analysts believe this law could lead to an increase in quantity of mental health care provided without corresponding improvement in health outcomes finally this law does not address workfor ce issues and shortage of mental health providers especially in rural areas when this shortage is combined with an anticipated increase in demand for care as result of the current economic crises it is believed that individuals who need mental h ealth care may still not receive it11
