representatives have shown that the house can reduce its expenses and in so doing not hinder the capabilities of the house as an institution19 among issues that drove consider ation of the fy1998 legislative branch appropriations bill were the following how much to appropriate for the architects request to undertake severa l capitol improvements whether legislative staff levels should be further reduced whether to agree to funds authorized for committee investigations of allege d campaign violations by the administration and congress what appropriation needs were for technology

activities flat budget flat budget typically provides n ew funds for mandatory cost increases but denies any additional funding requests flat budget is usually difficult to achieve due to number of factors among the factors affecting consideration of the fy1998 bill were the following 1the leaderships continued interest in increasing the electronic capabilities of the house and senate 2increases in house and senate committee funds and 3anticipated costs associated with repairs to the capitol complex buildings earlier in 1997 the chairman of the house subcommittee on legislative branc h

authority constant dollars reflecting the impact of inflation selection of budge t authority contained in annual appropriations bills with or without permanent budget authority permanent budget authority not requiring annual approval by congress and selection f fiscal years to be compared current dollar data reflect actual budget authority appropriated each year constan t dollar data reflect the conversion of actual budget au thority into equivalent 1997 dollars for example congress appr opriated budget authority of 41793000 for the senate in fy1968 excluding permanent budget authority

1269 the constant dollar figure indicates budget growth after adjustment for inflation differences also appear based on the choice of fiscal years used to compare budge t authority for example
