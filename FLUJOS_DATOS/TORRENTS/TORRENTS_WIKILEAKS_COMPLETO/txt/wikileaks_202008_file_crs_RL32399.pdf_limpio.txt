now means that customs and border protection cbp inspectors are essentially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections range of legal admin istrative and policy issues have emerged with unified border inspections legislation implementing the 911 commission recommendations the na tional intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 had various provisi ons affecting border inspections cbp inspectors are charged with enforcing host of laws immigration law requires the inspection of all aliens who seek entry into the united states and every person is inspected to determine citizenship status and admissibility all goods being imported into the united states are subject to customs inspection but an actual physical inspection of all goods is not re quired there also ar laws that subject animals and plants to border inspections this report provides discussion of these various laws and the proce dural differences in what constitutes an inspection border inspections conducted each year number in the hundreds of millions prior to the creation of cbp the depar tment of justices immigration inspectors did most passenger inspections peaking at 534 million in fy2000 since all foreign nationals seeking entry into the united states must be inspected in terms of customs inspections approximately 226 of rail containers 52 of sea containers and 151 of trucks entering the united stat were physically inspected unlike customs and immigration inspections data animal and plant health inspections data enumerate only those passengers referred to secondary inspections for the purpose of an agricultural inspection there we re 44 million animal and plant inspections in fy2002 border inspections are funded through combination of fede ral discretionary appropriations and user fees in fy 2004 cbp was given budget authority of 2496 million for border security inspections nd trade facilitation at ports of entry historic funding data for inspections are not comparable across the legacy agencies as the budget data often in cluded activities in addition to the inspection functions some argue that this reorganization of border inspections has been long needed and is resulting in more streamlined and efficient set of procedures at the border with clear single chain of command others warn that the different types of inspections are quite complex in their own right and that the reorganization is exacerbating the conflicting priorities at the border ultimately resulting in many more people and goods being nt to secondary inspections

one face at the border now means that customs and border protection cbp inspectors are essen tially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections background laws pertaining to border inspections da back to the earliest days of the united states federal governme nt and border inspections hi storically were organized along functional responsibilities the federal authority to assess and collect duties on goods wares and merchandi imported into the country was established by the second act that the 1st congress enacted in 1789 and late r that year the administrative apparatus of the us customs service wa s authorized as well although congress exclusive role over naturaliz ation and immigration is found in article 1 of the us constitution the formal inspection of aliens entering the united states came later in our history in 1882 congress enacted w providing for an examination of all aliens who arrive in the united states and in 1891 established the bureau of immigration which later became the immigra tion and naturalization service ins laws regarding plant quarantine and inspection date back to 1912 for many years the ins and customs service inspectors were cross designated so that they could perform in itial examinations in each others functional responsibilities in practice this divisi on of labor reportedl resulted in ins inspectors being the lead at land ports of entry and customs service inspectors being the lead at air and sea ports of entry the us department of agriculture usda had always handled the inspection of plants and animals independently today the department of homeland security dhs is charged with overseeing most of the border inspections functions the bureau of customs and border protection cbp includes customs inspectors immigration inspectors agriculturalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32399crs2 1 the homeland security act pl 107296 placed immigration inspections investigations detention removal and the border patrol functi ons into bureau of border security kept the us customs service intact and placed both in the directorate of border and transportation security as it established the department of homeland security in 2003 the bush administration split up the us customs service and the proposed bureau of border security and reconfigured them into two bureaus one that pertains to border activities known as customs and border prot ection and one that pertains to interior enforcement known as immigration and customs enforcement 2 data provided by cbp office of congre ssional affairs in

been long needed and will result in more streamlined and efficient set of procedures at the border with clear single chain of command ot hers warn that the different types of inspections are quite complex in their own right and that the reorganization will serve to exacerbate competing prio rities ultimately resulting in many more people and goods being sent to secondary inspections this report opens with an overview of the parameters of the border both physical and legal it then presents the statutory basis for border inspections in the three major areas at the crux of the report is the third section that explains the policies and procedures fo r immigration customs and agricultural inspections section on trends by ports and modes of entry analyzes the volume and types of inspections in recent years leading up to the establishment of dhs the fifth section of this report summarizes budget and staffing over the past five years for these three functions the report conclude s with discussion of the issues and concerns that are emerging with the implementation of the unified border inspections policies and procedures parameters of the border ports of entry for the past several years there have been 317 official ports of entry poe into the united states at given port inspectors may be responsible for more than one mode of transportation even processing all three conveyance types of air land and sea buffalo and detroit for example have air sea and land poes but the likelihood of inspectors having mu ltiple responsibilities are greater at the smaller poes cbp acknowledges

principally commercial ports while others receive passengers legal boundaries from legal perspective the parameters of the border for inspection purposes are generally given flexible reading by courts and often vary from the geographical confines men tioned above border searches3 may occur when entry is made by land from the neig hboring countries of xico or canada at the place where ship docks in the united states after having been to foreign port and at any airport in the country where in ternational flights fi rst land courts have given the border more flexible readin g because of the significant difficulties in detecting the increasingly mobile smuggl er aside from searches at the actual physical border the law recognizes two gal constructs that allow border searches to move beyond the geographical conf ines of the actual port of entry functional equivalent border searches may be conducted within the interior of the united states the border search exception extends to those searches conducted at the functional quivalent of the border the functional equivalent of border is generally the first practical detention point after border crossing or the final port of entry4 it is justified because in essence it is different than search conducted at the border and occu rs only because of the impossibility of requiring the subject searched to stop at th physical border search occurs at the borders functional equi valent when 1 reasonable certainty exists that the person or thing crossed the border 2 reasonable certainty exists that there was change in the object of the search since it crossed the border and 3 the search was conducted as soon as practicable after the border crossing5 places such as international airports within the country and ports

func tional equivalents6 extended border search the border search exception may also be extended to allow warrantless searches beyond the border or its functional equivalent under the extended border search doctrin government officials may conduct warrantless search beyond the border or its functional equivalent if 1 the government officials have reasonable certainty or high degree of probability that border was crossed 2 they also have reasonable certainty that change in the object of the search has occurred between the time of the border crossing and the search and 3 they have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was occurring7 this threepart test ensures that suspect still has significant nexus with border crossing so that border offi cials can reasonably base their search on statutory and constitutional authority and to ensure that the search is reasonable8 authority for border inspections while the homeland security act h sa pl 107296 transferred the inspection functions of ins and customs rvice to dhs it did not revise the laws that authorize these inspections hsa did specify which laws dhs agricultural inspectors may utilize to c onduct inspections but it did not alter these underlying statutes consequently understanding the legal authorities that guided agricultural customs and immigration inspections functions before and after their transfer to dhs becomes increasingly important at this point it is unclear whether the one face at the border initiative promoted by dhs will also result in or perhaps some could argue even require the future consolida tion of the authorities each legacy agency individually possessed immigration inspections the former ins through the attorney general ag was responsible for enforcing and administering the immigration and nationality act of 1952 ina codifi ed as amended at 8 usc 1101 et seq the hsa as modified by the president transferred administrative authority over immigration enforcement to the directorate of

officer is statutorily defined in the ina to mean any employee or class of employees of the ins or of the united states designated by the attorney general individually or by re gulation to perform the functions of an immigration officer specified by the ina12 dhs however has implemented regulations clarifying the meaning of immigration officer with respect to dhs personnel the regulation 8 cfr 1031b designates various categories of cbp and ice officials as immigration officers authorized to exercise the powers and duties of such officers as specified by the ina and applicable regulations the regulation also allows the secretary of dhs to designate other employees of dhs or of the united states as immigration officers section 1357 of title 8 of the us code gives any officer or employee

interview in which indivi duals may be asked bout their citizenship their trip and about any goods they may be bringing into the country that they did not have when they departed individuals entering the united states via land border crossing are required to make verbal decl aration individuals arriving in the united states by air or sea are required to fill out customs declaration form these forms are usually provided by the airline or the cruise ship the customs declaration form requires individuals to provide certain personal information eg name date of birth place and country of residence passport information and information about the nature of the trip countries visited airline or cruise ship information nature of the trip business or pleasure the customs d eclaration form also requires information concerning goods an individual is bringing into the country duty may be assessed on the value of goods exceeding personal exemption limits the primary inspection for individuals arriving by air or sea will include review of the customs declaration as part of the interview process ba sed upon the results of the primary inspection some individuals may be refe rred to secondary inspection customs inspections are based upon number of factors eg behavioral analysis observational techniques incons istencies intelligence information canine units xray machines and

goods differences between the northern and southern border operational differences between customs inspections on the northern and southern borders arise due to several factors one is simply the nature of the crossborder traffic that predominates at ports of entry along each border the ports of entry on the southern border must deal with significantly gr eater amount of pedestrian and personal vehicle traffic than the northern border while the northern border contends with considerably more commercial traffic than does the southern border appendices and f in this report illustrate these differences for example the total number of personally operated vehicles entering the united states crossing the southern and northern borders for calendar year c 2002 was n early 1223 million of this total 898 million or 73 entered across th southern border while 325 million or 27 entered across the northern border of the 113 million freight truck crossings in cy2002 69 million or 61 entered acro ss the northern border while 44 million or 39 entered across the southern border of the 24 million rail freight crossings 18 million or 75 entered acr oss the northern border operational differences at the northern and southern borders are also caused by different levels of progress that have been made on the bilateral agreements between the united states and canada and the ited

purpose animal and plant health insp ection contributes to national security by preventing the entry of exotic plant and animal pests and diseases such pests and diseases pose potential thr eat to domestic agricultural production particularly in the fruit vegetable and livestock sectors traditionally these inspections have dealt with all possible threats regardless of whether they are deliberately or accidentally introduced since september 11 2001 and the anthrax incidents more attention s been given to preventing entry of agricultural pests and diseases that might be used as bioterrorism or agroterrorism agents against us agricultural and natural resources agricultural inspection occurs at us borders ports of entry inland sites and offshore locations inspections cover passeng ers arriving by vehicle airplane and ship cargo and international mail and commercial aircraft vessels trucks and railcars inspection methods include human sensory examination xray and detector dog inspection along with examination of documents accompanying incoming cargo to assure compliance with health and trade agreements some agricultural items may be allowed to enter from certain countries but not others these determinations are based on scientific risk assessments which are updated regularly using currently available information forbidden fruits and vegetables may har bor range of invasive plant diseases and pests for example oranges from certain foreign locations can introduce diseases like citrus canker or pests like the mediterranean fruit fly similarly sausages and other meat products from ma ny countries can contain animal disease organisms that can live for many months nd even survive processing meat scraps from meals on foreign ships and airplanes could contaminate domestic livestock feed sources if not properly disposed of foot and mouth disease fmd debilitating livestock disease can be transmitted on footwear or clothing if passengers passed through fmdaffected areas outbreaks of plant and animal diseases can cost millions of dollars to eradicate jeopardize us agricultural exports disrupt domestic food supplies and industries and erode public confidence in both the safety of food and the governments ability to safeguard it the transfer of approximately 2680 aphis inspectors to cbp accounts for about twothirds of the agricultural quarantine inspection aqi programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32399crs23 personnel and onethird of aphis total staffing dhs personnel inspect international arrivals of passengers and their ba ggage imported cargo and international package mail and intern ational conveyances while combining agricultural inspections with other border security activities can increase the number of inspectors who can monitor the borde r for prohibited agricultural products it requires diligence to maintain adequate agricultural inspections in light of more general customs and immigration concerns inspection procedures as with other inspection functions by former customs and ins personnel animal and plan t health inspectors use smart border or risk assessment approach to identify which people or containers to inspect intelligence based on documents and advance notice frequently can add security away from the united states and make the actual border more fluid for legitimate trade and immigration passenger inspection the passenger inspection program utilizes uniform inspection process at land sea and air ports of entry passenger baggage is inspected on random basis and also from informati on that passengers provide on declaration forms inspectors also speak with travelers at primary inspection stations to ascertain where they have come from and what ag ricultural and food products they may be carrying based on the point of departur inspectors judge whether passengers are more likely to be carrying for example prohibited fruit spices cheese or meat all agricultural products are subject to inspec tion and are confiscated if they are found to be infested or are prohibited entr due to known pest and disease risks to focus attention on the highest risk passengers agricultural inspections are coordinated with other inspection functions either physically or through intelligence sharing before dhs was created aphis cooperated with othe r inspectors through the border passenger processing initiativ the majority of passengers cleared through the system without delay aphis customs ins and the state department examined passenger lists and checked them against past violators and other data to determine the most effective targets for inspection inspector dog teams commonly known as the beagle brigade roam the ba ggage arrival areas and can effectively determine the presence of agricultural pr oducts without opening individual bags aphis also uses xray technology to qui ckly screen certain targeted baggage preclearance of passengers is sometimes more feasible than inspection at ports of entry passenger preclearance res ponsibilities were not tr ansferred to dhs passengers departing hawaii and puerto rico for the mainland pass through an aphis predeparture inspection even thoug h part of the united states with respect to immigration and customs these offshore locations could present agricultural threats to the mainland aphis also ope rates passenger preclearance programs in bermuda the bahamas aruba and at four cities in canada montreal toronto vancouver and calgary us inspector s preclear passengers passing through canada on their way to the united states since canadian passeng ers typically would not face the same level of agricultural inspection at us ports of entry pre clearance program for military passengers expedites the arrival of soldiers returning from countries that have pests that could harm domestic agriculturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32399crs24 cargo inspection cargo shipments are targeted for efficient inspections based on manifest descri ptions of the containers this assessment occurs at ports of entry and more commonly at departure ports notification while in transit especially for ships allows inspectors to target certain shipme nts upon arrival at port inspectors board ships planes rail cars and trucks in order to thoroughly inspect shipments in some cases products are offloaded at s ecure warehouses for more thorough stripout inspection in addition to inspecting agricultural products inspectors also examine shipments of auto parts or other products arriving in crates or pallets containing solid wood packing material that could contain harmful woodboring pests usda personnel also typically oversee and sometimes carry out any necessary fumigation of agri cultural cargo at ports of entry in addition to visual xray and detect or dog inspection aphis is adapting new technologies for finding biol ogical agents in cargo shipments the ruggedized advanced pathogen identification device r apid is handheld instrument that can identify pathogens in the field within 30 minutes instead of up to several days in the laboratory rapid is currently being sted for possible use at ports of entry preclearance of cargo adds to the secu rity of agricultural inspections and reduces the demand on inspectors at the borders commodity preclearance activities were not transferred to dhs often it is more practical and effective to check and monitor commodities for pests or diseases at the source the goal is to intercept destructive pests in their native lands before being transported to the united states aphis has special arrangements with number of countries and has corps of experts stationed overseas to supplement domestic inspectors aphis conducts 35 commodity preclearance programs overseas including for example mangoes from mexico blueberries from argentina bulbs from the netherlands and grapes from chile many of the programs are seasonal importers pay for preclearance through user fees some agricultural commodities require inspection only prior to departure for the united states precleared commodities are less likely to require intensive inspections at the port of entry although they may be subject to random inspection andor checks to ensure compliance with any other mitigating steps that were required to take place between the time of the preclearance inspection and arrival at the port of entry other commodities however require treatment before they can be cleared for entry the most common types of preclearance treatments include hot water immersion cold tr eatment and fumigation in addition to traditional cargo food and garbage from international flights and cruises can carry pests and diseases that could harm us agriculture all international trash must be handled and disposed of according to aphis regulations inspectors regularly examine internationa l modes of conveyan ce and consult with airlines cruise lines ship and rail companies to ensure that trash is being properly handled and discarded pr oblems identified during these inspections can lead to citations for violations smuggling and trade compliance smuggling

prosecute smugglers in fy2002 the staff seized 6000 kilograms of prohibited plant products and 9000 kilograms of prohibited animal products difference between northern and southern borders agricultural inspections are generally uniform at th land border crossing s with canada and mexico many of the pests and diseases of concern to agriculture have potential pathways into the united states through bot h the northern and southern borders for example while canada cannot grow citrus in its colder climate it doe s allow imports of tropical fruit from countries with know n fruit fly populations and thus is of concern to us agriculture other pests and diseases vary between canada and mexi co and necessitate different procedures for example liv cattle being imported from mexico are dipped in an insecticide bath prior to entry into the united states to prevent entry of exotic ticks at the northern border imports of cattle and beef products currently are prohibited due to bse mad cow disease restrictions these differences however are based on risk assessments of pest and disease differentia ls rather than the inherent location of the border similar differences in inspections

particularly important for assessing the inspections process 1 an inspection is secondary level interview of person or examination of hisher baggage based on entrance documents detector dog identifi cation or random selection at primary inspection station xray or visual examina tion of baggage contents may occur for cargo and international mail an inspection occurs when the shipment is opened or xrayed 2 an interception is the identification of items having quarantine significance that may be confiscated or transferred to another aphis facility for subsequent evaluation or treatment depending on the cargo 3 violation is counted when goods are found to be misre presented on documents import rules were violated or items were otherwise attempte d to be smuggled ships or aircraft can incur violations for not following certain arrival procedures or for improper handling of garbage since aphis uses targeted inspection approach it may be somewhat misleading to present ratio of goods or people inspected from the entire pool of international arrivals the actual percentage of all entries inspected would appear unusually small since only higherrisk entran ts are inspected by using intelligence and risk assessment models the subset of passengers or goods targeted for inspection should have notably higher ra tes of interceptions and vi olations than the entire pool of arrivals

and cargo inspec tions efficiently so as not to impede the flow of travel trade and tourism on dramatic illustration of the effect that increased inspections can have on the flow of trade at the border occurred in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the wait time for trucks crossing the border was nearly 12 hours at some ports of entry the land border between united states and canada wa s nearly closed and as result some us auto plants began to shut down due to lack of parts98 while most observers acknowledge that inspectors should strike balance of their competing goals some warn that cbp inspectors are too concerned about facilitating trade and travel to scrutinize passengers and goods thoroughly critics cite the percentages of cargo inspected 226 of rail containers 52 of sea containers and 151 of truc ks and the brevity of the average primary immigration inspection reportedly 45 seconds as indicati ons that the current inspections process is inadequate others maintain that cbp inspecti ons are now conducted with much more sophistication drawing on the combin ed knowledge and experience of the agriculture customs and immigration inspections processes they assert that the development of analytical targeting its which emphasize highrisk passengers conveyances and cargo is protecting borde r security while enabling the smooth flow of goods and people targeting highrisk shipments cbps ability to successfully target high risk containers cornerstone of the csi program is depe ndent upon information regarding which containers are most lik ely to contain contraband the rationale behind the advance cargo manifest rules is to provide cbp with the necessary information it needs to conduct its targetin g operations while many observers note the importance of the development of sophi sticated targeting mechanisms and the significant progress cbp has made in collecting advance manifest information others have raised concerns one issue is the use of the cargo manifest as the primary document by which cbp gathers information and conducts risk assessments on cargo shipments destined for the united states the cargo manifest has traditionally been used for commercial compliance purposes and has been characteriz ed by some as error prone some have expressed concern that it may not cont ain the necessary information such

screening aliens at the border since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks considerable concern has been raised because the 19 terrorists were aliens who apparently entered the united states legally on tem porary visas although the ina bars terrorists consular officers issuing the visas and immigration inspectors working at the borders did not have access to all the law enforcement and intelligence data that might identify potential terrorists congress has enacted major laws requiring information sharing and inter operable databases to screen potential terrorists and criminal aliens the most r ecent being the enhanced border security and visa reform act of 2002 whether these provisions are being successfully implemented remains an important policy question101 last fall the

mexicans with border crossing cards and the 1318 million foreign nationals who enter through the visa waiver program vwp have not been part of usvisit thus establishing variety of avenues for potential terrorists and criminals to elude detection through usvisits biom etric background checks the recent announcement to add foreign nationals w ho enter through vwp to usvisit may assuage some of these concerns about th inclusiveness of usvisit but does not resolve the issue that the nations participating in vwp are not expected to meet the programs october 1 2004 deadline for bi ometric

specifi c recommendations are targeting travel is at least as powerful weapon against terrorists as targeting their money the unite d states should combine terrorist travel intelligence operations and law enforcement in strategy to intercept terrorists find terrorist travel facilitators and constrain terrorist mobility the us border security system should be integrated into largernetwork of screening points that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities such as nuclear reactors the department of homeland secu rity properly supported by the congress should complete

supporters of cbi assert it should be used for transportation projects113 the current infrastructure at most us ports of entry many warn is not sufficient to accommodate the demands of the automated

sufficient lanes staff and resources according to some observers additional lanes may be necessary at many land ports of entry to accommodate the large number of individuals seeking entry into the united states some also express concern that the current infrastructure at air ports of entry may not be sufficient to accommodate usvisit when it is fully operational although federal immig ration inspectors have presence at selected airports the space that is occupied by them is not federally owned airports have limite d space and may not have dditional resources to fund new construction some contend that this could lead to significant delays as travelers try to make their way through ports of entry others mainta in that as the technologies used at the border become mo re sophisticated nd efficient concerns about long lines and delays will abate infrastructure limitations they assert will be resolved by the time usvisit is fully implemented114 interagency and inter department coordination cooperation between cbp and other agencies is critical to th success of cbps mission this necessity is highlighted by the recent spate of new regulations that have been promulgated by several agencies charged with border security related activities one example concerns advance notification requirements while cbp is completing its rulemaking regarding electronic advan ced manifest

than eight hours for food arriving by water four hours for food arriving by air or by rail and two hours for food arriving by truck at this time it is unclear as to how the two sets fda and cbp of advanced notice requirements will be integrated the fda rules indicate that importers or their agents must submit their advance notice using cbps abi or acs systems those food importers without abi or acs access will use fdas prior notice pn system interface according to the fda rule the commissioners of fda and cbp will publish plan detailing the integration and partial harmonization of these rules another example of the importance of interagency cooperation is evidenced in the various federal entities th at have the responsibilities fo r aliens who seek asylum in the united states duties

determination of credible fear and dojs executive office for immigration review asylum and removal hearings while the lead agencies for setting asylum standards and policy are uscis and eoir cbp inspect ors are quite often the first point of contact with arriving asylum seekers training of personnel as is evident from the discussions of the agricultural customs and immigration inspections the cbp inspector must learn set of complex laws and pro cedures as well as develop keen eye for violators and violations of the law some argue that it is too much to expect that those working in primary inspections are knowledgeable of the various types of travel documents116 as well as when foreign national is requi red to have travel document117 some express concern that the ability to recognize th documents and di fferentiate fraudulent documents from legitimate ones is learned only from experience and training the customs inspector is attuned to targ eting travelers and goods from cargo perspective skill some argue that is quite distinct from an immigration inspection that the inspector must also be facile in accessing numerous data systems and databases has raised furt her questions about the adequacy of training118 specific concerns are being raised that primary inspectors in cbp from customs and immigrations backgrounds may not have sufficient agricultural training somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32399crs52 119 us congress senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on technology terrorism and government information border technology keeping terrorists out of the united states 2003 hearing mar 12 2003argue that current cbp training in agriculture for new inspectors may be inadequate former aphis inspectors had required sc ience and biology backgrounds combined with extensive pest and disease training many stakeholders in the agricultural community are asking whether cbp administrators and front line inspectors will pay enough attention to agricultural inspections others assert that these concerns about training needs are exaggerated and observe that cbp has new 14week training course for inspectors they point out that the immigration and customs inspectors have been crossdesignated for years and are already familiar with the laws procedures and databases they also observe that agricultural inspections will remain specialized for the time being and will occur during secondary inspections database technology critics of the current t echnological infrastructure contend that it poses security risk the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 pl 107173 mandated the integration of immigration databases in addition to integrating data systems that contain federal law enforcement and intelligence information relevant to making decisions on visa admissibility and the removal of aliens pl 107173 also mandated that immigration databases be integrated with other relevant data systems the integration of law enforcement and intelligence data systems and databases with immigration data systems and databases continues to be c oncern and is considered critical for the cbp inspector to adequately screen individuals seeking entry to the united states many assert that the need for all agen cies involved in admitting aliens to share intelligence and coordinate activities is essential for us immigration policy to be effective in guarding homeland security some maintain that the reforms congress made in the mid1990s requiring all visa pplicants to be checked in the look out databases were inadequate because the da tabases across the relevant agencies were not interoperable and the vari ous agencies were territorial with their data they maintain that in the long run the most fficient and effective guard against the entry of aliens who would do us harm is an interagency and interdepartmental database that is accessible in real time to consular officers cbp inspectors and key law enforcement and intelligence officials others point to the cost time and complexity of developing interoperable databases they cite the difficulty thus far in determining what biometric identifiers are most appropriate for screening aliens119 they point out competing technologies of the existing databases in which vari ous key agencies have already heavily invested some maintain that success of the interope rable database technology depends on 100 inclusion of aliens applying for visas and seeking admission but that the sheer scope of such system poses real time implementation issues they also warn that if intelligence data become too accessible across agencies national security may actually be breached because sensitive information may be more likelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32399crs53 120

effort to acquire new comprehensive database system that dates back to the us customs service the automated commercial nvironment ace will replace acs which has been characterized as outmoded and inefficient120 difficulties with acs are evident in the different levels of automation availa ble for different modes of transportation the most recent evidence of the difficulties raised by uneven automation can be seen in the different rollout deadlines for th new mandatory advance electronic manifest rule proposed by cbp the lack of consistent automati on particularly for commercial trucks means that several different programs will have to be utilized fast paps brass etc until ace becomes functional the ace strategy is developing commercial auto mation protocols and proce dures so that

will be an interc onnected database of all government agencies involved in the tr ade process allowing users to submit data to one agency database available to other agencies questions remain however because ace and itds were envisioned prior to the merging of primary border agencies in dhs issues such as how ace and itds will be incorporated into the larger dhs strategy and how they will interact with other existing databases remain concern constitutional considerations fourth amendment through the laws of the legacy agencies inspectors have unique statutory aut horizations to inspect and search individuals and merchandise at the border as discusse d above beyond these specific authorities however inspections at the border must still adhere to the protections afforded by the constitution the scope of these protecti ons may be more limited at borders and ports of entry than in the interior of the united states the scope of protections also might vary with the partic ular laws being enforced related constitutional matter that arises in this realm is racial profiling racial profiling is the practice of targeting individuals for law enforcement purposes based on their race or ethnicity in the be lief that specific minority groups are more likely to engage in certain unlawful beha viors several courts have considered constitutional ramifications of the practice as an unreasonable search and seizure and more recently as denial of equal protection of the laws121 in the past somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32399crs54 121 continued prohibited certain discriminatory

in the immigration context the constitutionality of making distinctions on grounds of race or nationa lity is unsettled123 with respect to immigration inspections c onducted near but otherwise beyond the actual physical border however the case law seems to sugge st that race alone cannot justify stop by roving patrol124 but can be more determinative when questioned at fixed immigration

ssion and those who are within the united states after an entry irrespective of its legality in the latter instance the supreme court has recognized additional rights nd privileges not extended to those in the former category who are merely on the threshold of initial entry126 indeed supreme court jurisprudence still questions whether the constitution applies at all to aliens seeking entry at

of questions emerge while not an exhaustive set the selected questions below express few of the crosscutting concerns are the inspections reforms aimed at enhanced border security that congress enacted being implemented with sufficient urgency when the new technologies are fully implemented such as usvisit at land ports of entry will people and goods move expeditiously if additional resources and infrastru cture are needed to secure and facilitate border inspections s hould fees be raised or funds appropriated or should it be combination of both is an inspections system geared up to protect against terrorism still versatile enough to also protect the nation against travelers with contagious diseases such as vere acute respiratory syndrome sars or flexible enough to r ecognize bona fide asylum seekers should any of the underlying laws be amended to further tighten or expand the inspections process g mandating physical inspections of greater percentage of cargo or requiring inspections of certain types of shipments should the underlying laws be ame nded to reflect the reorganization of functions striking the balance of facilitating legitimate travel and trade with
