official employee or agent operating within the scope of authority of any of these governments or under color of such authority92 principles of state responsibility require state in breach of an obligation to another state or international organization wit hout justification or excuse under international law to terminate the violati on and provide redress93 the matter of reparations for war crimes is ordinarily something that is negotiated through peace treaty at the end of the armed conflict reparations may take the form of monetary compensation for the damages caused by the violation but they may also take such forms as restitution in kind restoration of the status quo or specific performance of an undertaking94 it is possible that the respective governments may reach an agreement for some type of repa ration and yet the individual victims are not guaranteed any compensation at all95 the primary remedy for breach of state responsibility with respect to the maltreatment of detainees appears to be th payment of reparations the red cross commentary on the gpw states that compensation for damage resulting from the unlawful act although not stipulated explicitly is undoubtedly implie d by the authors of article 12 consequently state which bears responsibility for violation of the convention is in duty bound to make good the damage caused either by restoring everything to the former condition or by paying damages the choice resting as general rule with the injured party in many cases however reparation will have to be limited to the payment of damages when the nature of the prejudice caused makes restoration impossible an example of this would be the physical and mental injury suffered by prisoners 96 even though compensation may be contem plated however an individual who is harmed may not be able to seek redress directly particularly when as under the convention private right of action ex pressly is granted under traditional international practice the state of an individuals nationality is regarded as having suffered the harm when an international agreement is breached and it is up to that state alone to press for reparation howeve r

for congress to provide more express prohibitions to enforce executive compliance with what already is the law of the land130 however series of doc uments released by the executive branch that discuss legal aspects of the treatment of detainees in the war on terrorism may be read to suggest that relevant trea ties are inoperative with respect to the executive branch unless congress has enacted
