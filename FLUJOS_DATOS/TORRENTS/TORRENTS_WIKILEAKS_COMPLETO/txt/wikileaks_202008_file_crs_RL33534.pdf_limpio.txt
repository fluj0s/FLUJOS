as one of the greatest economic success stories in modern times from 1979 when econo mic reforms began to 2007 chinas real gross domestic product gdp grew at an average annual rate of over 98 in 2007 it rose by 114 the chinese economy in 2007 in real terms was nearly 14 times larger than it was in 1979 and real per capita gdp was more than 10 times larger by some measurements china is now th worlds second largest economy and some analysts predict it could become the largest within few decades chinas economic rise has led to substantial increase in uschina economic relations total trade between the two countries surged from 5 billion in 1980 to 387 billion in 2007 us data in 2007 china was the united states second largest trading partner its third largest export market and its largest source of imports many us companies have ex tensive manufacturing operations in china in order to sell their products in the boomin g chinese market and to take advantage of low cost labor for manufacturing produc ts for export these operations have helped us firms remain internati onally competitive and have supplied us consumers with variety of low cost goods chinas largescale purchases of us treasury securities have enabled the federa l government to fund its budget deficits and help keep us interest rates relatively low however the emergence of china as major economic superpower has raised concern among many us policymakers some express concern over the large and growing us trade defic its with china which rose from 104 billion in 1990 to 256 billion in 2007 and are viewed by many members as an indicator that us chinese commercial relations are imbalanced or unfair others claim that china uses unfair trade practices such as an underv alued currency and subsidies to domestic producers to flood us markets with low cost goods and that such practices threaten american jobs wages and living standards numerous bills have been introduced in the 110th congress to address various chinese economic trade practices deemed to be unfair such as its currency policy china faces number of significant ec onomic challenges including the fallout from the global financial crisis which c ould slow its exports and hence economic growth weak banking system widening income gaps growing pollution unbalanced economic growth through ove rreliance on exports and widespread economic efficiencies resulting from nonmark et policies the chinese government views growing economy as vital to maintaining social stability this report provides background on ch inas economic rise and current economic structure and the challenges ch ina faces to keep its economy growing strong and describes chinese economic policies that are of concern to us policymakers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33534crs2 most recent developments on november 20 2 008 the bank of china reported that the exchange rate between the chinese renminbi and the us dollar stood at 683 an appreciation of 187 since chinas currency was reformed in july 2005 on november 15 2008 chinese president hu jintao attended the summit meeting of the group of 20 g 20 countries in washington dc to discuss the current global financial crisis hu stated that steady and relatively fast growth in china is in itself an important contribution to international fi nancial stability and world economic growth on november 9 2008 the chinese government announced it would implement twoyear 586 billion stimulus package mainly dedicated to infra structure projects on october 24 2008 the chinese government reported that approved foreign direct investment over the first nine months of 2008 had fallen by 26 over the same period in 2007 on october 8 2008 chinas central bank announced plans to cut interest rates and the reservere quirement ratio in order to help stimulate the economy the announcement coincided with announcements by the us federa l reserve and other central banks of major economies around the worl d to lower their benchmark interest rates china cut its rates again on october 29 on june 13 2008 the netherlands environmental assessment agency announced that according to its estimates china in 2007 became the worlds largest emitter of co2 surpassing the united states by 14 and accounting for tw othirds of last years global carbon dioxide increase on may 12 2008 chinas

economic development chinas economy prior to reforms prior to 1979 china maintained cen trally planned or command economy large share of the countrys economic out put was directed and controlled by the state which set production goals cont rolled prices and allocated resources throughout most of the economy duri ng the 1950s all of chinas individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33534crs3 household farms were collectivized into large communes to support rapid industrialization the central governme nt undertook largescale investments in physical and human capital during the 1960s and 1970s as result by 1978 nearly threefourths of industrial production was produced by centrally controlled state owned enterprises according to centrally planned output targets private enterprises and foreigninvested firms were nearly none xistent central goal of the chinese government was to make ch inas economy relatively selfs ufficient foreign trade was generally limited to obtaining only t hose goods that could not be made or obtained in china government policies kept the chinese economy relatively stagnant and inefficient mainly because there were few profit incentives for firms and farmers competition was virtually nonexistent nd price and production controls caused widespread distortions in the economy chinese living standard s were substantially lower than those of many other devel oping countries the chinese government hoped that gradual reform would significantly increase economic growth and raise living standards the introduction of economic reforms beginning in 1979 china launched seve ral economic reforms the central government initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers which enabled them to sell portion of their crops on the fr ee market in addition the government established four special economic zones ong the coast for the purpose of attracting foreign investment boosting exports and importing high technology products into china additional reforms which followed in stages sought to decentralize economic policymaking in several sectors especially trade economic control of various enterprises was given to provinc ial and local governments which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free market principles rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning additional coastal regions and cities were designated as open cities and development zones which allowed them to experiment with free market reforms and to offer tax and trade incentives to attract foreign investment in addition state pri ce controls on wide range of products were gradually eliminated chinas economic growth since reforms 1979present since the introduction of economic re forms chinas economy has grown substantially faster than dur ing the prereform period see table 1 from 1960 to 1978 real annual gdp growth wa s estimated at 53 figure many analysts claim is overestimated base d on several economic disasters that befell the country

economists generally attribute much of chinas rapid economic growth to two main factors largescale capital investment financed by large domestic savings and foreign investment and rapi d productivity growth these two factors appear to have gone together hand in hand economic reforms led to higher efficiency in the economy which boosted output and increased resources for additional investment in the economy china has historically maintained high rate of savings when reforms were initiated in 1979 domestic savings as per centage of gdp stood at 32 however most chinese savings during this period were generated by the pr ofits of stateowned enterprises soes which were used by the central government for domestichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33534crs5 investment economic reforms which included the decentralization of economic production led to substan tial growth in chinese hous ehold savings these now account for half of chinese domestic savings as result savings as percentage of gdp has steadily risen it reached near ly 50 in 2005 among the highest savings rates in the world several economists have c oncluded that productivity gains ie increases in efficiency in which inputs are used were another majo r factor in chinas rapid economic growth the improvements to productivity were caused largely by reallocation of resources to more productive uses especially in sectors that were formerly heavily controlled by the central g overnment such as agriculture trade and services for example agricultural reforms boosted production freeing workers to pursue employment in the more produc tive manufacturing sector chinas decentralization of the economy led to the ri of nonstate enterp rises which tended to pursue more productive activities than the centrally controlled soes additionally greater share of the econom mainly the export sector was exposed to competitive forces local and provincial governments were allowed to establish and operate various enterpri ses on market principles w ithout interference from the central government in addition foreign direct investment fdi in china brought with it new technology and pro cesses that boosted efficiency measuring the size of chinas economy the actual size of the chinas economy s been subject of extensive debate among economists measured in us dollars using nominal exchange rates chinas gdp in 2007 was 32 trillion its per capita gdp commonly used livingstandards measurement was 2450 such data w ould indicate that chinas economy and living standards are significantly lower than those of the united states and japan respectively considered to be the numbe rone and numbertwo largest economies see table 2 many economists however contend that using nominal exchange rates to convert chinese data into us dollars substantially under estimates the size of chinas economy this is because prices in china for many goods and services are significantly lower than those in the ited states and other developed countries economists have attempted to factor in these price differentials by using purchasing power parity ppp measurement which attempts to convert foreign currencies into us dollars on the basis of the actual pur chasing power of such currency based on surveys of the prices of various goods nd services in each respective country this ppp exchange rate is then used to convert foreign economic data in national currencies into us dollars because prices for many goods and serv ices are significantly lower in china than in the united states and other devel oped countries while prices in japan are higher the ppp exchange rate raises the estimated size of chinese economy from 32 trillion nominal dollars to 73 trillion ppp dollars significantly larger than japans gdp in ppps 43 trillion and little over half the size of the us economy ppp data also raise chinas per capita gdp from 2450 nominal tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33534crs6 2 in december 2007 the world bank lowered its previous estimate of chinas 2005 gdp on ppp basis by 40 to 53 trillion based on pr ice survey data supplied by the chinese government for the first time the new ppp timates are believed to be more accurate than those made previously see crs report rs22808 how large is chinas economy does it matter by wayne m morrison and michael f martin 3 in 2005 china announced that previous yea rs fdi data

example taiwanese businesses are believed to invest in china through other countries in order to circ umvent government restrictions in addition continued5380 the ppp figures indicate that while the size of chinas economy is substantial its living standards fall far be low those of the us and japan chinas per capita gdp on ppp basis was only 117 of us levels thus even if chinas gdp were to overtake that of the united states in the next few decades its living standards would likely remain substantially below those of the united states for many years to come2 table 2 comparisons of us

trade surpluses largescale foreign investment and large purchases of foreign currencies to maintain its exchange rate with the dollar and other currencies have enabled china to accumulate the worlds

19 trillion making it the worlds largest holder chinas major trading partners chinas trade data often differ significantly from those of its major trading partners especially with the united states this is largely due to the large share of chinas trade both exports and imports pa ssing through hong kong which reverted back to chinese rule in july 1997 but is treated as separate customs area by most countries including china and the united stat china treats large share of its exports through hong kong as chinese exports to hong kong for statistical purposes while many countries that im port chinese products through hong kong generally attribute their origin to china for statistical purposes according to chinese trade data its top five trading partners in 2007 were the european union eu japan the united states the 10 nations that constitute the association of southeast asian na tions asean and hong kong see table 6 chinas largest export markets were the eu the united states and hong

importance of the us market to chinas export sector is likely to be much higher than is reflected in chinese trade data based on us data on chinese exports to the united states and chinese data on

labontemajor longterm challenges facing the chinese economy chinas economy has shown remarkable ec onomic growth over the past several years and many economists project that it will enjoy fairly healthy growth in the near future however economists caution that these projections are likely to occur only if china continues to make major reforms to its economy failure to implement such reforms could endanger future growth the global financial crisis this crisis currently poses the biggest overall threat to chinas economic growth china is highly dependent on foreign trade and i nvestment for its economic growth and thus an economic slowdown among chinas major trading partners could have big impact on chinas future growth discussed in more detail below an inflexible currency policy china does not allow its currency to float and therefore must make largescale purchases of dollars to keep the exchange rate within certain target levels although the yuan has appreciated someone since reforms were introduced in july 2005 analysts contend that it remains highly undervalued against the dollar economists warn that chinas currency policy has made the economy overly dependent on expor ts and fixed investment for growth and has promoted easy cred it policies by the banks these policies may undermine longterm economic stability by causing overproduction in various sector s increasing the level of non performing loans held by the banks and boosting inflationary pressures19 stateowned enterprises soes which account for about one third of chinese industrial producti on put heavy strain on chinas economy over half are believe d to lose money and must be supported by subsidies mainly through state banks government support of unprofitable soes di verts resources away from potentially more efficient and profita ble enterprises in addition the poor financial condition of many soes makes it difficult for the government to reduce trade barriers out of fear that doing so would lead to widespread bankruptcies among many soes the banking system faces several major difficulties due to its financial support of soes and its failure to ope rate solely on market based

money losing soes by pressuring state ba nks to provide low interest loans without which large number of th soes would likely go bankrupt currently over 50 of stateowned bank loans now go to the soes even though large share of loans are not likely to be repaid the precarious financial state of the chinese banking system has made chinese reformers reluctant to open the banking sector to foreign competition corruption poses anot her problem for chinas banking system because loans are often made on the basis of political connections this system promotes widespread inefficiency in the economy

which became violent in 2005 compare d with 53000 protests in 2003 over such issues as pollution government corr uption and land seizures20 number of protests in china have stemme d in part from frustrations among many chinese especially peasants that they are not benefitting from chinas economic reforms and rapi d growth and perceptions that those who are getting rich are doing so because

funds in many cas government connections not market forces are the main determinant of successful firms in china many us firms find it difficult to do business in china because rules and regulations

chinese investments in the us economy would produce long term economic benefits for china some chinese investments in us financial companies have fared poorly and chinese officials would be reluctant to put additional money into investments th at were deemed to be too risky30 secondly sharp economic downturn of the chines economy would likely increase pressure on the government to invest money at

offer relatively low rate of retu rn when china has such huge development needs at home many chinese officials contend that maintaining strong economic growth in china is the most effective action
