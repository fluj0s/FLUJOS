april 12 2005 brian w cashell specialist in quantitative economics government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848investing social security funds in the stock market some economic considerations summary for the time being social security receipts are more than enough to fund current benefits but beginning in 2017 unde r current law benefits are projected to exceed social security receipts at that point if not befo re either bene fits will have to be cut taxes will have to be raised or the shortfall will have to be made up either by tapping nonsocial security revenues which would reduce the unified federal budget surplus or by an increase in federal borrowing any current proposal to extend the financia l life of social security is likely to include increases in taxes cuts in benefits or both in addition to those possibilities is the notion of allowing beneficiaries to contribute some of their social security payments directly into personal accounts because equity has hi storically yielded higher rate of return than have treasury securities it is argued that allowing individuals to invest some of their contri butions in the stock market would offset at least some of the effects of either tax in creases or benefit cuts in any package of reforms between 1926 and 2003 the average annual total rate of return on large corporate stocks was 72 after adjustin g for inflation that was 49 percentage points higher than the average real re turn of 23 on longterm government bonds over the same period but there is substan tial variation in rate s of return which diminishes as the holding period grows longer even with relatively long holding periods there are still instances of belowzero rates of return the longest holding period with belowzero return for stoc ks was 18 years and 11 months although longer holding periods have historically reduced the volatility of stock returns that does not necessarily mean that the risk asso ciated with holding stocks falls as holding periods lengthen recent subject of speculation has been the risk that the retirement of the baby boom generation will coincide with s ubstantial selloff of assets some times referred to as the asset market meltdown hypothesis the concern is that as increasing numbers of retirees sell the assets they have accumulated over their working lives in order to continue the lifestyles to which they have become accustomed asset prices will decline theory alone seems insufficient to predict what might happen to asset prices when the baby boom generation begins to retire there are reasons to believe that they will sell some of their assets but there are also reasons to believe that those sales will not be so large as to disrupt financial markets or cause precipitous drop in the prices of ssets traded in those markets this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848contents t h q u i t p r m i u m 2 personal accounts 7 w h t h p p n s t s t c k p r i

2041 thus without any changes the trust fund would have to raise 47 trillion to finance projected benefit payments between 2017 and 2041 to do that under current law the securities held by the trust fund would have to be redeemed by the treasury technically speaking they are nonmarketable see the 2005 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal oldage and survivors insurance and disability insurance trust funds mar 23 2005 available on the social security administration website at httpwwwssagovoacttrtr05tr05pdfinvesting social security funds in the stock market some economic considerations social security was first established in 1935 as foundation on which to secure the income of the retired population it does so by transferring income from the working population to those who are longer in the labor force because of retirement or disability those currently working thus support the retired population with the expectation that future workers will in turn provide for their retirement benefits it also serves social welfar function by replacing relatively more income to retirees who were lowincome earne rs and their survivors and dependents for the time being social security receipts are more than enough to fund current benefits but beginning in 2017 unde r current law benefits are projected to exceed social security receipts1 at that point if not before either benefits will have to be cut taxes will have to be raised or the shortfall will have to be made up either by tapping nonsocial security revenues which would reduce the unified federal budget surplus or by an increase in federal borrowing on paper the cumulative excesses of social security receipts over benefits have been deposited in trust fund which s been entirely invested in treasury securities while the trust fund accounts s how considerable assets in fact those receipts have been used to fund the gene ral operations of the federal government because of the availability of surplus social security r eceipts the federal government has had to borrow less in the past leaving the outstanding federa l debt held by the public less than it otherw ise would have been because projected receipts ar expected to fall short of what will be needed to fund benefits concern that changes must be made to ensure the longrun integrity of the system is spreading any proposal to extend the financial life of social security is likely to include increases in taxes or cuts in benefits but in addition to those possibilities is the notion of allowing beneficiaries to contribute some of their social security payments directly into personal accounts because equ ity has historically yielded higher rate of return than have treasury securities it is argued that allowing individuals to

any package of reforms investing in the stock market could be significant change in public policy it would affect the overall distri bution of assets and income and the allocation of risk there is also question of what will happen to stock prices if and when retiring baby boomers begin to sell off their assets this report explores the economic consequences of investing social security receipts in the stock market as well as the possible consequences for equity ma rkets when the baby boomers retire the equity premium an important fact motivating those who favor allowing social security funds to be invested in the stock market is that historically stocks have yielded higher rate of return than have treasury securities or bonds the difference between the yield on stocks and relatively less risky i nvestments such as treasury bonds is known as the equity premium treasury securities are generally considered to be the least risky asset in any portfolio because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government moreover owners of treasury securities can expect relatively predictable return on their investment owners of corporate stocks on the other hand face less predictable re turns on their assets the return on corporate stock depends on the earnings of the company both present and future dividends paid out depend on present earnings and the value of the stock itself depends on investors ex pectations about future earnings as earnings fluctuate with overall economic c onditions and with conditions in various sectors of the economy companies tend to ad just the dividends they pay out as the outlook for companys prospects varies i nvestor demand for share of its future dividends will vary and hence so will the value of stock in that company because of the potential for variation in the return on equity investments which includes the possibility that the value of an equity investment can fall to zero investors demand premium relative to the return on safer assets to compensate them for the additional risk they assume between 1926 and 2003 the average annual total rate of return on large corporate stocks was 72 after adjustin g for inflation th at was 49 percentage points higher than the average real re turn of 23 on longterm government bonds over the same period2 those figures may however be mislead ing since averages do not account for the substantial variation in returns for bot h types of assets ove r shorter periods of timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848crs3 figure 1 plots the 12month real rates of retu rn on stocks and longterm government bonds monthly since 1926 source ibbotson associates clearly over successive 12month periods there was large variation in the returns to holding stocks or bonds with the notable exception of the end of the great depression the real rate of return to holding stocks frequently approached 50 and there were more than few periods of substantial losses as well returns on bonds appear to have been less volatile and to have fluctuated within narrower range when it comes to planning for retirem ent however 12 months is probably not an appropriate holding period for evaluating risks and returns figure 2 shows the real rates of return over successive fi veyear holding periods plotted monthly1926 1932 1937 1942 1947 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1993 1998

portfolio management fall 1994 pp 1524 6 zvi bodie on the risk of stocks in the long run financial analysts journal vol 51 issue 3 mayjune 1995 7 such large premium implies an unbelievable aversion to risk on the part of investors siegel and thaler put it this way the risk aversion indicated by hi storical risk premia suggests that investors would be willing to pa 49 of their wealth to avoid 50 chance of losing half of their wealth see jeremy j siegel and richard h thaler the equity premium puzzle journal of economic perspectives vol 11 1 winter 1997 pp 191 200 it appears to follows from these data is that those who invest in equities at younger age and who presumably look forw ard to longer holding period face less risk than those who are older at the time they make their investment but that is not necessarily the case samuelson has pointed out that as long as the stock market is efficient and stock prices re flect all available informati on then equity prices are not any more likely to rise in the future just because they have fallen in the past while longer holding periods may give investors more time to recover from market crash they also offer more opportunities for crashes5 bodie argues that risk actually increases as holding periods lengthen he finds evidence in the options market that it is more expensive for investors to hedge against any risk associated with owning stoc ks the longer the holding period is6 one development that is apparent is that the difference between the return on stocks and the return on bonds has decline d interestingly the puzzle has been not why did the premium on stocks decline but rather why had it been so large in the first place risk premium of over four percentage points is larger than can be explained by most models of consumer beha vior and thus explaining the size of the equity premium has been challenge to economists7 the reason this is important is that if there is obvious rationale to ex plain the large histori cal difference in the yields on stocks and bonds then it might not be prudent to expect that large difference to persist personal accounts reducing social security taxes to fund personal retirement accounts would increase the federal governments budget deficit as long as it was mandatory that any reduction in social security taxes be invested in these personal accounts this decrease in government saving would be ffset by an increase in household saving unless households responded by reducing other kinds of saving there would be net consequences for the national saving rate it is possible though that if individuals expected higher returns from their retirement accounts they might feel free to reduce other forms of saving if instead personal account s were introduced without any cuts in social security taxes and were made mandatory that would likely yield an increase in both household and national saving the net increase in household saving however would likely be less than the amount deposited in the accounts because in somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848crs8 8 similarly those near retirement at the incepti on of social security received very high rate of return since they made few contributions but nonetheless received benefits the same thing happens anytime taxes and benefits are simultaneously increased the first person to receive monthly benefits from the social secu rity program paid total of 22 in social security taxes and ended up collecting over 20000 in total benefits see kevin lansing can the stock market save social security federal reserve bank of san francisco economic letter 9837 dec 11 1998 p 5 9 if these bequests were funded by cut in social security benefits there would be transfer relative to current law from married couples to singles because of the reduced survivors benefitscases saving that would have occurred anyway will simply be shifted into the new accounts expanding the social security system to include personal accounts would give individuals discretion as to whether or not to invest some of those funds in the stock market social security as it stands is defined benefit program if the system were expanded to include personal accounts so accounts might do better than others thus social security would take on so of the characteristics of defined contribution as opposed to defined benefit retirement plan this means that social security benefits could vary significantly even for individuals with similar career earnings there is another aspect of risk that might be addr essed with the introduction of personal accounts there are more than few who now have doubts as to whether or not they will ever receive the retirem ent benefits social security currently promises in the absence of any changes substituting assets he ld in personal accounts for those held in the trust fund that repr esent the promise of future benefits might reduce perceived risk even in the case of personal account invested in equity related type of risk inhe rent in social security the way it now stands is that the rate of return within social security can differ substantially from one person to another even those of the same age ce it is defined benef it plan those who live long time after retirement r eceive substantially more nd thus earn higher return on their contributions than do those who only live relatively short time after retirement this is especially so in the case of single individuals8 depending on how personal accounts were designed m oney invested in them might be passed on in the form of be quest if so the introduction of personal accounts would alleviate some of the income redistribution associ ated with different life spans9 social security also through its bene fit formulae redistributes some income from high to low wage earners as way of reducing the risks of the elderly falling below the poverty line any switch from fined benefit to defined contribution retirement plan might tend to reduce the amount of redistribution and thus tend to increase any inequality in the distribution of income among the elderlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848crs9 10 see for example andrew b abel will bequests attenuate the predicted meltdown in stock prices when the baby boomers retire federal reserve bank of philadelphia working paper 012 jan 2001 pp 16 11 the correlation coefficient between the two series is 0603what happens to stock prices when the baby boom retires there are many factors that determine the ups and downs of the stock market but recent subject of speculation has been the risk that the retirement of the baby boom generation will coincide with subs tantial selloff of assets sometimes referred to as the asset market meltdow n hypothesis the concern is that as increasing numbers of retirees sell the assets they have accumulated over their working lives in order to continue the lifestyles to which they have become accustomed asset prices will decline10 dramatic decline in the value of financial assets would be problem for pensi on funds whose funding status might be jeopardized just when they are faced with increasing obligations it would also threaten any advantage personal accounts inve sted in the stock market might have from theoretical standpoint two co mmon presumptions might support that conclusion first at the center of most economic models of personal saving is the assumption that individuals seek to avoid substantial fluctuations in their living standards over the course of their lifetimes sec ond is the observation that individual incomes tend to rise during the course of their working lives and then decline after retirement taken together these two considerations lead to the prediction that most people will tend to save relatively less when they are young and when they are retired and save more when they are in their peak earning years in this simple model as baby boomers reach their peak earning and thus their peak saving years it might be reasonable to expect an increase in the demand for financial assets but as they age it might be presumed that on retirement they will gradually draw down their holdings of asse ts to finance consumption in order to maintain their standard of living thus if there is surge in retirements as the baby boom generation ages the increased sales of financial assets mig ht be expected to drive down their prices substantially figure 7 plots the proportion of the overall population aged 45 to 64 since 1950 also shown is the standard and poors index of 500 stock prices adjusted for inflation

appears to be some correla tion between real stock prices and the age distribution of the population there re mains more to consider in the simple model of saving behavior scribed above there are ot her factors motivating saving in addition to smoothing consumption over the course of ones lifetime some may save in order to insure against events less predictable than the drop in income experienced at retirement in other word s some may save for precautionary reasons to the extent that they do if they have run of bad luck or are f aced with unexpected outofpocket medical expenses those expenses need not force cut in consumption those with children may ve the additional motive of leaving bequest to the extent that these two motives influence savi ng behavior wealth holdings might not be expected to decline after retirement recent developments also give reason to doubt unique connection between the age distribution and the saving rate between 1990 and 2003 the share of those aged 45 to 64 and presumed to be in their peak saving years increased by about five percentage points over that same peri od the personal saving rate fell from 70 to 14 of disposable income if anything it is clear that knowledge of prospective changes in the age distribution alone is in sufficient to make pr edictions about saving behavior or asset prices cross section data confirm that saving rates do more or less follow the pattern suggested by the life cycle model one s ource for saving data by age group is the consumer expenditure survey published by the bureau of labor statistics of the department of labor table 2 presents these estimates of saving rates by age for 2002 because saving data are residuals in that saving is simply the difference between income and expenditures and because of the size of the sample on which the estimates are based there is considerable uncertainty associated with these estimates keeping possible statistical certainty in mind the crosssectional datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848crs11 confirm the idea of tendency of the saving rate to vary over the course of individual lifetimes table 2 saving rates by age group 2002 under 25 25 to 34 35 to

conducted by the board of governor s of the federal reserve among the questions asked in this survey is whethe r or not the responding family saved during the previous year table 3 shows the results for the 2001 survey these data also confirm the expected hump in the crosss ection with fewer of those families at the ends of the age distribution saving th an those in the middle of working age however they also indicate that ma ny families at the upper end of the age distribution are still saving and not necessa rily selling assets they accumulated over their working lives table 3

the data seem to confirm the main id ea of the life cycle model which is that saving declines in retirement however these measures of saving are calculated by simply subtracting expenditures from income that may be an overly simple approach if the reason for saving is to accumulate wealth either to finance retirement or as rainy day fund then ch anges in wealth may be more useful measure of saving table 4 shows estimates of net wort h by age group based on the results of the 2001 scf the mean is the average wealth holding of each age class and the median represents the midpoint of the

survey there are errors associated with these estimates the more so because of size of the age cohorts in the sample nonetheless the figures show that both net financial asse ts and total net worth rise up through the group aged 55 to 59 and then drop off somewhat what may be more significant though is that the dropoff in wealth for those groups that have largely retired is not as large as might have been expected there is siza ble drop between the 60to64 and 65to69 cohorts but the fact that net worth incr eases for the 70to74 age group suggests that some of that apparent drop ma be due to sampling errors these data lend support to the idea that re tirees finance their retirement in part by drawing down their wealth but the more remarkable characteristic of these data may be that the decline in wealth of the very elderly is not as great as might be expected that suggests that bequests nd precautionary saving may be as important motives to save as retirement that would make it less likely that there would be massive selloff of ssets as the babyboom generation retires in study published by the urban institute rogers toder and jones examined the consequences of the aging population on both private and public saving they point out that the increase in the proportion of the population that is aged is only part of the story they point to two other shif ts that may also influence private saving one is near term increase in the share of the population that will be in their peakhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848crs13 12 diane lim rogers eric toder and landon jones economic consequences of an aging population the retirement project at the urban institute occasional paper number 6 sept 2000 24 pp saving years the other is decline in the share of young adults in the population young adults are typically di ssavers so that would tend to raise the saving rate or at least offset any decline due to other shifts as result of the shifting age distribution the authors project that the pr ivate saving rate would rise through the year 2010 but after that the increasing numbers of aged would push it back down although it would remain bove the rate at the beginning of the projection12 the data in table 4 also hint at wealth distribution that is significantly unequal the ratio of mean to median is an in indication of the degree of inequality in given distribution an increase in the share of total wealth held by the richest households in the distribution will increase th ratio of the mean to the median in the case of net financial assets the ratio is 6 or 7 for most of the age classes while for total net worth it is 3 or 4 that indicates that the distribution of net financial assets is more unequal than the distribution of total net worth part of the reason for that difference is the equalizing aff ect of including home equity wealth is more unequally distributed than income table 5 presents data from the 2001 scf showing the degree to which the distribution of wealth is concentrated the data show that those households in th top 1 of the wealth distribution account for nearly onethird of all wealth the top10 accounts for over twothirds of

of governors of the federal reserve system note data reflect only assets held directly by households and do not include those held by pension funds and other institutions it would seem plausible that at leas t those households at the top of the distribution might not have to sell large fraction of their assets in order to maintain their standards of living upon retirement th more that is the case the less reason there would be to expect large increas in sales of assets as the baby boom generation begins to retire there is at least one reason to expect at least some asset sales as retirements

another consideration that might not affect the holdings of assets as much as how they allocated frequently heard rule of thumb for investors is that as they get older they should rearrange th eir assets in order to increase the overall liquidity of their portfolios that might for example involve shift away from equities and into bonds or cash whether or not it is wise investment strategy to the extent that investors do rearrange their portfolios as they age it is possible that an aging population could affect th relative prices of assets it has also been pointed out that if investors are rational and forwardlooking then whatever drop in asset prices might be in the cards would be anticipated and be reflected in current asset prices13 otherwise investors could profit by shortselling those assets well in advance of any ex pected selloff as babyboomers retire thus far only crosssecti on data have been presente d those data indicate how saving and wealth vary by age group at single point in time but they may not be sufficient to project how individuals will behave as they move up the age distribution there may be important reasons other than age that determine how individuals approach the decision how mu ch to save and how much wealth to accumulate and hold over the course of their lives for example it may be that those who grew up during the great contracti on beginning in 1929 developed different attitude about the importance of thrift from those who make up the babyboom generation if that is true it would be unr easonable to use the behavior of the current elderly population to predict the fu ture behavior of babyboomers aside from the question of what baby boomers will do with their assets when they retire is also the question of who will buy those assets when and if there is significant selloff if investors do not anticipate large scale liquidation when the baby boom retires and buyers are hard to come by then substantial decline in asset prices is possibility but in this circumstance it might be remembered that if there is not domestic market for those asse ts one may be found overseas whether overseas buyers absorb any increase in the supply of financial assets will depend on overall macroeconomic conditions both here and abroad not to mention the fact that the effects of demographic factors on financial markets may not be limited to the united states theory alone seems insufficient to predict what might happen to asset prices when the baby boom generation begins to retire there are reasons to believe thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848crs15 14 ibid 15 barry p bosworth ralph c bryant and gary burtless the impact of aging on financial markets and the economy survey center for retirement research at boston college oct 2004 pp 59they will sell some of their assets but there are also reasons to believe that those sales will not be so large as to disrupt financial markets or cause precipitous drop in the prices of assets traded in those market s consequently there have been numerous empirical studies attempting to model the effects of changes in the age distribution of the population on asset markets recently poterba examined the relationship between the age distribution of the population and returns on financial assets14 he found that the evidence for connection between an aging population and th financial market was weak he also points out that it may be much more impor tant how an aging population affects fiscal policy and what the consequences are for future budget deficits bosworth bryant and burtless examined the literature concerning the economic effects of the aging of the baby boom gene ration including those studies that focused on the effects of changes in the age distribution on the prices of financial assets15 some of those studies are limited to the united states and some examine the effectof demographic changes in different countri overall the authors found that the evidence for substantial effect on asset pri ces is fairly weak the authors note that part of the difficulty is that studies that cover different time periods yield different results another difficulty with any study i nvolving longerterm shifts in asset prices is accounting for all of the relevant variables that may be influential moreover in some countries studies found that change s in the age distribution had the opposite effect on asset prices from that which the lifecycle model would suggest other things being equal the retirem ent of the babyboom generation seems likely to result in at least some decline in the household saving rate at the same time in the absence of either changes to social security as it now stands or cuts in other categories of federal spending or tax increases the increase in outlays for benefits and the relatively smaller payroll tax base mean that there will be substantial budget deficits as the baby boomers reach retirement age moreover because social security is mostly payasyougo program it represents substantial income transfer from workers to retirees that means that larger share of total income will accrue to those with relatively lower saving rate s and smaller share will be accounted for by those with relatively higher saving rates if both hous ehold and government saving rates fall the aggregate national saving rate will as well policy considerations investing personal accounts in stocks has the potential to yield greater returns than are currently provided by social secur ity but along with those higher returns there is greater risk while longer holding periods have histor ically exhibited less variation in returns there have been in stances where holding periods as long as nearly 19 years left investors wo rse off than when they started httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32848crs16 if large numbers of participants decide to invest in equities and social security taxes are reduced that may have an influe nce on the relative rates of return on stocks and government bonds any increased dema nd for stocks will tend to push up their prices and thus reduce their rates of return if social security taxes are reduced then the federal government will have to borrow more the increased supply of treasury securities would push down their price and increase their yield the introduction of personal accounts could result in lower equity premium to the extent that retiring baby boomer s sell off assets that they accumulated during their working lives that might push down the prices on those assets it might not be dramatic decline but it does add to the risks faced by those who invest personal accounts in the stock market there is at least one other possibly sign ificant policy consider ation if personal accounts are established and the governme nt encourages those with accounts to invest in the stock market the government may have increased interest in the performance of the stock market the performance of equity markets might become more than an economic indicator it might become policy goal
