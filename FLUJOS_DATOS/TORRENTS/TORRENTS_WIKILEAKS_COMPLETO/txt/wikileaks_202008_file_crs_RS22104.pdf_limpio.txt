simple example of how it works in drug trafficking case this report is an abridged version without footnotes appendices or in most instances quotation marks or citations to authority of crs report rl32846 how the federal sentencing guide lines work two examples introduction congress created the united states sentencing commission and authorized it to promulgate sentencing guidelines in order to eliminate and prevent unwarranted sentencing disparity the statutes that define federal crimes still identify the maximum penalties and in some cases the minimum sentences that may be assessed the guidelines howev er provide the standards th at most often speak to how federal criminals will be punish ed within those boundaries the guidelines assign most federal crimes to one of fortythree offense levels based on the severity of the offense every offender is assigned to one of six criminal history categories based upon th extent of his or her past misconduct the combination of offense levels and criminal history categ ories governs the seve rity of th penalties assessed under the guidelines this is walk through the guidelines using as vehicle controlled substance sentencing case calcu lated according to the guidelines score keeping procedure i find the applicable guideline which sets the base offense level for the crimes of conviction ie the level assigned based on the na

sentencing table final offense level pointscriminal history points sentencing range base offense level korakis drug courier in an ecstasy smuggling and marketing scheme pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess ecstasy and marijuana with the intent to distribute it in violation of 21 usc 841 a1 846 the statutory index ussg appa identifies ussg 2d11 as the pplicable guideline section the drug quantity table in subsection 2d11c sets th base offense level according to the type and amount of the controlled substance i nvolved the type and amount of controlled substances involved include not only those that form the basis for the offense of conviction but also the types and amounts of controlled substances in any related relevant conduct korakis transported two packages of unmarked pills and delivered them to second courier who was later rrested with what the probation services presentencing report termined to be 9608 grams of mix ture of containing mdma and methamphetamine in pill form and 6044 grams of hashish in order to provide uniform sentencing standard in cases involving more th an one type of controlled substance section 2d11 includes drug equivalency tables which allow conversion into uniform marijuana equivalency standard when as here pills contain more than one controlled substance the higher equivalent is used under the drug equivalency tables 1 gram of hashish is treated as the equivalent of 5 grams of marijuana 1 gram of mdma is treated as 500 grams of marijuana but 1 gram of methamphetamine is treated as 2 kilograms 2000 grams of marijuana thus korakis base offense level is the base offense level for 195182 kilograms 1 951820 grams of marijuana 30220 grams for the hashish 5 x 6044 grams plus 1921600 grams for the thamphetamine mix 2000 x 9608 under 2d11c the base offense level for 195182 k ilograms of marijuana is 32 at least 1000 kg but less than 3000 kg of marijuan base offense level 32 section 2d11 modifies the base offense vel to account for seve ral aggravating and mitigating factors some which are found in ko rakis case and some which are not the factors inapplicable to korakis include 1 possession of danger ous weapon 2 levels 2 operating plane or other smuggling conveya nce 2 levels 3 trafficking in prison 2 levels 4 internet ma rketing 2 levels and 5 various manufacturingrelated increases 2 to 6 levels depending upon the circumstances the facts in korakis however do implicate few of the modificati ons mentioned in section 2d11 korakis argued that as simple mule he was titled to the 2 level re duction but the court rejected his argument on the basis of evidence of more substantial participation than that of simple courier his offense level remained the same adjusted offense level 32 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22104crs3 the failure to qualify for the mitigation adjustment to which low level offenders are entitled also cost korakis 2 level increase because his offense involved methamphetamine smuggling counterbalanced by 2 vel safety valve reduction available to low level fi rst time cooperative offenders adjusted offense level 32 adjustments role in the offenses adjustments are common feature of controlled substance cases as the discu ssion of section 2d11 above make s clear there are five role in the offense adjustments 1 leaders 4 levels for organizer or leader of crime with 5 or more participants or that is otherwise extensive 3 levels for manager or supervisor of such crime 2 levels for an organizer leader manager or supervisor of any other criminal activity 2 minor players 4 levels for minimal participants 2 levels for minor participants 3 abuse of trust or us of special skill 2 levels 4 fagan enhancement 2 levels for the use of mino r and 5 use of body armor 4 levels for the use of body armor during drug trafficking crime or crime of violence 2 levels for drug trafficking or violent crime involvi ng the use of body armor had korakis been able to claim reduced participation he would have been entitled to offense level reductions both an adjustment and reduction under 2d11 in the calculation of his initial sentencing level but he was not and the other role in the offense adjustments did not apply either adjusted offense level 32 obstruction accepting responsibility although obstruction of justice adjustments are fairly common in controlled substance cases the issue did not arise in korakis under either the general obstruction or the enhancement guideline for dangerous flight but he did qualify for the general 2 level acceptance of responsibility reducti on and an additional 1 level reduction for an early guilty plea adjusted offense level 29 d multiple counts to account the conviction of defendant for more than one crime without pancaking charges involving essentially the sa misconduct the guidelines apply grouping procedur under which similar offenses are grouped together once the multiple crimes for which the defendant has been convicted have been collected in closely related groups the offense level applicable to each group is determined using the highest offense level attributable to the most serious crime within the group with one exception for the cr imes whose offense levels depend upon the amount of money stolen or the extent of damage caused or the amount of drugs manufactured or dealt the amounts are cumu lated the offense level for each group having been determined the group with the hi ghest offense level is assigned unit as is any group whose offense level is within 4 levels of the lead group any group within 5 to 8 offense levels of that of the lead group is assigned half unit other groups are disregarded the offense level for the lead group is then increased by the total number of units add 1 level for 15 units 2 levels for 2 units 3 leve ls for 25 or 3 units 4 levels for 35 to 5 units and 5 levels for more than 5 units the resulting total offense level of the lead group is the basis for the defendants final sentencing korakis pleaded guilty to one count indictment and thus his case did not trigger the adjustments for cases involving multiple counts adjusted offense level 29 criminal history category as general rule an offenders criminal record determines his or her criminal history cat egory for each offense level there are six permissible sentencing subcategories arranged according to the seriousness of the defendants criminal history points are assessed for past convi ctions for misconduct committed while under judicial supervision such as bail or parole and for crimes ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22104crs4 violence past criminal activities not only determine defendants criminal history category point total but also provide the ba sis for increasing defendants offense level as in the case of career criminals b professional criminals c armed career criminals and d recidivist sex offenders the career offender guidelines cover any adult offender convicted of controlled substan ce crime or crime of violence following two prior convictions for similar offenses ffenders who qualify are assigned criminal history category of vi and the higher of 1 the offense level that applies based on their present conviction or 2 the career offende r offenses levels which except for higher demands in the case of certain firearms offe nses range from an offense level of 37 down to one of 12 based on the maximum penalty fo r the offense of their present conviction if the defendant committed an offense as part of pattern of criminal conduct engaged in as livelihood his offense vel shall be not less than 13 not less than 11 with an acceptance of responsibility reduction the armed carrier criminal provision can only be triggered by firearms possession offenses it limits its controlled substance predicates to 10 year felonies and in some cases it will recognize criminal history category of iv the sex offender enhancement has necessa ry nexus to any controlled substance offense none of these modifications applie d to korakis who was found to have criminal history category of i adjusted offense level 29 criminal history category i departures in the interest of uniformity the guide lines seek to limit the circumstances under which sent ence outside of the ranges otherwise called for by the guidelines may be recommended the gu idelines countenance departure from the sentence otherwise called for 1 upon the request of the government in recognition of the defendants cooperation with authorities 2 where the cr iminal history provisions do not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendants past criminal record and 3 in cases where there exists an aggravating or in cas other than those involving child crimes or sex offenses mitigating circumstance of kind or to degree not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines korakis sought to avail an excepti onal circumstance downward departure under the general provisions arguing that he d knowledge that mdma pills with which his coconspirator was arrested contained methamphetamine and that his immigration status would subject him to harsher treatment than would otherwise have been the case his argument rejected his offense level re mained unchanged ad justed offense level 29 criminal history category i sentencing table imprisonment total offense level of 29 with defendant criminal history category of i resulted in guidelines range of 87 to 108 months imprisonment under the sentencing table for korakis the guidelin sentencing range may only be applied within the statutory maximum and any stat utory minimum that applies to the crime of conviction in korakis case however th range was well below the maximum for the offense of conviction for which there was mandatory minimum httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22104crs5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22104crs6 probation substitute incarceration supervised release probation eligibility under the guide lines is very limited it extends only to defendants for whom the maximum permissible sentence of imprisonmen t under the guidelines is more than 6 months zone or to defe ndants whose maximum is more than 1 year if the court imposes some form of incarceration rather than imprisonment ie weekend or nighttime imprisonment home confinement etc z one b the maximum permissible term of probation for defendant with an offense level 6 or higher is 5 years below offense level 6 the maximum term of probation is 3 years defendants sentenced at offense level 19 or above zones c and d are ineligible for probation in cases when the offense level carries maximum term of imprisonment of not more than 16 months zone b or c the sentencing court may impose term of substitute incarceration intermittent confinement community confinement or home detention defendants like korakis sentenced at offense level 29 criminal history category i are ineligible for probation or substitute incarceration they are however subject to the statutory and guideline provisions for supervised release which in korakis case amount to term of 3 years restitution fines other economic sanctions restitution in drug cases is the exception rather than the rule the guidelines establish fine schedule according to offense level they call for fine of between 15000 and 150000 for crimes at korakis offense level of 29 but the court need not impose fine where the defendant is unable and unlike to become able to pay any fine imposed if the court does not impose or waives the fine imposed it may impose alternative sanctions korakis does not mention fine federal cour ts must impose special assessment of 100 for felony violations of federal law nd lesser amounts for misdemeanor s korakis would have been assessed special assessment of 100 as is the case with several other federal crimes property derived from and used to facilitate controlled substance violation is subject to confiscation there are two procedure under wh ich the property may be confiscated the government may elect to treat the property as the defendant and initiate civil forfeiture proceedings or it may chose to accomplish the confiscation as part of the defendants criminal trial these criminal forfeiture s which become opera ble upon conviction are announced as part of the sentencing proce ss although confiscation accomplished either through criminal or civil forfeiture procedures is common consequence of controlled substance violation korakis does not mention the prospect of confiscati on several tax statutes and few others authorize the court to assess the costs of prosecution against defendants convicted of violating their comma nds the statutes under which korakis was convicted are not among them section 3555 of title 18 author izes sentencing courts to order defendant to pay for the cost of victim notification up to maximum of 20000 the guidelines permit the court to set off the cost against any fine imposed the issue does not appear to have arisen in korakis
