scheduling while naples and cologne terms provide debt reduction classic terms classic terms are the standard terms for countries seeking paris club assistance they are the least concessional of all paris club terms debts are rescheduled at an appr opriate market rate houston terms houston terms were created at the 1990 g7 meeting in houston texas so the paris club could better accommodate the needs of lower middleincome countries houston terms offer longer gr ace and repayment periods on development assistance than do classic terms naples terms naples terms designed at the december 1994 g7 meeting in naples italy are the paris clubs terms for cancelling and rescheduling the debts of very poor countries countries may receive naples terms treatment if they are eligible to receive loans from the world banks concessi onal facility the intern ational development agency ida country is eligible for i da loans if it has percapita gdp of less than 755 according to naples terms between 50

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21482crs4 the evian approach on october 8 2003 paris club members nnounced new approach that would allow the paris club to provide debt cancella tion to broader group of countries the new approach named the evian approach introduces new strategy for determining paris club debt relief vels that is more flexible and can provide debt cancellation to greater number of countries than was availabl under prior paris club rules prior to the evian approachs introduction bt cancellation was restricted to countries eligible for ida loans from the world bank under naples terms or hipc countries under cologne terms many observers believe that strong us support for iraq debt relief was an impetus for the creation of the new approach instead of using economic indicators to determine eligibility for debt relief all potential debt relief cases are now di vided into two groups hipc and nonhipc countries hipc countries will continue to receive assistance under cologne terms which sanction up to 90 debt cance llation the united states and several other countries routinely provide 100 bilatera l debt cancellation nonhi pc countries are assessed on casebycase basis nonhipc countries seeking debt relief first undergo an imf debt sustainability analysis this analysis determines whether the country suffers from liquidity problem debt sustainability problem or both if the imf determines that the country suffers from temporary liquidity problem its debts are rescheduled until late r date if the country is also determined to suffer from debt sustainability problems where it lacks the long term resources to meet its debt obligations and the amount of debt adversely affects its future ability to pay the country is eligible for debt cancellation the role of congress congress has an active role in shaping united states debt relief policy title v of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 the federal credit reform act of 1990 pl 101508 2 usc 661 et seq set new gu idelines for the cost accounting of credit and loan programs in the us budget follo wing the passage of the act when new loan program is created congress must make speci fic appropriation to cover the cost of the program these rules also apply to changing the terms or reducing the amount of existing loans thus congress must ppropriate in advance the anticipated cost of any us debt relief typically the appropr iated amount is included in the annual foreign operations spending measure the method that the us government uses to value foreign loans is also based on the federal credit reform act of 1990 the act requires that us loans be valued at the net present value and not their face value determining the net present value is complex calculation involving several factors incl uding the terms of loan whether it is concessional or at market ra tes and the financial solven cy of the debtor and their likelihood of repayment in effect this mean s that the us government can forgive large amounts of foreign debt with very little budgetary implication for example on december 17 2004 the united states forgave 100 of the debt that iraq owed to the united states worth 41 b illion with budgeted 360 million the determined net present value of the outstanding debt httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21482crs5 7 tirole jean financial crisis liquidity nd the

issues related to paris club debt relief members of the private sector frequently raise concerns about the procedure for providing debt relief and pe rceived lack of input into debt relief negotiations especially considering that foreign investment is the largest source of external finance for low and middle income countries signif icantly higher than foreign assistance in addition many observers are concerned that in the wake of substantial paris club and multilate ral poor country debt relief veral emerging creditors are extending large loans to poor countries poten tially prompting new round of debt crises among developing countries the paris club and private sector activity the private sector financial community has frequently expr essed concerns about paris club operations when the paris club was created in 1956 official cap ital flows government finance dominated total capital flows to developing countries this situation s since changed dramatically the bulk of developing country debt is now he ld by the private sector and private capital flows account for more than five times official borrowing worldwide7 one private sector concern is perceived lack of input in paris club negotiations while paris club only reschedules official s ector debt the outcome of their negotiations greatly affects the private sectors ability to renegotiate debts owed to the them by sovereign creditor nations private sector offi cials are also concerned that official paris club debt is not written down to its appropriate market value as private debt often is during restructuring this could possibly di stort the value of countrys debt and lead to an increase in the private sectors sh are of the debt relief burden since 2001 the paris club has held annual mee tings with the private sector to discuss these concerns emerging creditors paris club member count ries and the multilateral development institutions are increasingly providing foreign assistance in

angolan government and consortium of chinese companies to upgrade its railroad infrastructure and an 83 billion investment to build an 1800 mile railroad in nigeria besides china other large emerging creditors are brazil india korea kuwait and saudi arabia while paris club creditors have established clear and transparent rules for their foreign assistance little is known about the rms of this new lending many western donors are concerned that new accumulated bt will create new cycle of poorcountry indebtedness and will erase an potential gains from recent bt relief efforts by paris club creditors and the international financial institutions according to the imf many emerging creditors loans have nontraditional financial structures including implicit or explicit collateralization foreign exchan ge clauses and variable fees13 if this debt is nonconcessional shortterm nd at rates that poor countries cannot afford over the long term potential debt crisis may be looming this presents significant challenge to the international community and the members of the paris club the paris club will likely have to reach out to emerging creditors ove r the next several years and try to harmonize their lending with the existing norms according to one analyst either it will include new members such as china or it will close14
