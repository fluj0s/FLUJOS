major alteration in its capabilities from force designed to fight the soviet union to one tailored to 21st century adversaries including terrorism this shift has been prompted by the perception of changing threat and impr oved technology especially information technology as the military services atte mpt to increase the agility and versatility of their weapon systems they also see need to increase the capabilities of military intelligence surveillance and reconnai ssance isr to support the new weapon systems and operating methods ag ainst these new threats to judge whether service activities are likely to help the military transform the head of dods office of force tran sformation retired vice admiral arthur cebrowski us navy has proposed thr ee criteriawhether the proposed capability can communicate and operate easily in conj unction with the other services whether it helps the military develop new methods of warfighting and whether it will be useful against wide range of threats in addition isr activ ities should in the aggregate provide worldwide persp ective of the threat fuse all types of intelligence into one picture access extensiv details about the enemy and monitor specific targets for long periods of time all of the services are planning isr programs which exhibit at least some attributes of transforma tion many observers belie ve military isr has already achieved some transformation as shown in the war in afghanistan by the militarys ability to detect target and destroy it within minutes the militarys ability to move intelligence quickly has improved dramatically however many observers are concerned that analysis may be lagging behind proposals to make revolutionary changes in analysis include using contractors to produce competing unclassified analyses developing artificial intelligence capabilities for database work and establishing more operations analysis centers the military intelligence community is supported by the national intelligence community which even before the sept ember 11 attacks was under intense scrutiny therefore the aspects of the national intelligence communitys operations in which congress has expressed interest directly affect the quality of military intelligence in addition dods plans for improving its isr capabilities raise potential issues for congress with regard to cost the balancing of potentially competing efforts to improve the flow of intelligence and th quality of the data and the support of military leadership finally the consequences of the militarys role in homeland defense and intelligence community reform may generate concern discussion of these issues is provided as background as congress considers isr programs as part of defense and intelligence au

effort to shift to new kinds of forces and modes of operation could be wasted although the war in afghanistan opera tion enduring freedom has been widely cited as proof that dod is successfully

facing an armed attacker sources another shorthand commonly used by the military services and the intelligence community refers to the source of any gi ven piece of intelligence intelligence which comes from person observing it is called human intelligence or humint intelligence derived from photographs nd other imagery is called imagery intelligence or imint intelligence obtained from electronic signals such as communications is called signals intelligence or sigint finally intelligence derived from other technically measurable aspects of the target such as vibrations or hyperspectral emissions is named measurement and signatures intelligence or masint5 these terms are important as they help characterize the basic structure of the intelligence community military intelligence community the central intelligence agency cia state department department of energy department of jus tice and department of tr easury all contribute to the intelligence picture available to the military6 however most intelligence used by the military comes from the defense intelligence agency dia which produces some humint masint and large portion of the defense departments strategic or longterm analysis the national security agency nsa which produces most sigint and the national imagery and mapping agency nima which produces most imint the services themselves also produce all types of intelligence for the community transformation background todays security environment appear s to be quite different from the environment of only ten years ago major sh ifts in both the threat

511changed environment most of todays military equipment and organization was originally designed to fight the soviet union common scenar io was that the soviets and their warsaw pact allies would attempt to occupy all of western europe using large numbers of tanks and aircraft to sweep through germany on their way to the rest of the continent defense against such an assault was per ceived to require heavy weapons such as tanks fighter and bomber aircra ft and aircraft carriers however the warsaw pact has collapsed and similar threat has not emerged instead the security environment looks significantly different compared to 1989 dods 2001 quadrennial defense review qdr points out that we cannot pr edict with high degree of confidence the identity of the countries or the actors that may threaten our interests and security the qdr explains dods percep tion of the changed threat by stating that the us is longer physically protected by distance from its adversaries it sees broad arc of instability from the middle east to northeast asia where nonstate entities whose activities are damaging to us interests drug traffickers terrorists etc are growing in strength and finding safehaven in weak and failing states in addition new technologies esp ecially information technol ogies and those related to chemical biological radiolog ical nuclear or enhanced highexplosive weapons are increasingly within the reach of potential adversaries and warfare may extend to space and cyber space7 outside observers including other members of the national intelligence community generally agree with dods char acterization of the threat concern over surprise deception increasingly diverse th reats weapons of mass destruction the middle east and asia appears consistent some add th at nonstate actors with new technology may undermine nati onstate control in many countries this could exacerbate the effects of environmental deterioration and disaster increasing the probability that the us would feel compelled to deploy its military forces to stem resulting humanitarian crisis8 in sum many analysts believe the us is now faced with asymmetric warfare in which means such as drugtrafficking terrorism and biologi cal warfare would be used to attack our interests the even ts of september 11 ppear to confirm the judgement that the threats of the future are unlikely to look like the threats of the past because these are means that the united states would not choose to employ itself and which bear resemblance to the old warsaw pact tank assault scenario some believe the us military is currently illprepared to deal with them in addition to the changed threat the us military along with the rest of society also has experienced major changes in the technologies available

to completely change the way military forces are equipped organized and employed9 definitions based on these changes in both the thr eat and in available technology dod states it must transform transformation in the context of large organizations such as the defense department is generally recognized as process of radical change involving technology organization and cepts of employment another term used in military theory which also expresses the idea of transformation is revolution in military affairs however even within dod there are at least two competing perspectives on what constitutes tra nsformation some personnel define transformation as disconti nuous or leapahead change10 this view supports those who believe it is necessary to move money manpower nd particularly patterns of thinking doctrine away from current w eapon systems and methods to entirely new technologies and procedures they perceive that resour ces are being wasted on the older systems and the only way to accomplish change is to do so in radical way the navys shift in the 1920s and 30s from th battleship to the aircraft carrier as its centerpiece weapon system could be consider ed an example of leapahead change even as the battleship remained in service until the 1980s the armys plan to replace its tank force in favor of much lig hter vehicles and other technologies may be seen as an attempt to achieve similar change11 others tend to define tr ansformation as incremental change using current or modernizing technologies in new ways w ith an end result of radical improvement over time they express concern that the future is unknown if dod cuts out proven capabilities for new ones those new capabilities may not match the currently unforeseen threat any better than todays technology proven technology however may be able to be adjusted to meet th at unknown situation these officials point to examples such as the change in the militarys ab ility to attack targets from the air comparing operation desert storm agai nst iraq in 1991 to operation enduring freedom against afghanistan in 2001 near ly every weapon system which was used in afghanistan had also been used in iraq in 1991 however improved communications procedures and the joint direct attack munition standard 2000 lb bomb which can be guided using global positioning system technology allowed b52 bombers to attack

friendly soldiers this would not have even been considered in 199112 transformation criteria regardless of how transfor mation may be defined re tired vice admiral usn arthur cebrowski the chief of the defense departments office of force transformation has identifie d some criteria by which military programs may be judged for their transformational qualities his top criterion is that the weapon system or operating procedure be interoperable interoperability means that the system can function easily with variety of other systems including those from other services13 other criteria cebrowsk i has named are judgements as to whether the system helps the user to change warfighting methods as opposed to merely improving existing methods and whet her the system can deal with wide range of threats 14 observers generally agree with cebrowskis criteria for example andrew krepinevich executive director of the center for strategic and budgetary assessments also notes the requirement for interoperability and support to new warfighting methods and discounts any hard and fast rule that program must employ new technology to be considered transformational at the same time krepinevich along with some other observers advocates the leapahead definition of transformation and ther efore would likely want to see larger changes in interoperability and warfighting methods than might cebrowski15 isr criteria in addition to assessing the military services isr programs based on cebrowskis informal criteria for transfor mation it may be helpful to look at what isr they will really need some commonly recognized characteristics include worldwide perspective fusion detail and persistent surveillance 16 the transformed force much more than the cold war force needs truly worldwide perspective derived from worldwide collection capabilities and indepth analysis during the cold war the threat from the warsaw pact was considered so great that military activity in other places often was considered inconsequential orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31425crs6 17 berkowitz and goodman p 114 18 john b ga nnon quoted in time for rethink economist april 2026 2002 httpwwweconomistcom lesser included threat17 the intelligence community therefore put greater effort toward monitoring the warsaw pact than th rest of the world today however the threat may in fact come from within country which appears quite nonthreatening for example one former central intelligen ce agency analyst notes that in 1998 half of the foreign crises which demanded u s attention occurred in lowerpriority areasagainst which fewer analysts and collection resources had been allocated18 fusion refers to bringing together all types of intelligence to create one consolidated picture of the threat as men tioned in the beginning of this paper the various sources of intelligence form the basic structure of the intelligence community that is every piece of intellig ence data is identified by whether it came from humint sigint imint or masint in addition these data are often kept in separate communications channels and data bases designed to support the unique aspects of the data collected piece of imagery for example requires different bandwidth software and hardware for transmission than does communications intercept and they each fill completely di fferent types of fields in database however military forces cannot easily use separate humint sigint imint and masint data they need one fused assessment of the threat while this has always been true the speed and precisi on with which the transformed force is expected to act makes this fusion even more desirable as it presents information about the enemy in timely clear manner the transformed force may also seek more detailed information than before first given todays emphasis on precise application of force while mitigating risk to us and civilian personnel the intelligen ce required to employ destructive force such as bomb or artillery round has increase d as adversaries hi within civilian populations or inside mountains the once straightforward process of identifying potential targets has become much more complex once target has been identified for destruction the information require d to successfully employ the weapon is increasing as target coordinates must be accurate to within few feet in three dimensions even after weapon is empl oyed the assessment of whether the target is destroyed known as bomb damage ssessment bda has also increased in difficulty in the cold war this was performed primarily by comparing before and after images of the target if target such as an enemy tank looked destroyed with its turret blown off or smoke coming out of gaping hole then it probably was weapons used by the transformed force however may not cause that type of visible damage even in operation desert stor m against iraq precisionguided munitions made only small holes in iraqi tanks as they penetrated and completely obliterated the insides this damage ho wever could not be seen from imagery other types of information such as hyperspectral data wh ich might detect whether the tank got very hot from internal explosions are needed to make an accurate damage assessment second as opposed to most cold war scenar ios physical destruction is not the only effect the transformed force may be able to bring against the adversary the military force may for example be able to accomp lish its objectives by isolating an opposinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31425crs7 19 general richard b myers chairman joint chiefs of staff dod news briefing december 11 2001 20 for example see mark m lowenthal grant vs sherman us military doctrine and the future of combat leadership handel in ternational strategy conference available at httpwwwnwcnavymil commander electronically however creating or defending against this type of effect requires extremely specific intelligence the ability to continuously monitor given target and provide immediate assessment of changes to it known as persiste nt surveillance is seen as essential to the transformed forces ability to def eat unconventional ene mies like terrorists19 as has been seen in kosovo and afghanistan detailed longterm rveillance of house or convoy such as that provided by pr edator unmanned aerial vehicle uav or special operator on the ground is key to properly identifying all personnel in the target area and maintaining full awareness of all activities hostile friendly or neutral the assessment that the desired target is present and can be effectively struck must then be made and communicated to the striking force within seconds so that the opportunity is not lost some experts express caution about thes characteristics they assert that doctrinal writings about the transforme d force assume perfect access to perfect intelligence that training its personnel to rely on such intelligence will prevent them from learning initiative and that reliance on perfect intelligence may keep the us from acting in circumstances where it n eeds to act but for whatever reason its precisionguided munition or other hi ghtechnology asset cannot be used20 the us intelligence community does not have eyes and ears everywhere in the world and it does not have perfect vision into poten tial adversary minds transformation advocates when asked reco gnize the fact of imperf ect intelligence and respond to this criticism by emphasizing the planned forces agility in equipment and training to overcome situations where intelligence is imperfect and

intelligence needs are collected by other services and the national agencies it therefore stresses being able to communicate with the other intelligence sources however exactly how it intends to accomplish that is still under development thus at least some of the programs which will be needed to achieve army objectives have not yet been fined technologically research and development effort is focused on analysis t ools especially data fusion and validation an apparently singular success in this area is the pathfinder text analysis system which is used extensively by the army s national

reconnaissance fa ll under the purview of the operations officer43 some observers believe this split in responsib ility may slow the armys ability to integrate all aspects of isr not only with army operations but with other service isr capabilities do the armys activities in isr support transformation the armys emphasis on interoperability as well as its apparent major commitment to change the way it fights seems to say they do although ther are still many questions to be answered concerning how the new army units will operate including how they will use isr the rsta squadron incorporating most aspects of army intelligence plans and promising fusion increased detail and pers istent surveillance may be viewed as radical departure from current operations but its ability to function in the face of wide range of threats is yet to be determined air force the air force says its transformation effort builds on the successes it has already achieved in being able to reach targets with stealth

challenges the air fo rce perceives are in integrating todays platforms to provide one coherent pictur of the battlespace reducing the need for human transfer between systems of basic technical data such as location information and determining if or when to move isr capabilities currently performed by airborne platforms to space key procurement programs are the spacebased radar and smart tanker program to equip all aerial tankers with surveillance sensors and communications equipment to increase the militarys persistent surveillance the multiplatform radar technology inserti on program to improve tracking moving ground targets predator b and global hawk uavs for airborne persistent surveillance and reconnaissance theater battle management co re system network centric collaborative targeting and the air operations center common operating picture for coordination with operations and the previously mentioned distributed common ground station for analysis and dissemination46 to some observers the operational changes the air force is now attempting to develop in isr are more incremental than revolutionary as noted earlier the air force claims that revolutionary change s have already occurred such as the integration of uavs into the air forces ope rations and the ability to get the process of identifying targets and subsequently destroying them down from days to minutes in length the air force believes it is doi ng good job providing isr at the theater level but is not yet able to provide gl obal perspective moving most of the air forces surveillance and rec onnaissance assets to space could significantly increase worldwide coverage and may be the next major ch ange in isr operations if appropriate technology develops such move however will surely be quite costly and also risks loss in flexibility as satellites have historically been difficult to move quickly from one target area to another and have also been more difficult than aircraft to repair or replace when necessa ry observers also question whether more emphasis should be placed on analysis rather than on more equipment for example bomb damage assessment the process by which the commander determines how much damage an attack caused on given target and therefore whether it needs to be struck again has been called w eak area for operation enduring freedom47 organizationally the air force has made several moves to improve its isr its reorganization in the early 1990s combin ing strategic air command with tactical air command to form air combat command could be seen as step toward isr transformation as it brought most isr assets under one co mmander previously the air forces strategic r econnaissance aircraft lik the rc135 u2 and sr71 belonged to strategic air command and were reserved primarily for tasks associated with defeating the soviet union with the formation of air combat command these aircraft have been made much more availa ble to units fighting theater wars such

transformation judged by the standards of inter operability support to changed thods of warfighting and ability to confront wide range of threats the answer is unclear interoperability stands at the top of the air forces stated priorities the various changes in air force organization which have occurred since the end of the cold war appear to be the most aggressive of all the services th availability and app licability of space assets to warfighting has increased significantly adding greatly to the services access to worldwide perspective as well as indepth intelligence as noted earlier air force efforts appear to have played large role in establishing the lauded isr capabilities particularly their persistent surveillance for operation enduring freedom however some observers believe the air force is primarily achieving t echnical improvements to established programs and operating methods rather than radical change appropriate to potentially ra dically different enemy another point made is that while the air force owns the vast majority of isr aircraft thes aircraft have been operating at very high rate for number of years such that the aircraft and crews are significantly more stressed than most of the air force this leads to situations where isr aircraft are unavailable to fly missions for commanders who need them observers wonder why the air force has

moving from force which emphasized maritime safety protection of natural resources and law enforcement to focus more on its maritime security and national defense missions including port security both in the united states and at overseas ports where us forces are located69 at the same time the coast guard is undergoing wholesale replacement of many of its ships boats and aircraft in an effort to replace obsolete systems while achieving full integration and interoperability this acquisition program named deepwater has been in planning for several years and should be contracted out in 2002 it will not replace systems type for type but instead will use an inte grated mix of surface and air platforms with appropriate connectivity to achieve the required capabilities70 coast guard acquisitions including deepwater claim to strongly emphasize interoperability much more than the other services however for the coast guard interoperability implies the ability to communicate and

are expected to substantially increase the coast guards production of and access to intelligence74 organizationally the coast guard sees need for shorebased fusion and analysis centers to handle the increased quantity of intelligence and is coordinating with the navy to establish one such 24hour operations center on each coast the coast guard is also significantly increas ing its airborne and shipborne intelligence collection capability and bringing it under th guidance of the navys naval security group75 do the coast guards activities in isr support transformation as with the other services interoperability is perceived as key and ppears to be receiving strong emphasis from coast guard planners th deepwater programs isr although conceived well before transformation became the coin of the realm in the defense department seems to be imed at allowing the coast guard to change its methods of operation by giving it an ability to function in tandem with the navy and other

obsolete83 indications and warning the analysis whic h warns of impending attack on the united states or its vital interests depends on the ability to predict enemy activity based on enemy plans doctrine and observed exer cises and training many of todays potential adversaries offer little in the way of traditionally observable activity84 berkowitz and goodman see maintaining databases as vastly more difficult problem today than it was twelve years ag precisionguided munitions worldwide interests adversary use of western and nontraditional w eaponry and the need for increased information about civilian popula tions have significantly expanded and complicated military intelligence database needs85 in response to this problem the prima ry solution offered both inside and outside the defense department is the development of be tter technology this may be artificial intelligence such as neural ne tworks which learn as they are used to perform datamining and other analytical tasks or powerful cookies like those that internet marketers use to track customer responses86 however senior analysts who have observed these tools believe they still require significant

analysis t echnological solutions to the information overload problem are also being researched as noted earlier institutional changes to address the analysis shortfall such as encouraging competing analyses from outside dod however are not apparent at the same time that there is reported to be more information than can be analyzed continued acquisition of some specific collection capabilities may still be appropriate many of dod s isr platforms are in very high demand and are operating at significantly higher operating tempo than most of the rest of the force96 these platforms collect focused intelligence of immediate value to the warfighter andcannot be replaced by the large amounts of other intelligence already being collected in addition acquisition of emerging capab ilities designed to detect very difficult targets such as foliagepenetrating radars and other highlytechnical capabilities potentially able to detect deeply buried targ ets or biological and chemical

of defense isr partic ularly in unmanned reconnaissance sensing tec hnologies and integrated an alysis congress may choose to watch these projects as well as osds lection of future projects to ensure the appropriate technologies ar being developed congre ss may also scrutinize the performance of the national r econnaissance office in this area widely recognized as highly innovative in its early years th nro has over the past several years been criticized for reduced level of innovation as it became more standard member of the defense bureaucracy98 some of dods isr research and deve lopment programs have encountered congressional opposition for example the 106th congress killed discoverer2 spacebased radar concept c onsisting of two experimental satellites due to the high cost and possible overlap with nimas future imagery architecture satellite program in addition some in dod believe that the structure of the program with just two experimental satellite s and followon funding requirements inaccurately communicated low dod priority for the program99 in the fy2002 budget the air forces space based radar and space ba sed infrared system both had funding requests reduced the cuts were due primarily to seriously escalating costs and program management issues100 the dod intelligence community still believes development of these capabilities is vital and the air force is refocusing the programs in response101 congress will then have the opportunity to determine whether the programs still make sensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31425crs27 102 david fulghum pentagon priorities shift to data and networks aviation week space technology april 22 2002 p 22 103 mark lowenthal previously cited believes that the joint chiefs of staffs joint vision 2010 and joint vision 2020 the guiding documents for service transformation efforts exhibit an intellectual sloppiness that tends to use information systems interchangeably with intelligencep 9 he perceives an assumption in the joint visions that the information ie intelligence on the networks will be accurate but they contain explanation as to how that accuracy will be achieved 104 the budget for fiscal year 2003 washington dc 2002 p 277networks vs quality intelligence consistent theme throughout dod is an emphasis on getting networks in place so that information can flow102 while even the best intelligence is only useful if it is communicated poor data on the network can also have devastating consequences one potential danger is that the flow of information regardless of the quality of that information ma become measure of success103 particularly if the number of contributors to the intelligence networks grows possibly exponentially the data must still be analyzed and validated while dia appears to be making progress on this problem at the strategic an alysis level some observers believe the marine corps has the clearest vision on meeting this requirement at the tactical level with its design of its intelligence analysis system bringing all data collected by the frontline troops into one location for co mparison analysis and dissemination the armys pathfinder text analysis tool appears to be an example of the type of automated analytical tool which will be needed both in the fi eld and in supporting intelligence centers although it is currently primarily used by strategic analysts not those directly supporting combat troops an alysis tools and the doctrine and people to use them will need to develop while the networks evolve congress may choose to examine service networking programs to ensure that quality of data as well as data flow is being improved cost will isr for the transformed force cost significantly more than todays isr due to the mix of black classified with white unclassified funding it is impossible to quantify in an unclassified report the expected changes in the military isr budget over the next several years however some feel for the impact on the budget can be measured in general terms in the administrations budget request for fy2003 for example the defense emergency response fund request of 201 billion included 26 billion for increased s ituational awareness supporting the global war on terrorism104 with significant portion of this request going toward isr and related activities service is r planners note general satis faction with the budgetary support they are receiving one area which traditionally is quite expensive is satellite reconnaissance while upgra des to our imagery satellite constellation are already presumably budgeted the funding for reconnaissance satellite s has always been classified other changes to the satellite constellation partic ularly in support of dods quest for worldwide persistent surveillance and reconnaissance may significantly increase the cost of future isr these programs are apparently exactlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31425crs28 105 thom shanker rumsfeld delays decisi ons on trimming arms programs new york times may 1 2002 p a19 106 vernon loeb and thomas ricks 1s nd 0s replacing bullets in us arsenal washington post feb 2 2002 p 1 the types of programs secretary of fense rumsfeld is proposing should receive funds redirected from reduced or cancelled major weapons programs such as the f 22 fighter and coma nche helicopter105 on the other hand increased isr expenditure may hold out the promise of decreased expe nditures in other areas as potentially the services will require fewer andor cheaper weapon systems as they experience lower attrition and more efficient employment in combat situations these savings however are unlikely to compensate for th potential large increases in isr funding requirements military leadership the military services seem to place their greatest trust in people who are trained to directly attack the enemy with deadly force officers who spent much of their career in the intelligence field are rarely selected to be senior leaders of their services most threestar officers who spent significant time as intelligence officers as well as admiral bobby inman us navy ret perhaps the only career intelligence officer to achieve fourstar rank have served at that rank only as their services senior intelligence officer or as the head of an intelligence agency such as the national security agency an exception was lieu tenant general thr ee star ervin rokke us air force ret who served as the president of national defense university invariably the officers retire after completion of their tours as the head of an intelligence agency rather than move back into the leadership of their parent service or the joint chiefs of staff admiral inman led the national security agency as threestar then became the deputy director of central intelligence as fourstar officer consequently the most senior uniformed members of the military continue to be people who are most familiar with the procurement planning and employment of lethal force rather than with the pr ocurement planning and employment of information and intelligence106 while the effect is not measurable this fact could reduce the strength with which isr issues are fought in the dod bureaucracy as well as reducing the options senior officers are willing to consider as they confront new enemies and situations while it is probably appropriate that any officer in position to order others into combat also be combat officer there are positions at the three and four star level which do not command combat forces if intelligence is becoming more important to national security and the application of force than the weapons themselves the sena may find it desirable to express desire to the secretary of defense that more offi cers with an intelligence background be nominated for senior officer positions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31425crs29 107 interview with capt rich kelly uscg weisman intelligence agencies p 11 108 see richard best jr homeland security intelligence support crs report rs21283 109 senior cia official says rumsfeld absolutely wrong on intel reform defense information and electronics report april 26 2002 p 1military intelligence role in homeland defense all of the services believe that they must play greater role in homeland defense than they had before the september 11 attacks the role of the services intelligence capabilities however does not appear to be as clear by law the military is restricted in its authority to collect or analyze intelligence on us persons or the united states in addition the military is in war the global war on terrorism which is stretching intelligence assets intelligence collected and analyzed for the military should be made available to other agen cies involved in homeland fense this is already occurring between the navy coast guard and other domestic agencies with responsibilities for port security as well as between dia cia fbi and nsa107 however significant shift of effort by the service intelligence agencies from overseas to homeland defens may be inappropriate the establishment of the department of homeland security dhs in january 2003 will affect the responsib ilities of all intelligence agencies including those in dod dhs will not itself collect foreign intelligence but will depend upon intelligence forwarded from other agencies the nature and extent of support that dod agencies will be expected to pr ovide dhs remains as yet uncertain108 congress may wish to maintain oversight of the overall effort to coordinate and consolidate intelligence for homeland security intelligence community reform reform of the intelligence community is perennial subject for highlevel commissions the most recent presidential commission headed by lt gen brent scowcroft us air force ret made recommendation to place the defense intelligence agencies directly under the director of central intelligence dci109 but action was taken on the proposal in the 107th congress if such move does occur in the future the concern for the military services would probably be to prevent any significant reduction in current and nea rterm production of imint by nima and sigint by nsa the services use th capabilities heavily and subordinating the defense agencies under the dci coul d lower the priority placed on military requirements if on the other hand the centralization creates conditions for transformation in analysis without si gnificantly reducing current production the military services may be better off in the long runhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31425crs30 appendix
