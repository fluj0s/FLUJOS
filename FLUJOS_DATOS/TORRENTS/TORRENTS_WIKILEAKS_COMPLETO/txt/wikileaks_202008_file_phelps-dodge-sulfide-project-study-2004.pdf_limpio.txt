increase traffic flux into the site the safest and most efficient method of managing and controlling traffic to constructionarea within an operating mine site is to provide separate and dedicate access for mine sitetraffic and for construction traffic to provide separate and dedicated construction site access several potential routes wereconsidered in addition the existing main highway into the mine site will require futurerealignment in two locations due to the conflict with the tailing embankment expanding tothe north and with the mine waste dumps expanding to the west this evaluation also considered new permanent access route to serve initially as the construction access route and ultimately as the permanent site access route the following options wereconsidered in this evaluation option 1 use existing routes north and south for mine and construction traffic option 2 temporary road up quebrada enlozada tailing impoundment option 3 temporary road up quebrada huayrondo option 4 permanent road up quebrada huayrondo 2 summary and recommendation all alternate site access routes require significant expenditure the cost estimates foreach to the routes considered are shown in table 21 the estimated capital to realign theexisting mine access highway in two locations is 5000000 for the purposes of thisevaluation it is assumed the existing highway would be realigned in year 4

route for mining and construction activities is the lowest cost option for the primary sulfide project this option however introduces some safetyissues that must be addressed and managed fluor recommends that the existing mine access route be used for construction traffic aseparate site security entrance should be provided for construction traffic at both the northentrance and the south entrance construction traffic will be routed around the cerroverde and cerro negro pits to avoid congestion in the main traffic route between the twopits traffic management program and safety plan will need to be developed andimplemented for the construction phase of the project the impact of sharing access gates needs to be review with respect to permitting and siteclassification 3 option 1 existing access routes using the existing access routes for mining and construction traffic will requiremodifications to the existing site security entrances new separate site security facilityshould be provided for and dedicated to construction traffic at both the north and southsite entrances construction traffic routes on site will be developed to minimize congestion and conflictwith the existing operations it is envisaged that construction traffic will be routed aroundthe cerro verde and cerro negro pits as shown on sketch c700010csk2 detailed traffic management and safety plan will need to be developed and implementedfor the construction phase of the project this plan should consider as minimum training for all mining and construction personnel special training of all transport operators busses and trucks clear signage and route markings manned traffic control points in areas of conflict between operations and construction traffic pilot cars for large or special transport

possible option for temporary constructionaccess to the concentrator site the initial concept was to widen the pipeline corridor toaccommodate construction traffic this is feasible option between the concentrator siteand the tailing embankment but not feasible between the tailing embankment and the mineaccess highway the gradient of the pipeline corridor between the tailing embankmentand the highway will be about 12 this is too steep for construction traffic fluorsreview of options to reduce this gradient was not successful so this route was consideredtechnically unacceptable an alternate
