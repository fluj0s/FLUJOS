dating lecture given on 17 july 1963 thank you well you had your demonstration last week so i thought id better give you talk this week on the subject of meters and so forth this is what audience 1 7th thank you thank you all right 17th of july ad 13 saint hill special briefing course the subject of this lecture happens to be dating we havent had any material on dating for some time and the situation is lot grimmer than it looks on the subject of dating and the need for accuracy in dating accuracy in dating is the single most important function of the auditor period single most important function of the auditor and ill tell you why and you might be very intrigued with this since october last year ive been engaged in study of unusual intensity we took new departure on the subject of auditing when we went into routine 3 on the subject of goals took very long time to sort that outtook couple of years actuallyand to find out that all of these mental phenomena and so on come down to the time track and engrams now we had already been over this in 1950the difficulties of running time track and so on consisted of the number of cases mostly the number of cases who could not do it we had lots of cases who couldnt run on the time track and run through engrams and erase engrams and that sort of thing so therefore vast number of years were spent in accumulating evidence and data on the subject of well case improvement without running the time track and so on but great many years were spent in that and they were not illspent we have tremendous numbers of processes of one kind or another which accomplish these things in october it became apparent that something else was at work here on the subject of the time track that the time trackwell the time track started to swing in with greater and greater importance right up to the time when it was discovered that the gpm was an implant and that its items were all implanted now at that point at that point whatever the date of that was great decision had to be made herea big findout we had to discover whether or not an individual could go clear and get out of the mud again without running the time track and engrams and recently i saw perception on the subject and it made it possible for people to run engrams and etc on the time track now all this boils down to is this the problem is very serious when you realize this one little point here already had great deal of experience of failure on trying to run people on the time track great deal of failure attends this you see nineteen fifty i never ran into cases that couldnt run engrams up till the time i started to teach people to audit and that sort of thing and then cases started showing up that couldnt run engrams and they amounted to considerable percentage of the number of cases presented themselves ive always gone on an all basis theres particular reason to leaveto leave pete behind you see just because of some peculiarity that pete has that joe and bill dont have dont you see so therefore youll realize the seriousness of the situation when i tell you that few weeks ago i sat down and had to consider this this one point was it possible that only about 50 percent of the people around could be moved through to ot i actually had to consider this point id never considered it before i had just gone ahead on the basis of well we just will do it dont you see but i had gotten down to point where i had doubts and i would say since october we have been through very harrying harassing and upsetting research channels these have been very rough very rough and theyve been made very rough by the fact that i had to catalyze research and do it far more rapidly per unit of time than it had been done before because of thea review of the situation demonstrated that we didnt have much time left this was quite obvious to we just didnt have much time left that was proven by the way in january when the attack was made on scientology in the united states and weve gone ahead on that but my answer to that situation was 1 hold the line legally and impede the progress and even win if possible but not go into complete spin on the subject and just fight that battle on that line you see and 2 make ots and get this job wrapped up in an awful hurry you understand bypass the state of clear and move into the state of ot you see clear is comfortable human end product i must tell you why this is that way clear has difficulty living around or society has difficulty accepting this state of clear he has difficulty living around human beings you get the idea hes still carrying along he simply is not aberrated in the state he is in at the human level you understand well ot that is something else that is something else thats probably the difference between making playground supervisor and commandoif you want to go at it militarily see and ifit isnt that we needed this desperately but it was the only possible answer for two reasons we had to wrap the whole thing up all the way there wouldnt be any comfortable margin of after wed wrapped up clear nicely then go ahead and wrap up ot see we didnt have that comfortable marginhad suddenly been cost usand we had to go straight ahead and wrap up the problems of ot just like that well this is an awful steep hill to climb if you listen to lectures and read papers and that sort of thing of mine of ten years ago youll find saying well we dont know much about the ways to ot and occasionally id release little process probably an ot process you know thislittle comments id reply to letters how do you make an ott well well find out in due time you see its comfortable state of mind that comfortable state of mind shifted it had to shift the two bases on which i was basing the future survival of scientology and your personal future was just this well hold the line legally and do all we can along that line but put all of our strength and action and so forth over into the technical line and push it forward on research right up to the point of operating thetan with way stops of any kind well just wipe them out we wont talk about them any more particularly well saywell if somebodys running goal out well just call him courteously hes one goal clear see tengoal clearwe dont care see now you can apply that to r3r you can run chain out of somebody hes onechain clear see different kind of clear youll find out thatll hold good but the point im making here is all that got bypassed ive had to accelerate this up to tremendous level now when you start accelerating research to this degree youre going to make problems because youve taken time out of the places where you need time and right away you get lots of problems so i had to wrap this up in hurry and i believe in the last few months the work which ive done in the last few months per unit of time exceeds anything ive ever attempted and ive slowed down you as far as thats concerned i havent let some of you out of here and so forth until i felt that there wasthat you would have something to operate with stably and so forth it wasnt that i needed your case for research it was that i needed you out there with fairly stable attitude of what you were going to do you see i let some go because they could run gpms and they had an idea of how to do this and so forth and they could audit basically and they could handle meters and stuff of this character and so that was all right with knowing they could catch up with it remember there were couple of problems that werent solved and one of those problems was the most basic problem do we sit still and say all right some people can go to ot and some cant is that the way we handle this im afraid the psychologist the psychiatrist the pavlovist im afraid theyd handle it this way with all too much glee but i didnt care to handle the problem like that but i was almost beaten to my knees on this particular line because this horrible fact had emerged id suspected it but it had emerged in all of its grisly visage if you cant run the time track youll never get to ot thats it well thats pretty grim now id already found out that all you had to do with mrwhich is what makes r3r mrall you have to do is get the right chain get the right date get the right duration and the person will have visio and even sonic and so forth on the chain now this was fabulous discovery but id already made that discovery when id gone into the blues on the subject and wondered if 50 percent wouldnt be left behind anyway so that discovery didnt make all that difference you can run an engram on almost anybody if youve got the right chain and the right date and the right duration as far as sonic and visio is concerned ah but there was one more impeding factor could you run it with tone arm action now lets go back and look this over if an individualif an individual is going to make case progressthis has already been established you seethis individuals going to make case progress that is real to the individual it will be in the presence of tone arm action tone arm action is the key to all of this thats very important he maybe can run an engram you understand but if he cant run an engram with tone arm action hes not blowing any charge and his reality will not improve if his reality doesnt improve he cant go any earlier on the track he isnt making any case gains tone arm actionno case gain so the bug in running engrams was not just forcing people along certain chain where they had sonic and visio if they had the right duration and youll always get it i dont care if the guy has black field or anything else you get the right duration of something hes got pictures i mean weve got that whipped but can he do it with tone arm action there was this one other bug which 1 of course knew nothing about in 1950 one other bug could he do it and blow charge or were you just going to go on endlessly stirring up the muck tone arm actionyoure just going on endlessly stirring up the muck oh you can release some somatics and you can do some various things it doesnt look terribly grim except the case isnt really making any progress you want to know the test you look through case that is running engrams and we have some on record and they settingtheyre setting the same goals for every consecutive session they never change their goals for the session you look at the gains theyre just lukewarm gains theres how youd sniff them out and there they go watch the pcwe know this of oldwho sets the same goals every session you get change of goals you get change of case i dont care what youre doing with case i dont care how much time track the fellow is running and that coordinates with tone arm action tone arm actionno change of goals case isnt blowing charge tone arm action so it comes down to not does the person have sonic and visio but does the person have tone arm action he must also of course have sonic or visio or something you see in running the engrami give youto improve they nearly always had visio sonic is not very vital to run an engram with they must be able to move through it but if theyre moving through these engrams with tone arm action you are not getting case improvement and that was what caused to sit down and say well are we going to leave 50 of50 percent of them behind tone arm action couldnt produce tone arm action yes we could go backgo back on the case to lower level process to reach and withdraw to this and that and hope that it got enough tone arm action and blew enough stuff off so that sooner or later the fellow could run an engram with tone arm action see well let tell you something that is just thin hope you understand that thats thin hope oh you can improve him as being but thats the route to clear not the route to ot you can key out clear this way hell go free needle and everything else its quite interesting we abandoned these keyedout clears and so forth they postulate themselves into the soup anywhere between one and three four five years afterwards so the devil with it that wasnt doing us any good made them feel fine and all that and theyd never be so bad off again and all this sort of thing but these are human goals see guy now doesnt have lumbosis so what do you think not having lumbosis or being able to cure lumbosis is going to put you any place into position where the united states government wont be able to spit on you every twentyfour hours let tell you government that is so minded as to produce an appropriation of sixteen billion dollars for men who can do nothing except butcher their fellow man is not going to be held off with feathers thats not going to be held off by being good little boys and girls you understand thats not the way to fight that battle you understand if you say well all right all right other organizations have done it this world is going into very interesting rolly coaster slide its going down man its going fast the ethical level of government these various other factors that you see the preponderance of weapons the little sense being usedlook for new solution look for new solution in international affairs just to give you an idea of it i kept an apartment up in london for some time and i hadnt been up there for about year its closed now but i hadnt been up there for about year and man taking care of it had laid out some magazines time life junk like this and i went up therei hadnt been up there for about year im trying to get myself in condition you know to stand the smog smoke and fire carbon monoxide you know and i got myself in condition and went up for visit to london anyway i sat down in this apartment and i was waiting for somebody i picked up magazine to see what was going on in the world and i read the magazine it was all about red china and about atomic conferences and geneva and all this and i said well same things are going on and then with great shock i suddenly realized i was reading magazine which was about eighteen months old there hadnt been any change in international affairs in eighteen monthssame news i dont know why they publish new editions thats an interesting thing youre looking for new solutions you wont get change in international situation unless you get some new solutions around some place theyre still discussing the same things the only new news youre getting is few more riots few more conference failures dont you see and when youre used to reading the time track to predict such as i am you read that kind of thing with oh and you can draw pretty accurate estimate of about how long its going to go and theres new factor in the world but us now thats very interesting maybe selfcentered or maybe stupid adjudication or maybe its this you could criticize it from number of lines but it still holds true it still holds true and i see slightest chance of the scientologist in the united states going on the way he is going i see slightest chance at all unless some other factor is entered into the situation which reverses the tide hed either have to be able to get very spectacular case results or he will be ablehave to be able toand even that isnt good enoughproduce spectacular being one or the other in order for the situation to imbalance and be resolved now thats pretty sobering estimate of the situation and yet its coldblooded estimate of the situation it isnt hopeful propaganda estimate of the situation if i wanted to propagandize you i certainly would be able to do so never doubt that but i dont i usually tell you the truth sometimes its very unpalatable but as far as i could tell this was about the only way we could meet the situation now all that background music im giving you right there is just shows you that we were at serious crisis because without tone arm action even though the person could run the track he would never make the grade well this is pretty heroic to get it sorted down that well i got it sorted out to where he could run the track with perception and then got it sorted out to the fact that you if you didnt get tone arm action it didnt do any good to run the track even with perception see this is getting more and more interesting because its an isolated point now give this point tone arm action the stress that it deserves without tone arm action you do not make any case progress period give thatgive that the stress that it deserves you wake up to that and dont you go around looking hopeful the reason i havent lowered the boom on this particularly because i didnt want to throw you into the doldrums because i thought id probably lickbe able to lick the problem and wrap it up and i have so i can lower the boom on this other fact and that fact is you process somebody without tone arm action and you might as well take him for walk in the park itd probably be more therapeutic see its that important to have that old tone arm waggling i wont go into what is tone arm action theres bulletin on it it still holds good good tone arm action poor tone arm action tone arm action these things have all been classified that tone arm there tells you how much mass you are discharging off the reactive bank and when that thing isnt wiggling youre not discharging any mass off the reactive bank and that is all there is to it so my problem then became and has been with now for many weeks horriblya haunting nightmare of problem what is tone arm action when its absent not what is tone arm action we know that but what is tone arm action what is tone arm action now my god if its assumed the importance of the fact that youve got to drop 50 percent of the people you process just because they dont get tone arm action regardless of what else they do while running engramsthat becomes very important question what is tone arm action wow and boy if that hasnt been conundrum well ive been able to sort it out ive been able to sort it out to this degreeits sorted out i wontit isnt modified sortout it has been sorted out the tone arm action disappears off case to the degree that time is in error and there is the answer this is very important and this wraps up an awful lot of packages for you tone arm action does not cease because youve run wrong goal thats quite interesting itll slow down and monkup because you fail to run out gpm because of this because of that because of something else it doesnt cease because of these things oddly enough it doesnt cease because of arc breaks you may think it might cease because of arc breaks only because it accidentally falls over also into the other time consideration arc breaks are mostly caused by wrong time you see so you could have read that reversewise the old dianetic axiom time is the single source of human aberration could have stood lot more punchup i knew it was true but i knew lot of other things were true thats the truth you get the difference between you know we know it was true thats the truth see time is the single source of aberration the gpm is totally devoted to scrambling somebodys time the doublefiring items so if you cant get the gpms off the case if you cant get those particular engrams off the case the guy will never make it they are geared 100 percent to be aberrative by the way theyre very hard to date and you want to know where dating is in this im goingim talking to you about dating right now time now one of the things that your pc who is hasnt got any sonic and very little visioone of the reasons he cant get rocket read and probably the chief one is because he never contacts the speed of the item or the fire he never contacts it and so he gets very poor rocket reads on the thing you know how one of those things sound i wont use one here that is very aberrative because itll stir you up let think of something well use spat as the goal and well use nonsensically as the part of it so with nonsensically spat as the ri we actually get something like this ppppppfffffffsssssss crack nonsensically spat thats the way gpm sounds all the way up the track thats hissing type on the earlier track from the helatrobus the helatrobus goes crack nonsensically spat clang they put clang in after it to make you think that pellet has hit the other pole and youve been shot at lot of you have been run on these things and didnt know that did you running them without sonic now how does pc normally react to this how did thetan normally react to this particularly the hissing type which is earlier and more germane to thetanthe pppppffffffffffsssssssssss nonsensically spat and hed just go geeek why doesnt it get over with see so part of your aberrative factor is hes rushing it have you ever had pc get very very very speedy on the gpms you know speedy you know trying to get it off in hurry get another one off in hurry give him four items at once you know did you ever have anybody doing this well that person is just dramatizing the natural reaction to this man it feelsin the incident it felt like he was walking under water at enormous restraint see and hes just going mad why cant this thing get over with because hes fasthes fast cookie see the doublefiring principle of item one versus item twothis double firing principle again messed it all up it hung him up in time dont you see because it gave positivenegative charge to two opposing sentiments it hit him from the right and it hit him from the left and made him feel like he couldnt move but that he had to move to get out of the way of it and hed get into all kinds of time scrambles the total purpose of the gpm was to scramble time this is represented by the fact that theyre the hardest engrams to date they float they float in time and theyre based on the problems activities i was talking to you about all the rationale of the gpm as given in early lectures on the subject and so on is all valid these things are all the laws of life theyre not the laws of gpms i had to figure them out and synthesize them then i found out somebody else had taken shadow of this thing and theyd made false ones all over the track and that was one of the reasons why that was one of the reasons why people couldnt run engrams because you cant run through them you have to run them out with repeater technique because of the opposing items pc cannot go through them just scan scan and thats out dont you see you scan somebody through gpm and it all goes black why does it go black well he protested it all the way through and what you do is rekindle his protest when he got it and of course that turns the engram black and then you cant see anything in it and then he cant move on the track and hes all frozen up in the thing and so forth so its remarkable that we can run these things now do you get the idea the important truth was that time is the single source of aberration now all that is very interesting all thats very interestingthe gpm and its aberrative character on time but actually we dont care so much about its aberrative character on time we can neglect it because we can resolve it it isnt that that keeps the tone arm from moving we can louse one of these things up and we stillwe still dont curei mean dont stop that tone arm you can run person through wrong goal with flock of wrong items and still have tone arm action itll mess it up bit because hes not moving as fast and that sort of thing but it wont stop it so what is this thing called stopped tone arm action what is it all right it is simply wrong dates that is all it is wrong time thats all now you go and forget thisthat ive just given you as datum and i wont wish you any bad luck like getting on pole trap but youll have hard time youll have hard time with pcs if you forget those two data the two data are of course that person cannot run track successfully even with sonic visio and everything elseunless he also has tone arm action see dont lay that one aside and get that under the dont get that one parked because thats very important datum terribly important technically tone arm action come off of it man i dont care how pretty its running finish the cycle so the pc wont be upset dont you see and then unloadhit the silk tone arm action now the source of tone arm actionwell there are other contributive sources because they all contain in them this other factor and you could say that there are an awful lot of them but you isolate what factor it is in each one of those and youll find out it all comes back to the same thing wrong time tone arm action equals wrong time reverse it nowwrong time equals tone arm action now ill go over these again if youre running person with tone arm action you wont make it i dont care what youre running and how promising it looks youll see and youll do it someday and youll notice the pc setting the same goals every session and the same gains and so on theyre doing all right well they lost somatic and they had little bit of this and you say my god how long can this go on oh it could go on for the next three or four thousand hours youre not getting the job done see tone arm action equals processing fascinating but true and the other one is is tone arm action equals wrong time and the solution isto that iswrong time equals tone arm action now if you can just get those things straightened out why youve got it made these are terribly important data i fought for these as ive been telling you since last october and particularly in the last few months and these have been giving bad time i havent worried about anything for long time but when you figure the number of factors that could have gone into this problem ive been throwing them away in avalanches you know stripping the problem down to essentials and working it back and so forth and finally made it and there is the result of that work very important very important because therestheres the cases that wouldnt have gone to ot see and theres an occasional case that was running all right but suddenly isnt running all right how do you put that case back together again heres the answer to 90 percent of your auditing problems 90 percent what about the other 10 percent well that depends on you if you never follow an auditing cycle and so forth why youre going to have lot of trouble you can still get auditing done youre just going to have trouble it isnt by the way going to stop the tone arm from moving moving tone arm iscannot be cured by being perfect auditor thats an interesting fact thats how important this datum is see it looms man it looms all right letslets get now hammer pound right to the whole business of dating if wrong time equals tone arm action and if tone arm action equals wrong time then we have lot of data that we can figure out zingzingzing with regard to any case were auditing this tells us that if we dont know how to date accurately we are soon going to have case which isnt producing any tone arm action well theres the importance of dating the greatest importance of dating is accuracy now this doesnt mean accuracy down to the last microsecond you can still do approximate dating of course it makes my brains creek little bit when somebody says 105 trillion trillion years to i can see this enormous span dont you see oflordthe life term of this planet according to modern science can be dropped into that date at random approximately 105 trillion trillion years ago you could just drop this solar systems whole history you see into that date several times and never miss it well is it 1051 1052 oh my god do you know what youve got there 1052 and the difference between 1051 trillion trillion years ago and 1052 trillion years agotrillion trillion years ago you go figure it out some time and you see what i mean thats lot of years vast panorama and your brain will go creak underneath this sort of thing nevertheless even that crude dating pattern is successful in auditing you can date that crudely and that grossly and still make it without lousing up the tone arm action so your errors are usually gross not minorgross errors you dated this thing at 545 years ago and its actually at 912 trillion i mean thats what were talking about errors you get the idea weve dated it at 159 trillion trillion years ago and its actually 115000 trillion trillion ago you get the idea when i mean wrong date im talking about wrong date the slight error of decimal place or something like that is not going to cause the cataclysm ordinarily but that should be guarded against too we mean when we say all right is it later than 115000 trillion years ago earlier than 115000 trillion years ago and we get earlier than because the pc thought it was later than and therefore protests earlier than and then we dont clear up the needle or the reaction and we go to well is it more than 100000 trillion years ago less than 100000 trillion years ago and again he says but im sure it is later to himself and we get protest of earlier so we get bigger read on earlier so we say well is it more than 50000 trillion trillioni mean 50000 trillion years ago or less than 50000 trillion years ago and he says good god its much later on the track than that he isnt talking dont you understand hes just thinking all this and you say all right well is it greater than one trillion years ago or is it less more than one trillion years ago or less than one trillion years getting quite read now so you say well is it we get tremendous read now at is it greater than 100 billion years ago is it less than 100 billion years ago 100 billion years ago and by this time his protest is so great and hes so enturbulated that you get steep drops falls and skyrockets and smoke coming out of the meter so you say all right thats thats thats 100 thousandthats 100 billion years ago yes thatsthats the date well he doesnt know anything about it he says well thats what the auditor said so thats all right now were going to go to the beginning of the incident now were going to get its duration and that sort of thingits very hard to get its duration but we manage to get something you know and so on we run the pc through all this muck and the next thing you knowyou had good running needle and the needle was all right before you started all this and then the state of the needle sort of tightens up the next thing you know why your tone arm gets up here to about 475 45 and you run through the incident the pc talks about the incident and the odd part of it is hell get something there you know and you go through it and so on and your tone armswell well you didnt get much tone arm action out of it well this next one were going to get good tone arm action on so lets date this next one all right now were looking for the earlier incident the earlier incident of that so naturally were going to look at 500 billion years ago or something like this and heby george he finds something there that has very little to do with any part of chain or anything of this sort but suddenly he says you know ive been thinking he said the incident youve got now it is much later i think its in the trillions of trillions actually oh you accommodatingly date it in the trillions of trillions so it finally comes out that this incident that you have just now found you see this incident is at 50 trillion trillion years ago thats the way it dates well actually it was at 500 billion years ago you get the idea so youve got the late one that should be early and the early one that should be late and this tone arm now starts looking like something thats cast in concrete it isnt just still it has stillness in perpetuity about it its quite intriguing all right so much for that so much for that how do we straighten out this case how do we straighten it out we clean the question wrong times in auditing wrong time wrong dates and if you want to clean up case all the way on it you give dating on dating has anything been you know and girl comes up with the fact that she doesnt like dating very much with certain boys and you clean that too you understand see anything dating means to them give it big 18button prepcheck on the subject of dating and then come around and say wrong times and wrong dates any way you want to phrase it you had any wrong dates well we dont care whether this person answers it in auditing or not in auditing or in your auditing or somebody elses auditing or anything else as long as that thing ticks we clean it as long as wethat needle is rough on this subject we clean it and whathow do we do it we date the wrong dates youyouyou you got that wrong see i mean iyou dont redate the wrong dates you date when the wrong dates happened you understand was it in last weeks auditing session that you got some wrong dates do you understand this becomes very involved you see because youre getting times when things were wrongly datednot correcting the wrong dates and now when youve got the time when it was wrongly dated then you run down what was wrongly dated and clean it up with the pc even if you have to redate it you say well thats quite an activity you could go on like that for some time haha yes i guess you could i guess youre going to and you will mysteriously see tone arm action restore to the case quite an activity it might take you session or two to accomplish the whole thing you want wrong dates that the pc guessed at or assumed in 1950 while running an engram you want the all the time the pc assumed that the time track was only 185 trillion years long thats wrong date wrong time isnt it you want the times when the pc assumed almost anything on the subject of dating particularly dating on the meter andthingbut you just clean up anything you can find until talking about wrong dates asking about wrong dates asking about wrong times or anything like that you get perfectly smooth needle and you keep on going on it until youve got smooth needle not because that needles suppressed but because there arent any more uncorrected on this case which are now in restimulation okay and after that your dating is ball you get reads marvelous you get reads i mean your dating reads easily because youre not reading it through the fog of bunch of wrong dates youre not reading it through upset about wrong dates dont you see on some pcs all you have to do is askjust say were going to date this and youve got dirty needle see well whats that dirty needle from that dirty needle is exclusively from bunch of wrong dates now the funny part of an auditor is is you also will find his finding wrong dates on the pcs will produce reaction so you clean that off too you just clean anything off thatit is nowhere near the reaction of whats been found on him as pcwrong dates found on him as pc but you may find it in there ticking and kickingworries about datings upsets about this im not giving you process now im telling you clean it up see just clean it up i dont care how you clean it up just get all the wrong dates off of this thing see get all the anxiety off on the subject of dating now youll be able to go back and pick up some of the things that tone arm action ceased on and all of sudden have tone arm action it may change the programming of the case you may find the goal to be alone in the helatrobus implants wasnt its in the gorilla goals small error of about 10 trillion trillion years it isnt that it had different line plot which it did that wouldnt have stopped your meter cold its just in the wrong place oh the line plot wrong line plot will of course jam up and slow down and raise hell you understand but it really wont do good job of it unless the dates wrong now you find helatrobus implant item at 10 trillion trillion years ago gorilla goals and youve got what for that item youve got gorgeously wrong date havent you the goal to be alone is in both of them thats what stops the needle thats what stops the ta rather thats what kills your rocket read its not the mechanics of the fact theres wrong pattern its that the pattern is being used at the wrong date you understand this is marvelous because youll find everything starts runningits as almost as though you had totally motionless world and somebody pushed button on and all the clockwork dolls all of sudden start moving see how did that happen your barrier to ot on 50 percent of the cases youll ever come near was they couldnt run the time track with tone arm action not that they couldnt run the time track with perception but that they couldnt run the because you give us tone arm action we can run the time track with perception thats not even problem you get the right date and right duration you get perception bang thats all there is to that and you do 3r3r right according to the book with the right date and the right durationyou get perception if you havent got perception you havent got the right date or you havent got the right duration and sometimes you havent got either the right date or the right duration so you find the right date and you find the right duration and you send the pc to the beginning of the incident and new world opens hes now got perception if its got gpm in it and you scan it through him you longer got the perception the lights go out why because you brushed past the items and restimulated the black protest of the pc and youthats that but as soon as you pick up the items out of it the lights turn on again this is all very remarkable right date right duration equals perception wrong duration or wrong date equals perception now theres some other thing that happens dubin itself is simply phenomenon of wrong dates marvelous its just phenomenon of wrong dates thats all it is nothing else prove it get loud and clear on your meterget loud and clear on your meter that the incident is 500 years ago tell the pcthis is good running pctell the pc that it is 100 trillion years ago get on the meter that the duration is 2v2 days tell the pc that it is 912 years tell the pc to go to the beginning of the incident and you will have collection of pictures from all over the track which appear to be dubbed and he wont be able to move he wont be able to move on the time track hell just have pictures and its all kind of blaa and hes not going anyplace and he doesnt get through anything in that way you could take very good case that was running well and produce this phenomenon we have called dubin now correctly date the incident at 500 years ago say i gave you wrongwrong date the date now is 500 years ago got wrong duration here you have to do this in such way that he isnt betrayed this incident is not years long its actually 212 days long now move to approximately 500 years ago good move to the beginning of the incident at approximately 500 years ago very good move through the incident to point 2v2 days later snap visio snap sonic snap dubin and tone arm action got it this is remarkable youll see this happen before your eyes remember that you can make some corny errors that will include time in them like use the wrong pattern get lot of wrong items start crumpling up facsimiles youll see normally that these dont interrupt tone arm action they upset the pc but they dont interrupt tone arm action pcs still getting something like tone arm action but dont go diving overboard when you see that tone arm action cease on the basis of straightening out items and getting ingetting in bunch of prepcheck buttons on wrong goals and all kinds of other rationale na you go to the basis of wrong dates and figure out how it made wrong date and then correct that and all of sudden your tone arm action is restored and until you do that you wont get any tone arm action you run the helatrobus implant plot on gorilla goal its obviously wrong date its not the wrong plot its the wrong date youll find that the same goal also occurs in the helatrobus implants or some similarly worded goal well youve got to straighten that out otherwise your pc will be upset its wrong time however that will restore your tone arm motion you got it straighten out wrong items dont let downgrade those things because theyre very tough on pc and they leave lot all over the thing and so forth when that tone arm stops moving there it is now one of the things that you will run up against youll occasionally flatten chain and your tone arm action will go up this has something to do with wrong dates more deeply seated in the case than you have power to overcome without reassessment the guys got stuff all wrongly dated himself he had bunch of stuff wrongly dated what he did was exceed his level of reality now lets look little bit further at this whole subject of wrong time now lets use wrong time to get case that cannot run engrams lets get the subject of wrong time here and lets get this case into shape to run engrams in other words lets reverse the whole magic and lets take the guy who is dragging bottom and lets use the subject of wrong time to give him tone arm action and put him on the time track how would you go about that joe blow he cant run engrams because theyre unreal goes into any past lifetheyre unreal hell tell you this right away everything is unreal and he cant believe it and he doesnt believe in that sort of stuff anyway whats his wrong date life began at birth so lets just strip off of his case every consideration that life began at birth and all of sudden up will go his reality and he can move onto the backtrack or whatever else wrong time you can find associated with that subject dont you see his error on wrong time is the length of the time track he thinks the length of his time track is his age 32 years well thats hell of an error look at it though as trap mechanism we have only lived but once look at that as trap mechanism isnt that fascinating you wonder why is this so popular with the savants of science oooh why do they insist on this why do they raise so much fuss with somebody saying hes lived before well they wouldnt raise that much fuss unless they had some idea of entrapment in mind nobody ever protests against truth unless he has vested interest in falsehood yeah im afraid this onelife proposition is method of tying everybody down to the ground its much more important than youd think lets take this case he can get back fifteen or twenty thirty lifetimes he can get back to the roman empire lets say now thatbeyond that it gets pretty unreal he just got wrong time someplace but remember you can run him within the span of what he considers right time you can run him in that span so youve got to clean the dates out of what he considers right time and you will find that youre gradually extending his time track backwards now this happens to any case it isnt just one lifetime ill confide in you that the first time an incident was spotted on in the four trillion bracket four trillions you see trillion trillion trillion trillion bracket my immediate thought was ill never get back there if that exists and i did get back there thereswould be nothing there anyway it justjust was too big i was running with great happiness at the time i was running hundreds of trillions this wasthis was ball i mean this wasi was getting so i was running this with better reality than i used to have on this lifetime you see and when i found myself one time at i think about eight trillion trillion the incident i was in seemed awfully long ago and very very unreal it was just an awful long time ago i didnt have any reality on it there was somebody pulling some caper of putting horrible looking hands in the sky in order to intimidate people you see with the coming of god or something and i didnt know i said i must be back at the beginning of the time track or i something or other i just couldnt make head nor tail out of the thing and then we found the beginning of the incident we found wed had wrong date all the way along the line and all of sudden this all brightened up and the reality factor came up so any case is going to hit ceiling of reality on the subject of dating some people can go back trillions and some people can go back minutes some can go back years some can go back this lifetime some can go back lot of lifetimes some can go back millions some can go back trillions hundreds of trillions when you get up into trillions of trillions why you could expect almost anybody to creak one place or another but they only creak to the degree that theres wrongnesses on time time wrongnesses thats the keynote and thats the key to that situation now youre not working particularly to increase the persons reality you just go along in the general course of running r3r or r3r plus 3n or just 3n or anything that youre running whatever youre doingdate correctly duration correctly if youre running into trouble youre not getting tone arm action pcs arc breaking and so forth the first thing you suspect is not beautiful significance but wrong date wrong duration see 3n youre not using durations but youll have wrong date now wrong date can sneak in on you without doing any dating you just supposed the engramthe gpm you were running you seeyou just supposed that this thing must be in the helatrobus implants because youve heard of the goal in the helatrobus implants and that sort of thing and all of sudden your pcs tone arm is up there at 50 and he isnt rring well you say well how can i have wrong date because ive never assigned any wrongany dates at all to this oh you never assigned any dates at all dont you see and oh you never assigned any dates at all the goal takes place much closer to pt than the helatrobus implants by saying even the helatrobus implants and give him that pattern you wrongly dated the goal didnt you the second you straighten out where it is whether you run the goal or not youll suddenly have restored your tone arm action so there is the boulder on which the bark flounders first you have to know what foundering bark is that is cessation of tone arm action when you see tone arm action seceded from the session you know that the bow of the vessel has run on large jagged boulder and is going to sink from here on itll sink slowly itll sink for sessions before you suddenly find theres water around your feet your pc isnt talking to you now you wonder how this ever happened and then the pc is not only not talking to you in session but also is not talking to you out of session and you want to know what happened i must have had an arc break figure figure figure figure figure see oh yeah he probably had an arc break but that wont do it very permanently when the bark really went up on the rock was when the tone arm ceased and you can go back and look for the last session in which you had tone arm action and look for the wrong dates in that session and the next one now never leave wrong date on case just dont leave one on case thats all theres several things that you dont audit case with one of them is wrong goal youve got wrong goal on case you clean it up first order of action but this takes seniority even to that now we found more important level dont pick up case that has had bunch of mr or something like that and is now not getting tone arm action without cleaning up the whole subject of wrong dates just straightaway clean it all up whole subject of datinglets get that all cleaned up and then proceed because the cessation of tone arm action on the case came from wrong dates now i wouldnt pester case that had good tone arm action unless the case started to arc break more often i would tend to assumei would tend to assume that we were running the case on wrong assessment or were pushing the case too hard or going uphill i would also assume these things you see but i would make sure that all this wasnt happening because of wrong date matter what else i was doing i would throw this in you see it was like the fellowthe fellow who repairs the airplane you see he repairs the airplane he fixes up the motor and does everything else to it you know and then throws aand then puts rabbits foot in his pocket you know same type of action see youve done everything that you can do that you can see on the surface of it well also do this one dont you see just throw it in i dont care where you throw it in you see that its quite important now case which is getting tone arm action from 30 to 40 if you got all the wrong dates off would probably get tone arm action from 25 to 45 so it isnt something you just use on stopped ta action you can also speed up your ta action by cleaning up this thing see now some cases are so unreal on the subject of time that they almost stop if you misdate little somethingit isnt even an important date you say all right i see here that you have an engram or hes got lock or something of this sort in 1952 and its actually 1953 you try to run the pc through it and the tone arm will go clank and stick redate oh 19 hehheh1953 all right we straighten that point of dating out all of sudden your tone arm action is restored thats because the case has got builtin wrong time in other words this case has been so overwhumped with wrong times one way or the other so many gpms so much this so much that and so on theyre pretty woggy and you start auditing them they can hardly take it so that gives you point of approach as far as processes which can be audited on the meter which is dating point of approach now how much good could you do case that otherwise couldnt run engrams and had track just by sitting down and doing good accurate job of dating anything under the sun moon and stars on the case interesting because it would produce real time track at least in this lifetime just find the date of everything dont run anything see dont run anything just find the date of everything see when did you go to school well i think it was about 1943 well all right good good were glad of that and so forth lets see letlet check that now we have to have certain reservation on the amount of invalidation we do of rechecking the wrong date dont you see the best way to do it is just to check periodically in the session for wrong date minimal invalidation dont you see normally on such case we say when did you go to school well i dont know i thought if that was 1932 it was 1951 it was you know say well lets date that well lets get very fancy lets get very fancy and nearly always date in years ago because you can be too often thrown for loop by dating on earth time pc hasnt been here but about two lifetimes see and youre trying to date 1776 ad 1776 where did that come from pc will be falling all over ad 1776 whereas he responded on years ago and then you finally find out if youre running engrams that why he hasnt been here on earth hes been in some other planetary system they had another time now in thein the final analysis here as final word on this subject this has been an interesting sprint and its toward ot and its been an interesting thing which has closed the doorhas kept the door closed its just been wrong timewrong timethats kept the door closed and that is what will basically close the door on anybody now lets take reach and withdraw process and ill show you what i mean reach and withdraw processill give you another talk about this all about reach and withdraw some other occasionbut weve got this person walking from point to point b in the room and theyre walking through facsimiles now do you see that as wrong date proposition matter of wrong date theyre walking through the room and theyre stepping between maypoles and eventually the experience of walking through the room brings them to realization that this is this date you dont necessarily find whats the date of the maypoles you understand but it brings them the accuracy of this date which cures some wrong dating to that degree now supposingnow lets get fancy this is not necessarily recommended process or anything because that other process im just giving you is very successful lets take look at this we walk them through the room and they keep running into ship capstans and the second we find theyre running into ship capstans as they walk through the room we grab our meter and date the ship capstans accurately got that we dont run the incident lets just date the ship capstans and then lets return them to walking back and forth across the room until they run into something else and theres some beautiful blackeyed maidens all of sudden that theyre walking through and trying to avoid you know theyre aberrated if theyre trying to avoid them lets just date these beautiful blackeyed maidens got the idea that hasnt even been testedim just you know thats just off the cuff im just showing you how can you use this principle called wrong dating now ive taken the lowest level process we have that produces results you see how you could apply it to that one it applies to that naturally because it shows present time is present time but you also could use dating in the thing and square that around you could probably take case that couldnt remember half of this lifetime and cook up some means of dating this lifetime and making it accurate accurately dating this lifetime and getting it in line and getting things in sequence and that sort of thing and all of sudden youd find mysteriously that he had tremendous reality on all of this lifetime there are many other ways of producing this but this is very directvery direct method of doing so this data ive given you in this is the makeorbreak point on about 50 percent of the cases that you will ever audititll be the makeorbreak point youll get lot of people through by the skin of their teeth and panting and huffing andbut youll make it you understand its rough but this is the other 50 percent that wouldnt make it at all to that we must add howeverwe must add howevergood auditing and all the technology okay thank you very much
