defense and trade division irans nuclear program status summary although iran claims that its nuclear programs are exclusively for peaceful purposes they have generated considerable concern that tehran is pursuing nuclear weapons program indeed the security council has responded to irans refusal to suspend work on its uranium enrichment and heavywater nuclear reactor programs by adopting several resolutions which imposed sanctions on tehran despite this pressure iran continues at its natanz centrifuge facility to enrich uranium expand the number of operating centrifuges and conduct research on new types of centrifuges tehran has also continued to produce centrifuge feedstock as well as work on its heavywater reactor and associated facilities whether iran is pursuing nuclear weapons program is however unknown national intelligence estimate made public in december 2007 assessed that tehran halted its nuclear weapons program defined as irans nuclear weapon design and weaponization work and covert uranium conversionrelated and uranium enrichment related work in 2003 the estimate however also assessed that tehran is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons and that any decision to end nuclear weapons program is inherently reversible although iran has cooperated with the international atomic energy agency iaea to an extent the agency says that tehran has not gone far enough to alleviate all of the agencys concerns about irans enrichment and heavywater reactor programs the iaea continues to investigate the program particularly evidence that tehran may have conducted procurement activities and research directly applicable to nuclear weapons development this report expands and replaces rs21592 irans nuclear program recent developments by sharon

status background iran has had nuclear program for close to 50 years beginning with research reactor purchased from the united states in 1959 us concerns that iran could pursue nuclear weapons program date back to at least the mid1970s as evidenced by us intelligence reports from that decade1 during the 1970s tehran planned to build nuclear power reactors and actually began constructing lightwater moderated nuclear power reactor near the city of bushehr iran also considered obtaining uranium enrichment and reprocessing technology2 iran cancelled the nuclear program after the 1979 revolution but reinstituted the program in 1982 according to 1988 cia report3 but 1985 national intelligence council report which cited iran as potential proliferation threat stated that tehran was interested in developing facilities that could eventually produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear weapon the report however added that it would take at least decade for iran to do so4 the iranian government says that it plans to expand its reliance on nuclear power in order to generate electricity this program will tehran says substitute for oil and gas consumption and allow iran to export its fossil fuels currently russian contractor is completing the bushehr reactor and iran says it intends to build additional reactors5 iranian officials say that tehran has begun design work on its first indigenously produced lightwater reactor which is to be constructed at 1 prospects for further proliferation of nuclear weapons special national intelligence estimate august 23 1974 2 for example the united states was willing to supply iran with reprocessing technology according to 1975 and 1976 national security council documents tehran also had 1976 contract for pilot uranium enrichment facility

newshourbbmiddle_eastjulydec04iran_927html crs2 darkhovin6 iran anticipates that foreign experts will be involved in the project an official associated with the project said7 iranian officials have repeatedly asserted that the countrys nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes for example supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei declared during june 3 2008 speech that iran is opposed to nuclear weapons based on religious and islamic beliefs as well as based on logic and wisdom he added nuclear weapons have benefit but high costs to manufacture and keep them nuclear weapons do not bring power to nation because they are not applicable nuclear weapons cannot be used similarly iranian foreign ministry spokesperson hassan qashqavi stated november 10 2008 that pursuance of nuclear weapons has place in the countrys defense doctrine8 however the united states and other governments have argued that iran may be pursuing at minimum the capability to produce nuclear weapons discerning peaceful nuclear program from nuclear weapons program can be difficult because of the dualuse nature of much of the technology in addition military nuclear programs may coexist with civilian programs even without an explicit decision to produce nuclear weapons jose goldemberg brazils former secretary of state for science and technology observed that country developing the capability to produce nuclear fuel does not have to make an explicit early political decision to acquire nuclear weapons in some countries such path is supported equally by those who genuinely want to explore an energy alternative and by government officials who either want nuclear weapons or just want to keep the option open9 the main source of proliferation concern is tehrans construction of gas centrifugebased uranium enrichment facility tehran claims that it wants to produce lowenriched uranium leu for its current and future reactors although iranian officials have expressed interest in purchasing nuclear fuel from other countries they assert that tehran should have an indigenous enrichment capability as hedge against possible fuel supply disruptions10 6 iran nuclear spokesman

gas centrifuges enrich uranium by spinning uranium hexafluoride gas at high speeds to increase the concentration of the uranium235 isotope such centrifuges can produce both leu which can be used in nuclear power reactors and highly enriched uranium heu which is one of the two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons heu can also be used as fuel in certain types of nuclear reactors11 iran also has uraniumconversion facility which converts uranium oxide into several compounds including uranium hexafluoride heavywater reactor which iran is constructing at arak has also been source of concern although tehran says that the reactor is intended for the production of medical isotopes it is proliferation concern because its spent fuel will contain plutonium wellsuited for use in nuclear weapons spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors contains plutonium the other type of fissile material used in nuclear weapons in order to be used in nuclear weapons however plutonium must be separated from the spent fuel procedure called reprocessing iran has said that it will not engage in reprocessing in addition to the dualuse nature of the nuclear programs described above tehrans interactions with the international atomic energy agency iaea have contributed to suspicions that tehran has nuclear weapons program in the past iran has taken several actions that interfered with the agencys investigation of its nuclear program including concealing nuclear activities and providing misleading statements although the iaea has gotten more complete picture of irans nuclear program since its investigation began in 2002 the agency still wants tehran to provide more information iaea directorgeneral mohamed elbaradei explained in june 2008 interview that they the iranians have concealed things from us in the past but that doesnt prove that they are building bomb today they continue to insist that they are interested solely in using nuclear power for civilian purposes we have yet to find smoking gun that would prove them wrong but there are suspicious circumstances and unsettling questions the iranians willingness to cooperate leaves lot to be desired iran must do more to provide us with access to certain individuals and documents it must make stronger contribution to clarifying the last unanswered set of questions those relating to possible military dimension of the iranian nuclear program12 recent nuclear controversy the recent public controversy over irans nuclear program began in august 2002 when the national council of resistance on iran ncri an iranian exile group revealed information during press conference some of which later proved to be accurate that iran had built nuclearrelated facilities at natanz and arak that 11 highly enriched uranium typically contains over 90 uranium235 whereas low enriched uranium used in nuclear reactors typically contains less than 5 uranium235 12 interview with iaea boss mohamed elbaradei der spiegel june 11 2008 crs4 it had not revealed to the iaea the united states had been aware of at least some of these activities according to knowledgeable former officials13 statesparties to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt are obligated to conclude safeguards agreement with the iaea in the case of nonnuclearweapon statesparties to the treaty of which iran is one such agreements allow the agency to monitor nuclear facilities and materials to ensure that they are not diverted for military purposes however the agencys inspections and monitoring authority is limited to facilities that have been declared by the government14 additional protocols to iaea safeguards agreements augment the agencys authority to investigate clandestine nuclear facilities and activities by increasing the agencys authority to inspect certain facilities and demand additional information from states parties15 the iaeas statute requires its board of governors to refer cases of non compliance with safeguards agreements to the security council prior to the ncris revelations the iaea had expressed concerns that iran had not been providing the agency with all relevant information about its nuclear programs but had never found iran in violation of its safeguards agreement in fall 2002 the iaea began to investigate irans nuclear activities at natanz and arak and inspectors visited the sites the following february the iaea board adopted its first resolution which called on tehran to increase its cooperation with the agencys investigation and to suspend its uranium enrichment activities in september 2003 the next month iran concluded an agreement with france germany and the united kingdom collectively known as the e3 to suspend its enrichment activities sign and implement an additional protocol to its 1974 iaea safeguards agreement and comply fully with the iaeas investigation16 as result the iaea board decided to refrain from referring the matter to the security council ultimately the iaeas investigation as well as information tehran provided after the october 2003 agreement revealed that iran had engaged in variety of clandestine nuclearrelated activities some of which violated irans safeguards agreement these included plutonium separation experiments uranium enrichment and conversion experiments and importing various uranium compounds 13 gary samore former senior

agreement is available at httpwwwiaeaorgnewscenterfocusiaeairan statement_iran21102003shtml iran signed its additional protocol in december 2003 but has not ratified it crs5 after october 2003 iran continued some of its enrichmentrelated activities but tehran and the e3 agreed in november 2004 to more detailed suspension agreement however iran resumed uranium conversion in august 2005 under the leadership of president mahmoud ahmadinejad who had been elected two months earlier iran announced in january 2006 that it would resume research and development on its centrifuges at natanz in response the iaea board adopted resolution february 4 2006 that referred the matter to the security council two days later tehran announced that it would stop implementing its additional protocol in june 2006 china france germany russia the united kingdom and the united states collectively known as the p51 presented proposal to iran that offered variety of incentives in return for tehran taking several steps to assuage international concerns about its enrichment and heavywater programs17 the proposal called on the government to address the iaeas outstanding concerns through full cooperation with the agencys ongoing investigation of tehrans nuclear programs suspend all enrichmentrelated and reprocessing activities and resume implementing its additional protocol european union high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana presented revised version of the 2006 offer to iran in june 200818 representatives from the p51 discussed the new proposal with iranian officials in july 2008 iran provided followup response the next month but the six countries deemed it unsatisfactory19 tehran has told the iaea that it would implement its additional protocol if the nuclear file is returned from the security council to the agency20 it is however unclear how the council could meet this condition the 2006 offers requirements have also been included in several security council resolutions the most recent of which resolution 1835 was adopted september 27 200821 however november 19 2008 report from elbaradei to the security council and the iaea board indicated that tehran has continued to defy the councils demands by continuing work on its uranium enrichment program and 17 the proposal text is available at httparmscontrolorgpdf20060606_iran_p51_

heavywater reactor program22 iranian officials maintain that iran will not suspend its enrichment program irans cooperation with the iaea iran and the iaea agreed in august 2007 on work plan to clarify the outstanding questions regarding tehrans nuclear program23 most of these issues24 which had contributed to suspicions that iran had been pursuing nuclear weapons program have essentially been resolved but elbaradei told the iaea board june 2 2008 that there is one remaining major unresolved issue which concerns questions regarding possible military dimensions to irans nuclear programme iran maintains that it has not conducted any work on nuclear weapons iran and the iaea have had series of discussions regarding these issues the last meeting was held august 1820 according to elbaradeis september report the agency has provided iran with documents or in some cases descriptions of documents which themselves were provided to the iaea by several governments indicating that iranian entities may have conducted studies related to nuclear weapons development the subjects of these studies included missile reentry vehicles for delivering nuclear warheads uranium conversion and conventional explosives used in nuclear weapons25 elbaradei told the iaea board of governors september 22 2008 that according to iranian officials the documents are not authentic26 he added that these officials acknowledged that some of the information in the documents is accurate but the activities described were the iranians said exclusively for peaceful purposes tehran has provided some relevant information about these matters to the iaea but elbaradei reported that the government still should provide all of the information access to documents and access to individuals necessary to support irans statements indeed the agency believes that iran may 22 implementation of the npt safeguards agreement and relevant provisions of security council resolutions 1737 2006 1747 2007 1803

rs22758 irans ballistic missile programs an overview by steven hildreth 26 iran has complained that the iaea has not provided tehran with original versions of some documentation related to the alleged military dimensionsof irans nuclear program elbaradeis february may and september reports have all stated that the agency has not had permission to provide this documentation from the governments which provided it on september 22 elbaradei called on such governments to authorize the agency to share it with iran crs7 have additional information which could shed more light on the nature of these alleged studies and which iran should share with the agency27 in september 28 2008 letter to the iaea iran described some characteristics of the documents discussed above28 the letter stated that some of the information from the united states was shown to iranian officials as powerpoint presentations additionally some of the documents are in contradiction with typical standard iranian documentation and lack classification seals the letter said the iaea has asked tehran about other information suggesting that the country may have pursued nuclear weapons such as information about high level meeting in 1984 on reviving irans prerevolution nuclear programme the scope of visit by officials associated with irans atomic energy organization to nuclear installation in pakistan in 1987 information on 1993 meetings between iranian officials and members of clandestine procurement network run by former pakistani nuclear official abdul qadeer khan and information about work done in 2000 which apparently related to reprocessing29 the agency also wants iran to provide more information on nuclearrelated procurement production and research activity by entities linked to irans military and defense establishments these included attempts to obtain items such as spark gaps shock wave software and neutron sources which could be useful for developing nuclear weapons30 in addition elbaradeis may report notes that substantial parts of irans centrifuge components were manufactured in the workshops of the defence industries organization furthermore the iaea has asked tehran to provide additional information about the manner in which it acquired document describing the procedures for reducing uranium hexafluoride to uranium metal as well as machining enriched uranium metal into hemispheres which are components of nuclear weapons31 tehran has previously told the agency that it was offered equipment for casting uranium but never actually received it according to iran its nuclear suppliers many 27 gov20084 28 permanent mission of the islamic republic of iran explanatory comments by the islamic republic of iran on the report of the iaea director general to the september

gov20084 31 gov200815 crs8 of whom were affiliated with the khan network provided the document in 1987 at their own initiative rather than at tehrans request islamabad has confirmed to the iaea that an identical document exists in pakistan32 elbaradeis november report points out that the iaea with the exception of the document related to uranium metal has information on the actual design or manufacture by iran of components nuclear or otherwise for nuclear weapons the report also suggests that iran and the iaea are at serious impasse tehran has not cooperated with the agency on these matters since elbaradeis september report iranian officials have indicated that tehran will not provide any further information to the agency33 nevertheless iran has been cooperating with the agency in other respects albeit with varying consistency the iaea has been able to verify that irans declared nuclear facilities and materials have not been diverted for military purposes and tehran has provided the agency with information similar to that which iran had previously provided pursuant to the additional protocol elbaradei reported in february adding that this information clarified the agencys knowledge about irans current declared nuclear programme iran however provided this information on an ad hoc basis and not in consistent and complete manner the report said34 indeed the iaea requested in april 2008 that iran provide as transparency measure access to additional locations related to the manufacturing of centrifuges rd on uranium enrichment and uranium mining but tehran has not yet agreed to do so elbaradeis february 2008 report underscored the importance of full iranian cooperation with the agencys investigation as well as tehrans implementation of its additional protocol confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of irans nuclear programme requires that the agency be able to provide assurances not only regarding declared nuclear material but equally importantly regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran although iran has provided some additional detailed information about its current activities on an ad hoc basis the agency will not be in position to make progress towards providing credible assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran before reaching some clarity about the nature of the alleged studies and without implementation of the additional protocol the iaea has also asked iran to reconsider its march 2007 decision to stop complying with portion of the subsidiary arrangements for its iaea safeguards agreement that provision to which iran agreed in 2003 requires tehran to provide design information for new nuclear facilities as soon as the decision to construct or to authorize construction of such facility has been taken whichever is earlier 32 gov200815 33 iran not to answer calls beyond npt fars news agency november 20 2008 tehran will have comprehensive interaction with iaea official islamic republic news agency november 19 2008 infcirc737 34 gov20084 crs9 previously iran was required to provide design information for new facility only 180 days before introducing nuclear material into it if tehran does not alter this decision the agency will receive considerably later notice about the construction of future iranian nuclear facilities indeed iran invoking its march 2007 decision refused to allow iaea inspectors to conduct an inspection of the arak reactor according to elbaradeis november 2008 report status of irans nuclear programs some nongovernmental experts and us officials have argued that rather than producing fissile material indigenously iran could obtain such material from foreign sources35 national intelligence estimate nie made public december 3 2007 states that the intelligence community cannot rule out that iran has acquired from abroad or will acquire in the future nuclear weapon or enough fissile material for weapon similarly during press briefing that same day senior intelligence official characterized such acquisition as an inherent option for iran however tehrans potential ability to produce its own heu or plutonium is greater cause of concern the official explained that getting bits and pieces of fissile material from overseas is not going to be sufficient to produce nuclear arsenal uranium enrichment iran has pilot centrifuge facility and larger commercial facility both located at natanz the latter is eventually to hold over 47000 centrifuges36 vice president gholamreza aghazadeh who also heads irans atomic energy organization said in april 2007 that it will take up to four years to install all of them37 iran began enriching uranium in the facility after midapril 2007 producing total of 630 kilograms of leu containing maximum of 49 uranium23538 some experts have reportedly concluded that this quantity of leu if enriched would produce enough heu for nuclear weapon however an iranian attempt to enrich this leu 35 see for example thenundersecretary of state for us arms control and international security robert josephs testimony before the senate committee on foreign relations

install over 50000 centrifuges see implementation of the npt safeguards agreement in the islamic republic of iran report by the directorgeneral gov200483 37 installation of centrifuges continues in natanz iran nuclear official iranian students news agency april 17 2007 38 gov200859 iranian operating records show that the plant has produced leu containing 49 uranium235 iaea samples have indicated that it has produced leu containing 4 uranium235 crs10 would likely be detected by the iaea39 this point is discussed in greater detail below individual centrifuges are linked together in cascades each cascade in the commercial facility contains 164 centrifuges currently iran has 18 cascades 2952 centrifuges of first generation ir1 centrifuges installed in the facility iran is feeding uranium hexafluoride into five additional 164centrifuge cascades and is installing and testing thirteen more cascades40 tehran has not fed uranium hexafluoride into any additional centrifuges since elbaradeis september report senior us intelligence official said december 3 2007 that country needs to be able to operate large numbers of centrifuges for long periods of time with very small failure rates in order to be able to make industrial quantities of enriched uranium the nie stated that iran still faces significant technical problems operating its centrifuges41 irans ability to operate its centrifuges appears to have improved in recent months however elbaradeis february report indicated that the natanz commercial facility had been operating well below its declared design capacity language that does not appear in subsequent reports in addition september15 2008 report from the institute for science and international security isis says that tehrans centrifuges appear to be running at approximately 85 percent of their stated target capacity significant increase over previous rates42 senior official reportedly offered similar assessment in september 200843 moreover november 19 2008 isis report points out44 that based on data from elbaradeis november report irans daily leu production rate has remained the same since early may 2008 iran is also working on several other centrifuge designs tehran has given the iaea information on four different centrifuge designs and has been testing small numbers of more advanced centrifuges known as the ir2 and ir3 which could

to its centrifuge work tehran is continuing to produce uranium hexafluoride as of november 3 iran had produced approximately 519 metric tons since march 2004 tehran also appears to have improved its ability to produce centrifuge feedstock of sufficient purity47 stating that centrifuge enrichment is how iran probably could first produce enough fissile material for weapon the 2007 nie adds that the earliest possible date iran would be technically capable of producing enough heu for weapon is late 200948 this date however is very unlikely the estimate says adding that iran probably would be technically capable of producing enough heu for weapon sometime during the 20102015 time frame but the state department bureau for intelligence and research the estimate says judges that tehran is unlikely to achieve this capability before 2013 and all intelligence agencies recognize the possibility that this capability may not be attained until after 201549 senior intelligence official explained during the december press briefing that the acquisition of fissile material remains the governing element in any timelines in which theyd have nuclear device the above time frame assesses tehrans capability to produce heu from its natanz facility however the 2007 nie states that iran would probably would use covert facilities rather than its declared nuclear sites for the production of highly enriched uranium for weapon indeed it is very difficult to divert without detection significant amounts of nuclear material from centrifuge facilities under iaea safeguards 2004 cia report concluded that inspections and safeguards will most likely prevent tehran from using facilities declared to the iaea directly for its weapons program as long as iran remains party to the npt50

although tehran could end its cooperation with the iaea and use its declared centrifuge facilities to develop fissile material such an action would be virtually unprecedented52 senior intelligence official explained that iran could use knowledge gained from its natanz facilities at covert enrichment facilities however there is public official evidence that iran has covert centrifuge or conversion facilities and according to the nie growing amount of intelligence indicates iran was engaged in covert uranium conversion and uranium enrichment activity but tehran probably stopped those efforts in 2003 and had not as of mid2007 restarted them plutonium iran acknowledged to the iaea in 2003 that it had conducted plutonium separation experiments an admission which aroused suspicions that iran could have program to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons the iaea however continued to investigate the matter and elbaradei reported in august 2007 that the agency has resolved its questions about irans plutonium activities53 the 2007 nie stated that iran will not be technically capable of producing and reprocessing enough plutonium for weapon before about 2015 but as noted above iran says that it does not plan to engage in reprocessing and elbaradeis november 2008 report stated that there have been indications of ongoing reprocessing related activities at irans declared nuclear facilities arak reactor iran says that its heavywater reactor which is being constructed at arak is intended for the production of medical isotopes according to may 5 2008 presentation by ambassador ali asghar soltanieh irans permanent representative to the international atomic energy agency it is to substitute for an outdated heufueled research reactor in tehran that has been in operation since 196754 however the reactor is proliferation concern because its spent fuel will contain plutonium better suited for nuclear weapons than the plutonium produced by lightwater moderated reactors such as the bushehr reactor in addition iran will be able to operate the reactor with natural uranium which means that it will not be dependent on supplies of enriched uranium 51 for more

moderated by light water the original german contractor which began constructing the reactor in 1975 abandoned the project following irans 1979 revolution russia agreed in 1995 to complete the reactor but the project has since encountered repeated delays in february 2005 moscow and tehran concluded an agreement stating that russia would supply fuel for the reactor for 10 years at the time the director of the russian federal agency for atomic energy said the reactor would begin operating in late 2006 more recently spokespersons from irans atomic energy organization and atomstroyexport the russian contractor have said that the reactor would begin operating sometime in 200956 russia has blamed financial and technical issues for delaying the projects completion however it had been widely believed that moscow may have been delaying fuel shipments in order to increase political pressure on iran to comply with the security council resolutions in any case atomstroyexport sent the first shipment of leu fuel to iran on december 16 2007 and the reactor received the last shipment near the end of january the fuel which is under iaea seal will contain more than 362 uranium235 according to an atomstroyexport spokesperson57 the united states had previously urged moscow to end work on the project citing concerns that it could aid an iranian nuclear weapons program by providing the country with access to nuclear technology and expertise58 however us officials said in 2002 that washington would drop these public objections if russia took steps to mitigate the projects proliferation risks

september 9 2008 iran nuclear spokesman interviewed on situation etemad november 9 2008 57 atomstroyexport completes latest shipment of fuel to bushehr nuclear plant interfax december 28 2007 58 for example then deputy assistant secretary of defense marshall billingslea testified before the senate july 29 2002 that the united states was concerned that the bushehr nuclear power project is in reality pretext for the creation of an infrastructure designed to help tehran acquire atomic weapons thenundersecretary of state for international security and arms control john bolton told the house international relations committee in june 2003 that iran could build over 80 nuclear weapons if it had access to sufficient fuel operated the reactor for five to six years and chose to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt this estimate assumes that iran possesses reprocessing facility crs14 spent nuclear fuel to russia59 this measure is designed to ensure that iran will not separate plutonium from the spent fuel moscow also argues that the reactor will not pose proliferation risk because it will operate under iaea safeguards it is worth noting that lightwater reactors are generally regarded as more proliferationresistant than other types of reactors although the security council resolutions restrict the supply of nuclear related goods to iran they do permit the export of nuclear equipment related to light water reactors does iran have nuclear weapons program in addition to the possible nuclearweapons related activities discussed above iran has continued to develop ballistic missiles which could potentially be used to deliver nuclear weapons but tehrans nuclear program has raised concerns for various other reasons first iran has been secretive about its nuclear programs for example tehran hindered the iaea investigation by failing to disclose numerous nuclear activities destroying evidence and making false statements to the agency60 moreover although irans cooperation with the agency has improved the iaea has repeatedly criticized tehran for failing to provide the agency with timely access to documents and personnel second many observers have questioned irans need for nuclear power given the countrys extensive oil and gas reserves the fact that tehran resumed its nuclear program during the iraniraq war has also cast doubt on the energy rationale furthermore many countries with nuclear power reactors purchase nuclear fuel from foreign suppliers fact that calls into question irans need for an indigenous enrichment capability especially since russia has agreed to provide fuel for the bushehr reactor moreover although tehran plans to develop large nuclear power program the country lacks sufficient uranium deposits fact acknowledged by iranian officials61 irans stated rationale for its arak reactor has also been met with some skepticism tehran says it needs the reactor to produce medical isotopes but the tehran research reactor is capable of producing such isotopes and has unused 59 estimates for the length of time the spent fuel will have to stay in iran to cool range from two to five years see paul kerr iran russia reach nuclear agreement arms control today april 2005 60 for example iran sanitized facility where iranian scientists had enriched uranium falsely told the iaea that it had not enriched uranium and falsely claimed that it had not procured any foreign components for one of its centrifuge programs 61 iranian students news agency april 17 2007 thomas w wood matthew d milazzo barbara reichmuth and jeffrey bedell the economics of energy independence for iran nonproliferation review vol 14 1 march 2007 crs15 capacity in addition nonproliferation experts have argued that the reactor is unnecessary for producing such isotopes62 however iran maintains that its enrichment program has always been exclusively for peaceful purposes tehran argues that it cannot depend on foreign suppliers for reactor fuel because such suppliers have been unreliable in the past63 iran also says that it has been forced to conceal its nuclear procurement efforts in order to counter western efforts to deny it nuclear technology claim that appears to be supported by 1997 cia report64 furthermore as noted above iran has stated that it needs the arak reactor to replace the tehran research reactor although few experts argue that there is evidence that iran has pursued nuclear weapons program some have documented tehrans projected difficulty in exporting oil and natural gas without additional foreign investment in its energy infrastructure65 and at least one expert has described irans inability to obtain nuclear fuel from an international enrichment consortium called eurodif during the1970s iran had reached an agreement with eurodif that entitled iran to enriched uranium from the consortium in exchange for loan66 the 2007 national intelligence estimate according to the 2007 nie iranian military entities were working under government direction to develop nuclear weapons until fall 2003 but then halted its nuclear weapons program primarily in response to international pressure the nie defines nuclear weapons program as irans nuclear weapon design and weaponization work and covert uranium conversionrelated and uranium enrichment related work67 62 robert j einhorn

control today june 2006 64 the report says that iran had responded to western counterproliferation efforts by relying more on legitimate commercial firms as procurement fronts and by developing more convoluted procurement networks 65 see for example roger stern the iranian petroleum crisis and united states national security proceedings of the national academy of sciences of america january 2007 and george perkovich and silvia manzanero plan b using sanctions to end irans nuclear program arms control today may 2004 66 oliver meier iran and foreign enrichment troubled model arms control today januaryfebruary 2006 67 the nie does not incorporate intelligence reporting after october 31 2007 time frame that includes elbaradeis last three reports to the iaea board of governors some documents described in his may 2008 report contain 2004 dates but whether that fact would change the nies conclusion regarding the date when iran ended its nuclear weapons program is unclear crs16 the estimate however added that the intelligence community also assesses with moderatetohigh confidence that tehran at minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons68 the estimate adds that because of intelligence gaps the department of energy and the national intelligence council assess with only moderate confidence that the halt to those activities represents halt to irans entire nuclear weapons program the nie also stated that tehrans decision to halt its nuclear weapons program suggests it is less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 200569 the change in assessments senior intelligence official said december 3 2007 was the result of new information which caused us to challenge our assessments in their own right and illuminated previous information for us to be able to see it perhaps differently than we saw before or to make sense of other data points that didnt seem to selfconnect previously according to press accounts this information included various written and oral communications among iranian officials which indicated that the program had been halted70 the united states may also have obtained information from iranian officials who defected as part of cia program to induce them to do71 the nie also incorporated opensource information such as photographs of the natanz facility that became available after iran allowed members of the press to tour the facility according to the 2007 nie the intelligence community continues to assess with moderatetohigh confidence that iran does not have nuclear weapon although the community assesses with low confidence that iran probably has 68 prior to the nie some nongovernmental experts had argued that iran had stopped its nuclear weapons program see for example paul kerr divided from within bulletin of the atomic scientists novemberdecember 2006 jeffrey lewis iran roundup negotiations and wonkporn july 27 2005 available at

httpwwwcarnegieendowmentorgfilespo16perkovichfinal2pdf 69 although the 2005 nie stated that iran currently is determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure that assessment was somewhat qualified titled irans nuclear program at crossroads the estimate stated that iran was not immovableon the question of pursuing nuclear weapons program and also addressed the possibility that tehran may not have had such program moreover the word determined was used in lieu of pursuing nuclear weapon because the authors believed the latter to be stronger term 70 dafna linzer and joby warrick us finds that iran halted nuclear arms bid in 2003 washington post december 4 2007 greg miller irans nuclear ambitions on hold us agencies conclude angeles times december 4 2007 david sanger and steven lee myers details in military notes led to shift on iran us says new york times december 6 2007 peter baker and dafna linzer diving deep unearthing surprise how search for irans nuclear arms program turned up an unexpected conclusion washington post december 8 2007 71 greg miller cia has recruited iranians to defect the secret effort aims to undermine tehrans nuclear program angeles times december 9 2007 crs17 imported at least some weaponsusable fissile material it still judges with moderatetohigh confidence that tehran still lacks sufficient fissile material for nuclear weapon in addition to the new intelligence other factors suggest that iran may not have an active nuclear weapons program first the iaea has resolved several of the outstanding issues described in the august 2007 iraniaea work plan and has apparently not found additional evidence of nuclear weapons program indeed the agency has not discovered significant undeclared iranian nuclear activities for several years although as noted above the iaeas ability to monitor irans nuclear facilities has decreased furthermore tehran beginning in 2003 has been willing to disclose previously undeclared nuclear activities to the iaea though as previously discussed iran has not been fully cooperating with the agency in addition iran made significant changes to the administration of its nuclear program in fall 2003 changes that produced greater openness with the iaea and may have indicated decision to stop nuclear weapons program72 finally as noted above iranian officials have stated numerous times that tehran is not seeking nuclear weapons partly for religious regions change in this stance could arguably damage religious leaders credibility living with risk other findings of the nie indicate that the international community may for the foreseeable future have to accept some risk that iran will develop nuclear weapons according to the 2007 nie only an iranian political decision to abandon nuclear weapons objective would plausibly keep iran from eventually producing nuclear weapons and such decision is inherently reversible the estimate also asserted that iran has the scientific technical and industrial capacity eventually to produce nuclear weapons if it decides to do so adding that since fall 2003 iran has been conducting research and development projects with commercial and conventional military applications some of which would also be of limited use for nuclear weapons this is not to say that an iranian nuclear weapons capability is inevitable as noted above iran does not yet have such capability but tehran would have to accept some constraints on its nuclear program in order to provide the international community with confidence that iran is not pursuing nuclear weapon other constraints on nuclear weapons ambitions although the production of fissile material is widely considered to be the most difficult step in nuclear weapons development iran would even with the ability to produce heu still face challenges in producing nuclear weapons such as developing workable physics package and effective delivery vehicles73 72 this argument is explained in more detail in kerr bulletin of the atomic scientists 2006 for an indepth discussion of irans nuclear decisionmaking process see abbas william samii the iranian nuclear issue and informal networks naval war college review winter 2006 73 for more detailed discussion see office of technology assessment technologies continued crs18 although developing and producing heubased nuclear weapons covertly would probably be tehrans preferred option such path would present additional challenges 2005 report from the international institute for strategic studies concluded that an iranian planner would have little basis for confidence that significant nuclear facilities could be kept hidden74 tehran would need to hide number of activities including uranium conversion the movement of uranium from mines and the movement of centrifuge feedstock75 alternatively tehran could import uranium ore or centrifuge feedstock but would also need to do so covertly furthermore iran could produce only fairly simple nuclear weapons which are not deliverable by longerrange missiles without conducting explosive nuclear tests however many analysts argue that such tests would likely be detected76 73 continued underlying weapons of mass destruction otabpisc115 december 1993 74 international institute for strategic studies p 57 75 the 2005 iiss report also explains that concealing plutoniumbased nuclear weapons program would be even more difficult pp 6263 76 for detailed discussion of this issue see steven hildreth statement before
