term now being applied to describe the practice among us companies of contracting out the jobs of whit ecollar workers in service sector industries to firms located beyond our borders the outsourcing of service sector jobs to specialized firms within the united states began in response to the early 1980s recessions when employers increased their focus on the companys core mission and contracted out peripheral activities to other us businesses the 2001 recession prompted employers to achieve further efficiencies by tapping into the global supply of labor they utilized now widely disseminated technologies that permit low cost good quality and high speed transmission of voice and data communications to outsource service sector jobs abroad events also transpired in the intervening years that enhanced the ability of other countries eg india and china to export goods and services to the united states us whitecollar and bluecollar workers are anxious about job security because of the ongoing increase in global economic integration offshore outsourcing which is one form of globalization recently has adversely affected particular whitecollar jobs information technology it occupations eg computer systems analysts and software engineers and itenabled occupations eg telemarketers and accounting clerks factory workers continue to experience job anxiety as their ranks further dwindle at the same time that the us population overall reaps benefits from international trade eg lower priced goods for consumers some observers believe that the united states has seen just the tip of the offshoring iceberg by one estimate about onefourth of all us jobs possess characteristics that will make them susceptible to outsourcing to globally dispersed talent within 10 to 20year time frame other observers expect that firms will lose enthusiasm for offshore outsourcing due to various reasons eg lessthananticipated cost savings customer dissatisfaction and consequently will use the business practice more strategically regularly collected series provides data on the total number of workers who actually have thus far st jobs to offshoring see crs report rl30799 unemployment through layoffs and offshore outsourcing for the number of workers let go permanently in mass layoffs as result of the movement of work to other countries congress has longstanding interest in assisting workers who lose jobs through fault of their own in addition to unemployment benefits laws currently exist to help displaced workers undertake education and training eg the workforce investment act wia the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn requires covered employers to give employees among others advance notice of plant closing or mass layoff trade adjustment assistance taa focuses specifically on workers who lose jobs due to international trade taa generally does not apply to layoffs in service sector industries alternative trade adjustment assistance taa provides wage insurance to older workers displaced by trade who accept new jobs paying less than the jobs they lost

also known as offshore outsourcing is the term now being used to describe the nascent practice among companies located in the united states of contracting out the performance of service sector activities eg call center operations to businesses located beyond us borders the term is equally applicable to us firms outsourcing goods production eg textiles to other countries which has been occurring for decades it commonly is assumed that the work sent overseas was being or could have been performed by us workers thereby resulting in an actual loss of jobs or forgone employment opportunities as is often the case with an emerging trend little concrete information is available about the offshoring of us jobs instead anecdotal accounts were initially conveyed by the media these have been followed by projections of the share of us jobs possessing characteristics that make them appear vulnerable to outsourcing regularly collected series currently provides data on the total number of us workers who actually have lost their jobs due to overseas outsourcing 1 the one government survey that in 2004 began to ask firms about the movement of work to other nations is limited to companies that have conducted permanent largescale layoffs of workers moreover there is some uncertainty about what should be considered offshoring2 many observers appear to define it as the contracting out of work to nonus companies located abroad and to the foreign subsidiaries of us corporations others take broader perspective and include the purchase of services from us outsourcing firms and from foreignowned outsourcers with us offices that can utilize workers living abroad living in the united states eg us citizens and legal permanent residents as well as persons with h1b professional specialty visas or combination of the two uncertainty also surrounds the short and longrun labor market implications of offshore outsourcing for example some observers initiall blamed this business practice for much of the jobless recovery from the 2001 recession while others countered that the historical link between economic growth and job creation remained intact unlike many past cycles permanent rather than temporary layoffs dominated the 2001 recession and early recovery this might have been related to firms seeing the recession as an opportunity to cut payroll costs and improve efficiency through operational changes such as outsourcing jobs to other us industries and to other countries some economists estimated that largerthanusual share of laidoff workers were not rehired by their former employers as result of this perceived structural change which caused many displaced workers to undertake the timeconsuming task of finding new jobs at other companies or in other industries 3 other economists estimated that the 2001 recession had about the same effect on all major industry groups and that the pace of job growth would accelerate as it eventually had following all past recessions4a contention that has proved true 1 for more information see crs report rl30799 unemployment through layoffs and offshore outsourcing by linda levine hereafter cited as

early in the current decade that might have been due to offshoring range from 3 to 105 while acknowledging that offshoring and other forms of globalization eg direct investment and other capital flows can cause painful dislocations for workers in the shortrun most economists agree that it benefits the nation as whole by enabling us companies that import goods and services to sell their products to consumers at lower prices providing consumers with more choices and by expanding markets for us firms 6 others dispute the degree to which us consumers actually benefit suggesting that the shareholders of companies engaged in offshoring instead gain through increased dividends these individuals also believe that outsourcing jobs overseas has different implications for the united states than outsourcing to other industries within our borders that are regulated by us laws eg minimum wage and other labor standards 7 still others note that the current overseas movement of work is not defined by skill level the jobs of both bookkeeping clerks and radiologists are amenable to offshoring for example they further wonder whether offshoring will result in college graduates facing dwindling supply of entrylevel jobs that traditionally have served as stepping stones to highskilled positions and question the adequacy of the governments safety net to meet the needs of already welleducated wellpaid workers who lose their jobs to offshore outsourcing eg financial analysts and income tax preparers 8 this report does not attempt to sort through all these issues some of which are addressed in other crs reports9 instead it begins by examining the antecedents of offshoring service sector activities and then synthesizing the voluminous writings in recent years about the business practice the reemployment and earnings experi ences of displaced workers are next analyzed focusing specifically on evidence of rise in job insecurity among whitecollar workers in the service sector the report closes with discussion of existing federal legislation and proposals meant to ameliorate the impact of offshore outsourcing on us workers 5 the 10 figure appears in jyoti thottam is

g17g158g157g156g152g158g155g140g146g151g144g561 the overseas relocation of manufacturing work predates by decades the current wave of offshoring service sector jobs major us companies initially responding to heightened competition from japanese and european multinational corporations opened facilities abroad during the 1970s and 1980s that turned out goods formerly produced by comparatively well paid often unionized us factory workers eg assemblyline workers in the automotive industry additionally us companies reacted to the backtoback recessions of the early 1980s by focusing on their core missions and contracting out activities that specialized domestic enterprises could perform more efficiently eg janitorial services firms restructured their operations by outsourcing jobs to temporary help supply agencies professional and business services establishments eg accounting firms and independent contractors us demand for employment including temporary help services continued to increase during the 1990s it is projected to be one of the industries experiencing the most job growth in the coming years 10 thus indicating that domestic outsourcing of formerly inhouse functions is permanent reorganization of how work is performed the latest recession which ended in november 2001 prompted employers to achieve further efficiencies by taking advantage of technological in novations that minimize the importance of physical distance between companies the now wide spread dissemination of technologies that enable relatively low cost good quality and high speed transmission of voice and data communications has enabled us firms to extend offshoring beyond the factory jobs of bluecollar workers to the services jobs of whitecollar workers eg computer programmers and call center operators service sector jobs at risk of being offshored thus are both those held by information technology it workers and technologyenabled workers events that transpired during the intervening decade of the 1990s enhanced the ability of other countries to export servicesparticularly it servicesto the united states and other developed countries eg the united kingdom one such event was the y2k crisis us firms in response to tight supply of computer programmers in the late 1990s turned to companies principally located in india to make the code fixes needed to avert problems with computer systems by the time 2000 arrived the domestic firms that utilized these programmers reportedly were pleased with the quality of their work 11 another event was the educational systems of foreign nations graduating an abundant supply of well educated sometimes english speaking individuals in some cases the number of persons with it and accounting skills exceeded the immediate needs of their local economies eg china eastern europe india and the philippines 12 and because 10 eric b figueroa and rose woods industry output and employment projections to 2016 monthly labor review november 2007

country it services can be provided by wide array of nonenglish speaking comparatively low wage nations eg argentina brazil bulgaria china the czech republic hungary jordan lithuania mexico slovenia russia and ukraine these developments are reflected in the latest employment projections of the us bureau of labor statistics although the professional and busi ness services industry eg computer systems design and related services is still expected to remain among the fastest growing in the economy the bureau projects that the rate of job growth could slow from 27 annually between 1996 and 2006 to 21 annually between 2006 and 2016 mainly due to productivity gains and offshore outsourcing13

and unemployed workers the seemingly greater publicity generated by the extension of offshoring from manufacturing to service sector industries is the case for the following reasons 1 whitecollar workers comprise the majority of all us workers and most whitecollar workers are employed in the service sector which accounts for the vast majority of total us employment in other words many more people today believe their jobs are at risk of being exported 2 domestic outsourcing and offshore outsourcing result in job losses for those employees who longer are required to produce the goods and services that their employers decided to purchase some displaced workers must seek jobs in other fields because the domestic firms that specialize in providing outsourced functions do so more efficiently than their former employers others who lose their jobs to domestic outsourcing can continue to perform similar work perhaps for lower wages and fewer benefitsby finding jobs in the industries now supplying goods and services to their exemployers eg as workers on the payrolls of temporary help agencies rather than manufacturers 14 thus key difference between domestic and offshore outsourcing is that none of the jobs that are cont racted out remain available to us workers when employers send the work to companies located overseas15 the loss of service sector jobs to offshoring has led people to ask what field is going to be the next generator of jobs for us workers and mo re particularly of good jobs the question is not easily answered candidates that have been put forth eg nanotechnology and biotechnology 13 figueroa and woods industry output and employment projections p 56 14 for information on the statistical exaggeration of the employment decline in manufacturing because workers still are engaged in goods production despite being categorized in the employment services industry see council of economic advisors economic report of the president washington dc gpo

to be moving abroad further life sciences jobs have themselves begun to be sent overseas16 although us workers have been encouraged to focus on upgrading their skills to be capable of performing the highlevel high paying jobs that are expected to be created by further us technological innovation17 an oft posed question in response to this advice is in what occupations the acquisition of it skills had been the mantra for several years however these are among the jobs that appear newly at risk of being exported because key difference between jobs susceptible to offshoring is the degree to which they involve impersonal services eg accountants or personal services eg hairstylists which does not correspond to the traditional distinction between highskilled and lowskilled work simply providing more education cannot be the whole answer 18 g10g152g160g561g15g138g151g162g561g12g152g139g156g561g3g155g142g561g25g142g561g22g138g149g148g146g151g144g561g3g139g152g158g157g501g561 people also have

engineers medical transcriptionists and paralegals and technical writers they are concentrated in such industries as information finance and insurance and professional and business services study released by the brookings institution built upon the work of bardhan and kroll forrester research and others to develop projections of the percent of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas that might be lost due to service offshoring over the 20042015 period offshoring is not expected to greatly affect employment in most metropolitan areas with just 22 of the jobs in these 246 areas likely to be offshored between 2004 and 201526 but the analysis suggests that five metro areas might lose 31 to 43 of their jobs by 2015 boulder co lowell ma san francisco ca san jose ca and stamford ct another 23 areas might have between 26 and 30 of their jobs offshored those metropolitan areas estimated to be most vulnerable to service offshoring tend to be very populous having 1 million or more inhabitants eg

concentrations of it jobs eg boulder co huntsville and lowell ma or itenabled backoffice jobs such as dataentry keyers and telemarketers eg des moines ia omaha ne and wilmington jensen and kletzer developed different geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable offshorable and nontradable nonoffshorable jobs in manufacturing and nonmanufacturing eg agriculture mining construction services industries about 94 of total us employment in 2000 was found to be in tradable industries according to one of their estimates more specifically 137 of employment in professional services industries may be vulnerable to offshoring compared to 124 of employment in manufacturing industries examining the data by occupation jensen and kletzer estimated that at least 60 of workers in the following jobs may be susceptible to offshoring computer and mathematical legal life physical and social sciences business and financial operations and architecture and engineering outside of education and healthcare occupations the typical whitecollar occupation involves potentially tradable activity 27 this suggests thatto the extent nontradable industries can pare off the duties of

estimate of jobs vulnerable to offshoring 256 of total employment although blinder labels categories i ii and all of iii as too aggressive estimate of jobs susceptible to offshoring in the near term 290 of total 2004 employment he suggests that further technological and other advancements might make the estimate more reasonable over 10 to 20year period blinder goes on to say that contrary to conventional wisdom the more offshorable occupations are not lowend jobs wh ether measured by wages or by education 28 some estimates of the impact of offshore outsourcing on us employment have focused on it jobs in particular gartner inc announced in d2003 that it expected 10 of it jobs at it companies in the united states and 5 of it jobs at other us companies to be sent overseas by the end of 2004 it further speculated that by 2005 employers would have rehired less than 40 of the workers whose jobs they had offshored 29 gartner subsequently reported that less than 5 of it jobs in the united states and in other developed countries already have been sent overseas but it believes the proportion could climb to 30 by 2015 while not disputing the 30 claim some other organizations think it will take longer to reach the figure 20 to 25 years rather than 10 years 30 28 alan s blinder how many us jobs might be offshorable ceps working paper 142 march 2007 p 35 hereafter cited as

jobs in the united states relatedly in study sponsored by the inform ation technology association of america itaa global insight estimated that actual and potential software and it services jobs lost as result of offshoring between 2000 and 2003 numbered fewer than 112000 it further projected net gain in aggregate us employment in the coming years associated with sending more it work overseas31 indeed some us companies reportedly have offshored aggressively and become more efficient competitors thereby enabling them to expand rather than shrink their domestic workforces32 there are those who think that offshoring may allow the notion which has been around since the 1980s of virtual corporationwith all but firms crucial activities performed by outside contractorsto become reality they believe that the rise of the offshore option is dramatically changing the economics of corporate reengineering with millions of lowcost engineers financial analysts consumer marketers and architects now readily available via the web ceos can see quicker payoff then the efficiency gains kick in 10 billion company might initially only shave few million dollars in wages after transferring backoffice procurement or bill collection overseas but better management of these processes could free up hundreds of millions in cash flow annually those savings in turn help underwrite far broader corporate restructuring that can be truly transformational 33 g17g159g142g155g139g149g152g160g151g561g8g142g138g155g156g501g561 one explanation for why perhaps only onetenth of the potential market for offshoring global it and business processes work has been realized thus far is that executives have lot to learn about using offshore talent to boost productivity the management challenge will grow more urgent as rising global salaries dissipate the easy cost gains from offshore outsourcing34 some therefore remain cautious about how rapidly offshoring will lead to the creation of globally distributed corporations they suggest that what might occur is overzealous pursuit of offshoring followed by retrenchment during which time us employers will learn the types of jobs best suited to the practice and how to manage globally dispersed workforce 35 deloitte consulting concluded that outsourcing will lose holy grail status in the future companies will not outsource because it is the latest management fad and it is the thing to do organizations will carefully define core strategic and thoughtleadership functions and will keep those inhouse to retain knowledge confidentiality and control over key functions some organizations will decide to outsource only shortterm many organizations will also engage in large scale reinsourcing thereby further eroding the outsourcing market 36

inquiry help services and call center work to the united states due to customer dissatisfaction37 other us firms have had to employ it service providers located in the united states to fix software produced abroad even when imported services are not flawed some employers have overestimated the cost savings from outsourcing because services purchase price is affected by more than intercountry wage differentials eg travel and managerial oversight costs38 meta group noted that firms often calculate labor cost savings by making persontoperson comparison eg fulltime equivalent in india will cost 40 less and ignoring hidden costs and differences in operating models that bring down savings to 1520 in the first year of offshoring39 perhaps reflecting these shortcomings of offshoring the share of it employers that prematurely terminated contracts with overseas it service providers reportedly rose from 21 in 2004 to 51 in 200540 at least two factors that could have put the brakes on the offshoring have failed to do so however offshore providers of it services for example were able to allay us outsourcers fears about security shortly after the terrorist attacks of september 11 200141 despite 911 us airline carriers have continued their increased outsourcing of maintenance jobs overseasto places like singapore brazil the dominican republicnot only for international aircraft but even for planes on purely domestic routes42 in addition concern periodically has arisen among us outsourcers over unrest in some regions eg disputes between india and pakistan as well as in the middle east global providers of software services have responded by placing more of their clients work in variety of countries including the nearshore markets of canada and mexico43 some individual us employers also beli eve that moving work to nearby canada which has fewer cultural differences with the united states than india or the philippines for example likely reduces its customers potential antipathy to offshoring44 in summary most studies find the extent of job losses from services offshoring relatively small in the aggregate but somewhat concentr ated in few industries and occupations the job losses stem from both direct impact of of fshoring which displaces some workers plus an indirect impact through the productivity hancements that it provides however there are still unanswered empirical questions including the justmentioned productivity effect indeed offshoring could raise productivity directly or indirectly by displacing lowwage lowskilled jobs and creating highwage ones but it could also do just the opposite ie result in displacement of wellpaid highskilled workers 45 37 khozem merchant tough call for the us costcutters financial times december 22 2003 38 olga kharif

initial years of the 1990s when the labor market was slowly recovering from the 19901991 recession and stories of worker anxiety over job insecurity abounded in the media month hardly went by without at least one major us company announcing layoff that involved thousands of employees46 the leading explanation for the heightened feeling of worker anxiety in that period was corporate downsizing ie net decrease in firms employment that often involved internal company restructuring through flattening the organizational pyramid ie eliminating layers of middle management jobs

population survey supports the impression that the nature of permanent job loss has changed generally speaking long tenured whitecollar workers in some service sector industries have become more susceptible to displacement but bluecollar workers continue to be at the greatest risk of layoff47 see the box below for description of the displaced worker population g343g351g350g342g156g561 the risk of job loss among manufacturing industry workers improved from 19811982 to 19911992 two comparable periods as the economy recovered from the severe 19811982 recession the chance of losing manufacturing job decreased during the milder 19901991 recession the displacement rate 48 among manufacturing workers rose to 71 but did not reach its 19811982 level of 82 see top panel of table 3 in contrast the job security of most other workers worsened or stayed about the same the incidence of permanent layoffs in finance insurance and real estate quadrupled to 55 while the displacement rate also climbed but less steeply in wholesaleretail trade construction and in services none of the service sector industries was close to manufacturings risk of job loss the shift in the industrial pattern of displacement translated into change in its occupational distribution in light of the predominance of bluecollar workers at manufacturers and whitecollar 46 for more information see crs report rl30799 unemployment through layoffs and offshore outsourcing unemployment through layoffs what are the reasons 47 little attention typically is paid to the displacement of workers in service occupations who include cooks and servers cleaners and maintenance workers hairdressers and child care workers and police and firefighters workers in service occupations are less likely than bluecollar and whitecollar workers to be affected by offshoring because many of their jobs require facetoface interaction with customers 48 the displacement rate is the number of displaced workers in particular group divided by the tenureadjusted two year average estimate of employment for that same group the us bureau of labor statistics bls defines displaced workers as person s at ast 20 years old who had worked for their mployers at least three yea rs before losing their jobs because of plant or compa ny closings and moves insufficient w ork for them to do or abolishment of their positions

improved virtually acrosstheboard during the long economic expansion of the 1990s even when examined against fairly comparable period 10 years earlier the probability of job loss was lower in 19992000 see table 4 however for the first time since the dws data were collected the risk of permanent layoffs among employees of the services industry group eg telecommunications firms and providers of computer services to other businesses rose to the point that it equaled the average displacement rate 50 the limited supply of workers available to us employers in the late 1990s was responsible for the reduced likelihood of being laid offwith the possible exception of professionals51 it has been suggested that any offshoring of services that occurred during this time can be seen as spinoffs from the us because of tight labor markets rather than job transfers out of the us in search of lower labor costs52 the services offshoring that continued to occur during the 2001 recession and sluggish

and salary jobs earned at least as much as they had in their predisplacement jobs although traderelated job loss among it and itenabled professionals is such new phenomenon that its consequences have not been much researched some surmise from earlier studies of worker displacement that offshoring may prove to be less costly in terms of unemployment and permanent wage loss as earlier waves of bluecollar traderelated job displacement were 55 their speculation is based upon the studies findings that more educated workers usually have an easier time finding new jobs and generally incur smaller wage declines others argue however that offshoring will exert downward pressure on the wages of higher skilled workers additionally studies typically estimate that trade has had fairly small effect on the us wage structure eg by depressing the relative wages of low skilled workers but if trade in services that involve more highly skilled jobs continues to grow trade will affect larger share of the workforce so the effect on the wage structure could become larger over time 56 those fulltime employees displaced from management and related occupations as well as from production jobs continued to experience poor wage outcomes compared to professional and related workers as shown in table 7 50 of managers and 38 of these bluecollar workers were able to obtain postdisplacement jobs that paid at least as well as their predisplacement positions compared to 59 of professionals differences in the degree of earnings loss by occupation may have to do with the nature of the skillsgeneral or specificthat members of occupational groups typically possess an analysis of whitecollar displacement found evidence to suggest that managers experience larger earnings losses than otherwise equivalent white collar workers 57 which accords with the idea that fairly large portion of the skills that managers and bluecollar workers possess are job or industryspecific because skills of this nature are not readily transferable from one job to the next managers and bluecollar workers appear less able than others to command wages on their new jobs that are comparable to their past earnings levels 58 an aboveaverage share of displaced bluecollar workers find new jobs in service occupations eg janitorial and maintenance positions as well as food preparation and serving jobsusually the lowest paying of all occupational groups59 this might partly explain 54 displaced professional workers most likely to return to the same occupation monthly labor review october 1999 55

mitigate the adverse impact of involuntary worker displacement they proposed that for those longtime fulltime employees who become unemployed through fault of their own and who subsequently accept fulltime jobs paying less than their predisplacement wages government provide subsidy through the federalstate unemployment insurance system equal to portion of the wage loss for up to two years following reemployment 66 such program they contended would reduce worker anxiety over trade liberalization among other factors that can result in job loss eg technological innovation and would help

component of the taa program is performing however on the basis of results of an evaluation of the canadian earnings supplement project which was conducted between 1995 and 1998 the benefits of wage insurance program may be modest69 the twoyear supplement replaced 75 of the earnings lost by displaced workers up to 250 per week who were reemployed within 26week period in lowerpaying fulltime 30 hours week jobs displaced workers were randomly assigned to group that was offered the supplement and to group that was not the control group only 20 of supplement group members received payments this low takeup rate is attributed to the inability of eligible workers to quickly find new fulltime jobs the program was estimated to produce small but statistically significant difference in the fulltime reemployment rate of supplement compared to control group memberswith the difference occurring toward the end of the period when workers were eligible for the supplement at its widest the difference in full time reemployment rates was 44 percentage points the gap gradually narrowed and by one year after assignment of displaced workers to the supplement or control group their fulltime reemployment rates essentially were the same the supplement did contribute greatly to the incomes of those fairly few individuals who rece ived it however with payments averaging some 8700 over oneandaquarteryear period in contrast to governmentsponsored initiatives the mckinsey global institute put forth wage insurance proposal that lies entirely in the private sector it recommended that as part of severance package businesses purchase insurance for displaced workers to cover their lost wages during the median period of unemployment for their occupational group and provide them with portion of any wage loss incurred upon reemployment in fulltime jobs 70 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 linda levine specialist in labor economics
