production sharing and trade j f hornbeck specialist in international trade and finance economics division summary debate continues over the benefits of us trade with mexico the north american free trade agreement nafta and particularly maquiladoras or crossborder production sharing plants maquiladoras generate large portion of usmexico trade yet the economic effects are not widely understood many believe there is benefit to such trade because it leads to the loss of us jobs production and wages maquiladora products however have high us content that in addition to fostering productivity gains in both countries may actually minimize the loss of us jobs by allowing the higher paying jobs to stay at home rather than be shipped entirely abroad for example to asia still adjustment to globalized production creates challenges particularly in addressing the plight of lowskilled workers who become unemployed research however continues to point to domestic rather than trade policy for the likely solutions particularly the emphasis on education and training programs mexico is the united states third largest trading partner accounting for 9 of us world trade the significance of these figures however rests not so much on the trade itself but on the longterm economic integration that it reflects the maquiladora program emerged in the 1960s to encourage such integration theme that was further embraced and broadened three decades later with passage of the north american free trade agreement nafta critics contend that both arrangements hurt the us economy because they encourage businesses and jobs to migrate south of the border1 this report examines the economics of maquiladoras nafta and deepening integration between the united states and mexico particularly the effects and implications of production sharing2 1 for current example of this thinking see the economic policy institute et the failed experiment nafta at three years june 26 1997 pp 36 2 for broader discussion

research service the library of congress crs2 production sharing and usmexico trade when good is manufactured by firms in more than one country it is known as production sharing an arrangement that among other things leads to trade within industry groups governments can encourage production sharing by giving preferential customs treatment to the trade that it generates with respect to usmexico trade both countries have legislated such preferences in mexico shared production is governed under the maquiladora program spanish word in modern use denoting crossborder assembly it began in 1965 when mexico decreed that certain imports could enter duty free provided that once processed or assembled the end products would be exported the united states reciprocates under customs heading 9802 of the harmonized tariff schedule hts which allows goods manufactured or assembled in foreign plants using us parts to be imported with tariffs applied only on the value added abroad these provisions are used by firms in many countries particularly in the caribbean and southeast asia and cover various types of products such as automobiles apparel and semiconductors the total value of hts 9802 imports in 1996 was 675 billion or 9 of total us imports although the percentage of productionshared imports may be as high as 15 because many from canada and mexico come in under nafta provisions and so are not counted under the 9802 heading3 mexico is the major source of us productionshared trade accounting for 41 of total hts 9802 imports in 1996 and 62 of those imports from developing countries as seen in table 1 the amount of us hts 9802 exports rose from 218 of total exports to mexico in 1991 to 281 in 1996 over the same time period the amount of hts 9802 imports fell from 471 to 376 of total mexican imports this decrease however presents an inaccurate picture because as mentioned above there is way to track productionshared imports that enter the united states under nafta provisions other indicators suggest that productionshared imports are still growing despite decreasing ability to quantify them4 maquiladoras clearly have prospered under these incentives in 1975 they employed 67214 workers in 454 plants producing 1 billion worth of goods by 1996 there were 754858 employees in 2411 plants with total production of 35 billion investment is heavily dominated by us businesses but asian and european interest is growing of the total registered maquiladoras in 1995 43 were wholly owned by mexican interests 38 by us parties and 14 by mexicanus partnerships most of the mexicanowned

maquiladora industry sectors are transportation equipment textiles and apparel and electronics transportation equipment includes us imports of motor vehicles as well as related equipment components and parts such as internal combustion engines ignition wiring harnesses and other smaller parts bumpers brakes radiators etc transportation equipment is produced largely by subsidiaries of the us big three automobile manufacturers6 textiles and apparel is highly competitive industry group with mexico and many caribbean countries vying for us market share of imports assembled from us components nafta however has tilted the relationship away from caribbean countries toward mexico so that sewn apparel is now among the fastest growing maquiladora sectors mexican assembled electronic components by contrast compete with those made in malaysia korea and the phillippines this sector involves numerous goods from semiconductors to television parts mexico dominates the latter category southeast asia the first7 although mexico is not alone in production sharing with the united states importantly its productionshared imports have high percentage of us content data since 1991 show that us content represented slightly over half of the total value of maquiladora imports see table 1 in addition mexican hts imports constitute 61 of the dollar value of us content entering under the hts program from all over the world the second highest level is distant 57 of goods brought in from the dominican republic8 maquiladoras therefore because they rely heavily on us suppliers support the us economy more than production sharing arrangements with all other countries 6 for detailed discussion on the automobile trade see us library of congress congressional research service the automobile

the maquiladora relationship in two important ways first more bilateral trade is occurring under nafta because 1 nafta is formally phasing out the maquiladora program which will end on january 1 20019 and 2 nafta provisions are less cumbersome than dealing with the hts 9802 program elimination of the maquiladora program provides another benefit to us firms operating in mexico by allowing their products easier access to the local market second nafta is attracting nonus foreign investment to mexico mostly asian as way to access the us market foreign producers in mexico benefit from 1 naftas rules of origin which raise tariffs on traded goods that do not have certain percentage of nafta country content 2 the 1994 peso devaluation which further lowered the cost of labor in mexico and 3 mexicos proximity to the us as both supplier and final product market10 for these reasons it is critical to understand the economic incentives that drive production sharing as well as the tradeoffs involved the economics of productionshared trade the benefits of trade between two countries is perhaps best understood when it involves different goods the united states does not grow bananas and honduras does not make airplanes which leads to trade even when two countries can produce like goods they tend to trade for the final products that the other produces relatively more efficiently which is the concept of comparative advantage finally when production within industries and firms takes place in different countries the intraindustry trade reflects the economic integration taking place because countries are exporting and importing similar products questions arise over how to measure the benefits of this type of trade common but erroneous notion suggests that such trade amounts to net gain the united states is simply drawing even or losing by exporting and importing the same goods and in the process also exporting jobs to mexico apparently counterintuitive is the idea that such intraindustry trade is exactly the type of exchange to be expected from economic integration and was in fact the goal of policies put in place since the 1960s such as the maquiladora program in mexico or uscanada auto trade agreement firms engage in production sharing to reduce costs increase efficiency and remain competitive in the global economy and how they accomplish these goals determines the type of intraindustry trade that takes place firms can reduce costs by undertaking what economists refer to as rationalizing production where savings are first realized by using specialized plants that engage in one stage of the production process or in one particular product second specialization leads to economies of scale and additional cost savings third close geographic proximity minimizes transportation costs thereby encouraging border trade these types of cost reductions promote intraindustry trade with canada and mexico in sophisticated products such as automobiles and parts 9 north american free trade agreement between the government of the united states of america the government of canada and the government of mexico 1993 annex i mexico p im34 10 usitc op cit pp 24 and 25 crs5 much usmexico production sharing and trade however is explained by traditional trade theory that emphasizes relative factor costs capital and labor mexico has comparative advantage in lowwage labor which allows the two countries to specialize in different stages of production that have different input mixes generally lower wage economies such as mexico inherit certain industry segments assembly while more developed economies like the united states remain competitive producing in other segments specialized inputs or more sophisticated downstream production consistent with their relative abundance of capital technology and high skilled workers11 this is in keeping with economic development patterns nationally and worldwide for example this explains the migration of textile manufacturing in the united states from new england to the south that began in the 1920s internationally the same incentives now drive the movement of similar us lowwage jobs abroad in fact production sharing arrangements exist all over the world based on relative labor costs and are further nurtured by trade agreements and other government policies eg hts 9802 us firms have affiliate arrangements in southeast asia and the caribbean japan coproduces many goods in southeast asian countries and the european union shares production among its member countries12 additionally investment by asian firms in mexico has been growing to improve their position in the nafta market as with us firms asian investment in mexican production facilities may actually increase use of us inputs compared to similar investment made in asia production sharing tradeoffs and adjustment in the us economy although maquiladoras will fade away under nafta as separate and privileged sector of usmexico trade production sharing will not it will likely increase indicative of the trend toward globalized production that transcends the maquiladora program nafta and usmexico trade this trend points to world in which production arrangements create partnerships across national boundaries that previously were made within countries measuring imports and exports within industry groups may even give false sense of competition where complementary relationships exist economists believe this fosters increased productivity faster economic growth and ultimately higher standards of living despite the benefits for the world as whole it is also widely accepted that globalization presents challenges as well as opportunities13 because industry adjustments do not lead to gains that are distributed evenly either among countries or within them concerns over these challenges thrive in the united states where many argue that production and trade from maquiladoras have resulted in lost jobs and falling wages particularly in such industries as textiles indeed production shifts to mexico have shown up in the trade data with textile mill imports mostly knitted products rising 247 from 1993 to 1996 whereas textile mill exports to mexico mostly fabrics climbed by only 75 11 for textbook discussion see brown wilson b and jan s hogendorn international economics theory and context reading addisonwesley publishing co 1994 pp 6970 12 usitc op cit p 111 and weintraub sidney nafta at three progress report washington dc center for strategic and international studies 1997 pp 3439 13 international monetary fund world economic outlook may 1997 pp 4547 crs6 the trend for apparel and finished textile products is similar but less severe with imports from mexico rising 91 while us exports increased by 7314 the employment and wage effects implied by these trade data are not however straight forward many of the lowskilled jobs textile mill and some finished product positions have moved to mexico with us employment in this sector falling by 714 from 1993 to 1996 however the higherskilled technologyenhanced textile jobs mostly in fabrics and finished apparel have remained in the united states and interestingly the average wage has increased by 912 from 1993 to 1996 with productivity improving some 10 in short production sharing with mexico is credited with minimizing job losses that would have been more severe had the whole process relocated to asia which in turn has allowed for higher average wage for industry employment asian investment in mexico even further supports these us jobs15 the textile example demonstrates how economic restructuring based on production sharing can help businesses achieve productivity goals and also lead to retention of relatively higher paying jobs in the united states even in industries where global competition is fierce but critical policy issue remains how to respond to the lower skilled workers who have the most difficulty during the adjustment process16 some call for slowing economic integration including rethinking the us commitment to nafta and free trade in general to alleviate the adjustment problem others believe that those lowskilled workers facing employment problems will not find lasting relief based on any type of barriers to international economic relations studies have found that wage stagnation and job losses in this group are for the most part not the result of trade but as noted by the international monetary fund represent broader trend driven principally by advances in technology that favor skilled labor17 from this perspective the solution is to be found in domestic rather than trade policy the oftrepeated policy suggestions include supporting trade adjustment first on shortterm basis by helping marginalized members of society to weather economic transition the social safety net issue and second on more permanent basis by helping them learn to function in an increasingly competitive global economy the education and training issue this emphasis encourages response to rather than confrontation with global trends 14 usitc the impact of the north american free trade agreement on the us economy and
