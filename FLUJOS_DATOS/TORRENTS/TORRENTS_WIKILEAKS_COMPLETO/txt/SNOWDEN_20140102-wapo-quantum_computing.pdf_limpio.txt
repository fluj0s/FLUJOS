date u 21 september 2011 office of origin u the laboratory for physical sciencesr3 poc ufouo original classification authority u community integration policy and records ufouo this document establishes information security guidelines on nsacsssponsored research in the field of quantum computing qc the objectives defining the scope of this research activity are 1 srel to assess if it is to nsas benefit to continue research into whether practicalscale qc can be developed within reasonable timeframe to identify its most promising physical embodiments and to formulate credible scenario for its largescale development 2 ufouo to gain an understanding of the computational cryptanalytic capabilities of quantum computers and 3 ufouo to identify practical cryptographic methods that are not susceptible to quantum computational attack srel these guidelines do not cover the possibility of largescale cryptologic qc development programs at nsa but only the research and planning preliminary to and in possible support of such programs ssirel much of the research in quantum computing is still very basic and is most effectively pursued in nsafunded open research programs these programs play critical role as the major source of new ideas and for training future researchers in the field however nsa is pursuing more than just basic unclassified research nsa is also attempting to preserve the sigint potential of quantum computing ie the cryptanalytic applications of qc while simultaneously attempting to protect the information security of both the government and private sectors against hostile qc attacks ie the cryptographic mission assurance applications of qc of interest to the information assurance community these goals must be pursued at the classified level ufouo t here are several fundamental reasons for classifying qc research 1 tssirel to protect nsas efforts to develop cryptanalytic qc to attack high grade public key encryption systems by denying adversaries information concerning nsas assessment of andor plans for largescale qc development top secretsirel to usa aus can gbr nzl top secret sirel to usa aus can gbr nzl 2 srel to enable us to track our adversaries degree of success or failure in similar qc development efforts and 3 ufouo to protect our own systems against adversarial cryptanalytic qc efforts srel based on this the distinctions between unclassified and classified information contained in this guide attempt to differentiate between unclassified basiclevel academicscale research of scientific interest and more comprehensive classified research which might disclose techniques that may otherwise be possible to protect or which might imply rightly or wrongly serious intent on nsas part to pursue largescale
