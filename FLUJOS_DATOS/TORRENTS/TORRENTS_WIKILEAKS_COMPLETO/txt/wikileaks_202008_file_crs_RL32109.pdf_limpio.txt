surface fire support nsfs and littoral i nearshore operations the ddg1000 was intended in part to replace in technolog ically more modern form the largecaliber naval gun fire capability that the navy lost when it retired its iowaclass battleships in the early 1990s2 the ddg1000 was also intended to improve the navys general capabilities for operating in defended littora l waters to introduce several new technologies that would be available for use on future navy ships and to serve as the basis for the navys planned nextg eneration cruiser called the cgx3 the ddg1000 is to have reducedsize crew compared with the navys current destroyers and cruisers of 142 sa ilors so as reduce its operating and support costs the ship is to incorporat significant number of new technologies including wavepiercing tumblehome hull design for reduced detectability4 superstructure made partly of large sections of composite materials rather than steel or aluminum an integrated electricdrive propulsion system5 totalship computing system for moving information about th ship automation technologies for the reducedsized crew dualband radar ne w kind of vertical launch system vls for storing and firing missiles and two copies of 155mm gun called the advanced gun system ags the ags is to fire new rocketassisted 155mm shell called the long range land attack projectile lrlap to ranges of more than 60 nautical miles the ddg1000 can carry 600 lrlap rounds 300 for each gun and additional rounds can be brought aboard the ship while the guns are firing creating what navy officials call an infinite

make ddg1000 technol ogies available for use in future navy ships this is why the navy refers to the ddg1000 program as being truncated rather than canceled or terminated navys reasons for its change in position why did the navy change its position on destroyer procurement change in threat assessment the navy testified that it has changed its position on destroyer procurement primarily because of recent change in its assessment of likely future threats to navy forces this change in the threat assessment navy official s testified led to corresponding change in capability requirements for navy destroyers to be procured over the next few years the navy testified that over the last two years its assessment of threats posed by ballistic missiles anti ship cruise missiles asc ms and modern nonnuclear powered submarines operating in blue waters has increased the navys prepared statement and spoken testimony at the july 31 2008 hearing include multiple references to ballistic missiles ascms including the proliferation of ascms to nonstate actors such as the hezbollah organization26 and modern nonnuclear powered submarines capable of bluewater operations27 the navy also testified that it now believes it has more than enough capacity as result aircraftdelivered precisionguided munitions and tomahawk cr uise missiles to meet requirements for providing fire support for forces ashore navy officials testified that as result its changed threat assessment the navy now needs to use destroyer procurement ove r the next several years to improve the fleets capabilities for bmd areadefense aaw and bluewater antisubmarine warfare asw navy officials testifie d that while the ddg1000 is wellsuited for nsfs and for operations in littoral waters it is not capable of areadefense aaw28 or bmd operations and its sonar system is not optimized for bluewater aswoperations the ddg51 design they testif ied is capable of bmd and areadefense aaw operations and its sonar is optimized for bluewater asw operations consequently the navy testified the ddg51 is be tter suited than the ddg1000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs15 for meeting the navys changed capability requirements for destroyers to be procured over the next several years navy offi cials testified that modifying the ddg1000 design to make it capable of bmd areadefense aaw and bluewater asw operations is unaffordable from the navys standpoint affordability although the navy at one point in its spoken testimony stated that affordability was not factor behi nd its new position its proposal to build ddg51s rather than ddg1000s is intended to be roughly budgetneutral over the period fy2010fy2015 cost considerations ppear to have played some role in the navys thinking the navy testified that pr oduction costs of ddg 51s are known that the costs associated with ddg 51 class shipbuilding are well understood and that the proc urement cost of the ddg51 is quantifiable the navy did not make the same statements about the ddg1000 this suggests that the navy believes that the procurement cost of the ddg51 is known with better confidence than the procurement cost of the ddg1000 and that procuring ddg51s would consequently pose less risk of cost growth than procuring ddg51s the navys testimony also make s reference to having enough capacity to meet regional combatant commander demands for surface combatants for maintaining daytoday forward deployments and participating in engagement activities with other countries capacity is term usually used to refer to the quantity of something as opposed to capability which usually refers to the kinds of things that something can do the navys use of the term capacity suggests that the service has concluded that procuring ddg51s instead of ddg1000s will pe rmit the navy to procure larger number of destroyers over the next several years as mentioned above the navy testified that the option of modifying the ddg1000 design so as to give it capability for bmd and area defense aaw and to improve its capability for bluewater asw is unaffordable from the navys standpoint cgx developments although the navy did not say so at the july 31 hearing developments in the cgx progra m may be an additiona l factor behind the navys decision to change its position on destroyer procurement the navy originally wanted to use the ddg1000 hull sign as the basis for the cgx design because doing so would minimize cgx hullde sign costs and take advantage of the ddg1000 production learning curve to re duce recurring cgx production costs the potential for reusing the ddg1000 hull in the cgx program was one of the navys arguments in previous years fo r moving ahead with ddg1000 procurement it is not clear however that the navy still considers the ddg1000 hull as the best hull design for the cgx july 2 2008 letter from john young the dod acquisition executive the under secretary of defense for acquisitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs16 29

congress by ronald orourketechnology and logistics to re presentative gene taylor the chairman of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee stated i agree that the navys preliminary design analysis for the nextgeneration cruiser indicates that for the most capable radar ites under consideration for the cgx the ddg1000 hull design cannot support the radar29 the cgx may be nuclearpowered ship and it is not clear that the ddg1000 can accommodate onehal f of the twinreactor plant that the navy has designed for its new gerald r ford cvn78 class nuclearpowered aircraft carriers30 if the ddg1000 hull cannot accommodate onehalf of the fordclass plant then the navy might have judged that designing new hull for the cgx that can accommodate onehalf of the fordclass plant would cost less or pose less technical risk than designing new reactor plant that can fit into the ddg1000 hull if the navy longer considers the ddg1000 hull as the best hull design for the cgx that might have removed reason for the navy to support continued procurement of the ddg1000 in addition as mentioned earlier th date for procuring the lead cgx reportedly may be deferred to about fy2017 the cgx is intended to provide the fleet with improved aaw and bmd capabilities if the date for procuring the lead cgx has slipped several years this may have made it more necessary in the minds of navy leaders to use procurement of stroyers over the next few years to begin achieving that goal if the scheduled date for procuring the lead cgx had remained fy2011 the navy might have deemed it acceptable to procure two more ddg1000s in fy2009 and fy2010 before switching to cgx procurement the following year even if the capabilities of those two dditional ddg1000s were not optimized for the navys stated new mission priorities in addition the navy might have viewed the upfront cost of restarting the ddg51 production line as not worth the effort if only two or three ddg51s were to be procured in fy2009 and fy2010 before switching over to the cgx in fy2011 in the context of deferral of the lead cgx to fy2017 however the navy was pres ented with the prospect of several more years of destroyer pr oduction before switching to procurement of the cgx this created the prospect of procuring several additional ddg1000s with capabilities not optimized for the navys stated new mission priorities in addition it created the prospect that the upfront costs of restarting the ddg51 production line could be amortized over eight or mo re ddg51s as opposed to two or three august 2008 press report on cnos remarks an august 31 2008 press report based on re marks made by admiral gary roughead the chief of naval operations stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs17 31 this is an apparent reference to the littoral combat ship lcsthe navy took the unusual step of abruptly canceling construction of its expensive new class of destroyers last month because the ships lack abilities that top commanders believe are necessary to pr otect us interests according to the services senior officer adm gary roughead chief of naval operations said the ddg1000 zumwalt class destroyer does not have crucial missile and air defense capabilities and defending it against submarines would be difficult the last ie third ship in the class will cost 26 billion i started looking at the ddg1000 it has lot of technology but it cannot perform broader integrated air and missile defense roughead said in his first interview since the controversial move to cancel the destroyer program the zumwalt class was designed to opera in coastal waters close to shore but the navy is developing less costly ship31 for that roughead also noted that design compromises resulted in the removal of some of its torpedoes making it more vulnerable to submarines submarines can get very close and it does not have the ability to take on that threat roughead said the destroyer was originally designed as ship that could move close to shore and fire its guns in support of ground forces but roughead said there is little call for the navy to fire guns on shore if you go back from the end of vietnam to our present time we have only shot about thousand bullets from nava l guns he said and i look at the world and i see proliferation of missiles i see proliferation of submarines and that is what we have to deal with the zumwalt class is also designed to be difficult for enemy radar to detect but roughead said the navy was evalua ting questions about that technology correcting the air defense shortcomings would add billions of dollars to its cost he said making it prudent instead to build more of the previousgeneration ddg51 arleigh burke cl ass destroyers additional models of the arleigh burke would cost about 18 billion apiece roughead said the first two zumwalt destroyers would help demonstrate the capabilities and problems of new tec hnology in the ship including its hull design and innovations designed to reduce the number of sailors needed to operate it but he was less enthusiastic about building third ship the navy agreed to the additional vessel because money was already in the current budget proposal he saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs18 32 julian barnes navy cancels new destroyers angeles times august 31 2008 33 see for example tony capaccio us na

raises several potential oversight issues for congress including but not necessarily limited to those discussed below timing of announcement of navys new position one potential oversight issue for congress concerns the timing of the navys announcement its change in position on dest royer procurement the announcement came well after the submission of the navys proposed fy 2009 b udget and the spring budgetreview hearings held by the house and senate armed services committees and the defense subcommittees of the house and senate appropriations committees potential oversight question for congress is why did the navy not announce its changed position prior to the budget submission or at least prior to the spring budgetreview hearings an october 9 2008 news report quoting vice admiral barry mccullough the deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources statedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs20 37 geoff fein navy needs ships it can evolve to meet growing ballistic cruise missile threats official says defense daily october 9 2008mccullough added that the process the navy undertook to make its decision was done right first we conducted an indepth evaluation within the navy once we came to the conclusion that rendered the decision that the navy made then we socialized this with osd because we want to have solidified navy position and then we wanted solidified big departmentwide position once we received approval from osd to go forward thats when we took it to congress he explained thats the right way to do it it wasnt approval of the plan mc cullough added it was the approval to go to congress with the navys proposal thats what we did we think thats the right way to do business from the outside it looks like the timing was bad the timing was hard and we realized that but we wanted to make sure we had the decision right and then we wanted to make sure we briefed osd on where we wanted to take the navy and then go to congress mccullough said as i look back on it i really think we did it right and its required so intense socialization with industry with members of congress that have an interest in it from an industrial base

over the next several years toward goal of improving the fleets bmd areadefense aaw and blue water asw capabilities why after arguing for years that the navy needs the improved nsfs capabilities of the ddg1000 does the na vy now believe that it has more than enough capability in this area what recent changes in warfighting scenarios concepts of operations or acquisition programs have occurred to suppor t this conclusion does the marine corps agree with the navy that there is more than enough nsfs capability naval surface fire support the discussion belo w provides additional information bearing on the issue of the navys changed assessment regarding the adequacy of navy nsfs capabilities march 2006 navy report on nsfs march 2006 navy report to congress on the navys nsfs programs stated in the 1970s the navy adopted the 5inch54caliber gun as the standard gun system aboard surface combatants ie cruisers and destroyers with the gun having range of 13 nautical miles nm it was intended for general purpose use against surface craft slow mmo ving aircraft and near shore targets additionally four iowa class bbs battleships were brought back into service to provide longerrange shore fire support with the retirement of the iowa class battleships in 1992 the surface navy was left with only the shortrange 5inch54 caliber guns to conduct naval gunfire support missions new and improved coastal defense systems meant the navy must develop platforms capable of delivering fires ashore from greater distances than were achievable with the mk45 mod 2 554 caliber gun in the national defense authorization act for fy1992 and fy1993 congress directed the navy to establish naval surface fire support rd research and development program and investigate potential technologies and weapons systems for improving shiptoshor fire support as well as to formally report on shiptoshore fire support re quirements the navy was also tasked to conduct cost and operational effectiveness

in suppor t of amphibious operations results from the navys nsfs study the ida study and the nsfs coea shared common theme combination of systems are required and precision guided munitions are needed to mainta in accuracy across longer ranges for nsfs the navys nsfs coea issued in march 1994 found that new 155 mm 60caliber gun with an advanced propellant and precisionguided munitions coupled with the tomahawk missile is the most cost effective nsfs solution the navy proposed research and development program to develop the 155mm gun and accompanying precision guided munition as well as upgrade the current mk45 mod 2 554 gun resident on guided missile cruisers and destroyers to achieve greater ranges until the new 155mm gun became operational based on affordability and timeliness the chief f naval operations cno approved new nsfs plan in december 1994 to fo cus on near term nsfs solution by upgrading the existing 554 gun to allow for increased range and to develop an accompanying 5inch precision guided mun ition plans to develop the nearterm 155mm gun and munitions were cancelled but were kept in consideration as long term nsfs solution the 155 mm solution is currently pported by the advanced gun system ags which will be installed on ddx ie ddg 1000 today the navy continues to invest in nsfs requirements the mk45 mod 2 554 gun has been upgraded to mk45 mod 4 562 gun and the naval fires control system has achieved initial operating capability ioc the extended range 5 munition or erm also known as the extended range guided munition or ergm suffered setbacks due to

artillery 22nm the joint fires icd incorporates th requirements of the us army special operations command and other pplicable organizations the joint fires icd defined four requirement gaps that are currently not filled 1 ability to transmitreceive re quired targeting information from intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance sources to command and control systems 2 ability to engage moving point and moving area targets under adverse weather conditions 3 ability to engage knownidentified targets when friendly forces are in close contact or when collateral damage is concern 4 ability to provide volume fires to suppress targets the navy continues to work to close these joint gaps sacca the supporting arms coordination center automated significantly closes gap 1 the use of erm and lrlap projectiles frees up tactical air assets in order to engage moving targets thus minimi zing gap 2 erm and lrlap will significantly close gap 3 the use of mrsi multiple round simultaneous impact capability of erm and lrlap has demonstrated the ability to play role in minimizing the volume fires requirement of gap 4 the navys nsfs program was initiated as part of larger strategy to meet usmc us marine corps stated re quirements for expeditionary maneuver warfare however nsfs will support all joint maneuver forces ashore at extended ranges and will provide responsive and persistent fire support for all other operations the nsfs program will represent economy over time as fewer rounds will be required to achieve the desired effects on most targets due to greatly enhanced accuracy precision and lethality ships will longer need to fire 300 rounds to cover one target during fire support mission for units ashore an individual target may potentially be engaged with as few as two rounds more accurately more quickly and at greaer range than is currently possible programs such as erm and lrlap represent transformation capabilities first conceived in 1992 and continue today to provide balance to the fire support triad consisting of nsfs close air support from tactical air and organic fires from artillery and mortars39 the report includes views and recomme ndations of the

allweather sea based fire support capabilities is fundamental to the success of naval or special operations forces engaged in littoral combat operations as we look at operating across an extended battlefield naval surface fire support nsfs capability will require greater range volume and accuracy in december 2005 the joint requirements oversight council validated the joint fires in support of expeditiona ry operations in the littorals in itial capabilities document icd and recognized nsfs as potential solution for mitigating several of the identified fire support gaps to include the ability to engage targets in close support of maneuver forces or with collateral damage concerns and the ability to provide volume fires over large area or for sustained periods of time eg suppression our existing liabilities in conventional ammunition are range and availability current nsfs systems remain our only available allweather fires capability for ship to shore operations however at 13

the navy and marine corps began to formulate requirements agreement was reached on the capabilities needed for naval surface fire support however quantifiable measures are still lacking for volume of fire the delivery of large quantity of munitions simultaneously or over period of time to suppress or destroy target until further quantifiable requirements are set for volume of fire it is difficult to assess whether additional investment is necessary or the form it should take the navys extended range munition and zumwalt class destroyer have cost more taken longer to develop and field than anticipated and will deliver fewer capabilities than originally promise d largely due to technical challenges the extended range munition is expected to exceed the original cost estimate for development by 550 percent and the navy has delayed delivery of initial capability by 11 years the munitions path for development and fielding remains uncertain as key technologies and munition design have not been adequately demonstrated the office of the secretar of defense recently assumed oversight of the program and while comprehensive review has not yet been held there are ongoing studies that could assist such review the navy has reduced zumwalt class land attack munitions by 50 percent and cut ship quantities from 32 to 7 the primary reason for reduced capabilities are cost pressures created by the navys original concept of revo lutionary performance at an unrealistically low cost the navy plans to begin constr uction of the first two ships in the zumwalt class in fiscal year 2008 the recent study of future fire support needs approved by the joint requirements oversight council identifies four capability gaps command and control of fire support engaging moving targets in poor weather engaging targets when collateral damage is concern and engaging targets that require large volume of fire the analysis that forms the basis of the joint study contends that while the extended range munition and zumwalt class destroyer offer significant capabilities in some scenario s they do not provide enough capability to meet all fire support needs the navy through its surface warfare

investments flynn and mccullough add in speech last week mccullough said the navy is not walking away from providing naval surface fires despite the planned truncation of the ddg1000 program to three hulls down from seven in favor of building more ddg51 vessels which lack the littoral capabilities long cited as the reason the service needed the newer ship ive been asked in light of the ddg1000 decision if we were walking away from the fires mccullough said pt 16 at luncheon sponsored by the surface navy association nothing could be further from the truth however retired marine lt gen paul van riper who led marine corps combat development command in the mid1990s expressed doubt that the latest study will produce any concrete result for 12 years the navy has repeatedly sought letters or requested studies detailing the marine corps naval surface firesupport requirements van riper wrote in an email to inside the navy when provided such specific requirements navy leaders have acted irresolutely in several cases they touted new technologies that never lived up to their promises i am not convinced that the navy has been or is serious toda about naval surface fire support in march the navy pulled the plug on raytheons extended range guided munition ergm program due to myri ad developmental issues ergm was meant to fill the navys extended range munition erm requirement for fiveinch precision projectile with an enhanced range and greater accuracy than current munitions the navy canceled the ergm program entirely in july we are still very interested in firing an extended range projectile mccullough said last week when asked about the subject yet retired marine officers such as van riper remain doubtful of the navys sincerity in such efforts based on my own experiences and having observed since 1995 the navys failure to adequately support improvements to naval surface fire support i am skeptical that this latest effort will be any different than those of the past van riper said robert work naval analyst at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments explained that the marine corps wants fire support in range of 41 to 63 nautical miles with the ultimate go of 200plus nautical miles in order to support an mv22 osprey insertion however challenges remain to reaching this goalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs28 45 zachary m peterson navy marine corp s to

report states variety of platforms could end up providing naval surface fires for marine corps forces ashore vice adm barry mccullough the navys top programmer told inside the navy last week i dont think theres going to be one material solution to this mission set i think its going to end up being multiple material solutions mccullough said in sept 24 interview i think thats wh at we need to go after so that we have variety of platforms that can service those requirements we remain fully committed to naval surface fires requirements both for the marine corps and for the joint force mccullough said we have looked at putting ags on the ddg51 hull and believe thats viable he said now whether we choos to do that or not well see but that is viable alternative the lpd17 amphibious ship has been considered by naval analysts as possible candidate for ags as well lpd17 is huge ship we havent l ooked at it specifically but it would seem to we could probably put it on there mccullough said when asked about the possibility further the sea service will continue to pursue an extended range fiveinch projectile despite the cancellation of raytheons extended range guided munition ergm program earlier this year due to myriad developmental issues ergm was meant to fill the navys extended range munition erm requirement for fiveinch precision projectile with an enhanced range and greater accuracy than current munitionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs29 46 zachary m peterson mccullough mix of so lutions for naval surface fires is likely inside the navy september 29 2008were going to recommence efforts to get at fiveinch extended range projectile mccullough said last week another option for the surface fires mix the admiral predicts is to use the nonline of sight missile system being developed for the littoral combat ship if you look at the nonline of sigh t nlos missile system that we put on lcs thats got gps guidance capability and could be used for fires the threestar admiral suggested it currently has range in excess of 20 miles and while that doesnt meet the current threshold of 41 miles its well in excess of our current capability with fiveinch projectiles and the netexplosive weight of the projectile and nlos missile is about the same however despite mcculloughs statements defending the navys commitment to providing marines with na val

the zumwalt radar suite is specifically designed for capability growth for the emerging bmd mission this is achieved by simply fully populating the dbr array faces with additional electronics the spokesperson adds the most affordable and quickest path to upgrade to even more superior aaw and bmd is via the completion of the ddg1000 tscebased47 mission equipment our estimate is that it would be about onequarter the cost of upgrading the ddg51 system and would result in 200 percent more capability for bmd as previously stated zumwalt mission equipment was designed to accommodate the sm2

capability that the navy could have for the next fe w years lawrence said the thing were talking about right now is even more over and above some of the capabilities that is in its the zu mwalt current requirementsspecifically about missile defense lawrence said is it missiledefensecapable ship and our answer and we put proposals on the table is it could be zumwalt missile defense system

more capable missile defense ship additionally he said our proposal says lets do some things that basically enhance the missiles so that theyre compa tible across say the aegis system and the zumwalt class and then even our coalition partners that would be accomplished he said by putting data link on board the ships that could talk to either one can talk to aegis talk to zumwalt talk to our coalition partners we think that that s really the future you make the missile interoperable across all those configurations if you do that then if the navy chooses to make zumwalt missiledefensecapable ship it becomes very easy to do and we think very affordable the zumwalt combat system could track an enemy missile and the zumwalt could be then missiledefensecapable ship with an sm3 interceptor or sm6 by itself with dual data link on the missile thus far the navy hasnt accepted the raytheon offer deciding that the zumwalt is not missiledefensecapable ship because theyve decided so far not to buy that capability lawrence said but the same could be said of arleigh burkeclass destroyers until they are upgraded with the aegissm3 ballistic missile defense capabi lity he said these areenhancements to the baseline destroyers and you can do the enhancement to either one where all that comes down is decision as to how many of each type of ship the navy wishes to procure the bi g debate is how much of either one do you want to do lawrence said we be lieve that we have proposal on the table that would make the zumwalt the most capable missile defense destroyer in the fleet but first you need to do few things to the interceptor missiles you need to do few things to the combat system you need to buy that incremental capability as well zumwalts could function well in

the sm2 and consequently cannot perform areadefense aaw this came as surprise to observers who have believed for years that the ddg1000 could employ the sm2 and perform areadefense aaw this belief was based in part on the following navy briefing slides on th ddxddg1000 program from 2002 to 2008 have consistently listed the standard missile as among the weapons to be carried by the ddg1000 the navys designation of the ship in 2006 as ddg1000 meaning guided missile destroyer with hull number 1000 rather than dd 1000 meaning destroyer with hull number 1000 implied that the ship would have an areadefense aaw capability for us navy surface combatants the use of g meaning guided missile ship in the ships designation traditionally has meant that the ship was equipped with an areadefense aaw

capability to employ the sm2 missile and thus to provide area defense aaw was never included in the ddg1000 design why did navy briefing slides on the ddxddg1000 program from 2002 to 2008 consistently list the standard missile as among the weapons to be carried by the ddg1000 and why was the ship designated in 2006 as ddg1000 rather than dd1000 during the years that the navy supported continued ddg1000 procurement and defended the ddg1000 against various criticisms did the navy believe it was advantage ous to have others be lieve incorrectly that the ship could fire the sm2 and provide areadefense aaw if the navys intention was to integrate an areadefense aaw missile either the sm2 or the planned successor missile the sm6 into the ddg1000 combat system at later date should the navy

25 times as much shipyard labor to build as would be required to build ddg5157 on april 10 2008 the navy clarified that this ratio was based on the number of labor hours that the navy estimates w ill be needed to build the first two ddg1000s and that subsequent ddg1000s would require smaller amounts of shipyard labor reducing the ratio for subsequent ships to something less than 25 to 158 the

weekhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs40 67 calvin biesecker coast guard acquisition chief suggests 2 billion needed for recapitalization defense daily october 8 2008we probably need close to 2 billion to recapitalize the coast guard at the speed were seeing our assets deteriorate rear adm gary blore assistant commandant for acquisition told defense daily in an interview last friday the coast guards acquisition budget for fy 09 is 15 billion which is for 22 projects the majority of the budget tad over 1 billion is for the deepwater modernization program that consists of 15 projects to upgrade the air sea and c4isr assets of the coast guard key reason for the coast guard needing about 500 million more year for its acquisition budget is the fact that its legacy assets in particular its fleet of high endurance cutters are wearing out fa ster than we anticipated blore said he cited serious mechanical and wastage issues that need to be addressed with these vessels one of the best ways to address the problems with the legacy assets is to be able to fund some of the new procur ements at faster pace blore said right now the acquisition budget only permits the purchase of one 418foot national security cutter nsc annually th coast guard is preparing to let proposal to northrop grumman noc for th fourth nsc which is expected to come in over the current 3537 million construction budget for that vessel in fy 09 the coast guard plans to purchase ei ght nscs and then begin acquiring mediumendurance vessels called the offs hore patrol cutter opc the service plans to buy 25 opcs given that there are five more nscs to build at one year and then probably being able to afford at most tw opcs per year thats another 17 years to recapitalize the surface fleet blore said thats long time to keep the legacy assets running blore saidif blore had the 2 billion to manage he said he would keep nsc production on time and possibly even finish the program year sooner and then move right into opc production the minimum production rate on the opcs would be two per year he said one top of all that blore said he likes the idea of building six fast response cutters per year last month the

winding down of ddg 1000 pr oduction and the restart of ddg51 production the navy and other obser vers have cautioned that the time line for restarting procurement of the current f light iia design could be extended by the need to restart or reestablish vendors for certain key ddg51 components such as the ships reduction gears68 in addition to total shipyard hours anothe r factor to consider for maintaining the shipyards is whether the mix of work being pursued preserves critical ship construction skills including outfitting skills and combat system integration skills the options listed below for supplem enting ddg51 construction work would support such skills to varying degrees increasing the scope of work to be performed in the ddg51 or cg47 modernization programs to include configuration changes like those discussed in appendix c could increase the amount of work th at would be provided by the first two options above procuring additional ships to be bu ilt at ngsb could

pl an to restart the arleigh burke class of destroyers would be budget neutral because of the questions surr ounding the navys decision to go back to ddg51 which according to service officials were based on rapid changes in the global security environment that outstripped the capability set that ddg1000 was designed to combat kennedy is asking for an applestoapples comparison of the two destroyers i believe this would entail providing complete cost data on ddg51 as envisioned by the navy after restart of the production line and on ddg1000 that has modifications the navy believes are critical to perform the ballistic missile defense bmd areadefense antiair warfare and bluewater antisubmarine warfare missions driving the navys desire to shift between platforms kennedy said in an oct 24 letter to chief of naval operations adm gary roughead the navy should provide cost estimates that assume improvements are made to the dual band radar only as necessary to give the ship capabilities comparable to the radar envisioned for restarted ddg51s and improvements are made that would reflect growth path to greater capability while the navy is waiting on the cgx program kennedy added additionally kennedy questions the navys assertion that the plan to restart ddg51 production would be budget neutral even if that were the case it is not clear to that the budget neutral plan is neutral when it comes to funding the workload necessary to support the surface combatant industrial base he said therefore i would like to see how many ddg51s you plan to procure budget quality estimates for that plan what effect that plan would have on the surface combatant industrial base and any associated termination costs while th navy waits to begin building the cgx in 2017 kennedy said the massachusetts senator also noted that number of questions have yet to be answered in regard to the navys decision to cap production of ddg1000 and restart the ddg51 line according to kennedy congress has yet to see intelligence analysis reflecting the coordinated assessment of the defense intelligence agency supporting these changes to the mix of platforms validation of this shift that is supported by reviews by the joint requirements oversight council for an acquisition category i program an approved acquisition strategy for cruisers and destroyers that supports the approved requirements baseline and is consistent with the previous navy studies on what investment is requi red to support the surface combatant industrial base evidence that potential changes in the

and cost savings or penalties from changed vessel manning levels to accomplish missions verification by the commanders of the combatant commands that the navys currently preferred program would be

navys contention that ddg51 will ffer greater ballistic missile defense advanced antiship cruise missile defense and bluewater antisubmarine warfare capabilities and that the service couldnt afford to make ddg1000 capable of supporting the same missions kennedy pointed to testimony vice adm barry mccullough deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources gave to the house armed services subcommittee on seapower in july modifying the ddg1000s to support these missions is unaffordable from the navys standpoint mccullough said at the hearing mccullough made similar statement in september at surface navy association luncheon the congress still has not seen the analysis to support this statement kennedy said in his letter to roughead even if we are to believe that there is an excess of capacity relative to the fire support requirement it is not clear to that the navys path forward makes the most sense kennedy added kennedy said its his understanding that the standard missile2 sm2 is included in the baseline and relatively modest research and development would llow the ship to also employ sm3 and sm6 missiles in ballistic missile defense bmd mission the ddg1000 could be furt her optimized for the ballistic missile defense mission through combat systems modifications and by perhaps deleting the advanced gun system and replacin g it with additional

the navy tasked raytheon with looking at how quickly the company could implement ballistic missile defense bmd capability onto ddg1000 of interest to the navy was the time frame for adding bmd which hull would get the capability what exactly is the capability the ship would get as well as what were the risks and challenges in pursuing this concept mike moe director of seapower capability systems for raytheon integrated defense systems told defense daily in recent interview their time frame they were looking at in this tasking was 2015 we did our analysis and came back in 30 days we found we could do it one year later2016that wa s the earliest we could provide credible capability he said as it stands now in the current operational requirements document ord for zumwalt there is call for bmd moe noted raytheon came up with three options for bringing bmd capability to zumwalt the options looked at radar software and missiles moe said the ship would need to have enough capability to radiate enough energy to be able to discern target when it was in space and then to put weapons on that target he added so the radar had to change in zumwalts case the dual band rada r dbr would have to be modified moe said dbr is designed to go across wide sp ectrum of the family of ships in the navy moe said including the cvn78 ford class of aircraft carriers dbr has two pieces the spy3 which is xband and the volume search radar vsr which is sband moe explained raytheon is the prime for the back end for both radars and lockheed martin lmt provides the vsr base on the sband side moe said the vsr was the radar that needed to be adjusted in the development of vsr from day one on zumwalt there was space allocated for growthfor other missions or more pressing threats that might require more volume search even in the air defense spectrum he said we had room in there to add additional modules additional tr transmitter receiver pieces vsr is partially populated moe said it has about 2600 modules in the current radar the one in development right nowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs47 to make it bmd capable moe said the radar would have to be fully populatedfill in the rest of the blanks that were left for growth in the original design one idea was to leave the vls sic vsr the way it is and see what that could provide in the way of bmd if the bmd software were added and the missile changed second idea was to fully populate the vls sic vsr to its fullest extent third idea was to fully populate the vls sic vsr but also change the duty cyclethat would change the frequency of how much energy would be put target he added each one of thosethe baselinethe term we use is sensitivityso the sensitivity of the baseline radar is zero db sensitivity so when we did the fully populated we got to 11 db of sensitivity which means more power on target moe explained and then with the change in the duty cycle we got to 15 db so 15 db of sensitivity was the maximum we could get out of fully populating the radar putting all the modules in all th holes that werent used initially and bring that kind of capability to bear fo r this capability we are looking for the navy moe noted went right away for the 15 db so thats where our focus was at but we also priced the 11 db capability so there were really two options off the baseline which was zero db as reference point so raytheon grew the radar to be all it could be against the bmd threat and they did the corresponding analysis with their radar fo lks to see if the solution would give them credible capa bility the answer was yes moe said in zumwalts combat system there is software for bmd mission moe said although there was software to inte grate the standard missile for area air defense the actual missile defense algorithms for discrimination and those kind of things to work with threat in the exoatmosphere required different algorithms and different software he sa id because we build that software for all of our radars the bmd system radars that was something we felt would be easy to bring in and leverage into our command and control system on zumwalt moe said raytheon also looked from pur ely cost point of view at the aegis bmd capability and what could be leveraged from that to save money but to do that moe added would require some provisions within the government and some kind of national team approach because of the proprietary nature of aegis bmd effort underneath lockheed martin and with the missile defense agency but we saw that as something that certainly should be considered so we put that into our assessment of other wa ys you could go at this requirement to leverage some additional capability thats already in play in aegis bmd he said for the software raytheon is going to take that from existing software they use in various radars for missile defens moe said the company would leverage that software into the additional code they had to change and bring in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs48 70 geoff fein raytheon says it can conv ert zumwalt into missile cruiser by 2016 defense daily november 4 2008 57discrimination algorithms to be able to discriminate the object of interest particularly in the exoatmospheric threat the third option looked at the missilesallowances had to be made for using the sm3 missile because it is an exoatmospheric platform moe said t hat was probably the easiest of the pieces moe added that the raytheon team look ed at marinized pac3 for use on shipboard environment or sm6 vari ant that would be competed somewhere downstream the missile people were concerned whether or not the missile would fit in the mk 57 launcher moe said and when the navy moves in 2015 to 21inch full up more robust sm3 would that missile fit first off the missile does fit every missile that fits in the mk 41 launcher on the current aegis fleet will fit in the 57 moe said in fact we have about 15 to 20 more inches of vertical room and we have about three more inches of diameter relative to the size of the modules so everything that can be shot out of an aegis mk 41 launcher can be shot out of mk 57 launcher with lot of margin left moe noted the difference is for sm3 because it goes exoatmospheric it needed second cable that references the missile to its ship platform upon launch he said so it has zero reference from where it is launching from as it goes out into space and that cable provides gps inertial navigation uplinka reference point upon launch so there is little difference for that missile because of how it works after all the analysis raytheon told the navy the company could provide very credible capability in the short term2016 moe said on the cost side nonrecurring cost came out to be 389 million for the 11 db and approximately 400 million for the 15 db radar for recurring costs is was 117 million for the 11db solution and 110 million for the 15 db solution moe said so all in all we could provide capability in 2016 we would meet the third hull realizing zumwalts first hull comes out in 2014 and is on schedule right now in the mayjune time frame year later hull two comes out in 2015 and hull three became our ship of choice to meet the requirement the navy had given us 70httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs49 shipprocurement opti ons with ags for nsfs if policymakers decide that

had initiated in the mid1990s with new future surface combat ant program aimed at developing and acquiring family of three new classes of surface combatants76 destroyer called ddx for the precision

surface attack craft also called swarm boats and mines in heavily contested littoral nearshore areas78 on april 7 2006 the navy announced that it had redesignated the ddx program as the ddg1000 program the navy also confirmed in that announcement that the first ship in the class ddg1000 is to be named the zumwalt in honor of admiral elmo r zumwalt the chief of naval operations from 1970 to 1974 the decision to name the first ship after zumwalt was made by the clinton administration in july 2000 when the pr ogram was still calle d the dd21 program79httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs57 79

finalassembly yard for the second on july 17 and 18 2007 it was reported that the na vy was considering the option of instead assigning the first ship to gdbiw and the second to ngsb the potential switch in construction sequence reportedly was being c onsidered by the navy in part because the navy believed it could pr ovide some additional help in maintaining gdbiws work force as its ddg51related constr uction work winds down and because it could also provide some additional time for ngsb to recover from katrinarelated damage80 on september 25 2007 the navy nnounced that it had decided to build the first ddg 1000 at gdbiw and the second at ngsb81 the difference in the two ships construction schedul about one year is driven in large part by the production capacities of vendor

awarded contract modifi cations to gdbiw and ngsb for the construction of the two lead ships th awards were modifications to existing contracts that the navy has with gd biw and ngsb for detailed

strategy for thi rd and subsequent ships82 under an acquisition strategy approved by the department of defense dod acquis ition executive and documented in an updated acquisition strategy report asr of february 13 2008 the navy intended to conduct single competition between gdbiw and ngsb for the contracts to build the five remaining ships in the previously planned sevenship program ie ships three through seven the winner of the competition was to have built three ships the third fifth and seventh ships in the program which were to have been procured in fy2009 fy2011 and fy2013

for congress by ronald orourkeunder this strategy each firm would ve built minimum of two ships and the two firms would in effect have competed for the right to build the remaining fifth ship in light of the shared producti on arrangement for the ddg1000 program see discussion below the two firms more speci fically would have been competing for the right to build certain portions of that fifth ship and to perform the finalassembly work on that ship work that would amount to about 50 of the total shipyard labor hours needed to build that fifth ship the two firms could also be viewed as having been competing for the timing of their respective second ships as the winners second ship would have been the ship to be procured in fy2009 while the other firms second ship would have b een the ship to be procured in fy2010 the navy intended to structure the contract with the winning firm as fixed price incentive fee fpif contract to build the ship that was to have been procured in fy2009 with priced options for building the ships that were to have been procured in fy2011 and fy2013 the navy in tended to structure the contract with the other firm as an fpif contract to build the ship that was to have been procured in fy2010 with priced option to build th ship was to have been procured in fy2012 if one or more of the third and s ubsequent ships were not procured in the years in which the navy currently planne d procure them the options would not have been exercised and the navy might have conducted new comp etition to determine who would have built the followon ships in the program shared production arrangement ngsb and gdbiw have agreed on sharedproduction arrangement for build ing ddg1000s under this arrangement certain parts of each ship will be built by ngsb certain other parts of each ship will be built by gdbiw and the remaining part s of each ship would be built by the yard that does finalassembly work on that ship each firms repeating portion of the ship would amount to about 25 of the labor hours for the ship the yard that does the finalassembly work on the ship would also perform the remaining 50 or so of the labor hours needed to build the ship th arrangement can be viewed as somewhat analogous to the jointproduction arrangement for virginiaclass submarines that was proposed by industry and the navy and th approved by congress in section 121 of

of weapons of mass destruction development and desire to proliferate missiles and other highly technologically advanced weapons all of these threats require the navy to have th capacity to build partnerships and continue our efforts of investing in maritime domain awareness intelligence surveillance and rec onnaissance programs and having both kinetic and nonkinetic effects capabilities we call on our surface combatants to conduct these operations and execute the maritime strategy today and we will continue to call on them to provide maritime supremacy from the ungoverned spaces of the littorals to vast expanses of our worlds oceans challenges the challenge for the navy is to main tain traditional core naval capabilities while simultaneously enhancing our ability to conduct expanded core roles and missions to ensure naval power and influence can be applied on the sea across the littorals and ashore it is longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multimission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps beyond addressing capability requirements the navy needs to have the right capacity to remain global deterrent and meet combatant commander warfighting requirements combatant commanders continue to request more surface ships and increased naval presence to expand our cooperation with new partners in africa the black sea the baltic region and the indian ocean and maintain our relationships with our allies and friends therefore we must increase surface combatant capacity in order to meet combatant commander demands today for ballistic missile defense theater security cooperation steady state security posture and to meet future demands as we standup africa command africom and the fourth fleet in southern command the navy also continues to remain comm itted to our ballistic missile defense partners around the globe including japa n korea the netherlands and spain future force the 30 year ship building plan was desi gned to field the force structure to meet the requirements of the national security strategy and the quadrennial defense review meeting the fy 2020 threat the 313ship force floor represents the maximum acceptable risk in meeting the security demands of the 21st century in the balance of capability and capacity the navy has found that there are increased warfighting gaps particularly in the area of integrated air and missile defense capability capacity also matters and capacity is capability for the irregular war we are in today the ddg 1000 program is developing capable ship which meets the requirements for which it was designed the ddg 1000 with its dual band radar and sonar suite design are op timized for the littoral environment however in the current program of record the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs62 sm2 sm3 or sm6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw th ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water th an ddg51 capa bility ddg 1000s advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivab ility however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and ta rgeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability the ddg 51 is proven mu ltimission guided missile destroyer she is the navys most capable ship against ba llistic missile threats and adds capacity to provide regional ballistic missile fense ddg 51 spiral s will better bridge the ballistic missile defense gap to the next generation cruiser production costs of ddg 51s are known the risks associated with reopening the ddg 51 line are less than the risks of continui ng the ddg 1000 class beyond 2 ships when balanced with the capability and cap acity of pursuing the 313 ship fleet current execution the department is committed to executing the acquisition plan for our future force acquisition professionals and requirements officers are working closely to maintain the departments co mmitment to an affo rdable shipbuilding and modernization plan ddg 51 destroyer program and pr oduction restart assessment the capability of ddg 51 class ships being bu ilt today is markedly more advanced than the initial ships of the class th ddg 51 class was developed in three incremental flights with upg raded technology and capability built into each subsequent hull ships are currently being constructed at both general dynamics gd bath iron works biw and northrop grumman shipbuilding ngsb 62 ships have previously been authorized and appropriated with the most recent procurement of three ship s in fy 2005 tota l of 53 ships have been delivered to the navy five ships remain under construction at gd biw and 4 at ngsb the last ship currently under construction ddg 112 is scheduled for delivery in fy 2011 all material for ddg 51 class ships currently under construction has been procured with the majority of the long lead material purchased in an economic order quantity buy in fy 2002 ddg 51 class production has been extrem ely stable with successful serial production at both shipbuilders despite some setbacks such as the impacts of hurricane katrina at ngsb the costs associated with ddg 51 class shipbuilding are well understood the aegis weapon system has been incrementally developed successfully to add increased capabilities and transition to the use of open architecture and increased use of commercial systems additionally the ddg 51 modernization program is currently modernizing the hull mechanical and electrical hme and combat systems these combined upgrades support reduction in manpower and operating costs achieve expected service life and allo w the class to pace the projected threat well into the 21st centuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs63 based upon navy assessment including discussions with both current shipbuilders to explore any subcontractor issues restart of ddg 51 procurement in fy 2009 is feasible however several ship and government furnished equipment vendor base issues including configuration change issues and production line restarts must be addr essed in order to award and construct additional ships which will increase ship costs above the most recently procured ships the most notable being the restart of the ddg 51 reduction gear production the navy is confident that these issues can be resolved to support fy 2009 restart ddg 51 class restar t beyond fy 2009 presents significant risks and therefore additional costs however both shipbuilders have indica ted to the navy that these lead time challenges can be mitigated with advance procurement and an adjusted build sequence and that ddg 51 restart in fy 2009 is executable in both shipyards regarding the combat systems the st production contracts were awarded in 2006 the cost and ease of restarting t hose production lines is function of time and part availability on military specification items which would need to be addressed given the truncation of the ddg 1000 program at two ships the navy estimate for procurement of single ddg 51 class ship in fy 2009 is 22 billion this estimate utilizes the latest audited forward pricing rate agreements fpras rates impacts for production line restart and contractor furnished equipmentgovernment furnished equipment obsolescence are included the navy has not finalized the acquisition strategy for fy 2009 ddg 51 and followon procurements the navy will carefully consider stability of the industrial base during the pl anning of the specific strategy ddg 1000 class destroyer program the navy remains ready to begin construction of ddg 1000 rigorous systems engineering approach for the prog ram has been employed to mitigate the risk involved with building comple x lead ship surface combatant this approach included successful building nd testing of the 10 critical technologies via engineering development models naval vessel rules were also fully incorporated prior to commencing detail design design of the mission systems is now nearly 100 percent complete detail design will be approximately 85 percent complete prior to the start of fa brication and will be more complete than any other previous surface warship the systems engineering approach for ddg 1000 has been well conceived and well executed however overall th remaining program risk involved in integrating the mission systems 10 edms and the ship detail design is still moderate particularly the dual band radar and integrated power system have further landbased testing to complete and the software development for the total ship computing environment continues careful planning has been conducted so that where further development does continue on systems these have been partially tested to the point that any potential changes are not likely to affect software or system interfaces w ith low risk of affecting either detail design or software development as such the maturity of the ship sign critical technologies and mission systems support commencement of production however it is accurate that the integration of complex lead ship rface combatant with significant newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs64 technologies always entails risk nd though the navy cost estimate for ddg 1000 is based on detailed bottomsup approach this complex integration does increase the cost risk truncation of the program at two ships will result in cost impacts due to program shutdown continuation of require d class service tasks and potential increased costs fo r ddg 1000 and 1001 and other prog rams additionally the rdte efforts for the ddg 1000 program which include software development and other critical efforts must continue in order to deliver completed ships and in the cvn 78 class conclusion your navy remains committed to building the fleet of the future and modernizing our current fleet the navys top shipbuilding priority remains achieving surface combatant shipbuilding program that is equally capable of assuring peace today and access to the global economy tomorrow regardless of the threats posed in an uncertain future to accomplish this we are steadfast in our intention to not use procurement accounts for other navy program offsets procurement and rd investments made today will serve our country and fleet well beyond 2020 as we modernize the fleet we have and build the fleet we need continuing to build ddg 51s enables us to expand warfighting capacity and capability in areas needed by combatant commanders and allows us to reach the 313 ship level sooner meeting evolving blue water and nearland threats that the ddg 51 can match provides less risk to the joint warfighter there is less risk associated with the affo rdability of mainta ining ddg 51 line ve rsus continuing the ddg 1000 line the navy is ready to restart ddg 51 production and is committed to successfully deliver ing ddg 1000 and 1001 from which we will inform new ship class designs th navy has not finalized the acquisition strategy for fy 2009 ddg 51 and followon procurements however acquisition planning is fully underway to execute this change in the navys shipbuilding requirements the department urge s the committees support for full funding of the surface combatant procurement account for fy 2009 and approving our proposal regarding ddgs thank you for your continued support and commitment to our navy i look forward to continuing to work

17 ppappendix c ship design options this appendix presents some ship sign options that policymakers may consider for reducing ddg51 costs or for improving fleet capabilities through procurement of modified ddg51s modifi ed ddg1000s or other ships parts of this appendix are adapted from crs testimony at the july 31 2008 hearing on destroyer procurement before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee85 which in turn was based on information in the navy program of record past brie fings and other information provided by the navy and industry to crs on the ddg51 nd ddg 1000 pr ograms industry briefings to crs on ddg51 and ddg1000 desi gn options that were done at crs request and opensource information ddg51 design options although the navys proposal for re starting ddg51 procurement calls for procuring essentially repeat copies of the current flight iia ddg51 design policymakers may consider the alternative of procuring modified version of the ddg51 design modified version could have lower costs and could be better aligned with poten tial policy goal of using ddg51 procurement to improve the fleets capabilities for nsfs or for bmd and areadefense aaw the latter two referred to in this appendix as integrat ed air and missile defense or iamd in deciding whether destroyer procurem ent over the next several years should focus on providing improved nsfs capabilities or improved iamd capabilities policymakers could consider several fact ors including current and potential us navy operations the operational requirements for conducting these operations current and projected threats or challenges associated with these operations and current or projected navy or dod programs other than destroyer procurement for countering these threats or overcoming these challenges key system for providing improved nsfs capability is the 155mm advanced gun system ags and the associated 155mm long range land attack projectile lrlap key systems for providing improved iamd capabilities include higher capability radars and verticallaunch tubes for iamd interceptors the navy has procured different vers ions of the ddg51 design over time significant change in the design occu rred in fy1994 when the navy shifted ddg51 procurement to the flight iia version of the ship which included among other things the addition of helicopter hangar and the repositioning of the ships aft spy 1 radar arrays prior to implementing the flight iia design the navy seriously considered version with even largerscale changes called the flight iii design that would have included among other things ngthening the ships hull to make room for additional mission systemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs66 compared to the option of procuring repeat flight iia ddg51s procuring modified version of the ddg51 design would incur additional nonrecurring design and engineering costs as well as additi onal recurring production costs due to loss of learning at the shipyard associated with changing the ships design and for some of the options discussed below the enlargem ent of the ship depending on the exact option pursued the nonrecurring design and engineering costs could total in the hundreds of millions of dollars given the number of ddg51s that may be procured between now and the procurement of lead cgx in fy2015 fy2016 or fy2017 these additional costs might be deemed cost effective in terms of making it possible to procure ddg51s that have lower co sts and are better alig ned with possible policy goal of using ddg51 procurement to provide the fleet with improved nsfs or iamd capabilities ddg51 configuration options that may be procured in coming years include but are not limited to the following the current flight iia design modified version with additiona l features for reducing costs modified version with additiona l features for reducing costs and an ags modified version with additiona l features for reducing costs and additional ver ticallaunch tubes modified version with additiona l features for reducing costs and an improved radar and modified version with additiona l features for reducing costs additional verticallaunch t ubes and an improved radar each of these options is discussed below the first of these options might be ready for implementation sooner than the others if so and if procurement of modified ddg51 desi gn were desired procurement of ddg51s over the next several years could begin with procurement of the current flight iia design and then shift to the modified design when the m odified design was ready for procurement although the option of procuring the current flight iia ddg51 design might be ready for implementation sooner than the other options the navy and other observers have cautioned that the time line for restarting procurement of the current flight iia design could be extended by the need to restart or reestablish vendors for certain key ddg51 components such as the reduction gear current flight iia design this option which might be considered the baseline option has the lowest nonrecurring design and engineering costs and the lowest recurring production costs of all the options presented here it would maximize the number of ddg51s that coul d be procured for given amount of procurement funding it would also pose the lowest amount of technical schedule and cost risk it would have higher lifecycle costs then the next optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs67 86 source letter dated may 7 2008 from admira l g roughead to the

well procuring the cu rrent flight iia design would provide more of the same capabilities that ddg51s curren tly provide for the fleet but the ships might not be considered par ticularly wellaligned if possible policy goal was to use ddg51 procurement to provide improved as opposed to additional capabilities for nsfs or iamd as mentioned above th current flight iia design could be procured as bridge to procurement of one of the modified designs discussed below version with features for reducing costs this option would procure flight iia ships that were modified to include features for reducing the ships annual costs potential features of this kind include but are not limited to the following adding automated equipment and making other changes to reduce crew size adding some electricdrive equi pment for interconnecting parts of the ships mechanicaldrive propul sion system so as to permit the system to operate more like an integrated electric drive system and installing

extension of 55 or 56 feet might permit magazine of more than 300 rounds or alternatively might permit the retention of at least some of the ships forward vls cells because the ags requires much more electrical power to operate than the ddg51s current 5inch gun equipping th ddg51 with an ags might require the installation of an additional electrical generator the best location for such generator

table all these options retain the ddg51s 5inch gun if the gun is considered not critical for the ship s intended concept of operations it could be eliminated from the design which would reduce the designs procurement cost supporters of eliminating the 5inch gun might argue that the gun is not critical because it does not contribute to goal of providing improved iamd capabilities and because the navy already has 106 5inch guns on 22 existing aegis cruisers two guns each and 62 ddg51s already in serv ice or under construction one gun each opponents of eliminating the 5 inch gun could argue that the absence of gun would reduce the mission flexibility of the ship version with reduced co sts and an improved radar this version of the ddg51 design would include an improved radar in the place of the ddg51s current spy1 radar as well as features for reducing costs the purpose in procuring this version would be to provide the fleet with improved iamd capabilities the improved radar would use activearra radar technology as opposed to the older passivearray technology used in the spy1 the activearray technology would be similar to that used for ex ample in the ddg1000 dual band radar multiple industry sources have briefed crs on their proposals for modifying the ddg51 design to include an activearray ra dar with greater capability than the spy 1 if the ddg51 hull is not lengthened then modifying the ddg51 design to include an improved radar would require re moving the 5inch gun to make space and weight available for additi onal equipment needed to support operations with the improved radar lengthening the hull might provide enough additional space and weight capacity to permit the 5inch gun to be retained102 supporting equipment to be installed would include an additional electrical gene rator and additional cooling equipment103 the best location for the generator might be in one of the ships two helicopter hangar spots wh ich would reduce the ships helicopter hangar capacity from two helicopters to one due to the higher cost of the improved radar compared with the spy1 and the cost for the additional generator and cooling equipment modifying the ddg51 design to this configuration would increas the recurring procurement cost of the ship information provided to crs by industry suggests that if the hull is not lengthened the increase might be in th general range of 100 million or perhaps or more if the hull were lengthened the cost increase would be greaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs75 104 depending on the amount of reduction in annua l costs it is possible that this ship might be comparable to or less expensive than baseline ddg51 flight iia in terms of annual costs 105 for more on this program see crs report rs22595 navy aegis cruiser and destroyer modernization background and issues for congress by ronald orourkeversion with reduced dditional tubes and an improved radar this version of the ddg51 design would include both additional vertical launch tubes and an improved ra dar as well as features for reducing costs the purpose in procuring this version would be to provide the fleet with improved iamd capabilities this option would require the hull to be lengthened the resulting ship would be more expensive in all respects nonrecurring design and engineering costs procurement costs and annua l costs and more capable than the other options discussed here104 if the ships hull were lengthened by 55 or 56 feet the resulting ship might be roughly 25 more expensiv to procure than the current flight iia design or perhaps more than that ddg51 modernization program policymakers may consider the option of altering the current progra m for modernizing existing ddg51s105 so as to produce modernized ships with configurations similar to the modified configurations discussed above for newconstruction ddg51s each of the modified configurations discussed above might be achievable through modernizations of existing ddg51s altering the ddg51 modernization program to include such changes to the ship configuration would increase the cost of the modernization program increase the amount of shipyard work associated with each modernization which could have implications for supporting the shipbuilding industrial base see discussion below produce ships with lower costs than currently planned produce ships that are aligned more closely with possible policy goal of providing the fleet with improved nsfs or iamd capabilities and permit the modernization effort to produce ships with improved nsfs capabilities while the newcons truction effort produces ships with improved iamd capabilities or vice versa thus pursuing both of these potential policy goals ddg1000 design options ddg1000 design options that policymaker s may consider include but are not necessarily limited to those discussed below as with the ddg1000 options discussed above modifying the ddg 1000 design could incur additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs76 nonrecurring design and engineering co sts and could affect the estimated procurement cost of the ship procuring modified ddg1000 design that includes additional vertical launch tubes rather than agss this option would more closely align the ddg1000 design with goal of providing the fleet with improved iamd capabilities by removing the ships two agss and their magazines and using the freedup space for additiona l vertical launch tubes procuring modified ddg1000 design that includes additional vertical launch tubes rather than agss and also highercapability radar this option which would also more closely align the ddg1000 design with goal of providing the fleet with imp roved iamd capabilities is simila r to the previous option except that the ddg1000 woul d also be equipped with radar with more capability than the radar in the current ddg1 000 design the higher capability radar would use activearray t echnology like the current ddg1000 radar but would use that technology in radar w ith more fully populated arrays radar with certain amount of additional capability could be accommodated without redesigning the ddg1000 deck house rada r with greater amount of additional capability could be accommodated through pa rtial redesign of the deckhouse ie redesign that would affect the deckhous but not require change to the ships basic hull design due to the space need ed for the additional cooling units that would be needed to support highercapab ility radar this option might result in smaller number of additiona l vertical launch tubes than the previous option procuring modified ddg1000 design equipped with sonar optimized for bluewater asw this option would more closely align the ddg1000 design with goal of providing the fleet with improved bluewater asw capabilities by replacing the ddg1000s current bowmounted sonar which is optimized for littoral ie nearshore as w operations with bowmounted sonar optimized for bluewater asw operations the new sonar could be the same as or similar to the ddg51s bowmounted sonar this option might be combined with either of the two previous options to provi the fleet with improved iamd and blue water asw capabilities press report september 12 2008 press repor t relating to options such as those outlined above stated raytheon rtn has proposal on the table with the navy to make the emergent zumwaltclass ddg1000 destro yers missile defense platforms according to company official in an interview yesterday with sister publication space and missile defense report taylor lawrence president of rayt heon missile systems noted that the zumwaltclass destroyers have stealth capabilities able to move in close to enemy shores without being detected by enemy radar the good thing about zumwalt is its really the advanced ship with the advanced combat system and the advanced components of missiles and everything that brings it together to give itthe best capability that the navy could have for the next fe w years lawrence saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs77 106 dave ahearn raytheon pitching missile defense variant of ddg1000 defenes continuedthe thing were talking about right now is even more over and above some of the capabilities that is in its the zu mwalt current requirementsspecifically about missile defense lawrence said is it missiledefensecapable ship and our answer and we put proposals on the table is it could be zumwalt missile defense system would be equipped with the same family of missiles that raytheon built for the aegis system lawrence added but he added the zumwalt would be far more capable missile defense ship additionally he said our proposal says lets do some things that basically enhance the missiles so that theyre compa tible across say the aegis system and the zumwalt class and then even our coalition partners that would be accomplished he said by putting data link on board the ships that could talk to either one can talk to aegis talk to zumwalt talk to our coalition partners we think that that s really the future you make the missile interoperable across all those configurations if you do that then if the navy chooses to make zumwalt missiledefensecapable ship it becomes very easy to do and we think very affordable the zumwalt combat system could track an enemy missile and the zumwalt could be then missiledefensecapable ship with an sm3 interceptor or sm6 by itself with dual data link on the missile thus far the navy hasnt accepted the raytheon offer deciding that the zumwalt is not missiledefensecapable ship because theyve decided so far not to buy that capability lawrence said but the same could be said of arleigh burkeclass destroyers until they are upgraded with the aegissm3 ballistic missile defense capability he said these areenhancements to the baseline destroyers and you can do the enhancement to either one where all that comes down is decision as to how many of each type of ship the navy wishes to procure the bi g debate is how much of either one do you want to do lawrence said we believe that we have proposal on the table that would make the zumwalt the most capable missile defense destroyer in the fleet but first you need to do few things to the interceptor missiles you need to do few things to the combat system you need to buy that incremental capability as well zumwalts could function well in area air warfare taking out incoming enemy air threats lawrence added you put the sm2s on board eventually sm6s you got very very capable area air warfare defense destroyer he said106httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs78 106 continued daily september 12 2008 23 bracketed words and stocksymbol identifiers as well as ellipses in the interiors of

operations the radar on the ship would be large activ earray radar that would be considerably more powerful for example than the imp roved radar that coul d be installed on modified ddg51 the presen ce in the fleet of such radar could significantly improve the fleets iamd capabilities the ship might be similar to the cobra judy replacement ship currently under construction107 few or several such adjunct ships might be procured depending on the number of theaters to be covered requirements for maintaining forward deployments of such ships and their homeporting arrangements the ships would have

the fleets iamd capabilities in the near term would be to alter the current program for modernizing aegis cruisers cg47s108 so as to include the inst allation of an improved radar this option would involve replacing the spy1 radar on existing cg47s with an improved radar using activea rray technology similar to the technology used in the current ddg1000 radar this option would require the removal of one of the cg 47s two 5inch guns as well as the remo val of some other mission equipment it would also require replacing the ships electrical generators and cooling equipment with more

equipped with agss another option that policymakers may c onsider for improving the fleets nsfs capabilities would be to procure lha6 am phibious assault ships earlier known as lha replacement or lhar class ships to modified design featuring lengthened hull and up to four agss one option for such modified design would lengthen the lha6 hull by 56 to 77 feet forward of the ships deckhouse ie its island superstructure and place four agss forward of the deckhouse along the starboard ie right edge of the ship supporters of this option might argue that building new lha6 class ships to this modified configuration rather than to the current design which is equipped with majorcaliber guns would increase lha6 procurement costs by relatively small percentage and thus permit the navy to introduce agss into the fleet at relativ ely low additional cost supporters might argue that the ship could continue to fire its agss while taking on additional lrlap shells for the agss through the ships well deck creating an infinite magazine similar to that in the ddg1000 design s upporters might argue that the location of the agss could permit them to be installed and used with potentially little reduction to the ships other capabilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs80 appendix d ddg1000 oversight issues for congress this appendix presents some oversig ht issues for congress specifically regarding the ddg1000 program prior to the navys announcement in late july 2008 that it wanted to stop ddg1000 procur ement at two ships and restart ddg51 procurement these and other ddg1000 prog ram oversight issues were presented in the main body of this crs report accuracy of navy cost estimate one potential oversight issue for c ongress specific to the ddg1000 program concerns the accuracy of the navy s cost estimate for the program cbo july 2008 testimony the congressional budget office cbo believes that the navy is significantly underestimating ddg1000 procurement costs consistent with previous cbo testimony and reports cbo testified at the july 31 2008 hearing on destroyer procurement be fore the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house arme d services committee that it believes ddg 1000s will each cost about 55 more than the navy estimates cbo testified that the navy had planned to buy one ddg1000 zumwalt class destroyer each year between 2009 and 2013 in addition to the two authorized in 2007 the services 2009 budget suggests that the navy expected the first two ships to cost 32 billion each in constant fy2009 dollars and the next five to cost an average of 23 billion each in constant fy2009 dollars reflecting an increase of about 200 million per ship for th last five ships compared with the costs projected in the navys 2008 budget cbo by contrast estimates that the first two ddg1000s would cost about 50 billion ap iece in constant fy2009 dollars and that the next five would ve cost an average of 36 billion each in constant fy2009 dollars the navys cost goals and estimates for the ddg1000 program and its predecessors the ddx and dd21 have increased several times since 1996 further growth in the ships cost is likely the navys current estimate for the two leadship ddg1000s pric the ship at about 250 million in constant fy2009 dollars per thousand tons of lightsh ip displacement the weight of the ship minus its crew materiel weapons or fu by contrast the lead ship of the ddg51 arleigh burke class destroyer cost about 390 million in constant fy 2009 dollars per thousand tons and the lead ship of the ticonderoga class cruiser cost more than 400 million i n constant fy2009 dollars per thousand tons cbo used the ddg51 leadship cost as its basis for estimating the cost of the lead ship of the ddg1000 class adjusting for the size of the ship the navy has asserted that the basis for cbos estimate may not be valid because the ddg51 had number of problems in the early stages of its construction that should not be expected to occur during the construction of the first ddg1000s specifically the design of the lead ddg51 was disrupted and delayed because new design tool being used at the time was incomplete and not well understood it had to be aba ndoned and the design restarted using more traditional methods the design of the lead ddg51 was thus about 20 percenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs81 complete when construction began by contrast according to the navy the design of the ddg1000 progressed far more smoothly the navy expects to have the design 85 percent complete when construction begins this summer in addition because the ddg51 is smaller more compact ship the navy believes that on tonforton basis it has been more difficult to build than the ddg1000 class is designed to be the more open internal spaces of the ddg1000 mean that it would not be as difficult to inst all piping wiring and other components and thus on tonforton basis it shoul d be less timeconsuming and therefore less expensive to build than ddg51 although the navy may not encounter the same problems constructing the lead ddg1000s that it did when constructing the lead ddg51 cbo expects that the service will encounter other probl ems that will increase the costs of the ddg1000 and delay its construction as navy officials have stated lead ships are often very difficult to build and many problems typically occur during construction problems with the first littoral combat ships for which costs doubled and with the lead ship of th lpd17 class amphibious transport dock for which costs increased by 80 percent and construction time more than doubled illustrate the difficulties th navy has encountered recently in constructing lead ships both the lc s and the lpd17 are much less complex technologically than the ddg1000 will be in addition wh ile the designs of the littoral combat ships and ddg51 were 20 percent to 30 percent complete at the start of fabrication the design of th lpd17 was about 80 percent complete at the start of fabrication and it was argu ably the navys most troubled leadship program over the past 20 years experien ce with the virginia class submarine program raises similar concerns recently navy officials stated in testimony before the congress that when construc tion of those new submarines began the virginia class program was at about the same point in its design that the ddg1000 will be the cost of the first two ships of the virginia class exceeded their budget by an average of 17 percent moreover the ddg1000 program is incorporating 10 major new technologies in the lead ship of the class that are intended to improve on technologies used in the previousgeneration ddg51 destroyer those technologies include electric drive and distributed power system tumblehome hull one in which the sides of the ship slope outward to increase stealthiness an advanced gun system new radars and composite materials and stealthenhancing coatings for the deckhouse in the past the navy typically introduced three or four major new t echnologies into new class of surface combatant comparison of the navys estimate for two additional ddg51s and its estimate for the seventh ddg1000 which was slated to be purchased in 2013 illustrates the risk for cost growth in the latter program in information recently provided to the chairman of the subcommittee on seapower of the senate armed services committee the navy stated that if the congress authorized the purchase of two new ddg51s in 2009 ships that would benefit from lessons learned during the construction of 62 si milar ships the cost would be about 33 billion or slightly less than 17 billion each at the same time in its fiscal year 2009 budget submission to the congre ss the navy stated that the cost to build the seventh ddg1000 in 2013 would be about 24 billion in 2013 dollars deflating the cost of the seventh ddg1000 using the inflation index for

imply that those 5000 extra tons as well as the 10 new technologies being incorporated in the ddg1000 class will increase the ships cost by only 200 million or about 10 percent if cbos cost estimates for the lead ddg1000s are realized cbos estimate is about 55 percent higher than the navys for the cost of procuring the first two ddg 1000s the lead ships of the ddg1000 program would still

commonly known as the caig five of eight leadship programs experien ced cost growth of over 60 percent the caigs analysis at the time did not include the virginia class submarine program the first two ships of which xperienced cost growth of 11 percent and 25 percent those ships were built under teaming arrangement and assembled in two different shipyards the analysis also did not include the first two littoral combat ships which have experience d cost growth of about 100 percent110 gao july 2008 testimony and report the government accountability office gao similarly believes that cost growth in the ddg1000 program is likely gao testified at the july 31 2008 hearing that costs of the ddg 1000 ships are likely to exceed current budgets if costs grow during lead ship construction due to technology design and construction risks as experience shows is likely re maining funds may not be sufficient to buy key components and pay for other work not yet under contract despite significant investment in th lead ships the remaining budget is likely insufficient to pay for all the effort necessary to make the ships operational the navy estimates total shipbuilding budget of 63 billion for the lead ships of this amount the navy has approximately 363 million remaining in unobligated funds to cover its outstanding costs and to manage any cost growth for the two lead ships but known obligations for the lead ships assuming cost growth during construction range from 349 million to 852 million the main discrepancy is the current estimated cost of the combat systems in order to create cash reserve to pay for any cost increases that may occur during construction of the lead ships the navy has deferred contracting and funding work associated with conduc ting shipboard testing of the combat systems and in some cases has also delayed purchasing and installing essential ship systems until later in the construc tion sequence the navy has estimated the cost of these combat systems to be around 200 million while the contractors estimate is over 760 million if the agreed on cost approaches the contractors estimate the navy will not have enough in its remaining funds to

effectiveness of the ddg1000 program prior to the july 31 2008 hearing on destroye r procurement before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee the affordability and costeffectivene ss of the ddg1000 program was explored extensively at twopart hearing on the ddg1000 program held on july 19 and 20 2005 before the projection forces subc ommittee of the house armed services committee at the end of the july 19 portion of the hearing dod and navy witnesses were asked by the subcommittee chairman representative roscoe bartlett to provide the subcommittee with their own individual views on the procurement cost figures at which the lead ddg1000 and followon ddg1000 defined as the fifth ship would become unaffordable at the beginning of the july 20 portion of the hearing representative bartlett stated that the figures provided by the witnesses ranged from 4 billion to 45 billion for the lead ship and 25 billion to 29 billion for the fifth ship the navys current cost estimates for the first and fifth ddg 1000s are below these figures cbos current cost estimates for the first and fifth ddg1000s are substantially above these figureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs85 technical risk third potential oversight issue for congress specific to the ddg1000 program concerns technical risk in the program which can affect the navys ability to build ddg1000s on schedule and within budg eted costs over the past several years gao has reported on the technical ri sks involved in deve loping the several significant new technologies that are to be incorporated into the ddg1000 the navy over the years has worked to retire th risks gao testified at the july 31 2008 hearing on destroyer pr ocurement before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee that the ddg 1000 program has from the onset faced steep challenge framed by demanding mission requirements stealth characteristics and desire to reduce manning levels by more than half that of predecessor destroyers these requirements translated into significant technical and design challenges rather than introducing three or four new t echnologies as is the case on previous surface combatants ddg 1000 plans to use revolutionary hull form and employ 11 cuttingedge technologies in cluding an array of weapons highly capable sensors integrated into the sides of deckhouse made primarily of composite material not steel and power system designed for advanced propulsion as well as highpowered combat systems and ship service loads this level of sophistication has necessitated large software development effort 14 million to 16 million lines of code ll of this is to be accomplished while splitting construction between two shipya rds the navy believes this approach and schedule is important to managing shipyard workloads as starting later would have caused shipyard workload to drop too low in sense then the construction approach and schedule became an additional challenge as they became constraints on the pace of technol ogy and design development to meet these multiple and somewhat conflicting demands the navy structured its acquisition strategy to develop key systems and mature the design before starting to build the ship while the navy has made good decisions along the way to address risk it is already likely shortly before the navy embarks on ship construction that additional funding will be necessary or tradeoffs will need to be made to develop and deliver ddg 1000 ships despite multiple and somewhat competing demands the navy conceived thoughtful approach and achieved developmental successes on ddg 1 000 developing 10 prototypes of the ship s critical systems helped to create confidence that number of technologies would operate as intended and the navys plan to mature the ships desi gn before starting construction aims to reduce the risk of costly design changes after steel has been cut and bulkheads built for example the navy successfully demonstrated the advanced gun system through initial guided flight and testing on land in other cases such as for the integrated power system tests brought to light technical problems which the navy was able to address by going to an alternate technology however notwithstanding these efforts significan t challenges remain in developing the ships design and number of key components in particular the deckhouse volume search radar and the integrated power system moreover the ships capability is contingent on an unpreced ented software development effort recently the navy restructured the schedule to buy more time for development good decision however as constructi on of the first ship has not yet begun the navy may have exhausted its options for solving future problems without adding money and timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs86 although the initial phases of the design are complete the shipbuilders will be pressed to complete large amount of design work by october 2008 when lead ship construction begins fr om august 2007 through may 2008 the shipbuilders finished work on 16 of th 100 design zones individual units that make up the ships design leaving 5 months to finish the final design phases in 84 zones leading up to the start of construction while the shipbuilders believe they can finish the design by the start of ship construction delays in the development of the ships key systems could impede completion of the design and eventually interfere with ddg 1000 construction if the shipbuilders cannot finish planned design work prior to the start of leadship construction the program is at greater risk for costly rework and outofsequence work during construction to maintain the start of ship construction in 2008 while continuing to develop the ships technologies the navy recently realigned the programs schedule rather than delivering fully missioncapable ship the navy will take ownership of just the vessel and its mechanical and electrical systems including the ships power system in april 2013 at that point the navy plans to have completed lightoff of the pow er mechanical and electrical systems lightoff refers to activating and tes ting these systems aboard ship the navy deferred lightoff of the combat systems which include the radars guns and the missile launch systems by over 2 years until may 2013 according to the navy conducting lightoff in phases allows the program to test and verify the ships major systems in particular the integrated power system in isolation and creates additional time to mature the combat systems as well as the software that supports these systems before ship installation and shipboard testing however since the navy will only test and inspect th hull prior to taking ownership of the vessel it will not have full understanding of how the ship operates as complete and integrated system until afte r final shipboard testing of the combat systems in 2014 while the restructure maintains the construction schedule it does delay verifying the performance of the integrat ed power system before producing and installing it on the ship tests of comple integrated power system with the control system will not occur until 2011 nearly 3 years later than planned to meet the shipyards schedule the navy will buy power system intended for the third ship and use it in landbased tests as result the integrated power system will not be demonstrated until year after the power systems have been produced and installed on the two lead ships an approach that increases exposure to cost and schedule risk in production finalizing deckhouse manufacturing and assembly processes are essential to constructing and delivering the deckhouse as planned changes to the manufacturing processes for deckhouse production are ongoing the shipbuilder is validating process changes through production and inspection of series of test units culminating with larges cale prototype manufactured to the same thickness and other specifications of the deckhouse final validation of the manufacturing processes for deckhouse construction will not occur until after construction inspection and shock testing of the largescale prototype however test and inspection activities are not sc heduled for completion until after the deckhouse production readiness review in september 2008 problems discovered during testing and inspection may require additional changes to manufacturing methods moreover facility and machinery upgrades necessary to construct and assemble the deckhouse are not all scheduled to be complete until march 2010httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs87 116 government accountability office defense acquisitions zu mwaltclass

ability to once again perform the systemintegrati on function following the downsizing of dods technical and acquisition workforce that occurred when acquisition functions were earlier transferred to the private sector the ddg1000 program in addition to being an early test of dods abilities in this area may represent fairly challenging test given the number of sign ificant new technologies that

appreciation of how large and expensive ship design the requirements would genera naval analyst norman friedman the author of numerous books on us warship designs stated in 2004 book on us destroyer designs that in past navy ship design practice the naval policymakers in opnav the office of the chief of naval operations would write draft set of ship characteristics the preliminary design branch of buships the bureau of ships or navsea the naval sea systems command would develop sketch designs to meet the requirements of ten the opnav policymakers would find the results outrageous for example exorbita ntly expensive such results would force them to decide just how impor tant their various requests had been eventually preliminary design would produce something opnav found acceptable but that might not actually be built in contrast to past practice preliminary design for the ddg1000 was drawn up to test the cost of various requireme nts each requirement was justified in operational terms eg level of stealth that would reduce detectability by some percentage but those sponsoring the ship had way of knowing the impact that particular combination of ch requirements would have normally navsea would have created series of sketch designs for exactly that purpose122 an august 2005 trade press article ggested that growth in dd21ddg1000 requirements and cost over time may have

as part of larger undertaking to draw up alternative options for the navys current shipbuilding program in essence sources said mullen is looking to reconstitute the ship characteristics improvement board which eventually became inactive in 2002 for more than 100 years the navy has maintained highlevel group of officials to advise service leaders on ship design and configuration this group established in 1900 as the general board has gone through many name changes including the ship characteristics nd improvement board in the early 1980s and until 2002 the ship characteristics and improvement panel navy officials say that the panels oversight began to wane in the late 1990s just as the dd21 program originally envisioned as 750 million replacement for spruanceclass destroye rs took off before becoming officially inactive in 2002 requirements during this time were added to the new destroyer program some of which raised eyebrows in the navy such as the need for flag officer quarters other ship in that class has accommodations for an admiral still the ddg1000 has come to be regarded as technology carrier for future surface ships and the price tag has ballooned to 3 billion copy mullens goal spelled out in july 25 memo to willard and provided to insidedefensecom is to put in place process that adequately defines warship requirements and manages changes to those requirements eg ship characteristics improvement board in disciplined manner with cost and configuration control as the paramount considerations recent rand study conducted at the request of mullens predecessor retired adm vern clark concluded that key cause for climbing ship costs is the number of requirements tacked on to program according to consultant familiar with the findings of the study

talk about new destroyer with 3 billion ship said former senior navy official this senior official who was in key pentagon position as the dd21 program commenced said that without panel overseeing the

have happened123 march 2007 report from the center for strategic and budgetary assessments csba made similar point for nearly century the navys scib group of highranking don department of the navy officials worked to balance desired warship warfighting requirements against their impact on ships final design and production costs the primary reason why the navy lost cost control over the dd21ddxddg1000 was th at just as the ship entered its design definition phase the power of the navys scib was waning replaced by joint requirements definition process with fiscal checks and balances124 some observers such as norman friedm an have raised questions about the navys decision to use tumblehome i inwardsloping hull for the ddg1000 2006 magazine article by friedman for example raised questions about the implica tions of tumblehome hull for the ships ability to deal with underwater damage125 asked whether the navy knew at the outset of the ddg1000 design process how much decision to incorporate tumblehome hull and other survivability features would increase the size of the ship and questioned whether the reduced visibility of the tumblehome hull to certain types of radars the central reason for using tumblehome hull will be negated by its visibility to highfrequency hf surface wave radars that are now for sale on the international market the article which refers to the ddg1000 by the previous designation ddx stated in the case of the ddx the overriding requirement in determining the hull design was to minimise radar cros s section stealth much of the hull design was dictated by the attempt to reflect radar pulses away from the radar emitting them so that radar returns would be minimised by now the main technique is well known slope all flat surfaces and eliminate the corner reflector created by the juncture of the hull and waterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs92 if the ship could be stabilized sufficiently against rolling from side to side then she would never or almost never present any vertical surfaces to radar in the case of ddx stabilization is apparently achieved using ballast tanks such tanks in turn demand internal volume deep in the ship overall stealth demands that as much as possible of the overall volume of the ship be buried in her hull where the shape of the ship can mini mise radar returns that is why paradoxically carefullydesigned stealthy ship will be considerably larger for more internal volume than less stealthy and more conventional equivalent in the case of ddx there were also demands for improved survivability the demand for stealth imp lied that antiship missiles were the most important envisaged threat they hit above water so an important survivability feature would be to put as much of the ships vitals as possible below water which meant greater demands for underwater volume once the tumblehome hull had been chosen the ships designers were apparently also constrained to slope th bow back creating surfacepiercing or ram bow instead of as is usual forward there were numerous reasons why past naval architects abandoned tumblehome hulls and ram bows tumblehome reduces ships ability to deal with underwater damage when conv entional flared outwardsloping hull sinks deeper in the water its waterplane area the crosssection of the ship where it intersects the plane of the water increase s it becomes somewhat more stable and it takes more water to sink it deeper into the water because the waterplane area of tumblehome ship decreases as it draws more water such ship is easier to sink deeper tumblehome also apparently makes ship less stable and hence less capable of resisting extreme weather conditions the larger the ship the more extreme the weather has to be to make that critical critics of ddx have concentrated on the danger defenders have concentrated on how extreme the critical weather condition would be in the end whether the ddx hull form is attractive depends on an evaluation of antiradar stealth as sign driver about decade ago the ddx design concept was sold on the basis of lengthy and incidentally unclassified analysis the gist of which was that heavilyarmed surface combatant could play decisive role in korean scenario the key analytic point was that it woul d be very important for the ship to come reasonably close to enemy shores unobserved that in turn meant anti radar stealth however it soon came to mean particular kind of antiradar performance against centimetricwave radars radars with wavelengths on the order of centimeters of the sort used by patrol aircraft the ship would fire its weapons from beyond the usual horizons of shorebased radars as it happens antiship missiles use much the same kinds of radars as patrolling aircraft so it could be argued that the same antirada r techniques would be effective in the endgame in which missiles would approach the ship without access to files of the time it is impossible to say whether those approving the ddg1000 pr oject realised that its stealth and survivability characteristics would produce 14000 to 17000 ton destroyer about the same time that ddx characteristics requirements were being approved the decision was taken at the defense department not navy level that there would be internal feasibility design in the past the feasibility stage had the very useful role of showing those setting requirements what their implications would be athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs93 126 norman friedman the new shape of ships naval forces ii 2006 5658 60 62 63 italics as in the original friedman makes somewhat similar comments in chapter 17 pages 431450 of us destroyers an illustrated design history revised edition op citthe very least the navys senior leader ship would have been given warning that they would have to justify drastic jump in destroyer size when they wanted to build ddx that jump might well have been considered justified but on the other hand the leadership might also have asked whether somewhat less dramatic approach would have been acceptable about decade after the requireme nts were chosen with ddx well advanced the situation with regard to stealth may be changing shaping is relevant only at relatively short radar wavelengths for about quartercentury there has been talk of hf surface wave radars which operate at wavelengths of about 10 to 200 meters ie at wavelengths the size of ship canada currently operates this type of radar made by raytheon for surveillance of the grand banks another is being tested in the caribbean australia has bought this kind of radar to fill gaps in overthehorizon radar coverage turkey is buying such radars for sale for some years in 2005 it was reported unofficially that china had bought russian hf surface wave radar the previous year it seems almost certain that hf surface wave radar can defeat any kind of stealth shaping designed primarily to d eal with shorterwavelength radars moreover hf surface wave radars have an inherent maximum range due to the way they operate of about 180nm at long range the radars beam is not nearly accurate enough to aim missile however we can easily imagine netted system which would use the longrange hf surface wave radar to define small box within which the target ship would be missile with gps global positioning system guidance could be fl own to that box ordered to search it if the argument given here is realistic then the considerable sacrifices inherent in the ddx design longer seem nearly as attractive it can still be argued that design like the ddx is attractive well out to sea beyond the reach of coastal radars in that case however there may be other signatures which can be exploited for example ships proceeding at any speed create massive wakes it is clear that the wake produces radar return very visible from an airplane or probably from spacebased radar in the end then how much is stealth worth as way of avoiding detection altogether probably less than imagined that leaves the rather important endgame the hope being that decoys of some sort greatly exceed actual ship radar crosssection that is probably not foolish hope but it does not require the sort of treatme nt reflected in the ddx now it may be that the untied states typically faces countries which have not had the sense to buy antistealth radars though we would hate to bet on that in that case ddx may well be effectiv ely invisible to them so will lot of less thoroughly stealthy ships126 an october 6 2008 press report stated

consistent with its larger size higher procurement cost and greater use of new technologies the ddg1000 the navy believe s is more capable than the ddg51 design in several respects the navy st ates that it designed the ddg1000 for full spectrum littoral dominan ce and believes the ddg1000 would be considerably more capable than the ddg51 in littoral ope rations the navy believes that because of its reduced signatures defensive system s number of gun shells in its magazine and ability to resupply gun shells while underway the ddg1000 would have considerably more capability than the ddg 51 to enter defended littoral waters and conduct sustained operations there the navy believes that because of its guns aviation capabilities special operations fo rces sof support capabilities and small

growth margin the ddg51 and ddg1000 designs each have about 10 growth margin for the roughly 9000t on ddg51 this equates to about 900 tons of growth margin while for the 14987 ton ddg1000 this equates to about 1400 tons of growth margin ship mobility the two designs are roughly quivalent in terms of maximum sustained speed cruising endurance and seakeeping ie stability in rough seas the ddg1000s draft 28 feet is somewh at less than the ddg51s 31 feet other things held equal this might give the ddg1000 an ability to operate in or be berthed at places where th water depth is sufficien t for the ddg1000 but not for the ddg51 the ddg1000s length 600 feet is greater than the ddg51s 505 feet other things held equal this mig ht give the ddg51 an ability to be berthed in spaces that are long enough for the ddg51 but not for the ddg1000 electrical power for weapons and systems the ddg51 has 75 megawatts mw of electrical power fo r its weapon systems while the ddg1000 design with its integrated electricdriv system can provide up to 78 mw for its weapons and power systems by divertin g power from propulsion to weapons and systems signatures and detectability the ddg1000 has smaller radar cross section and lower infrared ac oustic and magnetic signat ures than the ddg51 the two designs are roughly equivalent in terms of the detectability of their radar and other electromagnetic emissions the ddg1000s reduced signatures ddg1000 supporters will make the ddg1000 harder to detect localize classify and target giving the ddg1000 significant advantage in engagements against enemy forces survivability and damage control the navy states that the ddg1000 would be able to keep fighting after an attack like the one that disabled the uss cole ddg67 on october 12 2000 the two designs are roughly equi valent in terms of degree of compartmentalization and ship stability when flooded the ddg1000s vertical launch system vls is more heavily ar mored than the ddg51s the ddgs fire suppression system is automated only in th engine room and magazine while the ddg1000s sy stem is automated throughout the ship making it safer and more effective the ddg51s floodcontrol system is not automated while the ddg 1000s is which the navy be lieves will make it more effective the ddg1000s electrical power distribution system is an integrated fightthrough system meaning that it is designed to automatically isolate damaged areas and reroute electrical power around them all critical ddg1000 system s are dualfed meaning that if power from one source is cut off it can be rout ed through

sensitivity and target resolution the firm track range of the ddg1000s dualband radar the range at which it can maintain firm tracks on targets is 25 greater for most target types than the firm track range of the ddg51s spy1 radar the ddg1000s aaw combat system would be able to mainta in about 10 times as many tracks as the ddg 51s aegis system the ddg1000s radar s much more capability for resisting enemy electronic counter measures and for detecting ta rgets amidst littoral clutter as result of the better performance amidst littoral clutter the navy believes that ships escorted by the ddg1000 in defende d littoral waters woul d have three times as much survivability as ships escorted by the ddg51 the two designs would use the same ty pes of areadefense and pointdefense interceptor missiles130 they would also use the same flares chaff and decoys to confuse enemy antiship cruise missiles but the navy believes these devices would be more effective on the ddg1000 because of the ddg1000s reduced signatures antisurface warfarestrike warfare the ddg1000 would have considerably more naval surface fire support nsfs capability than the ddg51 the ddg51 has one 5inch gun while the ddg1000 has two 155mm advanced gun systems agss the ddg51s gun can fire an initial salvo of 20 rounds per minute and can subsequently fi re at sustained rate of four rounds per minute 204 the ddg1000s two guns have combined firing rate of 2020 the shells currently fired by the ddg51s gun have ra nge of 13 nm future shells are to have range of up to 50 nm the shells to be fired by the ddg1000s guns are to have range of 63 to 74 nm and consequently could cover at 74 nm more than three times as much area ashore assuming 25 nm standoff from shore as shell with range of 50 nm the shells fired by the ddg51 carry 8 pounds of explosive while those fired by the ddg1000 are to carry 24 pounds of explosive when fired at lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs99 than maximum range the shells fired by the ddg1000 can alter their flight paths so that six to eight of them can hit target at the same time the shells to be fired by the ddg51 do not have this capability the ddg51 carries 600 of the 13nmrange shells or 230 of 62nmrange shells while the ddg1000 carries total of 600 of its shells it might be possible to fit the ddg51 with one of the 155mm guns to be carried by the ddg1000 it would likely re quire the removal of both the ddg51s 5inch gun and its forward 32cell vls in this configuration the ddg51 might carry about 120 of the guns 155mm shells the 155mm guns on the ddg1000 could be replaced in the future with an electromagnetic rail gun or directed energy weapon the ddg51 does not have enough electrical power to support such weapons antisubmarine warfare asw the ddg51s sonar system is more capable for bluewater asw operations while the ddg1000s system is more capable for littoral asw operations the ddg1000s bowmounted sonar and towed array can interact to more rapidly triangulate targets the flight iia ddg51 lacks towed array the ddg1000s rada r would have more capability than the ddg51s radar for detectin g submarine periscopes the ddg51 has six torpedo tubes for firi ng lightweight 1275inch diameter antisubmarine torpedoes while th ddg1000 has none but the navy does not believe these tubes to be of significant operational value against potential future threats both ships can launch lightweight torpedoes from their helicopters or fire the vertical launch antisubmarine rocket vla which is armed with lightweight torpedo the ships would use the same counterm easures for confusing enemy torpedoes but the navy believes these countermeasur would be more effective on the ddg 1000 because of the ddg1000s reduced signatures mine warfare miw the ddg1000s bowmounted sonar includes an in stride mineavoidance capability the ddg 51s sonar suite has less capability for detecting mines the ddg51 can be built to design that permits the ship to embark and operate the re mote minehunting system rms six ships in the ddg 51 program ddgs 91 to 96 have been built to this design the navy says that the ddg1000s reduced acoustic nd magnetic signatures would translate into significantly greater operating area in mined waters missiles for performing above missions the ddg51 has 90 missile launching tubes in its vls while the ddg1000 has 80 the ddg51s vls tubes can accommodate missile up to 21 inches in diameter 21 feet in length and about 3000 pounds in weight the ddg1000s vls tubes can accommodate missile up to 24 inches in diameter 22 feet in length and about 4000 pounds in weight the gasmanagement ie heatmanagement system of the ddg1000s vls tubes can accommodate hotterburning missile than the gasmanagement system of the ddg 51s vls so the ddg1000 might be more cap able of using future missiles if they are hotterburninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs100 aviation for performing above missions the ddg51 can embark and operate two sh60 helicopter s but does not have electr onics for launching and recovering unmanned aerial vehicles uavs the ddg1000 can embark operate and provide full maintenance for two sh 60 helicopters or one sh60 helicopter and three uavs the ddg1000s flight deck is larger than the ddg51s and can accommodate all joint rotarywing aircraft including the mv22 the ch53 and the h47 the ddg1000s flight deck is 10 feet higher off the water and can therefore be used for full flight operations in sea st ate ie sea condition that is at least one step higher ie rougher than is po ssible for the flight deck on the ddg51 special operations forces sof support the ddg1000 has additional berthing for 20 sof personnel i platoon as well as space for sof mission planning and spaces for stowing sof gear the ddg51 lacks these features boats the ddg51 can embark two sevenme ter boats that are deployed and recovered with davit the ddg1000 can embark two 11meter boats and four rubber raiding craft that are deployed and recovered with ster n ramp which permits faster and safer launching and recovering and launchr ecovery operations in higher sea states habitability features for crew on the ddg51 enlisted crew berthing spaces accommodate 20 to 60 sailors eac h on the ddg1000 every sailor would have stateroom and each stateroom w ould accommodate four sailors the navy believes these features would improve

information presented in table 9 another slide in the navy briefing stated that the ddg1000s radar cr oss section will be similar to that of fishing boat131 navy officials have also st ated separately that the ddg1000s acoustic signature will be similar at certain speeds to that of certain us navy submarines132 in elaborating on the point in table 9 pertaining to the ddg1000s electrical power navy officials stated at the briefing that at speed of 20 knots the ddg1000 would have 58 megawatts of power ava ilable for powering nonpropulsion shipboard systems the briefing stated that the ddg51 by

against short and medium range ballistic missiles and area antiair warfa re capability required in an antiaccess environment where the ddg 1000 currently does not upgrading the ddg 1000 combat system with this capability would incur additional cost the ddg 51 class also possesses better capability in active open ocean antisubmarine warfare than does the ddg 1000 on balance the procurement cost of single ddg 51 is significantly less than that of ddg 1000 and the lifecycle costs of the two classes are similar i appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on these two alternatives with you similar letter has been sent to senator martinez as always if i can be of further assistance please let know133 on june 3 2008 john young the under s ecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics in testimony to the senate armed services committee questioned the accuracy of the cost figures in the may 7 letter stating among other things that he believed the annual operating and support cost of the ddg1000 would be about 10 million less than that of ddg51 and that the procurement cost figures in the letter relied on certain assumptions that might not prove accurate youngs testimony was viewed as defendi ng the ddg1000 more strongly than did the cnos may 7 2008 letter134 july 2 2008 dod letter to representative taylor july 2 2008 letter from john young the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics ie the dod acquisition executive to representative gene taylor that was obtained by fense trade publication and posted on its website pr ovides additional comments regarding the ddg1 000 and ddg51 as well as information about the r eadiness of the ddg1000 design to enter production the letter stated i agree that the navys preliminary desi gn analysis for the next generation cruiser indicates that for the most cap able radar suites under consideration the ddg 1000 hull cannot support the radar this applies just as well to the ddg 51 hull however it is my understanding that engineering analysis shows that the existing ddg 1000 hull design can support significantly more capable radar suites than the existing ddg 51 hull design moreover while it is not possible to quickly estimate the production cost of redesigned ddg 51 alternative i suspect that given the dense and complex nature of the ddg 51 hull ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs104 compared to that of the ddg 1000 hull the cost of redesigned ddg 51 very likely will be equal to or gr eater than th at of ddg 1000 your letter also warns that cost overruns for the ddg 1000 program might cripple the navys shipbuilding programs i am equally concerned that restarting the ddg 51 program would pose risk to the shipbuilding budget and inject additional cost for the following reasons direct production hours for one ddg 1000 ship are about 25 times that of one ddg 51 restart ship this validates dods experience that two to three ddg 51 destroyers need to be purch ased annually to sustain the production workload base for two surface combatant shipyards that number of ddg 51 ships costs more per year than one ddg 1000 follow ship the cost per year for modified ddg 51 ships would be even higher several ship and vendor base issues including equipment obsolescence main reduction gears config uration change issues and restart of production lines would need to be resolv ed in order to award and construct additional ddg 51 class ships the costs for the two ddg 1000 ships wold increase if that program is truncated to only two ships there will be program shutdow n costs for the ddg 1000 program if the program is truncated to only two ships the research development st evaluation efforts for the ddg 1000 program must continue in order to deliver two complete lead ships and to support the dual band radar for the cvn 21 program in reference to your concern that th ere is joint requirements oversight council jroc or us marine corps re quirement for fire support that can only be provided by the ddg 1000 the jroc validated the operational requirements document ord for the ddg 1000 program the ord includes requirement to provide precise and sustained nava l fires at extended ranges the ddg 1000 with its advanced gun system firing the long range land attack projectile is the only ship that can achieve that validated requirement i remain convinced that the ddg 1000 program is poised for proper execution unlike ddg 51 lpd 17 and lcs where the level of concurrent design development and construction were critical flaws leading to significant cost increases on the lead ships the ddg 1000 program benefits from early technology maturation and experienced desi gn team using mature design tool proven production processes and other factors as outlined below design drawing status ddg 1000 is significantly more mature in detail design than was lpd 17 or ddg 51 at the same points in the program for example at the time of the detail design and construction ddc contract award ddg 1000 detail design products were 55 percent complete compared to 0 percent for lpd 17 and ddg 51 at the start of fabrication ddg 1000 detail design products will be approximately 8085 percent complete compared to 20 percent for ddg 51 and 2030 percent for the two lcs designs while design products for the lpd 17 were also in the 80 percent complete range at the start of fabrication this came about only after long delay to fix and prove the design tool during the detail design phase lesson learned and avoided for the ddg 1000 program initial module construction the jointly developed design of ddg 1000 is on schedule to be more mature than any previous shipbuilding programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32109crs105 135 source
