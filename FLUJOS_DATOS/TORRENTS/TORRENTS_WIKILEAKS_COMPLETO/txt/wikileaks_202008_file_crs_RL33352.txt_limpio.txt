in american national government government and finance division telework centers and federal continuity of operations planning summary telework the officially sanctioned practice of federal employees working some of the time away from their traditional offices has gained renewed attention following hurricanes katrina and rita and concern about potential avian flu pandemic federal agencies coping with hurricane devastation and disruption of operations in the gulf coast region are reviewing overall continuity of operations coop planning to prepare for possible future catastrophic events telework centers may play role in such plans the general services administration gsa created its first telework centers in 1993 to serve as alternative locations in which federal staff could work away from their main offices currently gsa sponsors network of 14 telework centers in the washington dc metropolitan area thirteen formal federal coop agreements have been established with the gsasponsored telework centers which have emerged as component of coop planning in the event federal buildings are shut down as mandated by congress and authorized by federal agencies the number of federal teleworkers has increased over time federal employees who telework usually do so at home or at gsa telework center this report briefly discusses telework and federal coop planning recent legislative actions and focuses on the role of gsa telework centers as an element of coop planning it will be updated as events warrant for more comprehensive examination of the telework issue see crs report

working some of the time away from the traditional office has been promoted in the public and private sectors as benefit to both employees and organizations cited telework benefits include reductions in traffic congestion fuel consumption pollution and transportation costs other suggested benefits include increased productivity reduction in stress and time saved in commuting however telework may not be suitable for all employees or all work in federal agencies due to the nature of the work performance problems or main office coverage requirements there may also be situations where distractions at the offsite location make the delineation between home and work difficult or the alternative location lacks all the office amenities eg technology and access to subscription databases necessary to perform the employees work2 following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and the anthrax attacks soon thereafter telework gained renewed attention in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita and concern about potential avian flu pandemic federal agencies are reviewing continuity of operations coop planning to prepare for future emergency situations these emergencies could include catastrophic terrorist attacks natural disasters public health crises or civil unrest that could result in evacuations and federal building shutdowns this report will briefly discuss telework in the federal government and coop planning and then focus on the role of the general services administration gsa sponsored telework centers as an element in coop planning telework telework in the federal government has developed in stages during the past 15 years often at the prompting of congress 1 telework has also been be referred to as telecommuting flexiplace or use of alternative work sites in addition to working at home and telework centers teleworkers have conducted work at hotels libraries and internet cafes 2 for more comprehensive look at telework in the federal government including the benefits and limitations of telework see crs report rl30863 telework in the federal government background policy and oversight by lorraine h tong and barbara l schwemle crs2 in 1990 congress authorized federal agencies to spend federal funds during fy1991 to pay for telephone lines related equipment and monthly fees in the homes of teleworkers participating in telework pilot program3 five years later this authorization was made permanent4 provision in the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 which included funding for the department of transportation5 provided that for fiscal year 1999 and each fiscal year thereafter of the funds made available to each executive agency for salaries and expenses at minimum 50000 shall be available only for the necessary expenses of the executive agency to carry out flexiplace work telecommuting program in october 2000 congress enacted legislation that included provision authored by representative frank wolf requiring each executive agency to establish policy under which eligible employees of the agency may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance the provision also required the director of the office of personnel management opm to provide that the requirements of this section are applied to 25 percent of the federal workforce and to an additional 25 percent of such workforce each year thereafter6 the october 2000 legislation also required opm to conduct an annual survey of federal agencies implementation of telework7 opms 2004 survey containing responses from 82 of 86 agencies surveyed published in december 2005 indicates that the federal telework program has grown substantially in recent years in 2004 752337 of the 17 million federal employees in the 82 agencies were eligible to telework up from 521542 employees eligible in 2001 the reported number of federal employees who actually teleworked nearly doubled during this period from 72844 in 20018 to 140694 3 pl 101509 sec 624 4 pl 10452 sec 620 5 pl 105277 title iv sec 630 6 pl 106346 sec 359 7 opm compiled fiscal year data for fy1999 through fy2003 the reporting period was changed from fiscal to calender year beginning in 2004 therefore the 2004 survey issued in dec 2005 covers the period jan 2004 to dec 2004 8 the opm 2001 telework survey released in jan 2002 is based on responses from 63 agencies part of the increase may be due to the greater number of agencies 82 reporting in 2004 crs3 in 2004 in fact the reported number of federal teleworkers increased 37 in the previous year up from 102921 in 20039 those developments notwithstanding congress continued to press agencies to expand telework opportunities the consolidated appropriations act of 2005 withheld 5 million in appropriations from the departments of commerce justice and state the judiciary the securities and exchange commission and the small business administration unless they could certify within two months of enactment of the act that telework opportunities were available to 100 of their eligible workforces10 the act also required each of these departments or agencies to provide quarterly reports to the appropriations committees on the status of their telework programs and required them to designate telework coordinators to oversee the implementation of the telework programs in september 2005 the government accountability office gao reviewed these departments and agencies certifications reported that they lacked consistent methodologies and measures and recommended that congress determine ways to promote more consistent definitions and measures related to telework11 the fy2006 science state justice commerce and related agencies appropriations act again withheld 5 million from the departments of commerce justice and state the securities and exchange commission and the small business administration unless they certified within two months of the enactment of the legislation that they had increased the number of eligible teleworkers over the 2005 levels the act also withheld 5 million in funds from the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation unless within the same time limit they certified that they had made telework opportunities available to 100 of their eligible workforces12 language in the conference report included the conferees expectation that these entities will address the gao recommendation mentioned above concerning standards and consistency in identifying and reporting participation of telework eligible employees and provide information on their progress in the quarterly reports these departments and agencies are also expected 9 us

shortly thereafter managers at federal agencies began to take fresh look at telework as way to maintain operations during emergencies subsequently many federal agencies have begun to integrate telework into their coop planning in 2003 opm identified emergency planning as one of the key elements in its strategic focus opms report on its 2003 telework survey stated telework is essential for agencies emergency planning whether for snowstorms natural disasters or terrorist events for an agency to be effective in an emergency solid telework program must be in place before the event17 the following year in 2004 opm and gsa began making visits to federal agencies to strengthen the connection between telework and coop planning the opm report on the 2004 telework survey indicated that 35 agencies had incorporated telework as part of their coop initiatives and another 38 were considering including telework in their coop plans18 on april 28 2005 the house committee on government reform held hearings on whos watching the coop reexamination of federal agencies continuity of operations plans19 at that hearing committee chairman tom davis said it is imperative that we incorporate telework into our governments continuity planning also in april 2005 opm reported the results of its emergency preparedness survey which asked agencies if they were prepared for natural disaster all 85 agencies surveyed responded in the affirmative the survey indicated that more than 60 of these agencies utilized telework arrangements as an emergency preparedness tool with 576 having prearranged agreements to transfer work to other agency locations and 635 with telework capability in place from home or telework centers20 gsa telework centers although teleworking most commonly involves working from home some employees cannot or choose not to telework from home eg because of lack of needed equipment or software distractions or combination of these reasons telework center is facility that provides an alternative office setting that is closer to an employees home and would reduce travel time between home and the office center generally offers professional environment equipped with office furnishings technology equipment and onsite technical assistance for employees to perform their work 16 continued circular 65 17 us office of personnel management the status of telework in the

other organizations eg universities to staff and operate the centers and the directors of the centers are affiliated with these organizations gsa has statutory authority to establish the telework centers and to provide funding to acquire lease and equip the centers21 in maryland the telework centers are located in bowie frederick hagerstown laurel prince frederick and waldorf in virginia the centers are located in fairfax herndon manassas fredericksburg stafford woodbridge and winchester there is also center in kearneysville west virginia figure 1 shows the locations of the centers

the 14 telework centers are gsasponsored in addition to the information about the centers on the gsa and opm websites the directors of the gsa telework centers have created metropolitan washington telework centers website that provides information and links to the centers available at httpwwwwmtcorg also listed on this website is another center called the executive office club private corporation that is not sponsored by gsa but that makes its facilities available to federal and private teleworkers crs7 background the first gsasponsored telework centers were established in 1993 and were intended to help alleviate poor air quality and traffic congestion problems and to promote more familyfriendly workplace representatives steny hoyer and frank wolf drafted legislation to provide 5 million to fund three telework centers in the washington dc metropolitan area this funding was included in the fy1993 treasurypostal appropriations act23 the telework center in winchester virginia was the first center to open the following year congress passed legislation24 adding 1 million to fund the centers removing one center from maryland and adding two centers one in hagerstown maryland25 and another in fredericksburg virginia four more centers were established between october 1993 and may 199426 additional gsasponsored telework centers were established in the late 1990s and now there are total of 14 centers27 other federal telework centers have been temporarily established outside the washington metropolitan area to help cope with emergency situations eg after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in oklahoma city and the 1994 earthquake in northridge california28 there have been other instances when gsa has worked with local communities in different regions of the country to provide guidance in creating telework centers but they were not gsafunded or sponsored centers29 facilities equipment security and amenities according to gsa the telework centers provide professional environment and stateoftheart office equipment and telecommunications technologies 23 pl 102393 106 stat 1745 24 pl 103123 107 stat 1241 25 earlier preliminary telework center was established at the hagerstown junior college although gsa and hagerstown worked with the private sector on this center it was not an official federal initiative 26 dr wendell joice the evolution of telework in the federal government us general services administration feb 2000 p 25 hereafter cited as joice the evolution of telework in the federal government 27 according to gsa officials the telework centers were established as pilot program and the centers are still technically considered pilots gsa notes that before programs can be evaluated there must be adequate implementation the level of usage and participation necessary for complete evaluation and establishment of refined model of the centers has not yet been achieved 28 joice the evolution of telework in the federal government p 26 29 number of commercial enterprises offer facilities similar to the gsa telework centers they are not affiliated with gsa and are not subject to free trials and other government funding further information about these private corporations is available at httpwwwofficesuitespluscom httpwwwabcncom and httpwwwreguscom gsa does not sponsor the us department of agriculture

bring in their own laptop computers to use at the centers or use the centers equipment the workstations are equipped with many of the same security measures that exist at federal agency headquarters eg firewalls antivirus software and virtual private networks the centers also make available personal storage space with locks after business hours access to the centers can be gained with card key31 fees and usage fees for using telework center vary somewhat depending on its location and size as of december 2005 most of the maryland and virginia telework centers charged fulltime teleworkers employers between 500 and 545 per month however the west virginia center charged 770 per month and the woodbridge virginia center charged 980 the fee charged for one day week per month at most maryland and virginia centers was between 100 and 109 while the west virginia center charged 154 and the woodbridge virginia center charged 19632 most teleworkers average one day per week and only handful work four or five days per week from the centers although some federal agencies limit telework to one day week they have the flexibility of negotiating short or longterm arrangements for their employees processing the necessary agency paperwork to begin use of center takes approximately 30 days or longer according to gsa the telework centers are currently operating at approximately 60 of capacity with federal employees making up 95 of total teleworkers and the remaining percentage from the private sector opm and gsa officials said reasons agencies have cited for not using the telework centers have included concerns about the cost of using the centers some teleworkers preference to work from home and the distance of the centers from employees homes33 30 information is from the washington metropolitan telework centers website available at httpwwwwmtcorgtelework_informationhtmllink4 31 information is based on telephone conversations with gsa telework analysts on oct 3 2005 32 fees for the telework centers are listed on the us general services administration website available at httpwwwgsagov 33 information is based on several telephone conversations with gsa telework analysts in oct 2005 and opm annual telework reports crs9 in 1999 the six agencies with the largest numbers of employees working at the centers were the department of defense 128 gsa 68 and the departments of transportation 47 agriculture 29 treasury 23 and health and human services 10 in comparison in 2004 the top six agencies were the departments of defense 125 commerce 42 agriculture 36

peaked in 2002 when 459 employees from 20 agencies used the centers since then the number of participating agencies has remained constant but the number of individual users has declined the greatest drop in use occurred between 2003 and 2004 when the number of individual users declined by 49 from 435 to 386 table 1 federal agency telework center users and fees 1999 2004 number of number of year

congress status of telework in the federal government us office of personnel management available at httpwwwteleworkgovdocumentsasp opm compiled data for fiscal years from 1990 through 2003 in 2004 the data collected were changed from fiscal to calendar year jan 2004 to dec 2004 in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita gsa witnessed spike in inquiries from agencies and private sector organizations from different regions of the country expressing interest in possibly setting up similar telework centers or inquiring about the possibility of partnering with gsa similar increase in inquiries had occurred earlier immediately following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the anthrax threats shortly thereafter according to gsa in the past few years inquiries did not translate into significant numbers of new teleworkers signing up and continuing to use the centers after the initial strong interest the interest waned until crs10 the next crisis or catastrophic event34 gsa currently has plans to establish additional telework centers35 free trial and open houses because the telework centers have not been operating at full capacity gsa and the centers have increased their marketing efforts to promote greater use in addition to numerous methods of advertising directed at attracting federal agencies interest gsa has provided federal employees with several opportunities to work at the centers free of charge to their agencies the latest free trial period began on september 7 2005 and ended on december 31 2005 employees already teleworking at the centers were able to increase their number of days at the centers without additional charges36 during the trial period 81 new federal teleworkers worked at the centers an average of two days per week and 27 teleworkers who were already using the centers increased the number of days working there by an average of one day per week37 opms 2004 telework survey found that previous 60day free trial of the telework centers conducted in 2004 had similar result attracting 35 new federal teleworkers including those from seven new agencies after the trial period 24 of the 35 teleworkers continued to use the centers several times during the year various telework centers hold open houses to attract more teleworkers38 continuity of operations coop agreements the 14 gsasponsored telework centers currently have 13 formal agreements in place to reserve total of 130 workstations with various federal agencies as part of their coop strategy the centers normally accommodate total of 340 workstations but other facility space ie the conference rooms could be converted quickly to accommodate more teleworkers in coop situation39 for coop purposes the cost of reservations for each workstation ranges by location from 1000 to 1500 annually the cost of actually using the workstations during coop emergency 34 since the anthrax attacks in 2001 there have been other instances of emergency building shutdowns and evacuations due to concerns about possible anthrax attacks eg there were three incidents of suspected anthrax contamination at department of defense mail facilities in march 2005 testing did not indicate the presence of anthrax at the three locations in some cases employees could not return to their workplaces for days while testing was conducted 35 information is based on telephone conversations with gsa telework analysts on oct 6 2005 36 current users were obligated to pay for the days they had already reserved prior to the free trial offer 37 data provided by the director of the southern maryland telecommuting centers via mail on jan 20 2006 data are available yet on how many teleworkers who participated in the trial will continue working at the centers 38 see open house schedules at washington metropolitan telework centers website available at httpwwwwmtcorgwmtcopenhousehtml 39 information is as of dec 12 2005 further details about the participating agencies and the coop agreements were provided for security reasons crs11 would be prorated calculations would be based on the amount of time spent working at the centers in accordance with the gsaapproved fee schedule40 in the event of governmentwide coop situation those federal employees directed to work at the telework centers could have an opportunity to interact with their counterparts from other agencies also working at the centers such an opportunity could be useful in facilitating communication and coordination among federal agencies and provide an ad hoc interagency coop center recent legislative actions regarding telework and coop hurricanes katrina and rita caused serious disruption to the ability of the gulf regions oil refineries to supply gasoline and natural gas41 congress and the bush administration42 took action to address possible gasoline shortages with number of initiatives including encouraging greater use of telework various members of congress continue to express interest in and support for telework in september 15 2005 letter to president bush representative wolf urged the administration to make telework priority to improve continuity of operations after katrina he called the gsa free offer to federal employees to try telework centers an important step forward in promoting telework representative wolf also stated telecommuting has proven benefits not only for continuity of operations but also energy savings air quality employee productivity and employee cost savings in short telework is winner all around as the nations largest employer the federal government should be the model for telework for every level of government as well as the private sector43 on september 21 2005 telework coordinators44 from federal executive agencies and the judiciary held their quarterly meeting with session focused on coop hosted by opm and gsa federal emergency management agency fema representatives and the director of the southern maryland telecommuting centers were among the opm and gsa panelists leading the discussion on coop planning at the meeting agencies were encouraged to seek fema guidance for coop planning and gsa 40

the first quarterly telework coordinators meeting on nov 5 2002 attendance at the meetings continues to be high now averaging 70 attendees crs12 highlighted the use of telework centers and the offer for agencies to try the centers free of charge from september 7 2005 through december 31 200545 on november 16 2005 representative jon porter chairman of the house government reform subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization held hearing to examine the efforts of agencies and corporations to help workers cope with gasoline price volatility after the hurricanes caused oil supply disruption representative wolf and representative jim moran both testified on the merits of telework to reduce fuel consumption traffic congestion pollution and transportation costs for employees issues of productivity family friendly policies and telework as coop component were also briefly raised during the hearing committee chairman tom davis also attended the hearing to express his support for telework on may 11 2006 representative danny k davis introduced hr 536646 the continuity of operations demonstration project act the bill would establish program to enhance the governments coop capability in the event of an extended emergency situation under the bill the chief human capital officers council47 and the interagency continuity of operations working group48 would be jointly charged to provide for demonstration project under which two or more agencies would perform range of government essential and nonessential services and operations to test employees ability to work from home or alternative sites away from their usual duty stations for period of not less than 10 consecutive working days the council and the working group would be required to submit to the house government reform committee and the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee report evaluating the project later than 12 months after enactment of the legislation the bill was referred to the house government reform committee but further action was taken on the bill before the 109th congress adjourned issues for consideration the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the subsequent anthrax threats catastrophic natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita and the threat of flu pandemic have prompted number of federal agencies to reexamine existing coop policies and to improve refine and test procedures for the immediate short and long term telework has emerged as one component of strategic and 45 on sept 2 2005 opm director linda m springer issued memorandum to heads of departments and agencies to urge renewed efforts by federal agencies and departments to increase the use of telework carpooling and public transportation by employees for the memorandum see httpwwwchcocgovtransmittal_detailcfmid662 46 this bill was similar to hr 4797 legislation rep danny davis sponsored in the 108th congress action was taken on that bill 47 established by the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 sec 1302 the 25member council comprises the director of the office of personnel management opm who serves as chairman the deputy director for management of

crs13 comprehensive coop planning many federal agencies have formulated coop planning and procedures and most of them have established or are in the process of setting up alternative work locations for emergency preparedness and disaster recovery many agencies already have implemented active telework policies and have incorporated telework centers as part of their emergency preparedness and disaster recovery policies others are exploring integration of the telework centers as part of their coop strategy telework centers may not however be suitable for some federal agencies as component of their coop planning for various reasons such reasons may include the centers locations size and layout additional security arrangements and special technology critical to certain agencies especially during coop situations may not be available at the centers other reasons the centers may not be viable alternative may be that some agencies have already committed resources for alternative locations or that some agencies may prefer an environment solely operated by and under their authority and control strategic planning for telework center use if an agency chooses to test the viability of telework centers as coop component the agency might take number of preliminary and intermediate steps for example it might consider the following providing agency employees who have been identified as essential personnel an opportunity to work at the centers on limited basis providing agency employees who live in close proximity to telework centers an opportunity to work at the centers on limited basis when agencies are not using all of their allocated funding for telework center use rotating employees from different job positions to work at the telework centers on very limited basis thus over time more and more staff will have had at least one days work experience at an alternative site training employees to be efficient and effective teleworkers at the centers andor other locations refining contingency policies and procedures and conducting drillsexercises for teleworkers to work at the centers with little or notice to respond to different kinds of emergencies encouraging all employees who have worked at the telework centers to provide feedback on their experiences and evaluate the information and creating task force comprising telework coordinators information technology specialists managers and teleworkers who have used the centers or other offsite locations to recommend whether or how to use the telework centers and to provide oversight in addition such task force could conduct comparative analysis of the experiences of teleworkers who use the centers with the experiences of those who crs14 telework at home or elsewhere and apply any lessons to the agencys telework and coop policies federal agencies have reacted with heightened interest in telework centers as possible component of coop planning in the aftermath of disasters and emergencies however research49 showed that such interest diminished over time until the next catastrophic event proponents of telework maintain that strategic planning and vigilance in refining emergency policies and procedures to prepare rather than react would strengthen agencies response to and recovery from any future disasters 49 research conducted includes discussions with gsa telework specialists and other telework analysts for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33352
