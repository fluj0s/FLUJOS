complexities of the copyright acts provisions concerning music licensing in the digital age copyright law provides protection for original works of authorship by conferring certain exclusive rights upon their creators music is an example of kind of literary and artistic work that falls squarely within the scope of copyright law the realm of music copyright is characterized by two types of copyright holders the holder of the musical work and the holder of the sound recording the musical work copyright holder is typically the one who composes the piece of music the sound recording copyright holder is the recorder of rendition of the musical work if third party wants to use copyrighted work in particular way he or she must seek permission from the copyright holder however for holders of copyrights in musical works and sound recordings three of their rights distribution reproduction and public performance may be subject to form of permission called licensing licenses vary according to the type of user and the type of use when the copyright law creates compulsory license for particular use of copyrighted work the parties need not negotiate the right to use the work if the type of use or type of user does not qualify for the compulsory license the parties must negotiate voluntarily its availability and the specific terms of use the musical work copyright holder is subject to compulsory license for the reproduction or distribution of mechanical copies of the work including digital copies that come within the finition of digital phonorecord delivery dpd the compulsory license is seldom used however because many music publishers authorize the harry fox agency to issue licenses on their behalf public performance of musical work is typically licensed through performing rights organization such as ascap or bmi the licensing system behind nondigital music differ s from that of digital music whenever user reproduces or distributes nondigital or digital phonorecord the sound recording copyright holder and musical work copyright holder are both entitled to payment whenever user publicly performs phonorecord via nondigital transmission authorization from only the musical work copyright holder is needed however if the phonorecord is publicly performed through digital audio transmission both the musical work copyright holder and the sound recording copyright holder have right to receive royalties more comprehensive understanding of music licensing requires familiarity with the digital performance right in sound recordings act dprsra the digital millennium copyright act dmca and the audio home recording act ahr these laws amend the copyright act to among other things refine the scope of licensing for both types of copyright holders the copyright act also sets forth several exem ptions from infringement liability for certain unauthorized uses including the fair use doctrine 17 usc 107 and limitations on the public performance right under specific situations 17 usc 110 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33631g5g152g153g162g155g146g144g145g157g561g14g146g140g142g151g156g146g151 g144g561g146g151g561 g15g158g156g146g140g561

essential frank sinatra collection contains the song ive got you under my skin while sinatra fans may know the words and the melody how many of those fans understand the compensation structure behind this particular song the answer is probably very few the public may know that the proceeds of any given song fl ow to the record company and to the recording artist however the compensation structure is actually more complex and involves more parties than just the recording artist and the record label further there are increasingly steady pressures economic and otherwise that the compensation scheme for music be dynamic to adapt to frequent changes in music delivery methods for instance how consumers purchase and listen to music has undergone significant changes in the last 15 years with the advent of the computer and digital music deliveries thus advancing technology has an important role in further complicating the music compensation regime appreciating the intricacies of music compensation requires an understanding of the development of copyright law what follows is an explanation of the music licensing provisions of copyright law and why enforcing rights to song like ive got you under my skin can sound so complex g22g145g142g561g15g158g156g146g140g561g5g152g153g162g155g146g144g145g157g156g561

clause of the us constitution which authorizes congress to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries 1 copyright refers to the exclusive rights granted by law to authors for the protection of original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression2 original works must be captured in some form beyond transitory duration the types of original works eligible for copyright protection include literary musical dramatic and pictorial works motion pictures and sound recordings3 copyright is based on authorship and exists separate and apart from its physical embodiment for example if person purchases collection of books or records the purchaser owns those particular material objects but not the rights afforded to the copyright holder the rights conferred on copyright holders do not last forever copyrights are limited in the number of years that copyright holders may exercise their exclusive rights an author of work may enjoy copyright protection for the term of his or her life plus 70 additional years 4 at the 1 us const art i 8 cl 8 2

domain works in the public domain are available for anyone to use without fear of infringement the unauthorized use of copyrighted work constitutes infringement of the particular exclusive right at issue unless the action is permitted by statutory exception such as fair use for limited purposes5 in the realm of music there are two types of c opyright the musical work copyright and the sound recording copyright each of these copyrights confers particular set of rightssome exclusive to particular copyright holder to understand these rights one must first comprehend the difference between the two different copyright holders g22g145g142g561g15g158g156g146g140g138g149g561g25g152g155g148g561 musical work is lyrical andor notational composition of song transcribed on material object such

the terms sound recording and phonorecord sound recording is an original work of authorship that results from the fixation6 of series of musical spoken or other sounds in tangible medium of expression7 the sound recording copyright protects the elements of original authorship expressed in particular recorded rendition phonorecord is the actual physical object from which the sound recording can be perceived reproduced or communicated directly or with machines aid8 examples of phonorecords include compact discs vinyl albums and mp3format digital music files holder of sound recording copyright is typically recording artist or the recording artists record label9 g3g151g561g7g161g138g150g153g149g142g497g561g18g138g155g157g561g17g151g142g561 different rights attach to different uses and expressions of copyrighted work the convergence of copyright interests in sound recording is prime illustration using the example of cole porters 5 17 usc 107 this and other exceptions to infringement liability will be discussed infra 6 fixed work is one in tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in copy or phonorecord by or under the authority of the author is sufficiently permanent or st able to permit it to be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated for period of more than transitory duration 17 usc 101 fixation is an example of the many terms of art that the copyright act frequently employs these terms often have meanings that differ from ordinary usage in everyday language the copyright lawspecific terms of art that are pertinent to the topics discussed in this report are defined in various footnotes or in the body text for easier reference they are also arranged in glossary at the end of this report 7 id 8 id 9 sound recording copyright holder eg recording artist or record label could also hold copyright in the musical work as well for clarity and convenience this report addresses these music copyright holders as separate entities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33631g5g152g153g162g155g146g144g145g157g561g14g146g140g142g151g156g146g151 g144g561g146g151g561 g15g158g156g146g140g561

nondigital settings sound recording copyright holders have legal entitlement to control the performance of their works by non digital means one consequence of this lack of right is that terrestrial radio stations am and fm stations that broadcast sound recordings throug h analog means need not compensate recording artists or record labels or otherwise obtain their prior permission in order to perform the work to the public whereas all radio stations must compensate musical work copyright holders when the songs they have written are broadcast however transmissions of music by digital means for example by internet radio broadcasters webcasters or cable and satellite radio broadcasters would trigger the performance right for the musical work copyright holder and the sound recording copyright holder thus both copyright holders would have the right to receive royalties for performance made by digital audio transmission 14

exclusivity allows copyright holder to exercise particular rights for the sole benefit of the holder however copyright holder may confer these rights onto other users through permission in some circumstances statutes allow use by others under specified compensation scheme permission is often granted in the form of license in the context of copyright license permits third party to do something with copyrighted work that implicates copyright holders exclusive right possibly for fee without concern of infringing the copyright holders rights some licenses are negotiated instruments between copyright holder and third party referred to as voluntary licenses other licenses are created by statute statutory licenses are instruments that compel copyright holders to allow others to exercise holders rights without negotiated permission in copyright law these are commonly referred to as compulsory licenses when 14 the performance rights act introduced in the 110th congress hr 4789

rights are essential in the music licensing context the reproduction right the distribution right and the public performance right the right of reproduction is the right to duplicate transcribe imitate or simulate work in fixed form in the context of music copyrights the right of reproduction authorizes the copying of musical works eg duplicating sheet music or sound recordings infringement of these rights would be the unlawful copying of the copyrighted work the right of distribution establishes the right to distribute copies or phonorecords of copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending 16 in the context of music copyrights the right of distributi on permits the sale of copies sheet music or phonorecords sound recordings to

work either directly or by means of any device or process18 public performance not only covers the initial rendition but also any further act by which the rendition is transmitted or communicated to the public in the context of music copyrights the public performance right allows promotion and performance of the music infringement of this right would be the public performance of copyrighted work

to make copies of work21 the court ruled that the rolls were not copies of musical compositions but rather component parts of player piano machine22 hence there was infringement of the composers copyright23 through legislation congress overturned white smith in 1909 by granting to musical work copyright holders the right to control the mechanical24 reproduction of their works25 as consequence piano rolls would be infringements of the musical composition copyright however piano roll companies could still acquire the rights to make the rolls from musical work holders to prevent monopolization by large manufacturer of piano rolls congress subjected the mechanical reproduction right to compulsory license allowing any manufacturer of piano rolls to mechanically reproduce musical work in exch ange for payment of royalty fee without negotiating with the copyright holder for permission thus the compulsory license for the reproduction of musical works is commonly referred to as mechanical license section 115 of the copyright act of 1976 as amended is the current authority for compulsory license or statutory mechanical license for reproduction and distribution of musical works26 the license protects the musical work copyright holders right to control certain reproductions of the work eg copying the sheet music but permits the recording of song by third party on mechanical media such as piano roll or record27 in its present form it essentially allows reproduction of musical compositions that may be heard with the aid of mechanical device28 the mechanical license is validly obtained only after musical work has been initially distributed publicly under the authority of the copyright holder the license is authorized when the licensees recipient or user primary purpose is to distribute the work publicly for private use currently the mechanical license rate is 91 cents for songs 5 minutes or less or 175 cents per minute or fraction thereof for songs over 5 minutes whichever is greater 29 although the 115 mechanical license compensates the musical work copyright holder for reproduction and distribution rights it does not authorize the duplication of sound recording 30 20 piano rolls are cylinder rolls with perforations that mechanically cause notes to be played on selfplaying pianos id at 910 21 id at 9 22 id at 12 23 id 24 the term mechanical

works31 in 1927 the national music publishers company nmpc32 created the harry fox agency hfa to issue and administer mechanical licenses currently most mechanical licenses are obtained through hfa because there is reduction in the transaction costs offered by hfa although hfa has the right to authorize licenses only for musical works it represents hfa represents 27000 music publishers which

1909 copyright act congress granted musical works copyright holders the right to control the public performance of their works34 the 1909 act further recognized public performance right but limited the right only to performances engaged in for profit35 not until 1976 was the forprofit limitation removed despite possessing the right to control public performance musical work copyright holders had difficulty in collecting licensing fees for performances this problem was alleviated by the creation of performing rights organizations pros in 1914 group of nine music business leaders established the american society of composers authors and publishers ascap36 ascap licenses thousands of musical compositions for public performances under blanket license agreements 37 for business owners these blanket licenses significantly reduce the transaction costs involved in complying with the requirements of the copyright act for musical work copyright holders these licenses allow receipt of share of the royalties that were previously not of much value due to ascaps attempt to raise the royalty rates charged to radio stations broadcast music inc bmi became new pro in 193938 the society for european stage authors and composers 31 indeed the copyright royalty judges have acknowledged this anomaly virtually one uses section 115 to license reproductions of musical works the judges are therefore seemingly tasked with setting rates and terms of useless license the testimony in this proceeding makes clear however that despite its disuse the section 115 license exerts ghostintheattic like effect on all those who live below it thus the rates and terms that we set today will have considerable impact on the private agreements that enable copyright users to clear the rights for

differ analog technology is characterized by an output system where the signal output is always proportional to the signal input because the outputs are analogous the word analog is used basically an analog mechanism is one where data is represented by continuously variable physical quantities like sound waves or electricity in the context of music analog technologies refer to traditional radio cassettes and vinyl among others these technologies may deliver imprecise signals and background noise thus the duplication of analog music often erodes in quality over time the term digital derives from the word digit as in counting device digital services represent data in binary using 1s and 0s fashion rather than physical quantity digital signal is an informational stream of code that tells computer to compile perfect replica of the original code stream this means the digital code can be duplicated nearly infinitely and without any degradation of quality in the context of musi c compact discs and mp3format song files are examples of digital music

caused sound recording copyright holders to fear that the ability to make perfect copies of music and the ease of distribution would damage revenues from record sales in 1995 congress enacted the digital performance right in sound recordings act45 dprsra to fill the void in legislation fo r the protection of copyrighted works that are digitally transmitted over the internet the dprsra addresses the licensing of digital reproduction and distribution of music works and the digital performance and distribution of sound recordings traditionally only public performances of musical works were eligible for performance royalties the dprsra created public performance right for sound recordings performed through digital audio transmissions thereby establishing mechanism for controlling digital deliveries that posed threat to the sales of cds because sound recording copyright holders do not have general public performance right the dprsra established an actionable right in digital audio transmissions for sound recorders46 44 although 116 refers only to the copyright holders ability to negotiate common agents such as pros may negotiate on behalf of owners for the voluntary license 45 pl 10439 109 stat 336 1995 46 17 usc 101 defines to transmit performance as to communicate performance by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the pl ace from

under the language of 115 prior to the dprsra each distributed mechanical copy of musical work entitled the musical work copyright holder to royalty payment47 the dprsra amended the statute to encompass digital downloads under the mechanical license the copyright act refers to digital downloads as digital phonorecord deliveries or dpds dpd is each individual delivery of phonorecord by digital transmission of sound recording which results in specifically identifiable reproduction48 thus downloaded digital file of phonorecord is dpd in addition to dpds the 115 mechanical license distinguishes different royalty rate for dpds where the reproduction or distribution of phonorecord is incidental to the transmission which constitutes dpd49 however realtime transmissions where reproduction of sound recording is made for the purposes of the transmission does not constitute dpd 50 because of this exclusion streamed transmission is not considered dpd notwithstanding this statutory distinct ion however in may 2008 musicians publishers record labels and hightech companies reached an agreement that proposed for the first time ever to establish royalty rates and terms covering limited downloads such as those offered by online music subscription services interactive streaming and all known incidental dpds51 under the settlement agreement that was submitted to the copyright royalty judges in the form of draft regulations limited download and interactive streaming service providers would pay mechanical royalty of 105 of revenue minus any amounts owed for performance royalties 52 in november 2008 the copyright royalty judges adopted these rates and terms as final regulations pursuant to its statutory authority under section 801b7 of the copyright act53 also in the same rate determination proceeding the copyright royalty judges announced that the mechanical license is available not only for physical music products such as cds and records and dpds such as from itunes or amazoncom but also for ringtones 54 the decision to include ringtones came after the register of copyrigh t had issued memorandum opinion to the judges declaring that ringtones qualify as dpds55 the register cautioned however whether particular ringtone falls within the scope of the statutory license will depend primarily upon whether what is performed is simply the original musical work or portion 47 17 usc 115a1 48 17 usc 115d 49 17 usc 115c3c d 50 17 usc 115d 51 this settlement agreement was published in the federal register copyright royalty board library of congress

designed to codify licensing for certain performances conveyed via digital media including satellite radio73 and internet radio it renamed the subscription services covered in the dprsra as preexisting subscription services and created three additional categories of service that could operate under statutory license preexisting satellite digital radio services new subscription services eligible nonsubscription services74 the dmca also clarified the parameters of ephemeral recordingscopies made for the specific purpose of making licensed transmissionsand created statutory license for

the dmca non interactive nonsubscription service providers now must meet statutory eligibility requirements to avoid paying license fee for the public performance of digital sound recordings77 one affected group was small webcasters who argued that their nonsubscription noninteractive services should qualify as eligible nonsubscription transmissions and not be considered to fall within the

president bush signed into law the small webcaster settlement act swsa78 the act set specific royalty rates or fees but instead granted both small webcasters and copyright holders the right to enter into voluntary licensing agreements and permitted soundexchange the receiving agent designated in the earlier legislation to negotiate on behalf of the sound recording copyright holders79 negotiations between these parties permitted qualifying small webcasters to elect to pay royalties based on percentage of revenue or expenses rather than on persong perlistener basis however by swsas own terms its provisions were not to be considered in subsequent ratemaking proceedings by the copyright royalty board 80 as required by law on may 1 2007 the copyright royalty board announced new royalty rates for

into each device copyright protection technologya form of digital rights management scheme called the serial copying ma nagement system or scms which allows the copying of an original digital work but prevents the practice of serial copyingmaking copy from copy in exchange the ahra exempts consumers from copyright infringement liability for private noncommercial home recordings of music manufacturers of audio equipment sellers of digital recording devices and marketers of blank recordable media are also protected from infringement liability upon payment of the statutory royalty fee

of the public to make reasonable use of copyrighted material in special instances without the copyright holders consent for many years prior to the copyright act of 1976 fair use was judicially created exception to the exclusive rights of copyright holder to print publish copy and sell copyrighted work the 1976 act first codified the doctrine consistent with the treatment under case law prior to the act because the language of the fair use statute is illustrative determinations of fair use are often difficult to make in advance however the statute recognizes fair use for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship or research 98 determination of fair use considers four factors the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes the nature of the copyrighted work the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work99 the us supreme court has previously explained th at this fourfactor test cannot be simplified by brightline rules but rather that the doctrine of fair use calls for casebycase analysis100 in the context of digital music downloads and transmissions some alleged copyright infringers have attempted to use the doctrine of fair use to avoid liability for activities such as sampling101 space shifting102 and peertopeer file sharing103 these attempts have not been very successful 94 17 usc 11012 sections 1101 and 1102 apply to

music licensing act fmla to clarify the performance right exemptions for eligible establishments 111 the scope of the exemption is limited to performances intended to be received by the general public originated by radio or television broadcast station licensed as such by the federal communications commission or if an audiovisual transmission by cable system or satellite carrier112 the act covers transmissions embodying performances by food and drink establishments and by nonfood and drink establishments to be eligible for performance exemption under the fmla three criteria must be satisfied the first two criteria mirror those under the home receiving apparatus exemption there must be direct charge to hear the transmission and the transmission must not be further transmitted beyond the establishment where it is received 113 the third criterion states that the transmission must be licensed by the copyright owner of the work so publicly performed or displayed114 the latter criterion thus potentially creates liability if the transmitting entity the radio station itself broadcasts infringing content in such scenario the music copyright holder would likely bring suit against the infringing radio station rather than the establishment that played the radio 115 after the prior three criteria however the fmla provides even further specifications for the types and sizes of establishments that are eligible for the performance right exemption table 1 illustrates the specific qualifications t able 1 eligibility for p erformance ex emptions pursuant to 17 u sc 1105b type of
