from study only to more study and action orientation in 1992 with ratification of the framework convention on climate change unfccc the convention committed developed countries to aim at returning their greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000 the us decision to ratify the unfccc reflected both the nonbinding nature of the accord and analyses that suggested that the united states could achieve the necessary reduction at little or cost under the unfccc developed countries were to adopt national plans and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the united states submitted such plans in 1992 1994 1997 2002 and 2006 the energy policy act of 1992 epact has been the principal us statutory response to the unfccc primarily an energy policy response to the iraqi takeover of kuwait and the usled reaction epacts energy conservation renewable energy and other titles were also seen as having beneficial effect on global climate change concerns in addition the george hw bush and clinton administrations encouraged voluntary reductions by industry through administrative initiatives such as epas various green programs this largely voluntary approach to complying with unfccc allowed the two administrations to implement climate change policy without having to ask congress for new authorities however the subsequent inability of nations including the united states to achieve reduction goals under the unfccc led to negotiations on the kyoto protocol which established mandatory limits on emissions for developed countries while the united states signed the protocol the clinton administration did not submit it to the sena which earlier had specified sres 98 that any such agreement had to include reductions by developing countries and must result in serious harm to the economy of the united states in 2001 the george w bush administration announced that it was abandoning the kyoto treaty process because of concerns about cost competitiveness and the comprehensiveness of the treaty with respect to third world countries and that it would focus on voluntary programs to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic activity also it launched sixnation asiapacific partnership to coordinate voluntary actions to address greenhouse gas emissions and in 2007 convened meeting of the major economies to discuss approaches to climate change the reluctance to adopt mandatory actions reflects concerns about costs if one believes that the costs of greenhouse gas reductions are modest action to reduce emissions poses little risk however if one perceives substantial costs from reducing carbon emissions the uncertainty about any benefits raises serious questions as to the prudence of such action this clash of perspectives is likely to ensure that costs remain pivotal issue along with scientific uncertainty as the climate change policy debate continues momentum for action may be accelerating the senate in 2005 passed sense of the senate resolution that congress should proceed with mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on greenhouse gases in the 110 th congress deliberations on

only to more study and action orientation in 1992 with ratification of the framework convention on climate change unfccc during the protracted deliberations on the unfccc the national academy of sciences nas released an influential report on global warming in the report entitled policy implications of greenhouse warming the nas stated the united states could reduce or offset its greenhouse gas emissions by between 10 and 40 percent of 1990 levels at low cost or at some net savings if proper policies are implemented1 the nass energy policy recommendations focused on increasing energy conservation and efficiency incorporating greenhouse warming as factor in future energy planning and studying and eventually implementing full social cost pricing of energy although widely publicized and promoted this premise was not sufficient for the us to commit to firm targets and time frames for carbon dioxide co 2 reductions as witnessed by the us negotiation and ratification of the unfccc2 driven by concerns about scientific uncertainty with respect to global climate the george h w bush administrationagainst the wishes of most environmentalists and some vocal members of congressrefused to commit to binding agreement to reduce the nations co 2 emissions by specific date the unfccc reflects this negotiating position of the united states and some other countries in that it calls for voluntary control measures senate floor debate on ratification of the treaty brought out concerns by some senators about the cost of compliance its impact on the countrys competitiveness and the comprehensiveness with respect to the developing countriesconcerns that were overcome because of the nonbinding nature of the reduction goals3 those arguing for more binding commitments argued that emissions controls coul d create jobs and enhance economic health and that emissions were an indicator of inefficiency as finally negotiated the objective of the convention is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concen trations in the atmosphere at level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system such level should be achieved with time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in sustainable manner 4 arguing that the developed country parties should take the lead in reducing emissions the convention states that developed countries shall aim toward returning their greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000 in line with this goal developed countries were to adopt national plans and policy options to mitigate climate change by reducing anthropogenic 1 national academy of sciences policy implications

been the principal statutory basis for programs making up the us response to the unfccc primarily crafted as an energy policy response to the iraqi takeover of kuwait and the usled response its energy conservation renewable energy and other titles were also seen as having beneficial effect on global climate change concerns being debated at this time in international circles in its 1992 submission to the unfccc the george h w bush administration listed 11 different titles of epact as extremely important to its overall strategy of reducing greenhouse gases 5 the aforementioned recommendations of the nas we re embodied in several sections of epact these sections included provisions to establish energyefficiency standards promote dissemination of energysaving information establish several national research and development programs related to deployment of energyefficiency technologies and authorize the department of energy doe to evaluate costeffective energy efficiency technologies in addition to these activities to improve energy efficiency epact includes separate title to incorporate global warming concerns in energy policy planning title xvi was designed to assist the government in making informed decisions on global warming by collecting analyzing and reporting information on climate change through doe activities included report on the various economic energy social environmental and competitive implications of reducing greenhouse gas emissions developing leastcost energy strategy designed to achieve the stabilization and eventual reduction in the generation of greenhouse gases creating director of climate change and developing an inventory of greenhouse gases and early reductions in such gases indeed the passage of epact was anticipated by its authors to stabilize or even reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at little cost in line with the 1991 nas report as stated by the house report the committee expects that if fully implemented hr 776 will result in substantial reduction in us greenhouse gas emissions relative to forecasted levels the bulk of these reductions result from the programs that will demonstrate and transfer advanced clean coal and renewable technologies abroad and from the domestic energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives the provisions on electric utilities alternatives fuels and coalbed methane are also significant

thus epact is silent on the nature of the problem on the need for an immediate response or whether the united states should take the lead in any such response but as table 1 shows epacts portfolio of domestic strategies and program optionstechnology developmenttransfer financial assistance to developing countries and leastcost solutionsclosely track the provisions of the unfccc with the authorization of these programs and activities epact effectively constitutes implementing legislation for the us commitment made in signing and ratifying the unfccc it should be noted however that typically the programs are relatively specific not broad authorizations that for many the benefit of reducing greenhouse gases is bonus in achieving other goals eg substantially reduce environmental pollutants including greenhouse gases sec 1608 and that in at least one case the act explicitly denies new authority ie this subsection does not provide any new data collection authority sec 1605a

adjusted fo r ch 4 at gwp of 22 basically the george h w bush administratio ns plan was compendium of what was then known about greenhouse gas emissions and of existing or planned domestic actions that affected those gases the primary reason for these actions were to conserve energy and to reduce air pollutionany global climate change benefits would be bonus thus exemplifying regretsthe action is one that is justified for other reasons the goal of the george h w bush plan was to present baseline that should assist in measuring and evaluating existing policies and measures and in establishing basis for future actions the plan expressly does not seek to identify or recommend additional policies and measures that might be taken underlying this approach it appeared was the presumption that uncertainties about global climate change were too great to justify actions beyond research except for socalled noregrets initiatives justifiable on other grounds such as selected energy conservation measures reflecting this attitude the george h w bush plan was explicit about number of uncertainties for example in using two estimates of the global warming potential gwp for methane additionally the george h w bush plan discussed adaptive measures before discussing mitigation measures

issued new plan the climate change action plan 11 this plan explicitly set goal of reducing us greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels in the year 2000 and laid out of series of nearly 50 program activities to achieve the goal including both enhancement of earlier programs and new mostly voluntary initiatives it was not submitted to the unfccc but was described as the core of forthcoming submission to meet the obligations of the convention in march 1994 the clinton administration issued technical supplement that documented the assumptions and parameters used in developing the supporting analysis for the plan 12 also in 1994 the clinton administration submitted its climate action report to the convention and revised version was submitted in 1997 philosophically the clinton action plans were similar to that developed under the george h w bush administration both were designed to foster market choices that would conserve energy increase energy efficiency and encourage natural gas use both were also designed to strengthen selected regulatory standards that concomitantly also reduced greenhouse gas emissionssuch as landfill regulations that curtail methane releases as indicated in table 3 several actions in the 1993 clinton plan expanded programs listed in the george h w bush administrations plan by 11 this plan became the basis for the 1994 submission to the unfccc for further discussion of the plan see crs report 94404 climate change action plans by larry b parker and john blodgett 12 us department of energy the climate change action plan technical

reductions other clinton proposals were new examples included golden carrot program to induce efficiency improvements of industrial equipment renewable energy consortium program to encourage employers to replace parking subsidies with cash incentives for solo commuting and program to promote more efficient nitrogen fertilizer use under the 1993 clinton plan total greenhouse gas emissions were projected to return to their 1990 levels by the year 2000 although co 2 emissions alone would rise about 2 percent by 1997 the projected greenhouse gas emission reductions of the clinton plan was revised downward to 76 mmtce from 109 mmtce in the 1993 plan in addition the baseline for greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2000 was increased by 157 mmtce from that projected in 1993 thus rather than returning emissions to their 1990 levels in the year 2000 the 1997 plan projected 188 mmtce increase in emissions or 13 above 1990 levels 13 t able 3 selected major reduction strategies under the

rationale of the clinton plan remained the plan combines an array of publicprivate partnerships to stimulate the deployment of existing energyefficient technologies and accelerate the introduction of innovative technologies the goal of these programs was to cut co 2 emissions while enhancing productivity domestically and us competitiveness aboard15 the echo of the 1991 nas report was clear the cost to control greenhouse gas emissions would net out to zero or even save money depending on how the benefits from increased efficiency were estimated 13 climate action report 1997 p 125 14 climate

to counter global climate change the first two cops were held in berlin in 1995 and 1996 at cop1 several industrialized countries including the united states expressed concern that newly industrializing countr ies such as brazil and china would continue to be classified as nonannex 1 countries ie developing countries exempt from possible future legally binding reduction requirements despite their projected large increases in greenhouse gas emissions in the future this issue of exempting such countries from future binding reduction requirements took on heightened importance when ministerial participants at cop2 signed declaration calling for legally binding midterm targets such targets were the subject of cop 3 held in kyoto in december 1997 16 in anticipation of the kyoto negotiations the us senate debated the appropriate us position vis vis any legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on july 25 1997 the senate voted 950 to approve senate resolution 98 sres 98 expressing the sense of the senate regarding the conditions under which the united states should become signatory to any international agreement on greenhouse gases under the unfccc17 specifically the resolution states that the us should not sign any agreement limiting developed countries greenhouse gas emission eg the united states unless that agreement also includes specific schedules to limit developing countries greenhouse gas emissions over the same period in addition agreement should be signed that would result in serious harm to the economy of the united states sres 98 also states that any agreement sent to the senate for advice and consent should include detailed discussion of required legislative and regulatory actions to implement the treaty and cost analysis of an implementation strategy these conditions for senate consideration of treaty illustrate the senates concern about the cost of any agreement to the us economy and consumers the competitive effects on us trade and the environmental effectiveness of treaty that exempts increasingly important greenhouse em itting developing countries by requiring re analysis of the costs of implementing binding reduction requirements the senate was in effect calling for reexamination of the nas reports argument that greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced at modest cost that the kyoto protocol did not meet the conditi ons of senate resolution 98 is not in dispute it does not bind developing countries to any schedule of reductions for many critics commitment may be comprehensive

george w bush administration has abandoned both the kyoto protocol and its negotiation process in his june 11 2001 speech on global climate change the president stated that the kyoto protocol was fatally flawed in fundamental ways primary flaw outlined by the president is the exemption of china and other developing countries from its provisions this comprehensiveness concern was closely followed by cost and competitiveness concerns kyoto is in many ways unrealistic many countries cannot meet their kyoto targets the targets themselves are arbitrary and not based upon science for america complying with those mandates would have negative economic impact with layoffs of workers and price increases for consumers and when you evaluate all these flaws most reasonable people will understand that its not sound public policy 18 to respond to global climate change president bush called for new approach focused on the science and with flexible control mechanisms that employ marketbased incentives among the principles that the president argued should guide such program were the following we must always act to ensure continued econo mic growth in prosperity for our citizens and for citizen throughout the world and finally our approach must be based on global participation including that of developing countries whose net greenhouse gas emission now exceed those in the developed countries in its 2006 action plan submitted under unfccc the george w bush administration outlines six principles in building climate change policy19 be consistent with the longterm goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations be measured and continually build on new scientific data ensure continued economic growth and prosperity pursue marketbased incentives and spur technological innovation be flexible to adjust to new information and take advantage of new technology and promote global participation including developing countries several of these principles mirror those cited as influencing the regrets policy of the george h w bush administration as shown in table 4 below the focus on reducing greenhouse gases without interfering with economic growth is the basis of both policies in this sense the objectives of the george w bush administrations climate change policy are similar to those of the george h w bush and clinton administrations 18 president

plan makes attempt to suggest that it will achieve the unfccc goal of returning greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels in fact the administrations voluntary program shifts the focus from reducing greenhouse gas emissions per to reducing the intensity of emissions per unit of economic activity 20 as announced by president george w bush in february 200221 his voluntary plan would reduce greenhouse gas intensity in the us by 18 in 2012 threequarters of which would occur from projected businessasusual trends concomitant ly greenhouse gas emissions were projected to increase from 142 above 1990 levels in 2000 to 283 above 1990 levels in 2010some 45 below projected businessasusual levels22 in addition on july 27 2005 the bush administration announced formation of sixnation asia

global climate change was an important element in the legislative drafting and debates that led to energy policy act of 1992 global climate change was largely peripheral during the drafting of and deliberating on the bills predominately hr 6 in both the 108th and 109th congresses that ultimately became the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958indeed the drafters and managers of the legislation focused on energy security and energy supply and preferred to avoid engaging in debate on climate implications however energy policy inevitably has greenhouse gas implications eg pl 10958 includes provisions to foster nuclear power and to encourage alternative fuels at the same time other provisions encourage coal use some members did seek to inject explicit consideration of climate change into the debate on energy policy however and as result the issue of mandatory versus voluntary efforts to address global climate change was again debated in the 108th congress in the senate bill s 139 that would have imposed mandatory capandtrade greenhouse gas reduction program failed in 2003 on 4355 vote in 2005 similar initiative was considered as an amendment during the senate debate on the energy policy act of 2005 and defeated on 3860 vote these proposals would have placed cap on us greenhouse gas emission based on 2001 baseline the cap would have been implemented through tradeable permit program to encourage efficient reductions 23 charter for the asiapacific partnership on clean development and climate january 12 2006 purposes 211 for additional information see http

explicitly during the debate on energy policy in the 109th congress led 13 senators to introduce samdt 866a sense of the senate resolution on climate change the resolution finds that 1 greenhouse gases are accumulating in the atmosphere increasing average temperatures 2 there is growing scientific consensus that human activity is substantial cause of this accumulation and 3 mandatory steps will be required to slow or stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions based on these findings the resolution states it is the sense of the senate that the congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions this should be done in manner that will not significantly harm the us economy and will encourage comparable action by other countries that are our major trading partners and contributors to global emissions the resolution passed by voice vote after motion to table it failed on 4354 vote as with the energy policy act of 2005 the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 included floor debates about climate change but also as with the earlier enactment direct climate change initiatives were omitted in the final bill although such provisions as those promoting energy conservation and more stringent auto efficiency standards were seen as consistent with climate change initiatives explicit climate change legislation has progressed in the 110 th congress however consistent with senate amendment 866 the committee on environment and public works reported out revised version of s 2191americas climate security act of 2007by an 11 to 8 vote on december 5 2007 as reported s 2191 is estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 19 below 2005 levels by 2020 up from 15 as introduced and 63 below 2005 levels by 2050 the bill would cap greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation industrial transportation and natural gas sectors the program would be implemented through an expansive allowance trading program to maximize opportunities for costeffective reductions credits obtained from increases in carbon

by the threecs cost competitiveness and comprehensiveness these concerns as indicated earlier can be traced throughout the debate on global climate change the fundamental policy assumption that changed between the us ratification of the 1992 unfccc and the current bush administrations decision to abandon the kyoto protocol process concerns costs the ratification of the unfccc was based at least partially on the premise that significant reductions could be achieved at little or cost this assumption helped to reduce concern some had including those of the former bu sh administration that the treaty could have deleterious effects on us competitivenessa significant consideration because developing countries are treated differently from developed countries under the unfccc further ameliorating this concern compliance with the treaty was voluntary while the united states could aim to reduce its emissions in line with the unfcccs goal if the effort indeed involved

has happened without incurring any penalty under the treaty this flexibility would have been eliminated under the kyoto protocol with its mandatory reduction requirements the possibility of failure to comply with binding commitment intensifies ones perspective on potential costs how confident can one be in the claim that carbon reductions can be achieved at little or costs25 compliance cost estimates ranging from 55 billion to 200 billion annually cause some to pause26 the current bush administration was sufficiently concerned about potential co 2 control costs to reverse campaign pledge to seek co 2 emissions reductions from power plants in addition to its decision to abandon the kyoto protocol process27 as stalemate has continued on mandatory strategies to control co 2 emissions particularly because of costs fears attention increasingly fo cuses on the costlimiting benefit of carbon tax either as the primary strategy or as com ponent blending carbon tax with the reduction certainty of the tradeable permit system the object is to create safety valve to avert unacceptable control costs particularly in the sh ortterm these safety valves limit unit per ton costs of reducing emissions safety valve bounds the costs of any climate change control program price at the expense of reductions achieved quantity28 in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce co 2 emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quantity or compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable for example tradeable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of permits available caps allowable emissions while letting the marketplace determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax or safety valve sets the maximum unit per ton of co 2 cost that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received an impetus for this new debate is report by the national commission on energy policy ncep29 the ncep report called for mandatory economywide tradeable permit program to begin limiting greenhouse gases the mechanism for limiting such emissions involves progressively lower limit on greenhouse gas intensity over time tied to the projected increase in gdp thus the target is not fixed but increases to the degree that projected economic growth exceeds the mandated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity the ncep recommends the reduction rate for greenhouse gas intensity be set at 24 annually beginning in 2010 increasing to 28 beginning in 2020 25 for further discussion of the foundations for such divergent cost estimates see crs report 98738 global climate change three policy perspectives by larry parker

valve the ncep recommends this safety valve be set at 7 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2010 dollars this would be equivalent to about 590 ton in 2001 dollars this safety valve puts an upper limit on the marginal cost that an affected entity should pay for greenhouse gas reductions if control costs exceed 7 ton the entity could pay the safety value price instead the effects of the safety valve on the price vs quantity equation can be seen in table 5 below the safety valve increases uncertainty with respect to emission reductions achieved while increasing certainty with respect to price

in president clintons 1998 6 billion climate change technology initiative as summarized by national economic council chairman gene sperling on the introduction of the president clintons initiative we think that this package is very good example of what we spoke about when we said that there were winwin opportunities for positive incent ives that would clearly show how we can address the issue of climate change and strengthen our economy at the same time32 for those who hold to this technological perspective global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissionssuch as the kyoto protocolwoul d improve the possibilities for improved efficiency and technology by creating stronger market for such innovations they see concerns that increased costs would destroy us competitiveness as unfounded indeed they see increased efficiency and innovation as improving us competitiveness they contend that united states not only can afford to take the lead in carbon reductions negating the comprehensiveness concern but should do so in order to increase its technological leadership as well as to provide an example to the third world to those who are skeptical of this perspective but who may have been willing to accept it when it was part of voluntary framework the scenario appears too risky and overly optimistic in the context of mandatory scheme looking at economic analyses from various sources these skeptics do not see the potential economic costs of mandatory schemes resulting in commensurate environmental benefits particularly in the case of the kyoto protocol where developing nations are excluded from controls from their perspective the reward does not appear to be worth the risk and until it does the country would be better off keeping its options open rather than moving down an unsure and potentially very expensive track this appears to be the position of the george w bush administration which is prepared to encourage technological developmentas through the asiapacific partnershipbut is not prepared to commit to binding reduction target such as that embodied in the kyoto protocol with the bush administration having rejected the kyoto protocol in 2001 what does the senate passage in 2005 of sense of the senate resolution calling for mandatory steps to reduce climate change mean for the future direction of us climate change policy the sense of the senate resolution has spurred renewed discussion on directly incorporating cost considerations eg safety valve or carbon market efficiency board into any mandatory greenhouse gas reduction program from policy perspective the debate on incorporating safety valve into mandatory reduction scheme represents an attempt to quantify the risks involved in addressing global climate change as safety valve has the effect of allowing emissions that otherwise would be reduced those who see great risk in climate change will want to see substantial price attached to the safety valveso emitters would invest in more reductions before it would be cheaper for them to pay for releasing greenhouse gases instead in contrast those more concerned about the costs will want to set the safety valve at lower price levelaccepting more emissions second approach beginning debate would create board to observe the allowance market and implement costrelief measures if necessary seen as more flexible response with the potential for avoiding or mitigating the environmental impacts of safety valve carbon market 32 as reported in daily environment report administration announces 63 billion plan of spending
