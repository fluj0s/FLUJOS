eligibility for fe deral benefits and ta xation this report does not track legislation and will not be regularly updated introduction four major principles underlie us po licy on legal permanent immigration the reunification of families the admission of immigrants with needed skills the protection of refugees and the diversity of admissions by the country of origin these principles are embodied in federal law the immigration nd nationality act ina first codified in 1952 congress has significantly amended the ina several times since most recently by the enhanced border security and visa reform act of 2002 pl 1071731 an alien is any person not citizen or national of the united states and is synonymous with noncitizen it includes people who are he re legally as well as people who are here in violation of the ina noncitizen is generally used to describe all foreign born persons in the united states who have not become citizens the two basic types of legal aliens are immigrants and nonimmigrants immigrants are persons admitted as legal permanent residents lprs of the united states nonimmigrants such as tourists foreign students diplomats temporary

temporary period of time nonimmigrants are required to leave the country when their visas expire though cer tain classes of nonimmig rants may adjust to lpr status if they otherwise qualify2 the conditions for the admission of immigrants are much more stringent than nonimmigrants and many fe wer immigrants than nonimmigrants are admitted once admitted however immigrants are subject to few restrictions for example they may accept and change employment and may pply for us citizenship through the naturalization process generally after 5 years numerical limits and preference categories immigration admissions are subject to complex set of numerical limits and preference categories that give priority for admission on the basis of family relationships needed skills and geographic diversity these include flexible worldwide cap of 675000 not including refugees and asylees discussed below and percountry ceiling which changes yearly numbers allocated to the three preference tracks include 226000 minimum for familybas ed 1 40000 for empl oymentbased and 55000 for diversity immigrants ie form ulabased visa lotte ry aimed at countries that have low levels of immigration to the united states the per country ceilings may be exceeded for employmentbased immigrants but the worldwide limit of 140000 remains in effect in addition the immediate relatives of us citizens ie their spouses and unmarried minor children and the parents of adult u s citizens are ad mitted outside of the numerical limits of the per c ountry ceilings and are the flexible component of the worldwide cap the largest number of immigrants is admitted because of fa mily relationship to us citizen or immigrant of the 1064318 legal immigrants in fy2001 64 entered on the basis of family ties immediate relatives of us citizens made up the single largest group of immigrants as table 1 indicates family preference immigrants the spouses and children of immigrants the adult children of us citizens and the siblings of adult us citizens were the second largest group additi onal major immigrant groups in fy2001 were employmentbased pr eference immigrants including spouses and children refugees and

and dhs bureau of customs and border protection inspector s upon entry to the us that they are not ineligible for visas or admission under the so called grounds for inadmissibility of the ina these criteria categories are healthrelated grounds criminal history national security and terrorist concerns public charge eg indigence seeking to work without proper labor certification illegal entrants

requirement the ina also specifies the circumstances and actions that result in aliens being removed from the united states i deported the category of criminal grounds has been of special concern in recent years and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant res ponsibility act of 1996 expanded nd toughened the deportation consequences of criminal convictions the category of terrorist grounds has also been broadened and tightened up by the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10777httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20916crs4 6 the immigration reform and control act of 1986 legalized several million aliens

never again reached the peaks of the early 20th century the bcis data presentonly those admitted as lprs or those adjusting to lpr status the growth in immigration after 1980 is partly attributable to the total number of admissions under the basic system consisting of immigrants entering through preference system as well as immediate relatives of us citizens that was augmented considerably by legalized aliens 6 in addition the number of refugees admitted increased from 718000 in the period 19661980 to 16 million during the period 19811995 after the enactment of the refugee act of 1980 the immigration act of 1990 increased the ceiling on employmentbased preference immigration with the provision that unused employment visas would be made available the following year for family preference immigration there are two major statistical perspectives on trends in immigration one uses the official bcis admissions data and the other draws on bureau of census population surveys the bcis data present only those admitted as lprs or those adjusting to lpr status the census data on the other hand include all re sidents in the population counts and the census asks people whether they were born in th united states or abroad as result the census data also contain longterm temporary nonimmigrant residents and unauthorized residentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20916crs5 source crs presentation of
