us department of justice f ck1 _ t i national security division secretcomintorconnoforn washington dc 20530 november 20 2007 memorandum for the attorney general 9 l through the acting deputy attorney genep r klu lu 2 from kenneth l wainstein cc subject purpose assistant attorney general national security division steven g bradbury principal deputy assistant attorney general office oflegal counsel proposed amendment to department of defense procedures to permit the national security agency to conduct analysis of communications metadata associated with persons in the united states ssi to recommend attorney general approval pursuant to executive order 12333 of proposed amndment to procedures governing the national security agencys signals intelligence activities ssi synopsis the secretary of defense seeks your approval of proposed department of defense supplemental procedures governing communications metadata analysis supplemental procedures the supplemental procedures attached at tab would clarify that the national security agency nsa may analyze communications metadata associated with united states persons and persons believed to be in the united states these supplemental procedures would amend the existing procedures promulgated pursuant to executive order secretcomintorconnoforn classified by reason declassify on 20 november 2032 j secretcomintorconnofornxl 12333 that order requires the nsa to conduct its signals intelligence activities involving the collection retention or dissemination of information conceming united states persons in accordance with procedures approved by the attomey general accordingly changes to these procedures such as those proposed here also require your approval we conclude that the proposed supplemental procedures are consistent with applicable law and we recommend that you approve them2 ssi the communications metadata that the nsa wishes to analyzewhich relates to both telephone calls and electronic communicationsis dialing routing addressing and signaling infonnation that does not concem the substance purport or meaning of the communication the procedures divide communications metadata into two categmies telephonymetadata and electronic communications metadata telephony metadata includes such information as the telephone numbers of the calling and the called party electronic communications metadata includes such information as the email address and the intemet protocol ip address of the computer of the sender and the recipient this communications metadata has been obtained by various methods including pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa 50 usc 1801 et seq and resides in nsa databases3 nsa plans to analyze this data primarily using technique known as contact chaining contact chaining involves the identification of telephone numbers email addresses or ip addresses that targeted telephone number ip address or email address has contacted or attempted to contact through the use of computer algoritlm1s nsa creates chain of contacts linking communicants and identifying additional telephone numbers ip addresses and email addresses of intelligence interest on the basis of prior infom1al advice of the office of intelligence policy and review nsas present practice is to stop when chain hits telephone number or address believed to be used by united states person nsa believes that it is overidentifying numbers and addresses that belong to united states persons and that modifying its practice to chain through all telephone numbers and addresses including those reasonably believed to be used by united states person will yield valuable foreign intelligence information primarily conceming nonunited statcs persons outside 1 procedures governing the activities of dod intelligence components that affect united states persons dod reg 5 2401rdec 1982 approved by the attomey general on oct 4 1982dod procedures and its classified annex the proposed supplemental procedures would clarify procedure 5 of the dod procedures and its classified annex u 2 this memorandum was prepared in consultation with the office of legal counsel u 3 this memorandum assumes that the nsas initial acquisition of the information it wishes to analyze was lawful u secretcomintorconnofornxl 2 secretcomintorcon nofornxl the united states it is not clear however whether nsas current procedures permit chaining through united states telephone number ip address or email address ssf we conclude that the proposed communications rnetadata analysis including contact chaining is consistent with i the fourth amendment ii fisa and iii the electronic surveillance provisions contained in title 18 of the united states code the supplemental procedures are also consistent with the requirements of executive order 12333 ssi as you consider this proposed change you should be aware of the following 1 congressional oversight at the request of the secretary of defense nsa briefed the select cormnittee on intelligence of the united states senate and the permanent select committee on intelligence of the united states house of representatives on this proposed change before the secretary signed the supplemental procedures 2 oversight ofnsa s activities under the supplemental procedures because nsa has in its databases large amount of communications metadata associated with persons in the united states misuse of this information could raise serious concerns the general counsel of nsa has provided letter attached at tab b describing how nsa will oversee access to and use of this data and committing to report armually to you on nsas communications metadata program as part ofthis reporting nsa undertakes to inform the department ofthe kinds of information that nsa is collecting and processing as communications metadata particularly as technology changes this requirement is important because the legal standards govemi11g metadata are quite different from those governing the contents of communication we believe that the oversight and reporting regime that this letter describes is reasonable one and it informs our recommendation that you approve the supplemental procedures ssf 3 the central intelligence agencys cia interest in conducting similar communications metadata analysis on july 20 2004 the general counsel of cia wrote to the general counsel ofnsa and to the counsel for intelligence policy asking that cia receive from nsa united states communications metadata that nsa does not currently provide to cia the letter from cia is attached at tab c although the proposed supplemental procedures do not directly address the cias request they do resolve significant legal obstacle to the dissemination of this metadata from nsa to cia ssiinf 4 department of defenses dod interest in allowing other dod entities to have access to this data and to conduct similar analysis the dods general counsels office has informed us that in the future other dod entities may wish to obtain and analyze communications metadata using the same rules that nsa uses to do so the proposed supplemental procedures do not apply to these other dod entities but you should be aware that secretcomintorconnofornxl 3secretcomintorconnofornxl such request may be forthcoming as part of its oversight responsibilities the national security division will be briefed by dod conceming what these other dod entities are doing or arc seeking to do in this area before approving any such request ssi discussion u the fourth amendment u the fourth amendment provides that the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized us const amend iv this provision protects against the unreasonable search and seizure of the contents of communication in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy see katz v us 389 us 347 1967 we conclude that person has such expectation however in dialing routing addressing or signaling information that docs not concern the substance purport or meaning of communications4 we reach this conclusion with respect to metadata 4 as an initial matter we note that the analysis of information legally within the possession of the govemment is likely neither search nor seizure within the meaning of the fomth amendment see eg jabara v webster 691 f2d 272 27779 6th cir 1982 holding that the disclosure of information by an agency that lawfully possessed it to another agency does not implicate the fourth amendment memorandum for the attorney general from theodore b olson assistant attorney general office of legal counsel re constitutionality of certain national security agency electronic surveillance activities not covered under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 at 59 may 24 1984 olson memorandum traditional fourth amendment analysis holds that once evidence is constitutionally seized its dissemination or subsequent use raises additional fourth amendment question as noted we assume for the purpose of this memorandum that the nsa has lawfully acquired the information it wishes to analyze nevertheless the olson memorandum went on to consider the limits on the subsequeqt use of information when assessing the constitutionality ofnsas surveillance activities under the fourth amendment see id in an abundance of caution then we analyze the constitutional issue on the assumption that the fourth amendment may apply even though the government has already obtained the information lawfully ssi secretcomintorconnofornxl 4i j secretcomintorconnofornxl associated with both telephone calls and electronic communications5 ssi the supreme couti has held that there is reasonable expectation of privacy in telephone numbers dialed because caller must convey the numbers to the telephone company to complete the call see smith v maryland 442 us 735 74344 1979 in smith the court concluded that the installation of pen register was not search within the meaning of the fourth amendment and thus that warrant was required to collect such infonnation d at 74546 this conclusion followed from the courts previous holding in us v miller 425 us 435 1976 that an individual has fourth amendment privacy interest in infonnation released to third party and later conveyed by that third party to governmental entity d at 440 accordingly it is well settled that there is reasonable expectation of privacy in the telephony metadata the nsa proposes to analyze6 ssi likewise there is reasonable expectation of privacy in electronic communications metadata for fourth amendment purposes courts have considered emails to be analogous to telephone calls and to letters sent through the postal system see us v charbonneau 979 f supp ll77 1184 sd ohio 1997 us v maxwell 45 mj 406417 caaf 1996 following the same approach as smith courts have consistently held that the fourth amendment is not implicated when the government gathers information that appears on mail covers including the name and address of the addressee and of the sender the postmark and the class of mail see us v choate 576 f2d 165 174 9th cir 1978 us v depoli 628 f2d 779 2nd cir 1980 us v huie 593 f2d 14 5th cir 1979per curiam see also vreeken v davis 718 f2d 34334748 loth cir 1983 concluding that mail cover whichrecords information about the sender and recipient of letter is indistinguishable in any important respect fiom the pen register at issue in smith and courts have consistently found that individuals do not have reasonable expectation of privacy in information pertaining to the use of electronic media that 5 it is important to note that this memorandum addresses only those types of metadata specifically identified in the supplemental procedures as described above nsa is required to report regularly to the department on new types of information that it is treating as metadata ifnsa does so we will evaluate whether such new information also falls outside the fourth amendment ssi 6 smith continues to be cited by the supreme court and lower courts for the proposition that acquisition of telephone numbers does not implicate the fourth amendment see eg kyllo v united states 533 us 27 33 2001 us telecom commission v fcc 227 f3d 450454 dc cir 2000 u secretcomintorconnofornxl 5secretcomintorconnofornxi does not reveal the substantive content of communication_ the electronic communications metadata the nsa proposes to analyzedialing routing addressing or signaling informationis identical in all material respects to the infom1ation deemed not to implicate the fomih amendment in these lines of cases ssi thus when inte11jreting the fourth amendment the courts have drawn consistent distinction between the substantive content of the communications found to be protected in katz and the noncontent infonnation found to be unprotected in smith miller and number of lower court cases the communications metadata implicated by the proposed supplemental procedures is limited to dialing routing addressing or signaling information and is defined specifically to exclude any information that concerns the substance pwport or meaning of the communication thus it falls clearly within the second unprotected categ01y of infom1ation we conclude therefore that there is reasonable expectation of privacy in this metadata and that the communications metadata analysis proposed by nsa does not implicate the fourth amendment ssi fisas electronic surveillance provisions u to fall within fisas coverage ofelectronic surveillance an action must satisfy one of the four definitions of that tem1 none of these definitions cover the communications metadata analysis at issue here8 s 7 see thygeson v us bancorp wl 2066746 d or 2004 noting the distinction between the website addresses at issue there in which an employee had reasonable expectation of privacy and the contents ofwebsites visited oremails sent see also us v hambrick 225 f3d 656 4th cir 2000 unpublished opinion holding that although in certain circumstances person may have privacy interest in content informatiori such as the substance of an email there is privacy interest in infom1ation provided to the isp for purposes of establishing the account which according to the court is noncontent information us v 0mesorge 60 mj 946 nm ct crim app 2005 holding that there is reasonable expectation of privacy regarding information provided to an isp ssi 8 as noted above some of the metadata the nsa would analyze has been acquired pursuant to fisa and thus is subject to the minimization procedures applicable to that collection the standard nsa fisa minimization procedures contain restrictions that would prohibit the metadata analysis described herein the nsa will continue to comply with these procedures including with any restrictions on the dissemination of information in addition to the extent that any orders authorizing under fisa the collection of metadata impose minimization procedures that would restrict the metadata analysis in the malu1er proposed here by nsa the nsa must continue to abide by the conditions in those orders ssi secretcomintorconnofornxi 6secretcomintorconnofornxl three of the four definitions of electronic surveillance are satisfied only when the communication is acquired under circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes 50 usc 180lfl 3 4 this statutory expectationofprivacy requirement adopts tem1 of art from fourth amendment case law see eg katz 389 us at 361 harlan j concurring vherc congress borrows terms of art it presumably knows and adopts the meaning their use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed morissette v united states 342 us 246 263 i 952 the legislative history confirms the applicability of this presumption in this instance it repeatedly adverts to constitutional standards when discussing this provision see eg s rep 95701 at 37 1978 usccan at 4006 noting that the provision requires that the acquisition of inforrnation be under circumstances in which person has constitutionally protected right of privacy hr rep 951283 at 53 same s rep 95604 at 35 1978 usccan at 3937 same for the reasons stated above there is reasonable expectation of privacy in the communications metadata at issue here therefore nsas proposed activity would not come within the definitions of electronic surveillance contained in subsections 180lfl 3 or4 s the fourth definition of electronic surveillance involves the acquisition by an electronic mechanical or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication 50 usc 1802f2 wire communication is in turn defined as any communication while it is being carried by wire cable or other like com1ection furnished or operated by any person engaged as common cattier d 1801 1 the data that the nsa wishes to analyze already resides in its databases the proposed analysis thus does not involve the acquisition of communication while it is being carried by connection furnished or operated by common carrier ssi pen register and trap and trace provisions u the pen register and trap and trace surveillance provisions offisa 50 usc 1841 1846 and of the criminal law 18 usc 312127 do not apply to the communications metadata analysis that nsa wishes to conduct ssi first for the purpose of these provisions pen register is defined as device or process which records or decodes dialing routing addressing or signaling information 18 usc 31273 50 usc 1841 2 when nsa will conduct the analysis it proposes however the dialing and other infonnation will have been already recorded and decoded second trap and trace device is defined as device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or other dialing routing addressing and signaling information 18 usc 31274 50 usc 18412 again those impulses will already have been captured at the point that nsa conducts chaining thus nsas communications metadata analysis falls outside the coverage of these provisions ssi secretcomintorconnofornxl 7secretcomintorconnofornxl title iii u the federal criminal wiretap statute title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act 18 usc 2510 et seq prohibits the unauthorized intercept ion of any wire oral or electronic commmtication id at 2511 l which is defined as the acquisition of the contents of the communication id at 251 0 4 it also prohibits the use and disclosure of the contents of such communication if it was unlawfully intercepted see id at 25111 for the purpose of these prohibitions contents is defined as information concerning the substance purport or meaning of that communication d 25108 see united states v new york telephone co 434 us 159 1977 holding that title iii does not cover the acquisition of metadata with pen registers by its tern1s the supplemental procedures definition of the communications metadata to be analyzed excludes information about the substance purport or meaning of the communication for iliis reason at least the prohibitions of section 2511 i do not apply to the proposed communications rnetadata analysis ssi executive order 12333 and related procedures u executive order 12333 requires the nsa to conduct its signals intelligence activities involving the collection retention or dissemination ofinformation concerning united states persons in accordance with procedures approved by the attorney general see id 23 249 these procedures must pern1it ilie collection retention and dissemination of certain types of inforn1ation including foreign intelligence infonnation in manner that protects constitutional and other legal rights and limits the use of the information to lawful government purposes see id 24 the attorney general approved the current department of defense procedures and classified annex in october 1982 u the current dod procedures and their classified annex may be read to restrict nsas abillty to conduct the desired communications metadata analysis at least wiili respect to metadata associated with united states persons in particular tllis analysis may fall within the procedures defi11itions of and thus restrictions on the interception and selection of communications 9 in addition section25 of executive order 12333 provides that the attorney general hereby is delegated the power to approve the use for intelligence purposes within the united states or against united states person abroad of any technique for which warrant would be required if undertaken for law enforcement purposes because individuals have reasonable expectation of privacy in the types of metadata at issue here warrant would be required to analyze tllis information for law enforcement purposes in addition the analysis ofinfom1ation legally within the possession of the government is likely neither search nor seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment see note 4 supra section 25 thus does not require the attorney general to approve nsa s proposed analysis of communications metadata s secretcomintorconnofornxl 8 secretcomintorconnofornxl accordingly the supplemental procedures that would govcm nsas analysis of communications metadata expressly state that the dod procedures and the classified annex do not apply to the analysis of communications metadata specifically the supplemental procedures would clarify that contact chaining and other metadata analysis do not qualify as the interception or selection of communications nor do they qualify as using selection tenn including using selection term intended to intercept communication on the basis of some aspect of the content of the communication once approved the supplemental procedures will clarify that the communications metadata analysis the nsa wishes to conduct is not restricted by the dod procedures and their classified annex ssi the supplemental procedures define the tenns communications metadata contact chaining and metadata analysis the upplemental procedures also state that nsa will conduct contact chaining and other metadata analysis only for valid foreign intelligence purposes disseminate the results of its analysis in accordance with current procedures goveming dissemination of information concerning us persons as set forth in section 4a4 ofthc classified annex and investigate any apparent misuse or improper dissemination ofmetadata and report the same to the appropriate oversight organizations ssi in addition the nsa letter accompanying the supplemental procedures proposes regulatory and oversight regime for the handling of communications metadata of us persons nsa states that access to communications metadata will be restricted to only those persmmel with need for this data in the performance of their official duties before gaining access to communications metadata nsa or other persoru1el working under the authority of the director ofnsa will receive mandatory training approved by the general counsel ofnsa on the proper use of such databases and chaining tools when logging into the electronic data system users will view banner that reemphasizes key points regarding use of the data chaining tools and proper dissemination of results nsa will also create an audit trail of every query made in each database containing us communications metadata and network of auditors will spotcheck activities in the database to ensure compliance with all procedures in addition the nsa oversight and compliance office will conduct periodic super audits to verify that activities remain properly controlled finally nsa will report any misuse of the information to the nsas inspector general and office of general counsel for inclusion in existing or future reporting mechanisms related to nsas signals intelligence activities ssiocnf nsa also states it will report any changes to this oversight regime to the assistant attomey general for the national security division and by october 15 of each year will submit report to the attomey general regarding the kinds of information the nsa is collecting and processing as communications metadata nsas implementation of its compliance procedures and any significant new legal or oversight issues that have arisen in connection with nsas activities described in this memorandum c secretcomintorconnofornxl 9secretcomintorconnofornxl as drafted the supplemental procedures meet the requirements of executive order 12333 together with the cunent approved procedures they continue to permit the collection of foreign intelligence and other infonnation and as explained above the metadata analysis will be for lawful government purposes and consistent with the constitution and other applicable law s recommendation based on the information provided by nsa and our analysis of applicable law we conclude that there are constitutional or statutory restrictions on nsas proposed use of communications mctadata we therefore recommend that you approve the supplemental procedures ssi secretcomintorconnofornxl 10ssi department of defense supplemental procedures governing communications metadata analysis sec 1 purpose ssi these procedures supplement the procedures found in dod regulation 52401r and the classified annex thereto these procedures govern nsas analysis of data that it has already lawfully collected and do not authorize collection of additional data these procedures also clarify that except as stated in section3 below the procedures in dod regulation 52401r and the classified annex thereto do not apply to the analysis of communications metadata sec 2 definitions ssi communications metadata means the dialing routing addressing or signaling information associated with connnunication but does not include information concerning the substance purport or meaning of the communication the two principal subsets of communications metadata are telephony metadata and electronic communications metadata telephony metadata includes the telephone number of the calling party the telephone number of the called party and the date time and duration of the call it does not include the substance purport or meaning ofthe communication b for electronic communications metadata includes the information appearing on the to from cc and bee lines of standard email or other electronic communication for email communications the from line contains the email address ofthe sender and the to cc and bee lines contain the email addresses of the recipients metadata also means 1 information about the internetprotocol ip address of the computer from which an email or other electronic connnunication was sent and depending on the circumstances the ip address of routers and servers on the internet that have handled the communication during transmission 2 the exchange of an ip address and email address that occurs when user logs into webbased email service and 3 for certain logins to webbased email accounts inbox metadata that is transmitted to the user upon accessing the account metadata associated with electronic communications does not include infonnation from the subject or re line of an email or information from the body of an email lt ssl contact chaining contact chaining is process by which communications metadata is organized it shows for example the telephone numbers or email addresses that particular telephone number or email address has been in contact with or has attempted to contact through this process computer algorithms automatically identify not only the first tier of contacts made by the seed telephone number or email address but also the further contacts made by the first tier of telephone numbers or email addresses and so on sec 3 procedures ssl nsa will conduct contact chaining and other communications metadata analysis only for valid foreign intelligence purposes b ssi nsa will disseminate the results of its contact chaining and other analysis of communications metadata in accordance with cuitent procedures governing dissemination of information concerning us persons see section 4a4 of the classified annex to procedure 5 of dod regulation 52401r c ufouo any apparent misuse or improper dissemination ofmetadata shall be investigated and reported to appropriate oversight organizations see procedure 15 ofdod regulation 52401r sec 4 clarification ssi for purposes ofprocedure 5 ofdod regulation 52401r and the classified annex therejo contact chaining and other metadata analysis do nt qualify as the interception or selection of communications nor do they qualify as using selection term including using selection term intended to intercept communication on the basis of some aspect of
