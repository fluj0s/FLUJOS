james mccarthy resources science and industry division robert meltz american law division march 4 2008 abstract this report reviews the nature of epas californias and other states authority to regulate emissions from mobile sources the applicability of that authority to ghgs and issues related to the california waiver request the conditions for granting or denying waiver request under caa are four whether the state has determined that its standards will be in the aggregate at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards whether this determination was arbitrary and capricious whether the state needs such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions and whether the standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are consistent with caa section 202a california appears to have sound argument that it has met these tests epa however has decided that climate change is simply beyond the scope of its preemption waiver

requiring new motor vehicles to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs beginning in model year 2009 the clean air act caa generally preempts states from adopting their own emission standards for mobile sources however the act allows such standards in california if the state obtains waiver of caa preemption from epa california requested this waiver in 2005 but epa took until december 19 2007 to decide that it would deny the request on that day epa administrator stephen johnson wrote california governor schwarzenegger to say i have decided that epa will be denying the waiver and have instructed my staff to draft appropriate documents setting forth the rationale for this denial in further detail according to press reports the decision was taken against the unanimous advice of the agencys technical and legal staffs on february 29 2008 the administrator issued decision document denying the waiver that will be published in the federal register following epas december 19 letter california and environmental groups petitioned for review in the ninth circuit with multiple states inte rvening on californias side the interest of the intervening states derives from the fact that under the caa states other than california may adopt motor vehicle emission standards identical to californias and avoid caa preemption if california is granted waiver at least 14 states have adopted such regulations this report reviews the nature of epas californias and other states authority to regulate emissions from mobile sources the applicability of that authority to ghgs and issues related to the california waiver request the conditions for granting or denying waiver request under caa are four whether the state has determined that its standards will be in the aggregate at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards whether this determination was arbitrary and capricious whether the state needs such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions and whether the standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are consistent with caa section 202a california appears to have sound argument that it has met these tests epa however has decided that climate change is simply beyond the scope of its preemption waiver authority this report does not analyze whether california is preempted from regulating mobilesource ghgs by the corporate average fuel economy cafe requirements of the energy policy and conservation act of 1975 or the newly enacted provisions of the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 under these laws authority to set fuel economy standards is reserved to the federal governmentspecifically the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa in several court cases and in other venues the auto industry is maintaining that the regulation of mobilesource ghg emissions is simply another method of regulating fuel economy so californias ghg standards and identical standards adopted by other states are preempted two federal district courts have rejected this argument but one decision has been appealed and the other likely will be

law imposing environmental standards raises the question of whether the states are allowed to set stricter standards in deference to states rights congresss usual approach is to allow stricter state standards for example the clean air act caa allows stricter state standards for stationary sources of air pollution power plan ts refineries etc for mobile sources of air pollution howevercars trucks planes etca lack of national uniformity creates problem since manufacturers would potentially face the task of complying with different standards in each state such standards would fragment the national market increasing costs and complicating the manufacture sale and servicing of the affected products for this reason the mobile source portion of the caa title ii generally does not allow states to adopt or attempt to enforce their own emission standards for new motor vehicles or engines 1 in general it allows only federal standards for motor vehicle emissions there is an exception to this rule however in caa section 209b2 the epa administrator shall after notice and opportunity for public hearing waive application of this section the prohibition of state emission standards to any state which has adopted standards other than crankcase emission standards for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to march 30 1966 if the state determines that the state standards will be in the aggregate at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards 3 only california adopted such standards before march 30 1966 so only california can qualify for such waiver faced with severe air pollution problems especially in angeles and the san joaquin valley california has regularly developed more stringent standards for motor vehicle emissions than those required by federal law in order to impose these standards the state has requested and been granted section 209b waivers at least 53 times since 19674 although only california may be granted waiver under this section elsewhere in the act as discussed later in this report there is waiver of preemption for other states that have adopted californias standards if epa grants california waiver using section 209b waivers california has served as laboratory for the demonstration of cutting edge emission control technologies which after being successfully demonstrated there were adopted in similar form at the national level catalytic converters cleaner fuels and numerous other advances were introduced in this way currently waivers allow california to require that portion of each manufacturers sale s meet zero emission vehicle zev and partial zev requirements which has stimulated the sale of electric and hybrid vehicles 1 caa 209a 42 usc 7543a see also srept 911196 1970 p 32 2 42 usc 7543b 3 as will be discussed in greater detail below there are three conditions placed on the grant of such waivers the administrator is to deny waiver if he finds 1 that the states determination is arbitrary and capricious 2 that the state does not need separate standards to meet compelling nd extraordinary conditions or 3 that the states

the first state to enact legislation requiring reductions of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from motor vehicles the legislation ab 1493 required the california air resources board carb to adop t regulations requiring the maximum feasible and costeffective reduction of ghg emissions from any vehicle whose primary use is noncommercial personal transportation ghgs are defined by the state as carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride but for the purpose of this regulatory program only the first four of these are subject to control the reductions are to apply to motor vehicles manufactured in the 2009 model year and thereafter under this authority carb adopted regulations september 24 2004 requiring gradual reductions in fleet average ghg emissions until they are about 30 below the emissions of the 2002 fleet in 2016 5 as illustrated in figure 1 the regulations set separate standards for two classes of vehicles the first class consists of all passenger cars plus light duty trucks and suvs weighing 3750 lbs or less these vehicles mu st reduce emissions by an average of 365 between 2009 and 2016 the second group consists of light trucks and passenger vehicles over 3750 lbs which must reduce emissions 244 over the same time period the regulations require reductions in fleet averages rather than compliance by individual vehicles they provide substantial flexibility including credit generation from alternative fuel vehicles and averaging banking and trading of credits within and among manufacturers creditsand debits for any year in which manufacturer exceeds the standardsmust be equalized within five years of their generation with the first equalization required in 2014 thus manufacturers would not be subject to penalties for failure to meet the standards until 2014 at the earliest6 following adoption of these regulations by carb they were subjected to public comment and legislative review and carb submitted request to us epa december 21 2005 for waiver under section 209b 5 table showing the mandated reductions yearbyyear can be found in carbs regulations to control greenhouse gas

that epa will be denying the waiver and have instructed my staff to draft appropriate documents setting forth the rationale for this denial in further detail according to press reports the decision was taken against the unanimous advice of the agencys technical and legal staffs7 his staff did subsequently draft decision document which the administrator signed on february 29 20088 the decision documents rationale is set out at the end of the compelling and extraordinary conditions section below the agencys long response time two years has been the result of several factors first the agency was waiting for the us supreme court to decide whether ghgs are air pollutants under the caa and thus subject to epa s regulatory authority the court case posing this question challenged epas denial in 2003 of petition asking the agency to regulate ghg emissions from new motor vehicles under caa section 202a 9 the agency concluded it lacked authority under the caa to regulate motor vehicle emissions based on their climate effects in its 7 epa chief denies calif limit on auto emissions washington post december 20 2007 p a1 documents shown to and transcribed by congressional staff have included numerous statements by senior epa staff recommending that the administrator grant the waiver and the administrato r has not identified any staff recommendation suggesting denial see us senate

resolved this issue finding 54 that the clean air acts sweeping definition of air pollutant includes any air pollution agent or combination of such agents including any physical chemical substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons are wi thout doubt physical and chemical substances which are emitted into the ambient air the statute is unambiguous11 thus the courts majority had doubt that the caa gives epa authority to regulate ghgs from new motor vehicles although the specifics of such regulation are subject to agency discretion see crs report rs22665 the supreme court s climate change decision massachusetts v ep by robert meltz following this decision epa announced that it would consider the california waiver request the agency held public hearings on may 22 2007 in arlington v and on may 30 in sacramento ca under pressure from californias senator boxer who chairs the environment and public works committee 12 and other california leaders including governor schwarzenegger and attorney general brown13 epa administrator johnson announced that he would decide whether to grant the waiver request by the end of 200714 during the public comment period the agency received more than 60000 comments the vast majority of them urging it to grant the waiver support came from environmental groups the manufacturers of emission controls association the national association of clean air agencies which represents state and local air pollution control departments and number of governors as will be discussed further below 14 other states have adopted regulations identical to californias and 2 others have announced their intention to do so but their ability to implement the regulations depends on california first being granted waiver 15 thus they have weighed in support of the waiver request 10 127 s ct 1438 2007 11 id at 1460 emphasis in original 12 at may 22 2007 hearing for example senator boxer stated epa already has all the authority it needs to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles now the supreme courts landmark decision has now cleared the way the time to act is now the clearest example of this point is the case for the california waiver further delay in this matter is simply unacceptable see opening statement of senator

york oregon pennsylvania rhode island vermont and washington under section 177 of the act states that have nonattainment or maintenan ce areas can dopt californias emission standards for mobile sources in lieu of federal standards every state except hawaii north dakota and south dakota would be eligible to adopt californias standards under this socalled piggyback provision thus there is

stringent emission standards under the waiver provision of section 209b but elsewhere in section 177 the caa provides that any state with an epaapproved state im plementation planevery state except hawaii north dakota and south dakotamay adopt and enforce for any model year standards relating to control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines provided 1 that the

noted earlier section 209b says that the epa administrator shall waive the prohibition on state emission standards if the state determines that the state standards will be in the aggregate at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards since california did so determine this language would seem to give epa little room to turn down the waiver request but the section adds such waiver shall be granted if the administrator finds that the determination of the state is arbitrary and capricious b such state does not need such state stan dards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions or c such state standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with section 202a of this part there are two ways in which this language can be interpreted one is that it refers to the specifics of the new standards under considerationin this case the ghg standards this interpretation has historically been rejected by epa and by california as will be discussed at greater length see evaluating the states program in the aggregate below the other interpretation is that the language refers to the states program as wholeie whether in the aggregate all the states requirements for auto emission controls are as protective of public health and welfare as federal standards are needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions etc this has historically been epa s interpretation of the statute relying on both its wording and the accompanying legislative history we look at each of these interpretations in turn in the following sections since epa has now broken with its previous interpretation and based its decision on the ghg standards in isolation from the rest of californias program under the compelling and extraordinary conditions criterion we begin by examining this approach

standards by themselves meet the waiver criteria he must first find whether the states determination that its standards are at least as protective as applicable federal standards is arbitrary and capricious there are federal standards for co 2 the principal greenhouse gas nor are there standards for the other ghgs methane nox etc based on their greenhouse gas effects thus it is difficult to see how the administrator could have found californias determination that its standards are at least as protective to be arbitrary and capricious without addressing that point directly the administrator in his letter to governor schwarzenegger and other epa spokespersons and the president himself in december 20 continued the california standards neither state has issu ed regulations as of this writing however

the energy independence and security act eisa pl 110140 which the president signed december 19 2007 as requiring greater fuel economy than the california approach or being national in scope as opposed to patchwork of state standards22 these statements would seem to imply that the administrator considered the argument that californias ghg standards are not as protective as applicable federal ones although ultimately his february 29 decision document is not based on it such an argument was tenuous for at least three reasons first the new energy law does not establish emission standards it sets fuel economy standards as will be discussed at greater length in the related litigation section below two courts have now found that energy legislation does not preempt epa or california actions to regulate auto emissions even if the emissions in question ghgs are closely related to fuel economy the overlap between ghgs and fuel economy is not precise for example california regulates ghg emissions from auto air conditioners which are not covered by fuel economy standards furthermore congress has twice visited the issue of fuel economy without preempting epa or state authority to set emission standards second even if one were to hold that ghg standards and fuel economy standards serve identical purposes there still is federal standard to which one might compare californias for the years 20092019 the energy law does not establish any new standard for fuel economy before 2020 11 years after californias ghg standards would take effect thus for the years 20092019 there is overlap 23 third far from establishing patchwork of state standards granting california waiver would establish only two sets of standards californias standards in the 15 states that have adopted them and federal standards currently nonexistent in the other states this twostandard approach is the system that congress intended when it authorized california standards in 196724 and amended it in the clean air act amendments of 197725 the other two criteria b and c pose higher hurdles

nonattainment problem which is already the worst in the nation26 whether the states mobile source ghg emission standards are needed to meet these conditions poses more difficult question however climate change is global issue and will pose nearly identical challenges to california whether or not the state is permitted to implement the adopted regulations the reductions in ghg emissions that the regulations would bring about are estimated at 155200 tons of co 2 equivalent per day in 203027 ie when the fleet consists of vehicles that meet the 2016 standard566 milli on tons year compared to businessasusual scenario if all 15 states that have adopted or announced plans to implement the regulations do so the reductions might be as much as 175 million or 200 million tons annually compared to total current us emissions from all sources of about 7 billion tons californias action alone would reduce emissions less than 1 and all 15 states would eliminate 25 to 3 compared to world emissions from all sources 34 billion tons all 15 states would reduce the total about 06 thus it might be argued that the standards do not go fa r enough to be said to meet the compelling and extraordinary conditions that the state has described this had seemed to be the position that administrator johnson intended to take in his december 19 letter to governor schwarzenegger he stated unlike other air pollutants covered by previous waivers greenhouse gases are fundamentally global in nature greenhouse gases contribute to the problem of global climate change problem that poses challenges for the entire nation and indeed the world unlike pollutants covered by the other waivers greenhouse gas emissions harm the environment in california and elsewhere regardless of where the emissions occur in other words this challenge is not exclusive or unique to california and differs in basic way from the previous local and regional air pollution problems addressed in prior waivers 28 he concluded in light of the global nature of the problem of climate change i have found that california does not have need to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions29 on the other hand while the nature of the pollution problem global vs local or regional is clearly different case can still be made that the ghg regulations are similar in fundamental respects to the 53 previous sets of regulations for which epa has granted california waivers like the ghg standards each of the previous sets of regulations were incremental steps that reduced emissions but in themselves were insufficient to solve the pollution problem they addressed large portions of the state are still in nonattainment of the ozone air quality standard nearly 40 years after the first of these waivers despite these incremental steps to reduce emissions furthermore auto and light truck emissions are major contributors to the total pool of greenhouse gas emissions about 20 of the total of us emissions and are growing more

reducing total ghg emissions would be difficult or impossible without addressing this sector thus strong case can be made that reducing ghg emissions from mobile sources is necessary if the state is to meet the compelling and extraordinary conditions posed by the increasing concentr ation of ghgs in the atmosphere32 ultimately epas decision document of february 29 2008 denying the waiver was not based on the factual adequacy of californias showing that its standards were needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions rather it was based on the breadth of the legal concept of compelling and extraordinary conditions relying largely on the legislative history accompanying the original enactment of section 209 in 1967 epa concluded in the decision document that climate change impacts on california cannot constitute compelling and extraordinary conditions as that phrase is used in section 209b for two reasons first it argues compelling and extraordinary conditions must be of local or regional nature climate change by contrast is global phenomenon second contends the document climate change impacts in california will not be different enough from those in the nation as whole to justify calling californias situation compelling and extraordinary as noted epa s february 29 decision document takes the approach of evaluating californias ghg standards in isolation not in combination wi th its whole air pollution control program epa argues that the global nature of climate change makes inapplicable the intheaggregate approach used with previous waiver requests which all shared characteristicthat they addressed local or regional problemsjustifying common approach

february 29 decision notice the administrator could also have rejected the request if he found that the states standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with section 202a of the caa much of section 202a is not applicable to this waiver request it addresses standards specific to heavy duty trucks rebuilt heavyduty engines motorcycles and gasoline vapor recovery but the section also provides general authority for motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine emission standards it allows the administrator to determine whether there are any unreasonable risks to public health welfare or safety associated with specific emission control devices or systems and to determine the amount of lead time necessary to permit the development and application of technology requisite to meet emission standards the administrator has used the latter authority in the past and could do so again to delay the effective date of california standards in its initial statement of reasons and in other documents supporting the ghg standards the state emphasized that it had based the standards on the use of already demonstrated technologies continued greenhouse gas emissions and sinks table 37

different argument it says that california does not have need to meet these conditions this is not the actual criterion stated in section 209b which would require him to find that the state does not

accompanying its december 2005 formal request for waiver contains 21 pages describing the technologies available to meet the standards and states unlike most previous carb requests setting standards years into the future each of the technology packages projected for compliance contains many technologies that are currently available and in vehicles today34 the state concluded that inconsistency with section 202a can only be shown if there is inadequate lead time to permit the development of technology to meet the requirements giving appropriate consideration to the cost of doing so or if the federal and california test procedures impose inconsistent certification requirements because there are federal test procedures that measure ghgs for climate change purposes test procedures cannot be an issue carb concluded the only relevant question then is whether manufacturers can apply these technologies in sufficient quantities to meet the standards in time for the regulatory compliance

epa has granted waivers despite industry statements and its own findings that doing so would greatly increase cost result in substantial fuel economy penalties cause the marketing of more restricted model line in california result in poorer driveability and cause california auto dealers business to suffer substantially despite making all of these findings in 1975 waiver determination thenepa administrator russell train granted waiver because he concluded that the statutory language required that he give deference to californias judgment36

possible interpretation of section 209b is that the administrator is to determine whether californias auto and light truck emission requirements in the aggregatenot just the ghg controlsmeet the criteria for waiver according to numerous informed sources including both california and epathis has always been how the statute has been interpreted californias waiver submission for example states the relevant inquiry under section 209b1b is whether california needs its own emission control program to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions not whether any given standard is necessary to meet such conditions 37 epa has agreed with this position in past determinations for example in 1984 waiver determination administrator william ruckelshaus stated 33 carb initial statement of reasons

california needs its own motor vehicle pollution control program to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions and not whether any given standard eg the instant particulate standards is necessary to meet such conditions for the reasons elaborated below i agree with california 38 the reasons elaborated below included congresss use of the term state standards in the aggregate relying on this interpretation of the statute epa has repeatedly found as recently as december 2006 that california faces compelling and extraordinary conditions as to pollution not climate change and needs its own standards to meet these conditions39 epa has also generally deferred to the states judgment regarding consistency with section 202a40 in general as epa stated in 1975 waiver determination these provisions must be read in the light of their unusually detailed and explicit legislative history congress meant to ensure by the language it adopted that the federal government would not secondguess the wisdom of state policy here sponsors of the language eventually adopted referred repeatedly to their intent to make sure that federal bureaucrat would be able to tell the people of california what auto emission standards were good for them as long as they were stricter than federal standards senate language says you may go beyond the federal statutes unless we find that there is justification for your progress 41 in arguing thus the administrator foreshadowed the house interstate and foreign commerce committee report on the 1977 clean air act amendments which revisited and strengthened californias position in seeking waiver the report accompanying amendments to section 209b that gave the subsection its current form states the committee amendment is intended to ratify and strengthen the california waiver provision and to affirm the underlying intent of that provision ie to afford california the broadest possible discretion in selecting the best means to protect the health of its citizens and the public welfare the administrator thus is not to overturn californias judgment lightly nor is he to substitute his judgment for that of the state there must be clear and compelling evidence that the state acted unreas onably in evaluating the relative risks of various pollutants in light of the air quality topography photochemistry and climate in that state before epa may deny waiver 42 38 49 federal register 1888918890 may 3 1984 39 71 federal register 78192 december 28 2006 40 as noted by administrator ruckelshaus in the same 1984 waiver determination epa has long held that consistency with section 202a does not require that all manufacturers be permitted to sell all motor vehicle models in california as of 1984 he concluded only once has the agency found standard inconsistent with section 202a in california waiver proceeding in that case imposition of the standard would have forced manufacturers out of the california market for an entire class of vehicles ie light duty trucks 49 federal register 18892 may 3 1984 41 40 federal register 23103 may 28 1975 42 us house of representatives committee on interstate and foreign commerce clean air act amendments of

g20g142g154g158g142g156g157g501g561 as noted earlier california has requested waivers under section 209b on many occasions precise count of the number of such requests is difficult to determine according to epas office of transportation and air quality otaq in large part because the nature of such requests varies the state has requested waivers for new or amended standards on at least 53 occasions on another 42 occasions the state has requested within the scope determinations ie request that epa rule on whether new regulation is within the scope of waiver that the agency has already issued adding all of these together one might say that there have been at least 95 waiver requests but nearly half of these were relatively minor actions that may not deserve to be counted as formal requests 43 of these all were granted in whole or in part i dont think weve ever outright denied request said an otaq official before the current decision but there were some grants in which we denied part or delayed the effective date of part on feasibility grounds44 on at least six occasions prior to the 1977 caa amendments the agency granted waiver in part while denying other parts of the request45 in 1975 it denied waiver for the 1977 model year but granted it for 197846 since the 1977 amendments there was at least one instance in which epa made determination that californias requirements were feasible in part granting waiver for the 2007 through 2011 model years but making decision for model years after that47 the epa administrators letter to governor schwarzenegger and his february 29 decision document attempt to undercut whatever precedent value this history of consistent waiver grants may have both argue that ghgs are unlike other air pollutants covered by previous waivers since they are fundamentally global in nature ghgs harm the environment in california and elsewhere regardless of where emissions occur thus the challenge they pose as the letter says differs in basic way from the previous local and regional air pollution problems addressed in prior waivers 48 g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g14g146g157g146g144g138g157g146g152g151g561 aside from

overturned by the courts suits are pending in four federal judicial circuitsnot coincidentally the circuits containing most of the states that have adopted the california ghg contro ls courts addressing this litigation have not doubted that without california waiver state regulation of ghg emissions from motor vehicles is preempted by the caa and the noncaa litigation is moot two decisions have been handed down so far both rejecting the noncaa preemption theories presented in the first green mountain chrysler plymouth dodge jeep v crombie 49 the district court ruled that the relationship between vermonts californiaidentical ghg standards and the energy policy and conservation act epca was be tter analyzed as an interplay between two federal statutes rather than as federalstate preemption question so viewing the matter the court pointed out that the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has consistently treated epaapproved california emissions standards as constituting other motor vehicle standards of the government which ep ca says nhtsa must consider when setting cafe standards 50 moreover in related context the massachusetts v ep decision saw the caa and epca cafe pr ovisions as harmonious51 thus the court found the caa section 209epca relationship to be one of overlap not conflict despite its conclusion that preemption doctrine did not apply the court also did preemption analysis finding that vermonts ghg standards were preempted neither by epca nor as an intrusion upon the foreign policy authority of the united states an appeal is pending in the second decision central valley chrysler jeep inc v goldstone 52 district court similarly rejected claims that californias regulation of ghg emissions from cars and trucks was precluded by epca preempted by epca and preempted as an intrusion on federal authority over foreign policy53 an appeal is likely the legal theories presented in the crombie and goldstone decisions are similar to those in two duplicative rhode island suits lincoln dodge inc v sullivan54 and association of international automobile manufacturers v sullivan55challenging that states

which rejected epas rationale for denial finding that ghgs are air pollutants within the meaning of the caa and spurning epas arguments against their regulation as being insufficient57 the courts decision caused remand of the petition to epa which has not yet addressed it and drew new attention to californias december 2005 request for waiver of preemption to regulate the same pollutants for california standards to be granted waiver from caa preemption the state needed only to meet section 209bs tests which are basically four in number58 epa cannot interpose policy considerations first the state must determine that the standards in the aggregate are at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards the state has made this determination and since there are comparable federal standards the states determination would appear to be correct administrator johnsons december 19 letter to governor schwarzenegger does reference the presidents signing that same day the energy independence and security act which includes new fuel economy standards for cars and trucks to be phased in by 2020 the letter states that these standards will require greater fuel economy than californias approach and be national in scope but the new energy law while giving authority to the secretary of transportation to do so does not itself establish any standard for fuel economy before 2020 11 years after californias standards would take effect nor does it regulate auto emissions in any way californias standards are designed to address emissions even if their major impact might be on fuel economy for example the california standards address emissions from auto air conditioners the new cafe standards will not second epa may deny the waiver if the administrator finds that the determination of the state that its standards are at least as protective in the aggregate as comparable federal standards is arbitrary and capricious again it is difficult to see how the administrator could have rejected waiver on these grounds since there are federal standards third the administrator could reject the petition by finding that california does not need the standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions this is the sole basis for the waiver denial cited in the administrators decision document reliance on the other criteria is expressly disclaimed the state had described what it regarded as the compelling and extraordinary conditions that its standards were meant to address including threats to its coast line and its water supply from rising sea levels threats to its water supply from diminished snow pack and threats to human health and environment from higher temperatures and higher ozone concentrations among other factors without concerted action by california the rest of the united states and other countries these conditions are more likely to occur and to occur sooner according to the state thus there is plausible argument that th states action together with many other actions is necessary to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions furthermore epa has repeatedly held that it is the states entire program not the specific standards that must satisfy this criterion as recently as december 2006 the agency reaffirmed its conclusion that the states program has met this test 57 the decision does not command epa to regulate ghgs from motor vehicles but it finds that if it does not do so it must ground its reasons for inaction in the statute following the supreme court decision the dc circuit v acated the agencys denial and remanded the matter to epa 58 the states action might be preempted under the energy policy and conservation act as the auto industry maintains but that is separate issue for the courts to decide

articulated as his basis for denying the waiver that californias ghg standards were not needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions first he argued section 209b was intended to allow california to address mobile sourcecaused pollution problems that are local or regional not global like climate change second in the alternative he asserted that the effects of climate change in california are not compelling and extraordinary when compared to the rest of the country noting that the global nature of climate change makes it qualitatively different from conventional air pollution the administrator also determined that whether the compelling and extraordinary conditions criterion was satisfied must be assessed by looking solely at californias ghg standardsnot as with past waiver requests its air pollution program as whole fourth epa must deny waiver if the administrator finds the standards inconsistent with section 202a of the act here the issue would have been whether the state allowed manufacturers sufficient lead time california argued that since many of the requisite technologies were available and in vehicles in 2005 manufacturers clearly have sufficient time to comply furthermore the standards do not require that each vehicle or each model reduce emissions below the standards by relying on fleet averages the regulations allow manufacturers to exceed the limits on some models provided that others reduce emissions enough to make up for the excess epa has delayed the effective date of waiver on some other occasions but more often it has found that waiver should be granted even if it meant that some models offered for sale elsewhere in the united states would be unavailable in california 59 according to press reports and review of relevant documents by congressional staff epa technical and legal staff reviewed the law and californias arguments supporting its request and recommended that the administrator grant the requested waiver60 but the administrator overruled the staff and in his december 19 letter to governor schwarzenegger said that he has instructed his staff to draft appropriate documents setting forth the rationale in further detail for his decision this led to the decision document signed by the administrator february 29 the december 19 letter is being challenged in courtby california 15 other states and environmental groups almost certainly the cision document will be as well should the challengers win on the merits further delay could still ensue court holding thus would likely remand epas decision to the agency for further consideration enumerating the flaws in the agencys reasoning rather than ordering epa to grant the waiver outright all things considered it is unlikely that epa will be forced to grant waiver through judicial means before the swearing in of new administration in 2009 congress could of course grant epa waiver obviating the need for judicial action it could do so in number of ways 59 see for example the discussion in 49 federal register 18892 may 3 1984 which found that for the 1983 model year 73 models of small gasolinepowered pickup trucks were available federally while only 55 models were available in california the administrator there quoted the dc circuit court of appeals international harvester v ruckelshaus 478 f2d at 640 we are inclined to agree with the administrator that as long as feasible technology permits the demand for new passenger automobiles to be genera lly met the basic requirements of the clean air act would be satisfied even though this might occasion fewer models and more limited choice of engine types the driving preferences of hot rodders are not to outweigh the goal of clean environment 60 epa chief denies calif limit

preemption of californias ghg standards or order epa to grant such waiver by date certain the caa could be amended to clarify that section 209b can be used to authorize california standards for ghgs or to establish new criteria for determining whether to waive preemption in the case of ghg standards an epa appropriation bill could order the agency to grant waiver perhaps as step toward national ghg sta ndards for cars and trucks such congressional action in whatever form might pose the best shortcut for those opposed to the waivers denial but it too would face obstacles an appropriation rider for example might be the easiest way to get provision through congress there will be an appropriation for epa this year and the bill might be less likely to face veto than either an amendment to the clean air act or standalone bill in general though there is prohibition in house rules on legislating through appropriations bills so amendments to the clean air act or other legislative language attached to epas appropriation would be subject to point of order on the house floor in practice too directives placed in appropriations bills tend to be more successful at prohibiting an agency from taking particular action than at initiating or compelling an action thus the challenge might be to find an activity that the agency could be required to do through appropriations and to tie implementation of californias ghg program to implementation of that epa activity bills not tied to appropriationswhether standalone or amending the clean air actmight be more difficult to enact congress as whole has t shown itself to be united on climate change issues should legislation clear congress and be vetoed by the president twothirds majorities of the house and senate would be required for enactment an extraordinarily high hurdle in the current political climate meanwhile the three most likely candidates for president senators mccain clinton and obama are all supporters of national climate change legislation the latter two are also cosponsors of s 2555 senator boxers bill to approve the california waiver request thus californias ghg regulations for cars and trucks rejected by the epa administrator this year may not be dead yet instead the regulations join growing list of issues that may see new life in 2009
