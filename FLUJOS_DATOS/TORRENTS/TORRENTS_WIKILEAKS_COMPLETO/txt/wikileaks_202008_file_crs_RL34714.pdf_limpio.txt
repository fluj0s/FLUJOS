shortterm energy and winter fuels outlook stewfo for the 20082009 winter heating season initially warned consumers of the likelihood of higher heating costs average expenditures for those heating with natural gas were forecasted to see their expenditures rise by more than 18 home heating oil expenditures were forecast to rise by 23 propane expenditures by 11 and electric heating expenses by 10 the forecasted increases in total expenditures result from higher prices for all energy sources as well as the expectation of colder winter than the past several years revised stewfo reflecting lower oil prices projected declines in home heating expenditures for those using heating oil and propane in contrast heating expenditures were expected to increase for consumers of natural gas and electricity although by less than initially forecasted however oil markets have continued to experience downward volatility recently with the price of crude oil falling over 50 compared to the peak price reached in july 2008 if the downward trend in oil prices continues through the winter 20082009 heating season or stabilizes at lower level the expenditure estimates of even the revised stewfo may be overly pessimistic this is because the price of oil is major factor influencing all the home heating prices surveyed in the stewfo to some degree the price of oil directly affects the prices of heating oil and propane which are petroleum products the price of oil indirectly affects the price of natural gas and also therefore electricity through historical price parity relationship the key risk factors for the stewfo estimates are likely to be the extent to which the us economy continues to experience an economic slowdown that results in further declines in the price of crude oil additionally the variability of the weather could affect the expenditure estimates the low income energy assistance program liheap the primary federal program to assist with home heating costs has been funded at higher levels than last year and its eligibility requirements have been expanded as result this program appears to be able to provide aid to consumers should heating costs escalate this report will be

energy and winter fuels outlook stewfo warned consumers that not only might they expect the prices of natural gas heating oil propane and electricity to be higher in the winter of 20082009 compared to those of 20072008 but that the national oceanic atmospheric administrations noaas projections forecast 24 colder winter compared to last year1 according to the october stewfo the effect of these two factors will be that american consumers might expect to experience sharply higher home heating costs this winter the december 2008 revision of the stewfo demonstrating the importance of the price of oil to american consumers reduced forecasted winter heating expenditures for the united states as whole the revised stewfo projections are that natural gas customers might expect to see their expenditures rise by 02 heating oil consumers might see their expenditures fall by 196 propane expenditures might fall by 124 and electricity expenditures might rise by 79 2 the projected increases in natural gas and electricity costs are likely to put pressure on consumer budgets and their effects could be even greater in an environment of deteriorating national economic conditions even reduced home heating oil and propane expenditures might be burden when combined with job losses and reduced incomes these conditions are likely to increase the importance of the low income home ergy assistance program liheap reduced oil consumption related to relatively high prices as well as slowing economic conditions are expected to keep the price of oil below peak levels the oil market demand and supply balance has become more favorable for consumers with relatively large amounts of excess capacity available over the coming months oil markets are likely to experience an increase in demand due to lower prices as well as reduction of demand due to declining economic growth and production the market price will respond to the balance between these offsetting factors this report analyzes the key factors affecting the various winter fuels markets including consumption production reserves and storage volumes g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 table 1 provides summary profile of

midwest and 183 in the west electricity expenditures are projected to rise by 105 in the northeast 41 in the midwest 115 in the south and decline by 05 in the west differences in regional expenditure projections are due to regional fuel price differentials varying intensities of consumption during the winter season and regional variability in the noaa forecast for heating degree days due to volatile market dynamics the prices used in the stewfo may not yield the forecasted declines in expenditures for example while the stewfo uses 253 as the us average price per gallon in the home heating oil market the price reported by the eia for the week of december 1 2008 was 268 or 56 more if oil pr ices continue to fall or stabilize at lower levels the stewfo estimates could be high

accounted for about 16 in addition small part of domestic supply is imported in the form of liquefied natural gas lng which is part of small worldwide market that is important to some countries japan for example and is expected to grow in importance in others including the united states consumers of natural gas include households and commercial customers that largely use natural gas for space

20082009 on per household basis natural gas consumption has been relatively stable prices spiked in winter 20052006 and are projected to exceed earlier peaks in 20082009 the priceconsumption relationship suggests that natural gas demand is price inelastic meaning that consumption does not vary sharply with variations in price an inelastic relationship is likely because home heating and cooking are typically considered to be necessities by households and in general existing metering does not provide consumers easy access to quantities used and costs generated on the national level natural gas consumption rose by about 65 in 2007 compared to 2006 this increased consumption was led by the electric power sector with 105 increase and households with 82 increase the commerci sector increased consumption by 61 and industrial consumers increased consumption by 22 the increase in household consumption is largely related to the increasing proportion of households using natural gas about 52 of us households use natural gas as their primary heating source 4 us natural gas production is projected to rise by 67 in 2008 and by 42 in 2009 these increases follow 43 increase in production in 2007 physical supply from production is expected to be adequate for the winter of 20082009 while some hurricane damage did result from the storms of 2008 resulting in production shutin of about 165 billion cubic feet of natural gas total output is still expected to increase in 2008 and 2009 5 because natural gas consumption especially by households is cyclic and weather related peaking during the winter heating season and to lesser extent during the summer accumulation of stored gas takes place at other times stored natural gas is then released into the supply system during peak periods to augment production althoug h the amount in storage at the beginning of the 20082009 winter heating season 3110 trillion cubic feet was less than last year at the comparable time it was still 50 billion cubic feet above the fiveyear average from 2003 through 2007 key factors in determining the accuracy of the stewfo projections are likely to be the weather the effect of what appears to be deteriorating economic condition and the level of oil prices colder winter than anticipated will drive up household consumption and costs especially in the normally colder climate areas warmer winter will drive consumption and costs down the level 4 energy information administration natural gas monthly and shortterm energy and winter fuels outlook 5 energy information administration

jobs and income would tend to depress consumption but natural gas used for heating and cooking is necessity for most consumers also it is unknown how deep the curr ent recession is likely to be oil prices are loosely linked to natural gas prices historically the linkage was through fuel substitution however fuel oil is now only minor competitor to natural gas in terms of fuel substitution more recently the price linkage is based on energy content oil prices have been volatile reaching high of over 147 per barrel in the summer of 2008 but falling into the 80 per barrel range at the beginning

the midwest and 317 in the west diesel fuel product almost identical to home heating oil has been more expensive than gasoline recently and at the beginning of the 20082009 winter heating season averaged about 040 per gallon more than gasoline this price differential has resulted from us refiners emphasis on gasoline production and high level of world demand for diesel fuel the costs of gasoline diesel fuel and heating oil are all directly related to the price of crude oil the energy information administration eia estimates that about 73 of the cost of gasoline is crude oil cost and 64 of the cost of diesel fuel and heating oil is crude oil cost inventories of home heating oil were affected by hurricanes gustav and ike at the start of the winter heating season inventories were at approximately 122 million barrels while this level is some 12 million barrels less than the available amount at the beginning of the 20072008 winter heating season it is still near the fiveyear average as result price spikes are not expected to arise from inventory problems the key risk factor for consumers of home heating oil is the price of oil oil prices have been volatile in 2008 the

december 2008 heating oil expenditures could be even less than projected if the price of oil spikes to levels above projected values the stewfo could underestimate expenditures with deteriorating

number of propane consumers to decline by about 11 during 2008 and 2009 however expenditure decreases for this heat source are less than those expected for home heating oil consumers consumption is expected to increase but the price decreases expected for propane about 143 are less than those expected for heating oil 235 propane supply is unique compared to the other fuels covered in this report in the sense that it is byproduct and not directly produced the production of gasoline as well as natural gas give rise to propane supplies as result when the avai lability of those fuels is high so is the supply of propane propane production and inventories ar expected to be adequate to meet demand during the winter 20082009 heating season many of the same factors influence expected propane prices that affect natural gas and home heating oil prices however in this case the relationship is somewhat indirect because of the byproduct nature of propane propane prices are unlike the other fuels covered in this report affected by distance and dispersion of the consumer this is because the distribution process usually requires deliveries of relatively small quantities by truck to individual consumers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34714g25g146g151g157g142g155g561g8g158g142g149g156g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g156g561 g561

in 20082009 than in 20072008 this increase is as result of 65 higher prices for electricity as well as higher usage rates due to the expected colder temperatures eia expects overall electricity demand growth in 2008 to be about 1 and flat during 2009 as result little in the way of new demand will stress the generation and distribution system electricity prices are directly affected by the cost of

primary risk factors concerning the stewfo are the weather and economic conditions total household expenditures on heating are equal to the price that must be paid times the quantity of fuel used the weather measured by the number of heating degree days largely determines quantity of fuel used conservation in the form of reducing the temperature inside the house can also reduce the quantity of fuel consumed but for given desired temperature heating degree days is the key factor the 20082009 winter heating season is expected to be colder than recent winter seasons if the noaa forecast estimates turn out to over or under state the number of heating degree days the quantities demanded of heating fuels will fall or rise the other component of total expenditures price of fuel is determined by complex web of related prices and other economic variables in period of deteriorating economic conditions the key relationship may be that between the level of economic activity measured

markets at the beginning of the 20082009 winter heating season the price of crude oil has been observed to be below 50 per barrel decline of almost 66 compared to the recent peak prices lower price of crude oil directly reduces the price of home heating oil and propane natural gas prices that are linked to crude oil prices historically and by energy content also could be lower as result of lower oil prices this result is especially likely in market environment of adequate storage domestic supply growth and reduced need for lng imports because natural gas is primary fuel in electricity
