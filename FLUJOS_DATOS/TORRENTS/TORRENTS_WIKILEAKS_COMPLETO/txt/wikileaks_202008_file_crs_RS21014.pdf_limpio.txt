revenue effects of permanent and temporary capital gains tax cuts jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance division summary during the 107th congress proposals were made to enact either temporary or permanent capital gains tax cut the former would probably gain revenue in the first 2 years but lose that revenue and more most likely within the following 3 years hr 3090 passed by the house would lower the top tax rate from 20 to 18 for assets held at least year the senate fi nance committee version of hr 3090 did not reduce capital gains taxes president bush s current dividend re lief proposal contains some capital gains relief as well capital gains tax cut appears the least likely of any permanent tax cut to stimulate the economy in the short run temporary capital gains tax cut is unlikely to provide any stimulus permanently lower capital gains taxes can contribute to economic efficiency in some wa ys and detract from it in others capital gains tax cuts would favor high income indi viduals with about 80 of the benefit going to the top 2 of taxpayers this repo rt will be updated to reflect legislative developments introduction recent proposals have been made to act capital gains tax cut and some arguments have been made th at such tax cuts are needed to stimulate the economy proposals include both temporary cuts in capita l gains taxes rates for 2 years as well as permanently lower rates interest in tax stimulus package has increased following the terrorist attack of september 11 and capital gains tax cut is one of number of tax cuts being discussed hr 3090 passed by the house on october 24 in 216214 vote would lower the top tax rate to 18 for ssets held year the senate finance committee version of hr 3090 which wa s approved by the committee on november 8 does not contain capital gains tax cut president bushs dividend relief proposal effectively contains prospective capital gains relief for corporate stock because it would increase basis attributable to retainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21014crs2 1 for description history and overview of capital gains taxes see crs report 96769e capital gains taxes an overview by jane g gravelle earnings that had been taxed eventually th is adjustment should eliminate much of capital gains on corporate stock under tax law prior to 2001 individuals were taxed on ordinary incomes at rates of 15 28 31 36 and 396 new 10 bracket will be added for 2002 and the top rates 28 and higher began to drop in 2001 eventually the 28 bracket will become 25 capitals gains on assets held for year or more however are and will continue to be absent legislative changes taxed at special rates the capital gains tax rate for individuals in the 28 or higher nor mal tax rate bracket is 20 assets acquired after 2000 and held for 5 years will then be s ubject to tax rate of 18 individuals in the 15 rate bracket are taxed at 10 or 8 for assets held for 5 years regardless of when acquired proposals have been made to reduce the 20 rate to 15 and the 10 rate to 75 one proposal would make th is change permanent another would provide temporary rate cut for 2 years hr 3090 reported out of the ways and means committee on october 12 would lower the 20 and 20 rates to 18 and 8 the vast majority of capital gains tax revenue is collected from individuals in the 28 regular income bracket or above this report focuses on the likely revenue effects and effects on the economy of such tax chan ges focusing on the proposed 15 rate although other issues are addressed as well1 revenue effects permanent tax cuts there is significant difference between the revenue effects of permanent and temporary capital gains tax cut past capital gains tax cuts such as the reduction in rates from 28 to 20 in 1997 have been estimated to gain revenue in the first 2 calendar years which may extend over 3 fiscal years and lose revenue thereafter this initial effect occurs because of realizations respons esincreases in realizations induced by the reduction in the tax rate these responses occur because of an unlocking effect individuals who might wish to sell their assets and invest in some preferred alternative either because they expect the rate of return to be higher or because the alternative asset has more desirable riskreturn tradeoff are locked in by the capital gains tax to shift to the new asset causes taxes to be paid earlier or in cases where assets were intended to be held indefinitely causes taxes to be paid at all lowering the rate allows an unlocking which tends to be more pronounced initially these induced realizations and the tax collected on them offset the static revenue loss however as the tax rate falls the induced response offset declin for two reasons first the responsiveness is estimated to be smaller at lower rates than at higher ones second the induced realizations are taxed at lower rates to illuminate these points in 1999 hr 2488 the financial fr eedom act passed the house with similar provision to cut the capital gains tax rate to 15 the provision which became effective in midyear was projected by the joint committee onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21014crs3 taxation to lose revenue of 07 billion in fy2000 and 38 billion in fy2001 the revenue loss then rose to 58 billion per annum and cumulated to 51 billion over 10 year period this revenue pattern can be contrasted with the effects of larger tax cut in 1997 from 28 to 20 which was estimated to ga in revenue in the first 3 fiscal years and was estimated at that time to cost 21 billion over 10 years while some increase in projected gains had occurred the difference between the initial year patterns and the cumulative total indicates that capital gains tax cut will be expected to cost considerably more for given amount of stimulus because of the lower starting point this provision is estimated to cost 10 billion over the next 10 years temporary tax cut temporary tax cut has additional nuances first the temporary tax cut may gain revenue in the initial years the unlocking response will be somewhat larger for certain types of assets because the slightly lower tax has made the tradeoff for currently taxing income more favorable that is there is larger incentive to realize gain today than with permanent tax cut because the tradeoff is between different rates as well as between rates of return and tax deferral this eff ect is somewhat offset because of complications with the 18 rate as described below secondly the lower rate can create an incentive for indivi duals to sell even if they would not otherwise desire to do so in the absence of tax considerations this effect occurs when the asset is expected to be sold relatively soon in any case otherwise without higher expected rate of return or other inducement the benefit of the lower rate is swamped by the loss of tax deferral similar event occurre d when the 1986 tax reform act was passed and higher 28 capital gains tax rate effective the next year became known in advance there was signif icant rise in capital gains realizations capital gains realizations rose from 422 of gdp in 1985 to 760 in 1986 and then fell to 32 in 1987 and continued to fall while it is hard to control for the different forces affecting capital gains it is clear that there was significant response while the prospect of higher rates caused jump in realizations this type of magnitude is not likely to be repeated for th is proposed tax cut this effect occurs not only because the differences between old and new rates are much smaller today than they were in 1986 but also because of the 18 rate any asset acqui red after 2000 and held for 5 years becomes eligible for an 18 ta x rate suppose the lower rate is adopted effective jan 1 2002 the arbitrage will be most successful if the sset sales are delayed until the end of the second year any assets held in 2003 will be pot entially eligible for the 18 tax rate if they were acquired after 2000 that is any assets held for less than 3 years assuming sale on the last day of 2003 if any of these assets are sold however they will have to restart the 5year holding period for that reason we calculate that all of the advantages for these assets would be for cases where there was an existing plan to sell before 5 years thus any shifting of taxes would occur in most cases within 5 years in less than 4 years for assets already held for year within 3 years for assets already held for 2 years and within 2 years for assets already held for 3 years if plans were to hold the asset for longer than those times realizing gains now would restart the clock on the 5year holding period and require such long er time to wait to qua lify that the deferral period would offset the advantage of the lower 15 tax bracket httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21014crs4 2 while simple life cycle models do not necessar ily support the notion that marginal propensities to spend permanent tax cut would vary acro ss individuals with different permanent income levels realistic modifications of the model do first lower income young individuals may be liquidity constrained so that they are prevente d from spending as much as they want because they cannot borrow against future income tax cut would be wholly spen t in that case second higher income individuals are more likely to ve higher lifetime savings rates and thus would save more of any marginal income because they are more likely to leave significant bequests recent study that finds evidence of higher marginal propensities to save among wealthy individuals is jonathan mccarthy imperfect insurance and differing propensities to consume across individuals journal of monetary economics vol 36 2 november 1995 3 these data are derived from joint committee on taxation estimates see crs report rl30317 capital gains dist ributional effects by jane g gravelle for further detailsit is possible to have longer periods for assets that were ac quired before 2000 which are not eligible for the 20 rate as was the case for assets in 1986 but these individuals also did not take advantage of previous arbitrage opportunity selling assets at the beginning of 2001 to take advantage of the 18 rate cut which makes it less likely that they would do so in this case effects on the economy permanent tax cuts fiscal policy can stimulate the econom in the short run only if it increases aggregate spending there are reasons to expect that capital gains tax cuts would have the smallest stimulative effect on the economy of virtually any fiscal stimulus option while fiscal stimulus delivered through direct spending has relatively straightforward effect fiscal stimulus delivered via personal tax cut tends to have more muted effect on the economy because only part of it will be spent the smaller the share spent the smaller the stimulus although for most types of tax cu ts the presumption is that most of the tax reduction will be spent there are two reasons that capital gains tax cut is less likely to be spent first there are both theoretical reasons and empirical evidence for the view that individuals with higher wealth would save larger portion of tax cut2 capital gains taxes are perhaps the most heavily concentrated among higher income and higher wealth individuals than virtually any other ta x for 1999 those with earnings over 200000 who constitute the top 18 of income account for 786 of capital gains taxes3 while the average capital gains tax paid for all returns was 476 the average for the highest income class was 20536 and the average for ll returns in the bottom half was less than 10 the capital gains tax is 45 of total federal income payro ll and excise taxes however it is 14 of total taxes in the highest income bracket and less than one half of 1 for the bottom 70 of the population fo r the income tax alone capital gains taxes are 81 of total income taxes but 162 of income taxes in the top income class in the bottom 70 of the distribution the capital gain s tax is less than 1 of income taxes secondly capital gains tax cut may in crease savings through incentive effects although most empirical evidence does not support large savings response httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21014crs5 4 this part of economic analysis is technica lly complicated and there is difference between average q and marginal q however fundamental outcome of this analysis is that tax rate change such as change in the individual or cor porate rate will not affect the long run valuation of the stock market for technical analysis see david romer advanced macroeconomics chapter 9 new york mcgrawhill 2001 both of these effects suggest that larger fraction of capital gains tax cut will likely be saved than would be the case with other ty pes of tax cuts and thus the capital gains tax cut is less likely to stimulate the economy note that there has always been tension between short run and long run fiscal policy measures that increase consumption are expansionary in the short run but may detract from growth in the long run because deficit finance causes aggregate savings to fall unless the economy is at such low ra of employment that the stimulus induces sufficient output to offset the loss in saving s that is government spending and tax reductions financed by deficits tend to crowd out investment in the long run there are exceptions however government investme nt spending such as spending on infrastructure may provide short run stimu lus without detracting much from long term growth and can even enhance longterm gr owth if the productivity of the government investment is greater than the productivity of private investments however it is often difficult to enact such spending in timely fashion subsidies directly to private investment spending such as investment credits may mitigate effects on growth because they may directly stimulate investment unfortunately the evidence supporting positive shortrun response of investment to stimulu s is very weak and such tax cut may be largely saved in the short run by reducing bt or paid out in dividends this effect may occur because firms are reluctant to add to the capital stock during period of excess capacity as is typical in recession whethe r subsidy that directly targets investment would be more likely to induce shortrun sp ending than subsidy that is directed at saving is uncertain however some macroeconomists have modeled capital gains tax cut as direct revenue stimulus perhaps because macromodels do not have direct lever to use to introduce capital gains tax cut this approach does not reflect however the appropriate transmission mechanism of capital gains tax cut which must first induce saving and only after lag might induce investment some modelers have also assumed an increase in stock market prices by capitalizing the tax into asset values while one might expect some upward pressure on stock market prices its magnitude is uncertain because capital gains tax cut also induces selling which causes downward pressure on prices any effect on stock prices is temporary however because economic pressu res cause asset prices to ad just back to reflect asset values with the period of tran sition dependent on the cost of adjustment this analysis reflects the standard view of investment modeling which fo cuses on the ratio of market value of assets to their costs tobins q4 finally note that many economists doubt the efficacy of any fiscal policy in countering recession because it is very di fficult to enact such stimulus in timely fashion and fiscal stimulus can be easily dissipated in an open economy with flexiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21014crs6 5 for further discussion see crs report rl30040 capital gains taxes innovation and growth by jane g gravelle exchange rates and international capital flow s through fall in net exports monetary policy may be more effectiv in such an environment temporary tax cut temporary tax cut differs from perm anent one as noted above it may raise revenue initially and then lose larger am ount of revenue in very short time horizon essentially it is the equivale nt of borrowing from high in come individuals at higher than market interest rate and re deeming the bonds relatively quickly for these reasons any explicit tax reduction will be delayed until the future when assets are sold with higher basis so that for those who believe that some portion of any cash flow derived from tax cut is spent this incentive will not occur until 3 to 5 years in the future or perhaps more there will be presentvalue tax benefit but it will be of negligible size temporary in nature and unlikely to have much effect on aggregate consumption because any income effects s hould be spread over long period of time because of the temporary nature of the tax cut there is permanent stimulus to invest in stocks person investing immediately and planning to hold an asset for at least one year to qualify for the long term rate but more than 2 years would receive some benefit but that is likely to be limited category of investments since there will be an incentive to sell assets but not an incentive to invest the more likely shortrun effect is to depress the stock market although such effects would probably be modest because of the modest size of the tax revision other issues three other issues not discussed in this report have played role in the capital gains tax debate and they primarily apply to permanent tax cuts the first is that capital gains tax cuts may increase economic efficiency by reducing the lockin effect of the tax and also by reducing the tax burden on corporate equity investment however capital gains are favored relative to dividends because of th lower tax rate on gains the deferral of the tax and the possibility of passing on gains untaxed at death and magnify that distortion capital gains tax cuts are ofte n criticized by some because th ey are particularly beneficial to the wealthy as noted above finally argu ments are made that wer capital gains taxes encourage entrepreneurship although it is di fficult to find empirical evidence to support this claim and most capital gains tax cuts go to owners of established large corporations and real estate5
