law division january 18 2006 abstract s 354 109th congress would preempt state law regarding some aspects of medical malpractice liability and liability for defective medical products including drugs it would not however preempt any state law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for health care providers health care organizations or sellers of medical products from liability

damageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs220751 s 354 is similar to hr 5 109th congress which the house passed without amendment on july 28 2005 hr 5 is examined in crs report rs22054 medical malpractice liability reform hr 5 109th congress by henry cohen the major differences between hr 5 and s 354 is that s 354 would 1 abolish the collateral source rule when applicable law does not allow for subrogation 2 include special protections for fdaapproved products 3 establish qualifications for expert witnesses and 4 preempt state caps on noneconomic and punitive damages when such caps are higher than the bills congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs22075 updated january 18 2006 medical malpractice liability

periodic payment of future damages this report will be updated if and wh congress takes action with respect to s 354 preemption of state laws medical malpractice suits are governed by state law but because they affect interstate commerce the us constitution would permit congress to regulate them and to preempt state laws that regulate them s 354 109th congress the help efficient accessible lowcost timely healthcar act of 2005 or the health act of 2005 would impose federal standards on some aspect s of medical malpractice suits but would leave other aspects to continue to be governed by state law1 actually s 354 would apply to all health care liability claims which it defines to include not only medicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22075crs2 2 the phrase medical malpractice in this report when used in reference to s 354 should be read to include all health care liability claims 3 crs report rl31692 medical malpractice liability refo rm legal issues and fiftystate survey of caps on punitive damages and noneconomic damages by henry cohen 4 s 354 provides that it would pr eempt higher caps and says nothing about whether it would preempt lower caps one might argue that the bill therefore would preempt lower caps because the supremacy clause of the constitution art vi cl 2 provides that federal laws shall preempt state laws but the better reading appears to be that the bills expressly preempting higher caps evinces an intention not to preempt lower caps 5 s 354 5c provides that for purposes of applying the 250000 cap future noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value this apparently means that if jury awards say 260000 in future noneconomic damages and such amount could be paid in the form of an annuity that costs 240000 the higher figure would control and the future noneconomic damages would be reduced to 250000 not to 240000malpractice suits but product lia bility suits that allege inju ries resulting from defective medical products which means defective drug or device intended for humans2 this report will summarize th main provisions of s 354 and will do so not in the order of the bills sections but in the or der of the following subjects that the bill addresses 1 cap on noneconomic damages 2 standard for and cap on punitive damages 3 limiting joint and several liability 4 abolishing the collateral source rule 5 limiting lawyers contingent fees 6 cr eating federal stat ute of limitations 7 periodic payment of future damages and 8 expert witnesses another crs report without making reference to any particular legislation di scusses these same subjects in the same order explaining the legal concepts each involves in greater depth than the present report does and offeri ng pros and cons of each3 even with respect to those aspects of medical malpractice suits on which s 354 would impose federal standards s 354 would not preempt every state law it would not preempt any state law that imposes greater pr ocedural or substantive protections such as shorter statute of limitati ons for health care providers health care organization or the manufacturer distributor supplier market er promoter or selle r of medical product from liability loss or damages than those provided by this act 11c2a in addition its caps on noneconomic and punitive damages would preempt only state caps that are higher than the bills 11b24 1 cap on noneconomic damages s 354 5b would impose 250000 cap on noneconomic damages in any health care lawsuit regardless of the number of pa rties against whom the action is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with resp ect to the same occurrence as noted above this cap would apply only in states that have cap or higher cap5 economic damages refer to monetary losses that result from an injury such as medical expenses lost wages and rehab ilitation costs s 354 woul d not cap economic damages noneconomic damages consist primarily of damages for pain and suffering both economic and noneconomic damages are compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22075crs3 6 see crs report rl31721 punitive damages in medical malp ractice actions burden of proof and standards for awards in the fifty states by henry cohen and ta ra alexandria rainson2 standard for and ca p on punitive damages s 354 8a provides that punitive da mages may be awar ded if otherwise permitted by state law if th claimant proves by clear nd convincing evidence that the defendant acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant or deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that the defendant knew the claima nt was substantially certain to suffer s 354 would thus preempt st ate law regarding the burden of proof and standard for awarding punitive damages except in states that provide greater protection for defendants6 s 354 8b2 would also impose cap on punitive damages of 250000 or two times the amount of economic not of all compensatory damages awarded whichever is greater as with s 354s cap on nonecono mic damages the cap on punitive damages would apply only in states that have cap or higher cap s 354 8c provides health care provider who prescribes or who dispenses pursuant to prescription drug or devi ce including blood products approved by the food and drug administration sh all not be named as party to product liability lawsuit invoking such drug or device this means that doctors and pharmacists could not be held liable for prescribing or dispensing defective drug or device they could still be held liable for negligently prescribing or dispensing non defective drug or device as an action alleging such negligence w ould not be product liability lawsuit 3 limiting joint and several liability s 354 5d would eliminate joint and several liability in medical malpractice suits joint and several liability is the commonlaw rule that if more than one defendant is found liable for plaintiffs injuries th each defendant may be held 100 percent liable with joint and several liability the plaintiff may not recover more than once but may recover all his or her damages from fewer than all liable defendants with any defendant who pays more than its share of the damages entitled to seek contribution from other liable defendants the main argument for eliminating joint and several liability is that it allows plaintiff to recover his entire damage aw ard from deep pocket defendant who was only minimally liable the main argument for retaining joint and several liability is that it is preferable for wrongdoer to pay more than its share of the damages than for an injured plaintiff to recover less than the full compensation to which he is entitled 4 abolishing the collateral source rule the collateral source rule is the commonlaw rule that allows an injured party to recover damages from the defendant even if he is also entitled to receive them from third party collateral source such as health insurance company an employer or the government to abolish the collateral sour ce rule would be to llow or require courtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22075crs4 to reduce damages by amounts plaintiff recei ves or is entitled to receive from collateral sources often collateral source such as health insurer or the government has right of subrogation against the tortfeasor the person responsible for the injury this means that the collateral source takes over the injured partys right to sue the tortfeasor for up to the amount the collateral source owes or has paid the injured party though the collateral source rule may enable the plaintiff to r ecover from both his insu rer and the defendant the plaintiff if there is subrogation must reimburse his insurer the amount it paid him if the collateral source rule were eliminated then the defendant would not have to pay the portion of damages paid by collateral source and the collateral source would apparently not be able through subrogati on to recover the amount it paid the plaintiff in the medical malpractice context therefore eliminating the collateral source rule would benefit liability insurers at the expense of health insurers and other collateral sources s 354 7a provides the amount of an damages received by claimant in any health care lawsuit shall be reduced by the court by the amount of any collateral source benefits to which the claimant is entitled less any insurance premiums or other payments made by the claimant or by the spouse pare nt child or legal guardian of the claimant to obtain or secure such benefits this provision would not apply however if the collateral source has right of recovery by reimbursement or subrog ation s 354 does not specify how the courts should deter mine the amount of insurance premiums paid to obtain the collateral source benefits perhaps one years premium would be found appropriate 5 limiting lawyers contingent fees contingent fee is one in which lawyer instead of charging an hourly fee for his services agrees in exchange for represen ting plaintiff in tort suit to accept percentage of the recovery if the plaintiff wi ns or settles but to receive nothing if the plaintiff loses payment is thus contingent upon there being recovery plaintiffs agree to this arrangement in order to afford repr esentation without having to pay anything out ofpocket lawyers agree to it despite the risk of not being compensated because the percentage they receive if they win or ttle usually from 33 to 40 percent generally amounts to more than an hourly fee would s 354 5 would impose cap with s liding scale in medical malpractice cases 40 of the first 50000 the plaintiff recovered 33 of the next 50000 25 of the next 500000 and 15 of any additional amount 6 creating federal statute of limitations the statute of limitations the period within which lawsuit must be filed for medical malpractice suits under state law is ty pically two or three years starting on the date of injury sometimes however the symptoms of an injury do not appear immediately or even for years after malpractice occurs many states therefore have adopted discovery rule under which the st atute of limitations starts to run only when the plaintiff discovers or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered his injury or sometimes his injury and its causehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22075crs5 7 by the tolling of time the bill apparently mean s that the statute would be tolled ie the time period would not start to run if the plai ntiff had been unable to discover his injury because of fraud intentional concealment or the presence of foreign body 8 hrept 10832 part 2 mar 11 2003 at 28 9 see eg federal rule of civil procedure 8cs 354 4 provides that the time for the commencement of health care lawsuit shall be three years after the date of manifestation of injury or one year after the claimant discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury whichever occurs first however the time for commencement of health care lawsuit shall not exceed three years after the date of manifestation of injury unless the tolling of time was delayed as result of 1 fraud 2 intentional concealment or 3 the presence of foreign body which has ther apeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect in the person of the injured person7 this provision rather than imposing time limitation that begins on the date of injury or on the date of discovery of the injury would cut off the right to sue upon the earlier of two different periods three years and one year that begin respectively on the date of manifesta tion of injury and discovery of the injury s 354 defines neither term but commenting on substantively iden tical provision in its report on hr 5 108th congress the house committee on energy and commerce explained the former term the term manifestation of injury means the injury has become reasonably evident thus if someone unknowingly r eceives tainted blood manifestation of injury is not the date of receiving the blood instead it is the date on which adverse symptoms become reasonably evident8 the discovery of the injury then would pparently occur on the date that the patient learns that his blood is tain ted which date may not occu r until after manifestation of injury suppose that medical tests reveal the tainted blood one year after the plaintiff experienced his first symptoms there would still be two years to run on the threeyear manifestation period but the pl aintiff would apparently have to sue within one year of discovering that his blood is tainted even if it takes more than one year to learn that his blood is tainted as result of transfusion patient could also pparently discover his injury perhaps through routine medical st before symptoms become manifest and again the oneyear discovery pe riod would apparently apply s 354 has separate period of limitations for minors an action by minor shall be commenced within three years from the date of the alleged manifestation of injury except that if such minor is under the full age of six years such action shall be commenced within three years of the manife station of injury or prior to the eighth birthday of the minor whichever pr ovides longer period it is not clear whether the above time limitati ons are strictly speaking statutes of limitations s 354 does not call them that statute of limitations is typically an affirmative defense which means that the defendant must raise it if the defendant fails to raise it then the plaintiff may sue regardless of how much time has passed9 s 354 by contrast could be interpreted to place the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that his injury occurred within the time period allowedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22075crs6 10 annotation propriety and effect of structured settlements whereby damages are paid in installments over period of time and atto rneys fees arrangements in relation thereto 31 alr4th 95 96 11 victor schwartz doctors delight attorneys dilemma legal times healthcare law supplement feb 28 1994 at 307 periodic payment of future damages traditionally damages are paid in lump sum even if they are for future medical care or future lost wages in recent years however attorneys for both parties in damages actions have occasionally foregone lump sum settlements in favor of structured settlements which give the plaintiff steady series of payments over period of time through the purchase of an annuity or through selffunding by an institutional defendant10 s 354 9 provides in any health care lawsuit if an award of future damages without reduction to present value equaling or exceeding 50000 is made against party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund periodic payment of such judgment the court shall at the request of any party enter judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by periodic payments in accordance with the uniform periodic payment of judgments act promulgated by the na tional conference of commissioners on uniform state law though this provision states that an awar d of future damages shall not be reduced to present value to determine whet her it equals or exceeds the 50000 minimum necessary for party to require the court to order periodic payments it does not state whether the amount of the award of future da mages would be converted to present value not to require such conversion could be very major change significantly reducing awards if it is intended to allow defendant to pay for example 1 million award over 10year period at 100000 year on the othe r hand if it requires the jury award to be converted into present value terms an nnuity with present value of 1 million the reform doesnt mean that much as practical matter the defendant would be paying the same amount as before11 the defendant that is would have to spend 1 million for an annuity that as it earned interest over the year s of its distribution would yield the plaintiff more than 1 million had the defendant paid the plaintiff lump sum of 1 million then the plaintiff could have pur chased that same annuity 8 expert witnesses s 354 6c provides in part indi vidual shall be qualified to testify as an expert witness concerning the issue of negligence in any health care lawsuit unless he is appropriately credentialed typically treats the condition at issue and demonstrates that he is substantially familiar with applicable standards of care and practice as they relate to the act or omission which is the subject of the lawsuit on the date of the incident
