constitution grant to the national government and reserve to the states and the people during the 211year history of the constitution these issues have been debated time and again and have shaped and been shaped by the nations political social and economic history during the prefederalism period the country waged war for independence and established confederation form of government that created league of sovereign states deficiencies in the articles of confederation prompted its repeal and the ratification of new constitution creating federal system of government comprised of national government and states almost immediately upon its adoption issues concerning state sovereignty and the supremacy of federal authority were hotly debated and ultimately led to the civil war the period from 1789 to 1901 has been termed the era of dual federalism it has been characterized as an era during which there was little collaboration between the national and state governments cooperative federalism is the term given to the period from 1901 to 1960 this period was marked by greater cooperation and collaboration between the various levels of government it was during this era that the natio nal income tax and the grantinaid system were authorized in response to social and economic problems confronting the nation the period from 1960 to 1968 was called creative federalism by president lyndon johnsons administration president johnsons creative federalism as embodied in his great society program was by most scholars assessments major departure from the past it further shifted the statenational power relationship toward the national government through the expansion of grantinaid systems and the increasing use of regulations contemporary federalism the period from 1970 to the present has been characterized by shifts in the intergovernmental grant system the growth of unfunded federal mandates concerns about federal regulations and continuing disputes over the nature of the federal system some of the major disputes during this period were decided by the supreme court which ruled more often than not in favor of the

declaration of independence and eight years after ratific ation of the articles of confederation which established league of sovereign states the nation repealed the articles of confederation and ratified new constitution creating the united states since its ratification the constitution which established union of states under federal system of governance two questions have generated considerable debate what is the nature of the union what powers privileges duties and responsibilities does the constitution grant to the national government and reserve to the states and to the people during the 211year history of the constitution the answers to these questions have been debated time and again and have shaped and been shaped by the nations political social and economic history what is federalism according to james q wilson and john diiulio jr it is system of government in which sovereignty is shared between two or more levels of government so that on some matters the national government is supreme and on others the states regions or provincial governments are supreme1 there are three essential features that characterize federal system of governance first there must be provision for more than one level of government to act simultaneously on the same territory and on the same citizens the american federal system is composed of national government and the 50 states both recognized by the constitution local governments within states while not mentioned in the constitution are nevertheless key players in american federalism their power to regulate and legislate is derived from state constitutions second each government must have its own authority and sphere of power though they may overlap when state and federal authority conflict federal law is supreme under the constitution article i sec 8 of the constitution delegates certain enumerated powers to the national government that include the exclusive power to mint currency establish and maintain an army and navy declare war regulate interstate commerce establish post offices establish the seat of national government and enter into treaties the constitution reserves powers not granted to the national government to states or the people and it establishes certain concurrent powers to be shared between state and national governments including the power to tax in addition the constitution prohibits the exercise of certain powers or actions by both state and national govern ments including taking private land without justhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30772crs2 compensat ion establishing national religion or prohibiting the free exercise of religion third neither level of government federal or state governments can abolish the other the civil war was fought not only on the question of slavery but also central to the conflict were question s of states sovereignty including the power to nullify federal laws or dissolve the union this report identifies several significant eras and events in the evolution of american federalism and provides capsule description or discussion of each it should be noted that among experts in the field of federalism there may be general consensus concerning the evolution of american federalism however the choice of events and scholarly interp retations of such events may vary and are by nature subjective prefederalism period 1775 to 1789 during this period the former colonists successfully fought the war of independence and established national gove rnment under the articles of confederation disenchanted with the functioning of the national government the states called constitutional convention with the aim of addressing the deficiencies in the articles of confederation instead the delegates drafted and the states ratified new constitution that created federal system of government 1776 declaration of independence in the midst of the revolutionary war which lasted from 1775 to 1783 delegates to the continental congress convened in philadelphia and on july 4 1776 adopte d the declaration of independence each of the former colonies also established state governments to replace the colonial charters the continental congress was given the power to carry on the war effort 1777 drafting articles of confederation the continental congres s drafted the articles of confederation which defined the powers of the congress leery of strong central government the former colonists created confederation or league of states that was statecentered rather than nationcentered 1781 articles of confederation approved by the states under the articles of confederation legislative judicial and executive powers rested with congress the articles of confederation established congress comprised of one representative from each state it limited the power of the central government and it delegated to the states the power to levy taxes and regulate commerce the confederation congress was given the power to declare war make treaties and maintain an army and navy the articles of confederation had several noteworthy flaws that made it ineffective 1 it did not provide for an executive to administer the government 2 the national governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30772crs3 lacked the power to tax and 3 it lacked the power to regulate commerce 1786 articles of confederation reconsidered demand for re examination of the articles of confederation was prompted by post revolutionary war economic depression rebellion in massachusetts among debt ridden former soldiers led by daniel shays shays rebellion concerns about the ability of the confederation to support its currency or meet domestic and foreign debt incurred during the war issues surrounding westward expansion and state tariff conflicts group later known as federalists led by alexander hamilton john jay and james madison sought support for strong central government that could deal with internal insurrections arbitrate state tariff conflicts and other conflicts among states and manage westward expansion members of the group called for constitutional convention in 1787 to reconsider the articles of confederation 1787 drafting new constitution constitutional convention met in philadelphia from may until septemb er and drafted new constitution under the new constitution the central government in order to form more perfect union was given additional powers that included the power to levy taxes and control commerce among states and with foreign countries in addition the convention created three coequal branches of government executive judicial and legislative in compromise connecticut compromise between rival plans offered by virginia and new jersey delegates the constitution called for the creation of legislative branch composed of two chambers members of the house of representative from each state were to be elected by the people of that state based on state population the senate would be comprised of two senators from each state elected by their respecti ve state legislatures the constitution included provisions that ensured the supremacy of federal laws article vi but also recognized state powers and the power of the people amendment x 1787 1788 campaigning for new constitution the federalist series of 85 essays by alexander hamilton john jay and james madison writing under the pen name publius was published during this period the papers provided the philosophical underpinning in support of the new constitution those opposed to the new constitution labeled anti federalists but calling themselves federal republicans also published articles under the pen names brutus and cato arguing for support of federal system of governance that would protect the state governments from the tyranny of the national government the anti federalists or federal republicans woul d eventually evolve into the democratic republican party that ascended to power with the election of thomas jefferson in 1801 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30772crs4 dual federalism phase i 1789 to 1865 the concept of dual federalism is the idea that the national and state governments were equal partners with separate and distinct sphere s of authority despite the doctrine of implied powers as first enunciated in mcculloch v maryland the federal or national governm ent was limited in its authority to those powers enumerat ed in the constitution there existed little collaboration between the national and state governments and occasional tensions over the nature of the union and the doctrine of nullification and state sovereignty the states rights debate and the nature of the union whether the constitution created league of sovereign states or an inseparable union was major issue in the civil war 1789 constitution approved by the states state ratifying conventions convened and ratified the new constitution which required 34ths 9 of the states to vote for its approval 1789 to 1801 the federalist period the period takes its name from the dominant political party of the time which believed in strong central government its leaders included george washington alexander hamilton john adams they were opposed by antifederalists or democratic republicans such as thomas jefferson who argued against strong central government and for statecentered governance in 1790 the federal government assumed responsibility for the war debt which some have called an early form of federal aid in 1791 the first ten amendmentsthe bill of rightswere added to the constitution after being ratified by 34ths of the states the tenth amendment protected the rights of the states and declared that all powers not expressly delegated to the central government by the constitution were reserved for the states this laid the foundation for the concepts of states rights limited nationa l government and dual spheres of authority between state and national governments in 1791 congress established the bank of the united states at the urging of alexander hamilton thomas jefferson opposed the idea of nationa l bank congress granted the bank 20year charter protracted debate over the constitutionality of the bank by pro and antibank factions led to the defeat of an effort to renew the banks charter in 1811 the charter renewal effort was defeated partly because of the restraints the bank put on state chartered private banks in an effort to control inflation and because some viewed the concept of central banking as attack on state sovereignty years later the central or national bank controversy was at the center of the debate concerning the enumerated powers clause of the tenth amendment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30772crs5 2 1 stat 571 and 1 stat 577 3 1 stat 5961798 the doctrine of nullification federalistcontrolled congress in 1798 passed the alien2 and sedition3 acts in an attempt to silence jeffersonian democraticrepublican critics of the undeclared war with france in response democraticrepublican controlled legislatures in kentucky and virginia passed resolutions supporting the concept of statecentered federalism and nullifying the acts as unconstitutional the doctrine of nullification held that any state could suspend within its boundaries the operation or implementation of any federal law it deemed to be unconstitutional the alien and sedition acts played large part in the defeat of the federalist party they expired before the supreme court could hear challenge to them 1800s internal improvement debate during this period there was significant debate concerning the role of the national government in the provision of roads and canals as means of encouraging settlement and aiding commerce the debate raised questions about whether the national government could participate in such activities witho ut constitutional amendment that provided explicit authority or whether such activities should be undertaken solely by states and private concerns 1815 states rights doctri ne the hartford convention which was called to protest the economi c hardships endured by new england states during the war of 1812 attempted to assert the states rights doctrine the convention urged states to protect citizens against the acts of congress not authorized in the constitution 1819 doctrine of implied powers and the necessary and proper clause of article i of the constitution in 1816 the central bank was rechartered as the second bank of the united states in 1819 the constitutionality of congress authority to charter national bankthe

justice john marshall in writing the supreme courts unanimous decision in support of congress constitutional authority to establish national bank acknowledged that the national government was limited to powers enumerated in the constitution expressed powers but stated that article i also allowed the national government congress to pass such laws necessary and proper to carry out powers and duties enumerated by the constitution thus the establishment of national bank though not explicitly sanctioned by the constitution nonetheless was an appropriate activity under the doctrine of implied powers

creation of the people and not the states and that article vi established federal law as the supreme law of the land supremacy clause justice marshall wrote that the power to tax involves the power to

involved dispute over the use of the hudson river the new york state legislature had granted company the exclusive right to the use of the river that was in conflict with congress granting of license

of the united states was the venue in which senators robert hayne of south carolina and daniel webster of massachusetts debated the issue of state sovereignty concerning recent tariff act passed by

fugitive slave act constitutional 1860 the civil war testing federalism civil war addressed two central issues 1 the role of the federal government and 2 the nature of the union slavery accelerated tensions between nationcentered and statecentered concep t of the federal system on the one hand there were those who argued that the union was but league of sovereign states and that each state had the power to nullify federal laws within its boundaries or ultimately secede from the union on the other side were those who believed that the union was indestructible created not by the states but by the people delegating to the states and the national government certain limited authority enunciated in the constitution the question of the nature of the union was resolved in favor of nationcentered concept of federalism the role of the national government was also profoundly influenced by the civil war before the civil war the role of government was generally characterized by decentralization the national government acted as servant to the states during the war state militia and state recruited volunteers were replaced by policy of federal conscription and the national government reclaimed control over currency and banking whic h had been delegated in large part to the states during the 1830s dual federalism phase ii 1865 to 1901 although the era of dual federalism continued this period was marked by erratic but increasing presence of the national government into areas that had previously been the purview of the states the sherman antitrust act the interstate commerce commission act as well as the twelfth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments were significant events that pushed federal autho rity into areas such as the power to regulate business and the economy as well as civil rights in the midst of the industrial revolution in an effort to control the monopolistic tendencies of business congress passed legislation that attempted to control commerce congress

interpretation of the fourteenth amendments equal protection due process and privileges and immunities clauses in series of cases including plessy v ferguson and bradwell v illinois the court rulings upheld state laws restricting the freedoms and constitutional protections of certain gender or racial classes women and minorities 1868 due process and equal protection clauses of the constitution the fourteenth amendments due process and equal protection clauses strengthened federal judicial powers the amendment originally drafted to protect the newly freed slaves from arbitrary and capricious state actions was used to constrain the unfair practices of businesses according to some scholars the amendment which granted congress the power to enforce its substantive provisions laid the foundation for future federal expansion 1873 doctrine of states rights revived slaughterhouse cases18 and bradwel l v illinois 19 the supreme court played pivotal role in two civil rights cases that tested the privileges and immunities clause of the fourteenth amendment the supreme court in its rulings in the slaughterhouse cases and bradwell v illinois noted that state and national citizenship were separate and distinct in the slaughterhouse cases the supreme court upheld the state of louisianas right to confe r upon one company the right to butcher cattle in the city of new orleans thus creating monopoly in the operation of slaughterhouses in bradwell v illinois the supreme court held that state could bar women from the practice of law the courts rulings in these and other cases

courts ruling allowed state to determine standards under which persons would gain the right to vote the application of literacy tests had discriminatory impact on blacks cooperative federalism 1901 to 1960 this period marked an era of greater cooperation and collaboration between the various levels of government it was during this era that the national income tax and the grantinaid system were authorized in response to social and economic problems confronting the nation though the first part of the 20th century has been characterized by some federalism scholars as one of inactivity by 1920 eleven grant programs had been created and funded at cost of 30 million during this period the federal government was seen as servant of the states in the kinds of activities funded the federal grant system spurred by the great depression was expanded and fundame ntally changed the power relations between federal and state governments 1910 new nationalism president theodore roosevelts new nationalism initiative sought to expand the powers of the national governmen t his view of government contended that matters of national concern had become too decentralized or as he stated the new nationalism is still more impatient of the impotence which springs from overdivision of governm ental power the impotence which makes it possible for local selfishness or for legal cunning hired by

state and local governments creative federalism 1960 to 1968 president lyndon johnsons creative federalism as embodied in his great society program was by most scholars assessments major departure

supreme court forces reapportionment the supreme courts ruling in baker v carr32 is noted example of judicial intervention into state political affairs on constitutional grounds the tennessee general assembly had not reapportioned legislative districts since 1901 despite state constitutional requirement to apportion according to population the migration of people from rural to urban areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30772crs13 without legislative districts being redrawn to reflect population shifts had resulted in city residents being underrepresented in the state legislature the supreme court required the reapportionment of legislative districts based on population proportional representation the supreme court ruled that the denial of equal representation districts equal in population size was violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment based on standards established by the supreme court every state except oregon was forced to reapportion to achieve districts equal in population another legacy of baker v carr was the reinvigoration of the practice of gerrymandering of legislative districts after each decennial census in order to achieve or maintain some political advantage 1964 creative federalism and the great society creative federalism and the great society sought to expand the national governments role in an effort to achieve socially desirable outcomes ie reductions in poverty elimina tion of hunger prior to the johnson administration federal involveme nt often had to be justified as necessary evil in order to legitimize intrusion into state and local affairs under the new theory federal involvement was justified as long as congress could establish national purpose for such actions the great society programs used states and local governments as intermediaries or agents to implement national policie s and the volume of federal regulations increased as the federal government became increasingly involved in areas that had previously been the purview of state and local governments or the private sector contemporary federalism 1970 to 2000 this period has been characterized by shifts in the intergovernm ental grant system the growth of unfunded federal mandates concerns about federal regulations and continuing disputes over the nature of the federal system 1970s new federalism phase i during the 1960s concerns were raised about the intergovernmental grant system particularly about duplication fragmentation overlap and confusion these concerns resulted in attempts by the richard nixon and gerald ford administrations to redirect power relations within the federal system the administrations principal tools were revenue sharing and the consolidation of federal aid programs into six special revenue sharing programs the intent was to shift funds authority and responsibility to states and local governments in an effort to more effectively manage the intergovernmental grant system though

ii initiatives of the ronald reagan administration stimulated the debate on the appropriate roles of federal state and local government president ronald reagan rather than attempt to more rationally manage federal aid as was the case in the nixon administration sought to funda mentally restructure the system of governance in his 1981 inaugural address president reagan raised an issue as old as the republic what is the nature of the union the president stated that the federal government did not create the states the states created the federal government35 this stateme nt expressed the sentiments found in the virginia and kentucky resolutions the websterhayne debate the doctrine of nullification and state sovereignty and the states rights philosophy the modern debate has also been fueled by dissatisfaction with the effectiveness and efficienc of the national government in 1981 congress passed the omnibus budget reconciliation act that consolidated number of social programs into nine block grants which allowed for greater state and local autonomy and flexibility in the fashioning of local strategies to address federal objectives the administration was not successful in the second phase of new federalism which would have reallocated federal and state responsibility and resources for welfare food stamps and medicare and would have turned back revenue sources to the states

significant impacts on federalism according to some scholars one under garcia the supreme court held that the tenth amendment does not protect state and local governments from compliance with the fair

majority in both houses of congress taking control of the house of representatives after 40 years in the minority the new republican majority moved quickly to fulfill its contract with america among the accomplishments of the 104th congress was the passage of the unfunded federal mandate reform act of 1995 pl 1044 which requires the federal gove rnment to assess the costbenefit impact of federal legislation and regulat ions on states local governments and the private sector the congress also considered but failed to win passage of balance budget amendment that if approved by the states would

involving federal preemption of state taxing authority and federal grant management in 1998 congress passed the internet tax freedom act pl 105 277 which was included in omnibus conso lidated

the internet nondiscrimination act of 2000 but the bill was not acted upon by the senate the legislation would have preempted states that sought to tax revenue generated from such economic activity several groups representing state and local officials and led by the national conference of state legislators opposed the moratorium and instead called for voluntary multistate system to collect and admin ister existing sales and use taxes for internet commerce the congressional preemption removed that proposal as possible option for the states in 1999 congress also considered and passed the

governmental responsibilities between the national government and the states46 in that regard the order sought to strike balance between the rights and responsibiliti of the states with the authority of the national government47 the order also sought to ensure that the principles of federalism established by the framers guide the executive departments and agencies in the formulation and implementation of policies48 the order built upon provisions in two revoked orders eo 12612 issued by president reagan on october 30 1987 and eo 12875 issued by president clinton on october 28 1993

officials in discussions prior to the release of proposed regulations or legislation the order succeeded eo 13083 which was criticized on number of grounds notably that it lacked sufficient input from state and local gover nments and emphasized the supremacy of the national government the criticism and controversy pitted state and local officials and their advoca tes in congress against the

the order was legislation prohibiting the expenditure of funds for its implementation51 and the introduction of measure to enact alternative policy52 judicial strengthening of states rights the supreme court emerged as major arbiter for determining the character and direction of contemporary american federalism the courts emergence in this regard was due primarily to its interpretations of the interstate commerce clause and the tenth and eleventh amendments while all of the cases handled by the court did not favor states rights the trend was one of siding with the states and against the
