legislation in the 109th congress by charles doyle without the footnotes appendices or most of the citations to authority found in the longer reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22433crs2 procedural adjustments the reauthorization act changes procedures associated with federal capital cases including those relating to air piracy cases arising before 1994 and habeas procedur for state capital petitioners pre1994 capital air piracy cases in the early 1970s the us supreme court held unconstitutional the imposition of capita l punishment under the procedures then employed by the federal government nd most of the states in 1974 congress established revised procedure for imposition of the death penalty in certain air piracy cases in 1994 when congress made the proce dural adjustments necessary to revive the death penalty as sentencing option for othe r federal capital offenses it replaced the air piracy procedures with those of the new reg ime at least one court however held that the new procedures could not be applied retroactively to air piracy cases occurring after the 1974 fix but before the 1994 legislation in the absence of an explicit statutory provision the reauthorization act adds an explicit provision to the end of the 1994 legislation hr 1763 and hr 3060 contain comparable provisions habeas corpus in state capital cases federal law provides expedited habeas corpus procedures for state death ro w inmates in those states that qualify for application of the procedures and have opted to ta ke advantage of them as of enactment of the reauthorization act pparently few if any states had sought and been found qualified to opt in under the r eauthorization act states opti n or have optedin as of the date past or present upon which the attorn ey general determines they established or have established qualifying assistance of counsel mechanism the earlier provision required that the mechanism in clude competency standards for appointed counsel the reauthorization act remove d the requirement but gran ted the attorney general regulatory authority sufficient to establish such standards the act establishes novo standard of review for the attorney generals determination before the dc circuit the streamlined procedures acts in the h ouse and senate hr 3035 and s 1088 would make similar changes in the opt in procedure s 956 hr 2388 and hr 3132 housepassed legislation is noted in italics contain common amendment governing federa l habeas cases of an individual convicted under state law of killing child proposed 28 usc 2254 habeas under section 2254 would have been unavailable in such cases ex cept for claims that both 1 relied on new constitutional interpretation made retroactively applicable by the supreme court or on evidence that the petitioner could not reasonable have been previously discovered and 2 were predicated upon facts in the face of wh ich reasonable judge or jury would have found the petitioner guilty but for the constitu tional error proposed 28 usc 2254j1 2 under the bills judicial consideration of claims that meet the dual criterion would have been expedited additional procedural proposals venue several antigang bills purport to change the place where capital cases may be tried s 155 hr 970 hr 1279 and hr 4472 contain the same provision that would have rewritten 18 us c 3235 section 3235 provides that where possible capital cases shoul d be tried in the county in which the crime occurred the proposal would have repealed the county trial lang uage of section 3235 and replaced it with language reminiscent of the multidistri ct terms of section 3237a the trial of any offense punishable by d eath shall be held in the district where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense began continued or was completed b if the offense or related conduct under subsection involves activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22433crs3 which affect interstate or foreign commerce or the importation of an object or person into the united states such offense may be prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred proposed 18 usc 3235 the proposal would have operated subject to two constitutional provisions and two supreme court cases which construe them mitigating and aggravating factors the death penalty may be imposed in federal capital case only after consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in 18 usc 3592 and only if at least one aggravating factor is found several bills would have adjusted the factors one of the aggravating factors in homicide cases consists of the fact that the death resulted from the commission of list of designated felonies the adam walsh child protection and safety act adds 18 usc 2245 to the list 18 usc 3591c1 among the proposal s that failed to secu re final passage hr 3860 would have added 18 usc 2245 sexua l abuse resulting in death to the list proposed 18 usc 3591c1 hr 3060 would have placed 18 usc 2339d receipt of military training from foreign terrorist organization on the list and hr 5040 would have done the same and so added 18 usc 241 civil rights conspiracy 245 deprivation of federally prot ected activities 247 interferen ce with religious exercise 1512 tampering with federal witnesses and 1513 re taliating against fe deral witnesses proposed 18 usc 3592c1 both hr 3060 and hr 5040 would have made obstruction of justice an aggravating factor in homicide cases proposed 18 usc 3592c17 other procedural proposals hr 3060 would have allowed the court upon finding of good cause or agreement of the parties to proceed with capital sentencing jury of fewer than 12 members proposed 18 usc 3593b existing law requires agreement of the parties the bill also amends rule 24c of the federal rules of criminal procedure to allow for the selection of maximum of 9 alternate jurors and allows each side 4 peremptory alternate juror challenges when either 7 8 or 9 alternates are to be selected proposed frcrimp 24c the present rule calls for maximum of 6 alternates and affords the parties 3 alternate juror peremptory challenges these and other similar proposals passed the house initially as part of hr 3199 but were dropped in conference and were not part of th reauthorization act as passed hr 5040 would have struck the provision which outlaws the execution of the mentally retarded proposed 18 usc 3596c the omission although perhaps surprising to some appeared inconsequential since execution of the mentally retarded is constitutionally proscribed the bill also would have required notice to the government and would have permitted the government to request an independent mental health examination when defendant intends to enter mental retardation as mitigating factor for capital sentencing purposes proposed 18 usc 3593b the existing statute mentions such requirements presumably recourse to the proposed procedure would have been more infrequent in those cases wh ere the district cour t conducted pretrial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the mental retardation of the accused precluded imposition of the death penalty following an conviction present law permits capital jury to unanimously recommend senten ce of death or of imprisonment without possibility of release if they do not the court is to sentence the defendant to any lesser sentence authorized by law ie imprisonmen t for life or term of years hr 5040 would have provided that if the jury cannot agree on capita l recommenda tion new sentencing jury would have been empane led and the issue retried proposed 18 usc 3594 existing law specifically contemplates that the execution of federal capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22433crs4 sentences will be carried out in state facilities hr 5040 would have granted the attorney general regulatory implementing authority without exclusive reference to state facilities proposed 18 usc 3596 3597 the b ill also would have rewritten 18 usc 3005 whic h assures defendants two assigned counsel in capital cases the proposal would have made it clear that the statute only app lied when the government sought the death penalty and not in capital cases where it d elected not to do so proposed 18 usc 3005a the federal appellate courts are divided on the question over whether section 3005 now entitles defendant to the assistance of two attorneys in all capital cases or only in those in which the government actively seeks the death penalty the proposal also would have explicitly authorized the government to strike for cause potential jurors in capital cases whose opposition to the death pena lty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors proposed 18 usc 3005b the proposal borrowed language from supreme court cases indicating that potential juror may be struck if his views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath new federal capital offenses title iii of the reauthorization act designated the reducing crime and terrorism at americas seaports act creates three new federal capital offenses 1 18 usc 2282a devices or dangerous substances in waters of the united states likely to destroy or damage ships or to interfere with maritime causing death 2 18 usc 2283 transportation of explosive biol ogical chemical or radioactive or nuclear materials causing death and 18 usc 2291 destruction of vessel or maritime facility intentionally causi ng death two other port security bills would have suggested similar new death pe nalty offenses hr 2651 and s 378 as reported proposed 18 usc 2282a 2283 nd 2291 and third would have offered three slightly less comparable offenses hr 173 proposed 18 usc 1372 destruction of vessel or maritime facility if death results 2280a dev ices or substances in waters of the united states likely to destroy or damage ships if death results and 2282 malicious dumping if death results the bills drafted to counter gang violence hr 4472 hr 1279 hr 970 and s 155 frequently include two new federal death penalty ffenses one of the proposed offenses would have proscribed the use of interstate facilities with the intent to commit multiple murders and would have been capital offense where death results the other modeled after the provision that condemns the use of firear m during or in relation to crime of violence or drug offense would have outlawed crimes of violence committed during or in relation to drug traffickin g offense and makes the offense punishable by death if death results few other bills would have made it federal capital offense to kill police officer under various circumst ances for example hr 2363 would have outlawed killing peace officer and fleeing the country proposed 18 usc 1121c hr 1751 and hr 2194 would have prohibited mu rdering federally funded state or local law enforcement officers proposed 18 usc 1123 other proposed new federal capital offenses would have included 1 agroterrorism when death results proposed 18 usc 2339d s 1532 2 interference with federal disaster relief efforts if death results proposed 18 usc 1370 hr 3728 3 death resulting from violation of 18 usc 1590 t rafficking in persons that involves raping or kidnaping more than one person proposed 18 usc 1590 s 2437 4 death resulting from violation of proposed 18 usc 555 s 2611 that would have proscribed evading immigration customs or agricultural inspection at the border and 5 deathhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22433crs5 resulting from the commission of federal crimes of terrorism violations of 18 usc 175 biological weapons 175b biological mate rials 229 chemical weapons 831 nuclear materials or of 42 usc 2284 atomic weapons or conspi racies or attempts to commit such crimes or violations proposed 18 usc 2339e hr 3060 hr 5939 s 3882 s 3848 capital punishment for vi olation of existing crimes section 110 of the reauthorization act merges 18 usc 1992 2000 ed wrecking trains and 18 usc 1993 2000 ed attacks on mass transit into new 18 usc 1992 the train wreck offense was capital offense the mass trans it offense was not under the new section both are now capital offenses 18 usc 1992 the most common example of proposed death penalty sentencing option for an existing crime comes from some of the child safety bills many of which would have made the death penalty available where child dies as result the commission of federal crime of violence or some other federal crime 1 s 956 crime of violence proposed 18 usc 3559d 2 hr 2388 same 3 hr 3132 same 4 hr 4472 same and 5 hr 3860 vio lations of 18 usc ch110 sexual exploitation of children ch 117 transportati on of illegal sexual activity or 1591 sex trafficking in children proposed 18 usc 2245b cong ress adopted variation of this theme in the adam walsh child protection and safety act when it amended 18 usc 2245 to make murder federal capital offense when committed in the course of wider range of federal child sexual abuse offenses the gang bills generally would have rewritten the federal criminal gang statute 18 usc 521 to permit imposition of capital puni shment for deathresulting violation of the newly crafted provisions or of the travel act 18 usc 1952 hr 1279 proposed 18 usc 521 1952 s 155 proposed 18 usc 523 1952 hr 4472 proposed 18 usc 521 1952 see also hr 970 proposed 18 usc 523 hr 3060 hr 5939 s 2883 and s 3848 w ould have made capital offenses of several deathresulting terrorismrelated offenses that are now punishable by more than life imprisonment specifically proposed 18 usc 832 participating in foreign nuclear or other weapon of mass dest ruction programs proposed 18 usc 2332g antiaircraft missiles proposed 18 usc 2332h radiologi cal dispersal devices proposed 18 usc 175c smallpox virus and proposed 18 usc 42 usc 2272 atomic weapons it is possible that the drafters of hr 3060 also intended to treat receipt of military training from foreign terrorist organization 18 u sc 2339d like treason and espionage that is to make it capital offense even if death results from commission of the offense the statutes that outlaw treas on and espionage make them puni shable by death or term of imprisonment 18 usc 2381 794 s ection 3591a1 of the federal capital punishment procedures provides that treason or espionage are punishable by death if execution is found justified after considering the mitigating and aggrav ating factors listed in section 3592 section 3592b lists three aggravating factors for treason and espionage cases ie 1 the offender has prior espi onage or treason conviction 2 the offense involved grave risk to national security and 3 the offense i nvolve d grave risk of death violation of section 2339d is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years 18 usc 2339da hr 3060 would have made change in section 2339d buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22433crs6 it would have amended section 3591a1 of the capital proce dures provisions to say that violations of sections 2381 treason 794 esp ionage or 2339d terrorist training may be punished by death if execution is found ju stified after consider ing the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in section 3592 proposed 18 usc 3591a1 it also would have amended the list of 3592c aggravating factors to add fourth factor ie the defense involved substantial planning by the defendant proposed 18 usc 3592c4 assuming the conforming amendment to sec tion 2339d making it capital offense was an oversight and in spite of the proposal s caption addition of terrorism to death penalty offenses not resulting death it is not clear that the courts would permit imposition of the death penalty for viola tion of section 2339d unless the offense also involved first degree murder the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishment clause precludes imposing the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman by an individual already under sentence of life imprisonment at the time of the rape it precludes imposition of the death penalty even in the case of murder unless the defendant at least acted intentionally or acted with reckless indifference to human life while participating in felony involving mu rder and since the courts decision in furman v georgia it has never been called upon to approve and conseque ntly has never approved imposition of the death penalty for crime that did not involve murder moratorium hr 4923s 122 would have repealed federal death penalty provisions and barred imposition or execution of any capital sentence for violation of federal law it made men tion of capital punishment imposed for violation of state law hr 379 on the other hand would have t ten year moratorium on imposition and execution of capital sentences in any state in which an individual originally sentenced to death had subsequently been judicially f ound innocent it said nothing of capital punishment imposed or ex ecuted under federal law
