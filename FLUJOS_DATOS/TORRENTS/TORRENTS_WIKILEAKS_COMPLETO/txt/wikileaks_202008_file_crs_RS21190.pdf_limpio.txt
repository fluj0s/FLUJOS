production and prospects bernard gelb specialist in industry economics resources science and industry division summary there is likelihood of relatively large rese rves of crude oil and natural gas in the caspian sea region and consequent larg increase in oil and natural gas production from that area because diversity of energy sources and energy security are considerations in congressiona l deliberations on energy polic this prospect could play role in such discussions however ther are obstacles to increases in caspian sea region production of oil and gas that slow some development this report will be updated as events warrant the caspian sea is 700milelong body of water in central asia bordered by azerbaijan iran kazakhstan ru ssia and turkmenistan among the five nations only iran is member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan became independent when the soviet union dissolved in 1991 the caspian sea region historically has pr oduced oil and natural gas but the region is considered to have large resources of oil and gas capable of much greater production current production and proven reserves the caspian sea region presently is sign ificant but not major supplier of crude oil to world markets ba sed upon estima tes by bp and the energy information administration eia us department of energy the caspian region produced 19 million barrels per day bblsday including na tural gas liquids in 2005 or 2 of total world output table 1 1 thirteen noncaspian region c ountries each produced more than 19 million bblsday in 2005 caspian sea region oil output has been higher but suffered during the dissolution of the soviet union and the years following kazakhstan whose production has risen rapidly since the late 1990s accounted for 67 and azerbaijan for 22 of regional crude oil output in 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21190crs2 based upon figures published by bp casp ian sea region oil production comes from proven economically recoverable reserves of 48 billion bbls table 2 this equals about 4 of total world prove n reserves and much more than bps figure for us reserves 29 billion bbls eia estimates of much larger possible reserves suggest potential for much greater production however as indicated by analysis later in this report there are obstacles to output increases both now and in the future the caspian sea regions relative contribution to world natural gas supplies is larger than that for oil its gas production of 30 trillion cubic feet per year tcfyr in 2005 was 3 of world output as with oil gas produc tion has been higher but suffered during the soviet unions collapse and the following years turkmenistan is the largest producer with production of 20 tcfyr it accounts for almost

natural gas are higher proportion of the world total than is its natural gas production in some instances exploration efforts hoping to find oil have found gas instead the estimate of proven rese rves of natural gas in the caspian sea region for the end of 2005 published by bp 257 tcf represents 4 of the world total increases in caspian region gas production face obstacles somewhat similar to those that challeng further oil development and production resource and production prospects there is likelihood of much greater additi onal reserves of crude oil and natural gas being found in the caspian sea region this is supported by the fact that number of oil companies have large stakes there much of the known reserves have not been developed yet and development usually l eads to discovery that prospects are larger than originallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21190crs3 2 caspian sea region survey of key oil and gas statistics and forecasts july 2006table 2 estimates of oil and gas reserves and

httpenergycrusgsgovoilgasnoga viewed march 1 2005 estimated moreover many areas remain unexplored it is estimated that an additional 184 billion barrels of crude oil reserves are possible2 which would raise the total to almost five times its present level this level of proven reserves would nearly equal the amount now held by saudi arab ia and could come to about 15 of total world reserves if the high output projection for 2010 in table 1 comes to pass caspian sea region oil production would have more than doubled to 41 million bblsday the prospective increase in natural gas prove n reserves appears to be much smaller in relative terms than for oil but still very large it is estimated that there are between 250 and 300 tcf in additional natural gas reserves in the regi on should this be the case total caspian region proven reserves in 2010 would put the region s proven gas reserve total at more than twice its present level and far exceed present saudi arabian natural gas reserves given such expectations it is timated that annual casp ian region natural gas production would reach 54 tcf by 2010 any co mparison of the volumes of caspian sea region oil and natural gas re serves versus those of saudi arabia however must be tempered by acknowledgment of the considerable advantage of saudi oil and gas in terms of much lower costs of production and much easier market access also

pipe fsu oil gas monitor december 21 2005 p 2 4 kazakhstan china consider gas pipeline construction fsu oil gas monitor december 7 2005 p 4to develop and bring them to market could depend to some extent on the ability to establish and maintain relationships with international energy companies present and prospective markets in view of the above caspian sea region countries potentially are large exporters of oil and gas caspian sea oil and gas has several markets now and wider variety of potential markets these include nations trying to meet their economies demand for energy and those that also wish to redu ce their dependence on persian gulf energy reflecting soviet era dictates and infrastru cture much of caspian region crude oil goes north andor west largely via pipe line to andor through russia to european markets some also goes by tanker throug h the bosporus straits to western european markets via the mediterranean however as indicated below the trend is away from russian and bosporus routes natural gas tr ansportation even more than oil is tied to pipelines going mainly north andor we st through russia and its monopoly pipeline system transneft this combined with the fact that russia itself produces oil and gas gives russia the market power to levy trans it fees on caspian energy shipped through its transportation network and to determine in so cases how much if any it is willing to transport also because energy competes on deliveredcost basis reflecting transit fees wellhead prices in the region suffer caspian sea countries thus have incentives to develop alternatives to routes through russia possibly consortia of routes that would avoid long transits through russia in reaching european and other markets and provide leverage in negotiating transit fees on shipments that do go through the russian pipeline system in addition given russias early january 2006 cutting of natural gas s upplies through ukraine it is likely that western european countries already seeking to diversify their sources of gas will more actively seek nonrussian gas to reduce the effect of feared future cutoffs caspian region energy sources are attractive to turkey they are close and offer turkey an opportunity to offset part of its energy import b ill through transit fees for shipments across its territory turkeys energy use is growing much faster than its economic output making it rapidly growing importer of both oil and gas it already is large importer of russian gas also turkey has good relations w ith caspian countries east asian countries also are potentially attractive markets japan already imports significant quantity of natural gas and energy consumption in india and pakistan is growing rapidly perhaps most significant chinas proven oil and gas reserves are small compared with the current and potential size of its economy and the recent steep increases in its oil consumption this has led for example to the building of an oil pipeline from kazakhstan to china which was completed and began to be filled in november 20053 and consideration of kazakhsta ntochina natural gas pipeline4 the prospects of caspian energy exports to the regions identified above however may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21190crs5 limited by newly expanding or developing non central asian energy exports to those regions these developments include expansion of north africas gas export capacity and discovery of large natural ga s province in and near egypt challenges to further development there are however interrelated geogra phical political economic technological legal and psychological obstacles to the fu rther exploration for and development of caspian sea region energy resources some w ith implications for us energy security because the caspian sea is landlocked and the regions nations are distant from the largest energy markets transportation must at least begin by pipeline followed in many cases by tanker through the shallow and cong ested bosporus straits pipelines from the region completed before 1997 except those in northern iran were routed to russia and designed to link the together the states of the former soviet uni on the several pipelines now transporting caspian regi on oil westward and thus to european and potentially to us markets have sufficient cap acity to handle present production table 3 completion of the cpc pipeline from kazakhs tans tengiz oilfie ld to novorossiisk russia on the black sea in 2001 and its planned expansion is notable but the effective capacity of the cpc line and that of others may be constrained by limits on tanker passage through the bosporus previously note d the capacity of the btc pipeline which has begun delivering oil plus that of other pipelines transporting oil from the caspian sea and surrounding area totals 22 million bblsday however iran now can compete somewh at with the btc pipeline through oil swaps that ultimately divert caspian region oil away from western including us markets iran has enlarged its tanker terminal at neka on the caspian sea coast enhancing its capacity to deliver caspian oil to refineries for local consumption with an equivalent amount of iranian oil expor ted through persia n gulf terminals new pipelines to serve east asian mark ets have economic potential but could be lengthy and possibly entail transit through af ghanistan iran andor pakistan pipeline that avoids these nations is the recently completed kazakh 620 mile oil export pipeline from atasu in central kazakhstan to alas hankou adjacent to the xinjiang region of china with an initial capacity of 400000 bbl sday it began delivering oil in may 2006 routes to east asian markets via iran would include shipping through the persian gulf complicating the pipeline issues is the fact that potential pipelines could be disrupted by regional conflicts these include the armeniaazerbaijan dispute over nagorno karabakh longstanding tens ion between india and paki stan continued unsettled conditions in afghanistan intermittent military activity in chechnya and chechen rebels use of georgias pankisi gorge region as base and refuge deciding upon pipeline routes that have reasonable assurance of security and are politically acceptable to parties with influen ce in the region are major hurdles in the development of caspian energy resources on the purely economic side the longer the pipeline route the less attractive it is to producers other things being equal inasmuch as energy competes on deliveredcost basi s and transit fees based upon distance effectively lower the wellhead price received by producers because transit fees are source of revenue to govern ments politics as well as ec onomics come into play inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21190crs6 pipeline route selection builtin precau tions to minimize environmental impacts particularly in and around the caspian sea also add to pipeline costs in addition much of caspian sea energy resources are offshor requiring special large drilling rigs very limited rig production capacity in the relatively isolated region makes the acquisition of rigs expensive and gistically difficult hampering development of caspian energy resources this situation is easing little as new rig was added to the fleet recently and another is in the production pipeline full realization of the energy potential of the caspian region also is impeded by the unresolved legal status of the caspian sea despite number of efforts so far only azerbaijan kazakhstan and russia among the littoral states have reached agreement on delineating ownership of the sea s resources or the rights of development and this does not prevent disputes between these countrie s and iran and turkmenistan in addition turkmenistan has made much less progress in developing its hydrocarbon resources than azerbaijan and kazakhstan despite the obstacles discussed above ergy development in the caspian sea region is proceeding and is likely to proceed further given the widely perceived prospect of very large energy resources in the regi on the pace of development however may be less rapid
