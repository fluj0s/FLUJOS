that commonwealthstatus is or should be only temporary fix to be resolved in favor of other solutionsconsidered permanent noncolonial and nonterritorial some contend that ifindependence is achieved

puerto rico assert that there are only three constitutionally reco gnized options for the islands independence statehood or continuation as territory in response to the 2005 version of the task

developments since 2005 in san juan puerto rico as well as washington dc have signaled some renewed congressional attention to the political status of the commonwealth of puerto rico and its relationship with the united states1 recent developments 110th congress in the 110th congress two house bills and one senate bill addressing puerto ricos political status have been introduced as with bills introduced in the 109th congress the house legislation hr 900 and hr 1230 originally offered two alternatives for addressing puerto ricos political status plebiscites popular votes or constituti onal convention duri ng march and april 2007 the house subcommittee on insular affair s held hearings on the two bills the house natural resources committee marked up hr 900 in october 2007 it was reported favorably the sena bill proposes third option plebiscite but in different format and with different opti ons than proposed by hr 900 action has occurred on the senate bill to date this section summarizes the pending legislation the two house bills prior to committee markup on february 7 2007 representative serrano introduced hr 900 which as originally introduced would have authorized two plebiscite s in puerto rico the firs t plebiscite to be conducted not later than december 31 2009 would ve asked voters to choose between two options 1 continuing the existing form of territorial status as defined by the constitution basic laws and po licies of the united states or 2 pursuit of path toward constitutionally viable permanent nonterritorial status2 if the majority of voters approved change the second plebis cite would have termined whether independence including free ssociation discussed later in this report or statehood was preferred as introduced hr 900 would have allowed us c itizens born in puerto rico but not necessarily living there today to participate in the plebiscites voter eligibility would be determined by the puerto rico state elections commission representative vel√°zquez introduced hr 1230 on february 28 2007 hr 1230 proposes constitutional c onvention and referendum to consider status first the bill proposes constitutional

in the text surrounding the cited passage in each version of the billthree options 1 new or modified co mmonwealth status 2 statehood or 3 independence the convention charged with formulating selfdetermination option proposal must be based on the sovereignty of the people of puerto rico and not subject to the plenary powers of the territory clause of the constitution of the united states3 the conventions proposal would th be presented to the people of puerto rico who would also have elected the convention delegates in referendum if majority of voters approve the proposal congress shall enact joint resolution approving the proposal any congressional changes to the proposal would be submitted to puerto rican vot ers for another referendum before the provisions took effect the legislation sp ecifies that voters participating in the referenda may include resi dent puerto ricans and nonre sidents who are not legal residents of the commonwealth of puerto rico and who are either born in puerto rico or have one parent born in puerto rico4 the october 2007 house natural resources committee markup on october 23 2007 the house natural resources comm ittee marked up hr 900 during that session portions of the origin versions of hr 900 and hr 1230 were combined in the reported version of hr 900 which was sent favorably to the full house by voice vote the written report hrept 110597 was not issued until april 2008 unlike the original versi on of hr 900 which called for two plebiscites but only if voters in the first plebiscite chose change in status an amendment in the nature of substitute to hr 900 reported by the full committee proposes only one plebiscite in which vot ers would consider whether puerto rico should pursue the status quo or another politi cal relationship with the united states also the reported version of hr 900 m odifies the threshold question in the original version of the bill the status quo is described as the existing form of territorial status as defined by the constitution basic laws and policies of the united states 5 by contrast the reported version frames the status quo as puerto rico continuing to have its present form of territorial status and relationship with the united states 6 as with the original version of the bill the reported version of hr 900 would frame the second political status opti on in the first plebiscite as pursuing constitutionally viable perman ent nonterritorial status7 the original and reported versions of hr 900 also propose different steps following the initial plebiscite

committee adopted an amendment sponsored by representative ch ristensen to the rahall language the christensen amendment would incorporate into hr 900 language taken from hr 1230 under the christensen amendment if majority of voters chose change in political status in the first plebiscite congress would recognize the inherent authority of the people of puerto rico to either call cons titutional convention or conduct another plebiscite ot her elements of the origin and reported versions of hr 900 eg those addressing voter eligibility are similar or identical to summarize the house natural resources committee reported favorably hr 900 as amended by voice vote th reported version of the bill contains elements from the original versions of hr 900 and hr 1230 most notably the reported version of the bill would require the puerto rico state elections commission to hold plebiscite on puerto rico status by december 31 2009 in that plebiscite voters would choose be tween the status quo and constitutionally viable permanent nonterritorial status if voters chose the latter option per the christensen amendment the people of puerto rico could either call constitutional convention or hol d second plebiscite to c onsider how to proceed in either case congress would have final sa over the islands status although the reported version of hr 900 represents compromise generally supported at the markup between the approaches origin ally proposed in hr 900 and hr 1230 some members continue to have reservations for example representative vel√°zquez sponsor of hr 1230 has called the reported bill insufficiently democratic and transparent9 on the other hand representative fortu√±o co sponsor of hr 900 characterized the reporte d version of the bill as less than ideal but ultimately positive step in the status debate the senate bill senator salazar introduced s 1936 on august 2 2007 the bill which shares the puerto rico mocracy act of 2007 title with hr 900 but differs substantially from that bill pr oposes single plebiscite in which voters would choose from four status options on one ballot s 1936 proposes that by september 30 2008 the puerto rico stat elections commission shall conduct plebiscite in which voters would choose between the status quo independence free association or statehood as with the h ouse bills ballot language and the placement of various options on the ballot could affect the results the status quo described as continuation of puerto ricos present status and relationship with the united states would be listed first independe nce would be listed second definition of independence is provided free associati on which generally implies negotiated legal economic or defense ties between sovereign nations would be listed third and described as seeking nationhood in fr ee association with the united states finally statehood without additional finition would be listed fourth10 n committee activity has occurred on s 1936httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32933crs4 comparing the reported hr 900 and s 1936 both the reported version of hr 900 and s 1936 as intr oduced propose reconsideration of the puerto rico status issue through popul ar vote whereas s 1936 presents four status options as distinct choices the reported version of hr 900 simply asks voters to choose between the status quo and cha nge in political status although the house bill does not specify status options if voters chose change recent reports by presidential task force discussed below determined that constitutional status options were limited to the status quo inde pendence including free association or statehood as is noted below the conclusi ons reached by the task force have been controversial the two bills also differ regarding votereligibility requirements funding and other administrative provisions 109th congress bills introduced in the 109th congress were largely similar to the bills introduced in the 110th congress four bills addressing puerto ricos political status were introduced during the 109th congress these bills also offered two different approaches to the political st atus issue on february 16 2006 senator burr introduced legislation s 2304 that r ecognized the right of the government of puerto rico to call constitutional c onvention and authorized such action according to the legislation delegates w ould have considered three proposals that could have been submitted to congress 1 development of new compact of association with the united states 2 admission of puerto rico as the 51st state or 3 establishment of an independent na tion the conventions proposal would then have been presented to congress if approved puerto ricans would have voted on the proposal in referendum representa tive duncan introduced an identical bill hr 4963 in the house on march 15 2006 s 2304 and hr 4936 were similar to hr 1230 introduced in the 110th congress although there are some differences between the 110th and 109th congress bills for example hr 1230 places the popular referendum before congressional approval of the conven tion pr oposal whereas s 2304 and hr 4963 called for the referendum to be held after congressional appr oval of the conventions proposal on march 2 2006 representative fort u√±o resident commissioner for puerto rico introduced legislation hr 4867 to au thorize two status plebiscites in puerto rico this legislation is essentially the same as hr 900 introduced by representative serrano during the 110th congress representatives fortu√±o and serrano were cosponsors of hr 4867 on april 26 2006 senator martinez in troduced s 2661 which also proposed plebiscite but differed significantly from hr 4867 s 2661 proposed only one plebiscite in which voters would have been presented with two choices continued status as territory of the united states or pursuit of path toward permanent nonterritorial status the bill did not specify what would have constituted permanent nonterritorial status on november 15 2006 the senate ener gy and natural resources committee held hearing on the 2005 report from the pr esidents task force on puerto ricos status witnesses at the hearing noted continued disagreement in washington and puerto rico about puerto ricos current nd future political status various senators and witnesses also bated whether puerto ricos politi cal

legislative activity described above was the release in decem ber 2005 of the presidential task forces report11 in the report the task force asserted unambiguously that puerto rico although styled commonwealth is terr itory of the united states and is subject to congress under the territorial cl ause of the u s constitution12 it also asserted that the constitution recognizes only two nonterritorial options for puerto rico either incorporation as state into the union or independence the task force recommended that the people of puerto ri co be given the opportunity through plebiscite to say whether they want to continue their territorial status were puerto ricans to reject territorial status the task force recommended second plebiscite through which puerto ricans would choos between the two constitutionally viable options of statehood and independence th task force recommendations have been rejected by the current governor of pu erto rico who condemned the report and rejected any efforts to turn the task forces recommendations into congressional legislation13 the governor among others argu ed that the commonwealth or in some cases enhanced commonwealth c onstructs are leg itimate nonterritorial options under u s constituti onal and statutory law in san juan during march and apri l 2005 the puerto rican legislative assembly debated and approved bill demanding that the president and congress express their commitment to respond to calls to resolve the issues of the political status of puerto rico14 had the governor not vetoed the bill on april 10

in the 1998 plebiscite led some in congress to call for further consider ation of the status issue49 in response to the inconclusive results of the plebiscite four members of congress who chaired committees and subcommittee with jurisdiction over puerto rico summarized the impact of the vote as follows after almost fifty years of local constitutional government in puerto rico by us citizens now the lack of majority consent to the current form of internal selfgovernment by those who are disenfranchised nationally calls into question the continued acceptability of the status quo this problem cannot be unilaterally resolved by the us citiz ens of puerto rico acting under the local constitution but rather by working with the federal government which has the sole power as well as duty to change puerto ricos political status into one of full enfranchisement50 the 106th congress continued to give attention to the matter and on october 4 2000 the house committee on resources held

have the opportunity of choosing between different alternatives governor anibal acevedo vil√° saidin particular the task force in 2007 noted that use of the term commonwealth with respect to puerto rico describes the substantial political autonomy enjoyed by puerto rico and appropriately captures puerto ricos special relationship with the united states however the task force said the island remains us territory subject to the congressional plenary powers under the territorial clause70 this language suggests that although the task fo rce perhaps more explicitly recognized degree of puerto rican autonomy than it did in the 2005 report the 2007 report nonetheless reiterated that the territorial clause grants congress wide jurisdiction over the island as long as puerto rico re mains us territory as in 2005 the task force also concluded that socalled enhanced commonwealth was constitutionally impermissible71 the 2007 task force report also reiterated the 2 005 recomme ndations concerning federally sanctioned plebiscite to determine whether puerto ricans wish to maintain the st atus quo or pursue constitutionally viable status option the need for second plebiscite that would present choices between either statehood or independence if puerto ricans choose to pursue nonterritorial status in the first plebiscite and the view that plebiscites should occur periodically to revisit the status question if puerto ricans choose to maintain the status quo72 issues of debate on political status the establishment of the commonwealth in 1952 did not resolve all questions on the political status of puerto rico puerto rico remains territory of the united states subject to congressional authority under the territorial clause of the us constitution some puerto ricans howev er believe the commonwealth enjoys unique relationship to the united states nd the federal governme nt and that it has some attributes of separate sovereignty73 others argue that commonwealth status is temporary political status that falls short of two permanent status options httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32933crs19 statehood or independence as sovereign na tion continuation or even enhancement of this status leaves the governance of puer to rico subject to the territorial clause and therefore subject to congressional acti on others disagree arguing that the current status can be permanent st atus option that requires adjustments enhancements over time as the 110th congress reexamines the political status of puerto rico number of policy issues might arise among which are the following what process will be used to consider the political status options how is each option to be defined what impact would puerto rican statehood have on the us congress what associated policy matters might be raised if congress debatesstatus each of these issues is discussed below process options past congressional debate and discussions on the political status of puerto rico have focused not only on the end result will the status change and if so what will it be but also on the process by which the debate and vote were to proceed the process used to identify discuss and vote on status options would likely be established before bate begins on the final status options bills considered by the puerto rican legi slature in 2005 dealt with one step of the process call from the people of puerto rico for federal response to the status issue but the parties in puerto rico could not reach consensus on procedural matter and the governor vetoed the measure the gubernatorial veto of the measure recently approved by the puerto rican legisl ature and the history of controversy and popular votes on status proposals suggest that procedural questions will require careful planning and decisions arguably an agreement on procedure is necessary for the resolution of subsequent complex questions eg the definition of status options neither the us constitution nor preced ents establish procedures and firm boundaries for the re solution of controversies concerning the political status of territory of the united states throughout u s history various procedures have been used to determine whether territory affiliated with the united states changes its status to statehood or independence with gal ties of free association or sovereign nation or remains territory history however presents some broad outlines and variations the process of debate involves the following assessment of how change of st atus for the territory might affect national interests of the united states assessment of the

another perspective is presented in report prepared by contractors for commission on alaskas statehood the commission report identified two basic paths one stemming from congressional initiatives the other from territorial forces initially as provided in the northwest ordinance congress would authorize territory to initiate the steps toward statehood once the territory drafted constitution and set up government the congress would pass second statute admitting the territory as state on the other hand the respective territory would present itself to the congress as ready for statehood thus leaving out the step in which the congress passed the enab ling act or gave the territory the go ahead to start meeting the requirements of statehood83 independence development of sovereign identity some territories affiliated with the united states eventu ally became independe nt sovereign nations after considerable congressional debate and years of action or inaction for example the philippine islands gained independence in 1946 after decades of negotiations between filipino officials and congress and years after congress passed legislation in 1934 to provide for the complete independence of the philippine islands to provide for the adoption of constitution and form of government for the philippine islands and for other purposes84 in essence for roughly 50 years the federal government

debate among puerto ricos officials currently centers around alternative mechanisms for discussing and resolving the status opti ons one option advocated by the governor and the pdp is to establish constituent assembly or local constitutional conventions the members of the assembly would be elected by the people of puerto rico and would be charged with developing the status options to be offered to the people of puerto rico and to congress88 delegates to the assembly pursuant to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32933crs23 88 continued of constitutional assembly on status governor acevedo vil√°

dialogue with executive branch officials and submit report to the president and to congress on the proposals for the political relationship of puerto rico to the united states89 the report of the assembly according to the proposal must represent alternatives to overcome all vestiges of colonialism and establis h clearly the nonterritorial nature of the future st atus of puerto rico90 negotiations between representatives of puerto rico and congress arguably would address issues of the constitutionality of the status options veloped by the assembly second option reportedly supported by th majority of the legislature and the current resident commissioner called for referendum to be held in 2005 in puerto rico if under the proposal majority of the voters had approved the convening of referendum the process of establishing fe derally defined status options would have begun options developed by federal officials would then have been presented to the people of puerto rico for their considera tion plebiscite would then have been held before july 1 2007 on those options91 third option described previously in this report was based upon pip proposal the pnpled puerto rican legi slature approved the measure with pdp supported amendment but the governor vetoed it according to the bill if congress had not reacted within 90 days of the deadline december 31 2006 the puerto rican legislature would have been committed to legislate to enable the people of puerto rico to choose the procedural mech anism to be used to further the status discussions the mechanisms mentioned in the legislation included but were not limited to constitutional convention on stat us or petition for plebiscite with federal approval92 the decision by the governor to veto the legislation and at least temporarily halt formal discussion of the process m eans that many questi ons remain unanswered were congress to take up the status debate some procedur questions that might be raised include the following would the legislation be selfex ecuting that is would congress enact legislation that requires further congressional action once the people of puerto rico reach consensus on status option would congressional pproval of selfexecu ting legislation behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32933crs24 93 on january 23 1997 the legislature enacted concurrent resolution 2 requesting congress to

agreement on legislation to initiate the process would congress respond to concu rrent resolution adopted solely by the legislature93 would plurality or majority of registered voter participation be required to indicate support for fi nal status option are there circumstances under which plurality vote for status option would be acceptable to congress and the people of puerto rico none of the 110th congress bills establish minimum thresholds for support among voters eg minimum percentages for result to be considered valid plurality rather than majority vote could be particularly likely in the s 1936 plebiscite because the bill would present four options to voters simu ltaneously similarly none of the 110th congress legislation guarantees that voters would choose any of options presented would puerto ricans who reside on the mainland or in other parts of the united states besides puerto rico be eligible to vote on the status proposal the two house bills introduced in the 110th congress contain language suggesting that puerto ricans livingoutside the islands would be allowed to participate at what stage or stages in the decisionmaking process would the people of puerto rico participate in the election of officials specifically tasked with resolving the issue in establishing the status definitions in voting on the definitions established by others including federal officials in referendum on legi slation approved by the puerto rican legislature or by congress definitions of status options definitions or more specifically the lack of definitions of the political status options for puerto rico compound the complexity of the debate agreement on standard defi nitions of the terms may be elusive even if the terms are initially accepted as defined in particular the lack of clear and stable legal definition for the term commonwealth complicates the debate some argue that congress should define the rms others howev er advocate direct involvement by the people

upon selection of status option by the voters congress would have been required to consider implementing legislation in accordance w ith specified timetable by comparison the senate committees on energy and natural resources and on finance reported out bill s 712 that would have been selfexecuting i the status of puerto rico would have been resolved after referendum with further congressional ac tion required the full senate did not vote on s 712124 several reasons have been cited for the decision by the senate not to approve s 712 and the inability of the 101st congress to reconcile th differences between the two bills the chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee questioned the utility of the definitions in the report that accompanied hr 4765 and noted that the debate could not be concluded with the short time that remained in the 101st congress125 s 712 was perceived by some to be biased toward statehood in that it would have provided for an immedi ate transition to statehood and would have applied federal benefits immediately to puerto rico but would have delayed tax payment responsibilities some senators did not want to take action in the absence of petition from puerto ricans on state hood also the bill included few of the enhancements sought by the popular mocratic party pdp perhaps most significantly sponsors of the bills could not reconcile the gap between the self executing provisions of s 712 and the pr ovision for congressional consideration of implementing legislation in hr 4765126 s 712 several catalysts stimulated

to resolving the status issue127 the leaders of the three principal political parties in puerto rico wrote to the chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee requesting congressional action on status an excerpt from the letter follows the people of puerto rico wish to be cons ulted as to their preference with regards to their ultimate political status and th consultation should

onwealth as approved by plurality of those voting in the referendum in the legislation153 another rejected amendment would have revised the proce ss set forth in the legislati on by separating statehood and independence instead of combining th em in one option to be subsequently differentiated in another stion still another amendmen t would have replaced the transition period of decade with immediat effectuation after the results of the referendum were tabulated amendments that were adopt ed included continuation of commonwealth status on the ballot definition opposed by the pdp and continued referenda every four years until puerto ricos unincorporated territory status is terminated in favor of recognized form of full selfgovernment in accordance with this act the house committee on rules reported out the bill in september 1996 in the closing days of the 104th congress and amended section 6 of the bill concerning expedited congressional consideration of the legislation specified in hr 3024 further action was taken on hr 3024 during the 104th congress 105th congress as in the 104th congress the primary action on the status issue took place only in the house the

the house congressional record daily edition vol 143 september 24 1997 p h7738some provisions differed between the tw bills hr 856 as approved by the house included an english language pr ovision along with the expectation it is anticipated that english would be the fficial language of the federal government in puerto rico to the extent required by law throughout the united states also like hr 3024 the bill called for additional refere nda to be held in the event the initial referendum proved inconclusi ve the difference however was that the referenda would be held at least once every 10 year s unlike the quadrennial schedule in hr 3024 if neither statehood nor separate sovereignty receive d majority of the votes also the descriptions of the status op tions were altered in hr 856 to reflect suggestions from political leaders in puerto rico issues of debate on hr 856 as in previous debates disagreement over the definitions of the status options domin ated advocates of hr 856 perceived the bill would establish fair process to enable puerto ricans to select status option others disagreed however with some ar guing that the legislation biased the referendum process toward statehood members of the pdp disagreed with the commonwealth description in th bill critics argued that under the legislation vote in favor of statehood would be the catalyst for congressional action whereas majority vote for continuing commonwealth status would require additional future referenda until you get it right154 it was also argued that the definition of commonwealth in the legislation was anathema to commonwealth supporters leaving them only one option to boycott the referendum one member of congress contended that the bill would deny us citizenship to the children of puerto ricans if commonwealth is chosen threatens the puerto rican people with the loss of federal benefits if they reject statehood denies puerto ricans on the mainland in the united states the right to participate in this vital process neglects our distinct puerto rican history as people and nation abandons the idea of democracy and embraces the imposition of the will of the few on the hopes and dreams of the many155 during the 10hour debate on the floor of the house on march 4 1998 some of the same issues discussed in previous years were raised again some argued that this bill like h r 3024 from the 104th congress was biased toward the statehood position opponents also argued that it included unconstitutional provisions established an expedited process that did not allow for sufficient consideration and did not adequately address the citizenship issue some of the reasons stated for senate inaction included th dearth of backing from commonwealth supporters and concern on the part of the republican l eadership that statehood would result in democratic gains in congress the 105th congress like those before it ended without resolution of the matter
