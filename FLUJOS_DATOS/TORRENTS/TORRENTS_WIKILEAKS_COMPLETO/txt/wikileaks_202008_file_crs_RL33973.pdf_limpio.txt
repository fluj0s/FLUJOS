ways to address the unauthorized alien population the issue of unauthorized employment is the focus of much discussion the unauthorized alien working population like the unauthorized alien population generally has been growing steadily there were an estimated 72 million unauthorized workers in the us civilian labor force in march 2005 it is widely accepted that most unauthorized aliens enter and remain in the united states in order to work thus eliminating employment opportunities for these aliens has been seen as an approach to curtailing unauthorized immigration provisions enacted by the immigration reform and control act irca of 1986 which are sometimes referred to as employer sanctions made it unlawful for an employer to knowingly hire recruit or refer for fee or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to work it also established paperbased employment eligibility verification system known as the i9 system which requires that employers examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work eligibility and complete and retain i9 verification forms there is general agreement that the i9 process has been under mined by fraud employers violating prohibitions on unauthorized employment in the immigration and nationality act ina may be subject to civil or criminal penalties the department of homeland securitys immigration and customs enforcement dhsice is responsible for enforcing the ina prohibitions on unauthorized employment building on the employment verification system established by irca the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira directed the attorney general to conduct three pilot programs for employment eligibility confirmation that were to be largely voluntary under the basic pilot program the only one of the three pilots still in operation participating employers verify new hires employment eligibility by accessing social security administration ssa and if applicable dhs databases variety of options has been put forth to curtail unauthorized employment and related practices selection of which is discussed in this report some of these options would build on the current employment eligibility verification system these include making electronic verification mandatory increasing existing penalties or increasing resources for worksite enforcement others represent new approaches to address unauthorized employment such as shifting responsibility for employment eligibility verification from employers to the federal government this report will be updated if developments warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33973g23g151g138g158g157g145g152g155g146g163g142g141g561 g7g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561g146g151g561

years as increasing public and congressional attention has been focused on the unauthorized alien population in the united states the issue of unauthorized employment has come to the fore unauthorized employment as used in this report refers to the employment of aliens who lack authorization to be employed in the united states the term includes both those who are in the country in violation of the law as well as those in the country legally who nevertheless are not authorized to work 1 despite the prohibitions against unauthorized employment in the immigration and nationality act ina an estimated 72 million unauthorized workers were in the us civilian labor force in march 2005 representing about 5 of the labor force2 for many years it has been widely accepted that most unauthorized

system in which they examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work eligibility and complete and retain i9 verification forms with respect to the document examination requirement ina 274a states that an employer is in compliance if the document reasonably appears on its face to be genuine8 there is general agreement that the i9 process has been undermined by fraudboth document

may be subject to civil andor criminal penalties ina 274a establishes separate and escalating ranges of penalties for the following failure to comply with the i9 requirements 110 1100 per employee violations of prohibitions on knowingly hiring recruiting referring or continuing to employ unauthorized aliens 275 11000 per alien and pattern or practice of violations of knowingly hiring recruiting referring or continuing to employ unauthorized aliens up to 3000 per alien or up to six months imprisonment or both 10 as discussed below dhss immigration and customs enforcement ice is responsible for enfo rcing the ina prohibitions on unauthorized employment during the congressional debates preceding the passage of irca major concerns were expressed that the verification and penalty provisions would result in employment discrimination based on national origin as employers opted not to hire eligible workers who looked or sounded foreign out of fear that they lacked work authorization to directly address these concerns irca added new 274b to the ina which makes it an unfair immigrationrelated employment practice for employers with four or more employees to discri minate against us citizens or workauthorized aliens in hiring recruiting or referring for fee or firing based on national origin or on citizenship or lawful immigration status ina 274b also provided for the establishment of the office of special counsel for immigrationrela ted unfair employment practices osc in the us department of justice to enforce these provisions 11 under ina 274b employers found to have engaged in an unfair immigrationrelated employment practice shall be required to cease and desist from such practice and may be subject to other requirements including civil penalties irca also required the thengeneral accounting office gao to issue three annual reports on the implementation and enforcement of the ina 274a provisions in each of the reports gao was directed to make determination as to whether the implementation of ina 274a has resulted in pattern of discrimination in employment against other than unauthorized aliens on the basis of national origin 12 gaos third report included the following summary of its findings gao found that the law has apparently reduced illegal immigration and is not an unnecessary burden on employers has generally been carried out satisfactorily by ins the former immigration and naturalization servi ce and labor and has not been used as vehicle to launch frivolous complaints against employers gao also found that there was widespread discrimination but was there discrimination as result of irca that is the key question congress directed gao to answer gaos answer is yes 13 10 these penalty levels reflect 1999 increase of the civil penalties in ina 274a as enacted in accordance with the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act of 1990 as amended pl 101410 october 5 1990 28 usc 2461 note for further breakdowns

responsibility act of 1996 iirira directed the attorney general to conduct three pilot programs for employment eligibility confirmation that were to be largely voluntarythe basic pilot program the machin ereadable document pilot program and the citizen attestation pilot14 under the basic pilot program the only one of the three pilots still in operation participating employers verify new hires employment eligibilit by accessing social security administration ssa and if applicable dhs databases15 the program is administered by dhss us citizenship and immigration services uscis the basic pilot program began in 1997 in the five states with the largest unauthorized alien populations16 initially scheduled to terminate in 2001 it has been extended twice most recently by pl 10815617 it is currently scheduled to terminate in 2008 in addition to extending the life of the basic pilot program pl 108156 directed the secretary of dhs to expand the operation of the program to all 50 states not later than december 1 2004 in connection with this expansion it further directed the secretary to submit report to congress assessing whether the problems identified in earlier pilot program evaluations had been resolved and describing actions that the secretary would ta ke prior to the nationwide expansion to resolve any outstanding problems in the resulting june 2004 report uscis described its efforts to resolve the three main problems identified in the pilot program evaluations the chief problem which the report described as the most serious pilot deficiency noted by the evaluation was that workauthorized employees especially foreignborn workauthorized employees too frequently received tentative nonconfirmations or initial responses by the system that employment eligibility could not be immediately confirmed the report described this erroneous tentative nonconfirmation rate as source of unintentional discrimination against foreignborn employees and detailed efforts to address it by improving the accuracy of the verification databases and reducing data entry errors by employers and immigration status verifiers the other problems identified in the pilot program evaluations were employer noncompliance with pilot program requirements and low levels of employer interest in participating in pilot program 18 in december 2004 uscis announced the expansion of the basic pilot program to all 50 states and the district of columbia19 14 iirira is division c of pl 104208 the pilot programs were established under title iv subtitle independent evaluations of

testimony the current basic pilot is not fraudproof and was not designed to detect identity fraud 21 worksite enforcement actions by ice in late 2006 and early 2007 focused national attention on these

strategy also involves targeting unscrupulous employers of illegal aliens and seeking to initiate criminal prosecutions and cause asset forfeitures according to ice its worksite investigations often uncover egregious criminal violations such as money laundering alien smuggling or document fraud and widespread abuses such as worker exploitation 24 in july 2006 ice announced another part of its

acceptable documents has long been under discussion as an option for making the i9 verification process more secure and less confusing for employers38 other options in this category would combine reduction in the number of acceptable documents with requirements to improve the security of do cuments particularly the widely counterfeited social security card for example there have been proposals to require social security cards to include an encrypted machinereadable electronic identification strip unique to the bearer and digitized photograph 39 under some such proposals new hires would be required to show card of this type to the employer who would then us it to verify the workers identity and work authorization biometrics40 could also be incorporated into new social security cards or other documents as discussed in the next section verification system based on more secure documents could replace the existing requirement under the i9 process that employers examine employeeprovided documents in his february 2007 testimony before the senate judiciary committee commerce secretary carlos gutierrez called for the issuance of secure documents to assist businesses in verifying the legal status of their employees but he limited his recommendation to foreign workers according to secretary gutierrez tamperproof biometric identity cards should be established for foreign workers so that employers have excuse for violating the law 41 reducing the number of documents for evidencing identity and employment eligibility could raise concerns that some workauthorized individuals might not be able to meet the requirements easily42 proposals to require all new hires to show one particular document containing various pieces of information about the bearer have been further criticized by some as undermining privacy facilitating identity theft and creating facto national identification card43 the costs of issuing more secure social security cards or other documents would likely be another issue44 37 8 cfr 274a2b1v both senatepassed s 2611 and housepassed hr 4437 in the 109th congress would have made changes to the ina provisions on acceptable documents 38 see for example us

could make the government responsible for verifying employment eligibility in november 2005 paper marc r rosenblum offered one such alternative which he termed centralized screening system45 he described the centralized screening system as follows under centralized system the responsibility for verifying work eligibility would rest with professional screeners at the point of document issuance and proof of eligibility would be embodied in workers identity card itself employers could thus assume cardholders are workauthorized and employer responsibility would be reduced to keeping record of new hires as outlined by rosenblum employers would be responsible for registering new hires in new job holder database he envisions that eventu ally this would be done by swiping machine readable card under such system employers would only be subject to penalties for failing to fulfill the registration requirements the effectiveness of such system at preventing unauthorized employment would rely largely on the security of the underlying documents according to rosenblum enforcement agents would be responsible for insuring the integrity of work authorization documents and for analyzing employer records to search for evidence that employees are using borrowed or stolen documents if such system were to receive serious consideration there would likely be questions about whether enforcement agents could perform these functions in addition to the extent that it relied on one or small number of verification documents such system would likely raise concerns about privacy identity theft and the establishment of national identification card as discussed in the prior section

likely the same employers who violate wage hour and safety laws another version of this option which represents complete departure from the current employment eligibility verification system would couple increased dol enforcement with the repeal of the current ina prohibitions on uthorized employment jennifer gordon law professor advocated version of this option at hearing of the house immigration subcommittee in june 2005 in her testimony gordon contended that the current system had contributed significantly to undermining the working conditions of us citizens and legal immigrants and that effective enforcement of basic workplace rights for all employees is the lynchpin in any strategy to protect the wages and working conditions of us workers she recommended replacing the current system with twopronged approach the first prong would be statement from congress that workplace protections apply equally to all workers regardless of their immigration status the second part as she characterized it would be new commitment to intensive and strategically targeted government enforcement of minimum wage and health and safety laws in industries and geographic areas with high concentrations of undocumented workers46 this option is highly controversial while gordon argued at the hearing that it held greater promise for protecting workers than the current system others soundly reject the idea of repealing employer sanctions among the opponents is carl w hampe partner in law firm and former justice department official and congressional staffer who also testified at the june 2005 house hearing according to hampes testimony i believe repealing employer sanctions would be very unwise as it would send message to the worlds potential unauthorized immigrants that the united states longer will discourage illegal immigration however large the unauthorized immigration problem is now repeal of employer sanctions at this point would certainly make the problem far worse

be ripe once again to address these issues as congress decides if and or to reform the current system it may consider the options presented in this report members of congress may decide on one or more options that build on the existing employerbased system of employment eligibility verification and the existing ice worksite enforcement program or may consider different approach in one or both of these areas while presumably options would be assessed in large part on their potential for reducing unauthorized employment this report has also attempted to identify accompanying concerns such as discrimination privacy and identify theft which congress may also want to weigh as part of the policymaking process 46 statement of jennifer gordon at us congress hous committee on the judiciary
