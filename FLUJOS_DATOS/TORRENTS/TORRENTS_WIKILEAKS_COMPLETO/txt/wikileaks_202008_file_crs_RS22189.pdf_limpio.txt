1 one of its three property rights decisions during the 20042005 term in kelo the court addressed the citys condemnation of private property to implement its area redevelopment plan aimed at invigorating depressed economy by 54 the court held that the condemnations satisfied the fifth amendment requirement that condemnations be for public use notwithstanding that the property as part of the plan might be turned over to private developersa privatetoprivate transfer under the fifth amendment the united states may invoke its power of eminent domain to take private propertyknown as condemnationonly for public use 2 this public use prerequisite is made applicable to the states and their political subdivisions as in kelo through the fourteenth amendment due process clause in addition states and their subdivisions must comply with state constitutions which use phrases similar to public use the issue in kelo was not whether the landowners were compensated condemnation under the federal or state constitutions must always be accompanied by just compensation of the property owner rather the issue was whether the condemnation was not for public use and thus may not proceed at all even given that just compensation is paid kelo prompted immediate debate whether cong ress should respond by protecting property owners from the use of eminent domain for economic development

satisfy the constitutional requirement that eminent domain only be used for public usenotwithstanding that the transferee is private entity for our nations first century public use generally was construed to mean that after the condemnation the property had to be either owned by the government for roads military bases post offices etc or when private to private by private party providing public access to the property as with entities such as railroads and utilities having common carrier duties beginning in the late 1890s however the supreme court rejected this publicaccess requirement for privatetoprivate condemnations asserting that public use means only for public purpose even without public access the court said privatetoprivate transfers by emin ent domain could under proper circumstances be constitutional in 1954 the owner of department store in blighted area of the district of columbia argued to the supreme court that the condemnation of his store for conveyance to private developer as part of an areawide blightelimination plan failed the public use condition he pointed out that his particular building was not dilapidated whatever the condition of other structures in the area might be the supreme court in berman v parker 3 unanimously rejected the nopublicuse argument the court declined to assess each individual condemnation but rather viewed the blightelimination plan as whole so viewed the plan furthered legitimate public interest indeed the public use requirement was said to be satisfied anytime government acted within its 1 2005 westlaw

upon by municipalities across the country engaged in blight removal the 1980s saw further extensions of public use in the realm of privatetoprivate condemnations in 1981 detroit sought to condemn an entire neighborhood to provide site for general motors assembly plant unlike in berman the neighborhood was not blighted the city simply wanted to improve its dire economic straits by bringing in the plant to increase its tax base the michigan supreme court in poletown neighborhood council v detroit 4 interpreted public use in its state constitution to allow the condemnation few years after poletown the us supreme court in hawaii v midkiff5 dealt with hawaiis use of condemnation to relieve the highly concentrated land ownership there the states program allowed land lessee to apply to the state to condemn the land from the owner for sale to the lessee again unanimously the supreme court perceived public use this time in the elimination of the claimed adverse impacts of concentrated land ownership on the states economy as in berman the court declared that the public use requirement is coterminous with the scope of the sovereigns police powers 6 the effect of berman poletown and hawaii and kindred decisions was to lead some observers to declare that public use had been so broadly construed by the courts as to have been effectively removed from the constitution to exploit the new latitude in public use and with poletown specifically in mind local condemnations assertedly for economic development began to increase in the 1980ssome of them pushing the envelope of what could be considered economic development with primarily public purpose predictably litigation challenges to such condemnations increased in tandem property owners charging that even under the courts expansive view of public use the particular pr oject could not pass muster in one of the early propertyowner successes new jersey court in 1998 rejected as not for public use proposed condemnation of land next to an atlantic city casino for the casinos discretionary use 7 few other cases also rejected public use rationales for economicdevelopment condemnations either because the projects benefits were primarily private or because economic development categorically was not regarded as public use most dramatically in 2004 the michigan supreme court unanimously reversed poletown 8 all this set the stage for kelo g22g145g142g561g13g142g149g152g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561 in the late 1990s connecticut and the city of new london began developing plans to revitalize the citys depressed economy they fixed on 90acre area on the citys waterfront adjacent to where pfizer inc was building 300 million research facility the intention was to capitalize on the arrival of the pfizer facility in addition to creating jobs generating tax revenue and building momentum for revitalizing the dow ntown the plan was also intended to make the city more attractive and create recreation opportunities the redevelopment would include office and retail space condos marinas and park however nine property owners in the redevelopment area 4 410 mich 616 304 nw2d 455 1981 5 467 us 229 1984

the property owners claimed that the condemnations of their properties were not for public use in his opinion for the 5justice majority justice stevens held that the condemnations implementing carefully considered areawide revitalization plan in an economically depressed area were for public use even though the condemned properties would be redeveloped by private entities the majority opinion noted preliminarily that there was suggestion of bad faith hereno charge that the redevelopment was really sweetheart deal with the private entities that would benefit the case therefore turned on whether the proposed development was public use even though privatetoprivate transfers with limited public access were involved without exception said the majority the courts cases defining public use as public purpose reflect policy of judicial deference to legislative judgmentsaffording legislatures broad latitude in determining what evolving public needs justify while new london was not confronted with blight as in berman their determination that the area was sufficiently distressed to justify program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to our deference but just as in berman the plan was comprehensive and thoroughly deliberated so the court again refused to consider the condemnations of individual parcels because the overall plan served public purpose it said condemnations in furtherance of the plan must also the property owners argued for flat rule that economic development is not public use rejecting this the court said that promoting economic development is longaccepted function of government and that there is principled way of distinguishing economic development from other public purposes that the court has recognized as public usesas in berman and hawaii nor is the incidental private benefit troublesome as government pursuit of public purpose often benefits private parties and categorical rule against development condemnations is not needed to prevent abuses of eminent domain for private gain such hypothetical cases said the court can be confronted as they arise also rejected was the property owners argument that for cases of this kind courts should require reasonable certainty that the expected public benefits of the project will accrue such requirement the court noted asks courts to make judgments for which they are illsuited and would significantly impede carrying out redevelopment plans finally the majority opinion stressed that it was construing only the takings clause of the federal constitution state courts it pointed out remain free to interpret state constitutions more strictly and state legislatures remain free to prohibit undesired condemnations other opinions in kelo warrant mention as they have echoed in the ensuing congressional debate justice kennedy one of the majorityopinion justices filed concurrence emphasizing that while deference to the legislative determinationrational basis reviewis appropriate courts must not abdicate their review function entirely court should void taking he said that by clear showing is intended to favor particular private party with only incidental or pretextual public benefits in dissent justice oconnor joined by the court s three core conservatives argued vigorously that under the banner of economic development the majority opinion makes all private property vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner so long as it might be upgraded justice oconnor allowed as how pr ivatetoprivate condemnations without public access could on some occasions satisfy public useas in berman and hawaii but in those cases she asserted the targeted property inflicted affirmative harm on society in contrast in kelo the wellmaintained homes to be condemned were not the source of any social harm so their httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22189g5g152g151g141g142g150g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g18g155g146 g159g138g157g142g561g18g155g152

public something that almost any lawful use of real property does sh also questioned whether justice kennedys test for acceptable development condemnations was workable given that staff can always come up with an asserted economic development purpose g6g146g141g561g13g142g149g152g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g561g7g161g146g156g157g146g151g144g561g14g138g160g501g561 property rights advocates assert that kelo marks change in existing takings jurisprudence but the reality is arguably more subtle very possibly some of their adverse reaction is attributable to the opportunity lost in kelo to do away with economicdevelopment condemnations in one fell swoop after kelo property rights advocates will have to pursue their goal in multiple state courts and legislatures the doctrinal crux of the matter appears to lie in the majority and dissenters divergent readings of the courts prior publicuse decisions justice stevens for the majority finds principled difference between economicdevelopment condemn ations and condemnations the court has already approved as in berman and hawaii while justice oconnor for the dissenters does justice stevens view arguably takes insufficient account of the distinction between projects where economic development is only an instrumental or secondary aspect of the project and those where economic development is the primary thrust on the other hand the distinction drawn by justice oconnor between projects whose primary th rust is elimination of affirmative harms and other projects while intuitively appealing requires dichotomy between elimination of harm and creation of benefit that the court has previously critiqued as unworkable moreover justice oconnor had to backpedal on the statement in hawaii which she authored that the public use requirement is coterminous with the scope of the sovereigns police powers some exercises of that police power she now would hold are not public uses of course what kelo really means will not be known until the lower courts have had few years to interpret and apply it it will be interesting to see whether justice kennedys meaningful rational basis review has any content or whether the dissenters more skeptical view that plausible economic development purpose can always be conjured up by competent staff will ultimately prove correct in the meantime frequent efforts can be expected by property owners and likeminded public interest law firms to expand the number of states whose courts find fault under state constitutions with development condemnations

lines conservative one supposes would side with the property owners but having statesrights orientation might resist federal constraints on what local governments can do on the other hand liberals might be comfortable with municipal efforts to guide the market toward economic development but resist on the ground that such efforts disproportionately displace minority and lowincome communities

interpreting solely the takings clause in the us constitution as in other constitutional areas state courts remain free to interpret state constitutions more stringently and indeed some state high courts have read their constitutions to bar condemnation for economic development moreover whatever the state constitution says state legislatures are free to statutorily prohibit development condemnations and indeed once again at least few have in light of the foregoing congress might conclude that it was appropriate to let the matter simmer for few years in the states and then act only if unsatisfied with their response

proposals have already surfaced in congress to prohibit the use of federal money for state and local projects with an economic development purposeusually through conditions on federal grants there are several ways this could be done the prohibitory condition could be attached solely to the monies for the particular economic development project involving the condemnation more broadly the condition could be applied to larger pot of money eg community development block grants still having some relation to economic development condemnations most expansively the condition could be attached to the largest federal funding program one can find or all federal funding though this course of action may run afoul of the constitutional requirement that conditions on federal funding must relate to the underlying purpose of the funding 9 g6g146g155g142g140g157g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g15g138g151g141g138g157g142g156g561 the suggestion has been raised that congress could direct how states
