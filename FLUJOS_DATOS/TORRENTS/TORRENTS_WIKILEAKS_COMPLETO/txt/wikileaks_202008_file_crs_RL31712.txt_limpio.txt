tuberculosis and malaria background summary the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria headquartered in geneva switzerland is an independent foundation intended to attract and rapidly disburse new resources in developing countries for the struggle against infectious disease the fund is financing vehicle not development agency and its grants are intended to complement existing efforts rather than replace them the origins of the concept of an independent funding mechanism to fight aids and other diseases lie partly in french proposal made in 1998 in ideas developed in the 106th congress and in recommendations made by secretary general kofi annan in april 2001 president bush made the founding pledge of 200 million for disease fund in may 2001 the global fund was established in january 2002 following negotiations involving donor and developing country governments non governmental organizations ngos the private sector and the united nations as of march 31 2006 the global fund has approved more than 350 grants totaling nearly 52 billion for projects in more than 131 countries of which about 21 billion has been disbursed in 127 countries to date there have been five rounds of funding with the board approving proposals in april 2002 january 2003 october 2003 june 2004 and september 2005 however in september 2005 due to lack of available funding from donors only portion of proposals recommended for approval in round 5 were officially approved the remaining tentatively approved proposals received final approval in december 2005 after additional contributions were made the global fund will make grants only if it has funds on hand to cover the first two years of the proposed projects an approach known as the comprehensive funding policy the policy is designed to avoid disruptions to projects due to funding shortages this is regarded as particularly important consideration with respect to antiretroviral therapy since interruptions in treatment can lead to the emergence of resistant strains of hiv and to death funding for the third through fifth years of the projects is dependent on new contributions to the global fund by donors

remarks by the president may 11 2001 5 communique dated july 22 2001 crs4 to the deaths of patients funding for the third through fifth years of the projects is dependent on new contributions to the global fund by donors the global fund has developed performancebased funding system that enables it to intermittently adjust funding for projects the global fund reports that it funds grants in principle for five years but commits funding for the first two years only this enables the fund to assess the progress of the programs and determine if funding should be renewed the global fund has approved 107 projects for phase 2 funding totaling 11 billion some projects were not approved for phase 2 funding due to poor performance others were temporarily cancelled when accounting inconsistencies were found to date the global fund has cancelled one grant the decision to cancel the grant in myanmar sparked debate among policy analysts about how best to serve humanitarian needs

including government the ngo community the private sector people living with hivaids tuberculosis andor malaria religious and faith groups the academic sector and united nations agencies represented in the applicant country8 the fund views ccms as essential in assuring true partnerships that involve all relevant actors in developing grant proposal sharing information and communicating with one another on global fund issues ccms can also serve as forums through which national efforts on aids tuberculosis and malaria can be 6 distribution of funding after four rounds at

from individual organizations such as ngos are permitted only from countries without legitimate governments or in other exceptional circumstances may 2003 report by the us government accountability office gao while praising the global fund for noteworthy progress in establishing essential governance and other supporting structures and for responding to challenges noted several problems with respect to the ccms10 these included difficulties in communication between the ccms and global fund headquarters misperceptions within ccms about the roles and responsibilities of the ccm itself and of ccm members and in some ccms lack of information sharing and infrequent meetings however the gao report also noted that the fund was addressing these problems through enhanced communication holding workshops including language describing the duties of ccms in grant agreements and other measures11 in july 2004 report the global fund acknowledged that the membership of ccms continued to be dominated by governments that people living with the three diseases tended to be underrepresented and that few ccms had followed guidelines on gender balance12 some in the ngo community and among aids activists have urged that the global fund impose set of requirements on ccms with respect to these and other issues insisting that ngo representatives be included in all ccms for example13 governments in recipient countries tend to oppose such requirements14 and at its june 2004 meeting the global fund board decided to continue to deal with these matters through recommendations15 however at its november 2004 meeting the board decided to impose some requirements on ccms to take effect with phase 2 renewals from june 2005 and for new grants from round 5 onwards under these requirements all ccms must demonstrate evidence of membership of people living with andor affected by the diseases ccm members representing the ngo sector must be selected based on documented transparent process

2004 available at httpwwwaidspanorg crs6 ccms must establish transparent documented process to solicit and review submissions for possible integration into proposals to nominate principal recipients to oversee project implementation and to ensure that there is broad range of stakeholders in the proposal development and grant oversight process when the principal recipient and the chair or vice chairs of ccm are from the same entity the ccm must have written plan in place to mitigate against the inherent conflict of interest16 the ccm submits single country coordinated proposal ccp to the global fund where it is reviewed by the 22member technical review panel trp consisting of independent experts in the three diseases as well as others with broader global health experience the trp is tasked with identifying the proposals most likely to have clear and demonstrable impact in the fight against aids tb and malaria17 and refers those proposals to the board for discussion and final decisions on approval within the recipient country projects are implemented by one or more principal recipients prs which should be agencies or organizations that belong to the ccm the prs are responsible not only for carrying out the project but also for managing its finances each pr must have an independent auditor acceptable to the fund18 but the work of the prs is also monitored by local fund agents lfas which represent the global fund within the recipient country and are regarded as the funds eyes and ears each lfa is expected to have an incountry presence enabling it to assess the capabilities of the prs and effectively evaluate their financial and program reports the identification and selection of lfas carried out in conjunction with the ccms was prolonged process but ultimately private sector accounting firms management and consulting companies and the office for project services were recruited to fill the lfa role in various countries19 the lfas are paid centrally through the global fund and their fees are not deducted from the grants the gao notes that there are misunderstandings and resentments toward the lfas in some countries and that the global fund is trying to address these by encouraging local participation in the work of the lfas the gao is also concerned that it may be difficult to maintain the independence of the lfas in poor countries where the ranks of trained accountants and other experts are thin in such situations lfas may have difficulty recruiting skilled personnel who are not already involved in the global fundsupported program in one way or another20 16 global fund observer newsletter issue 36 november 21 2004 17 chrispus kiyonga then board chairman quoted in global fund press release march 11 2002 18 global health
