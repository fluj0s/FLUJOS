process although anecdotal evidence suggests that taa has helped firms adjust to import competition the firm taa program nonetheless has been criticized for its inability to reach all tradeimpacted firms its backlog of eligible firms that have not received assistance and its stringent and cumbersome certification process also taacs were found to have inconsistent cost and fee structures in recent years eda has taken steps to address these criticisms including improving outreach and coordination with other federal programs improving the efficiency of the taacs and undertaking comprehensive study to assess firm satisfaction and success with the taa program reauthorization of the taa programs has been at the heart of congressional consideration of the broader trade agenda in the 110 th congress the democratic leadership insisted on taking action on taa prior to other trade bills in the absence of an agreement to do so trade legislation including implementing bills for three outstanding free trade agreements stalled given the importance that many members attach to taa programs and its shortterm appropriations it is possible that taa program reauthorization may be among the first trade bills to receive consideration in the 111th congress

economic welfare of all trade partners but in compelling firms and workers to face stiffer global competition can also cause adjustment problems congress responded to this issue by authorizing three trade adjustment assistance taa programs to assist tradeimpacted workers firms and farmers this report discusses the taa program for firms which provides technical assistance to tradeaffected firms to help them develop strategies to remain competitive in the changing international economy1

countries freer trade is preferable to protectionism insights from the theory of comparative advantage point to freer trade providing mutual gains for countries because exchange encourages specialization where countries produce those goods at which they are relatively more efficient while trading for those at which they are relatively less so evidence supports theory trade appears to enable efficient producers within an industry and efficient industries within an economy to expand leading to reallocation of resources that increases countrys productivity output and income 2 consumers both firms and households also gain from wider variety of goods at lower prices it is also true that increased competition from trade liberalization creates both winners and losers presenting adjustment problems for all countries the more efficient firms and plants may grow as they expand into overseas markets the less efficient may contract merge or perhaps even fail when faced with greater foreign competition while the adjustment process may be healthy from macroeconomic perspective much like marketdriven adjustments that occur for reasons other than trade eg technological change it can be harsh transition for some firms and their workers3 critics of free trade agreements often highlight the adjustment costs of reducing trade barriers to avoid business closures and layoffs tradeimpacted firms often seek to weaken if not defeat trade liberalizing legislation this makes economic sense from the perspective of affected industries firms and workers but economists argue that in the long run it can be more costly for the country as whole the costs of protection arise because competition is suppressed reducing pressure on firms to innovate operate more efficiently and become lower cost producers the brunt of these costs falls to consumers both individuals and businesses who must pay higher prices but the national economy is also denied higher standards of living because of forgone productivity gains one way to balance the broadbased gains from freer trade with the more highly concentrated costs is to address the needs of firms negatively

authorized taa in title iii of the trade expansion act of 1962 pl 87794 including new firm and industry assistance program which is administered by the economic development administration eda of the us department of commerce 4 it provides technical assistance to help tradeimpacted firms make strategic adjustments that may allow them to remain competitive in global economy originally firm taa also included loans and loan guarantees but congress eliminated all direct financial assistance in 1986 because of federal budgetary cutbacks and concern over the programs high default rates and limited effectiveness the taa for firms program was last reauthorized through fy2007 at an annual funding level of 16 million as part of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 to receive assistance firm must first be certified as eligible by demonstrating that 1 significant number or proportion of workers became or are threatened to become totally or partially separated 2 sales production or both decreased absolutely and 3 increased imports of competing articles contributed importantly to the decline in sales production andor workforce once certified the firm has two years to apply for assistance in developing andor implementing its adjustment proposal approval depends on edas finding that the adjustment proposal 1 is reasonably calculated to materially contribute to the economic adjustment of

technical assistance to firm for preparation of the petition for eligibility certification and to certified eligible firm for developing the economic adjustment proposal or implementing the proposal in practice this technical assistance is provided through one of the 11 trade adjustment assistance centers taacs which operate as nonfederal consultants they provide technical assistance to firms

accepted adjustme nt p roposals historically program evaluation has been limite d lacking formal evaluation process although anecdotal evidence suggests that taa has helped firms adjust to import competition the urban institute conducted the most comprehensive evaluation of the program in 1998 it found the taa program effective in helping distressed manufacturing enterprises respond to foreign imports specifically the study concluded that five years after certification eligible firms that sought taa had higher survival rate 84 than those eligible firms that did not ultimately pursue assistance 70 this amounted to termination rate firm either merged or failed for assisted firms of about half that of unassisted firms also assi sted firms on average added 42 more employees and had sales growth of 34 compared to 53 loss of employees and 16 sales growth for eligible firms that had not received assistance 8 this study was careful to include control group in making comparisons by including data on those firms that entered the process and became eligible but declined the assistance comparison could be made between two similar groups of firms that took different paths this distinction is useful and lends credibility to the studys overall positive conclusions still given the financial commitment needed to participate it is likely that many eligible firms that did not pursue taa may not have had the financial ability to do so if so it is likely the control group may have included larger proportion of the most financially distressed firms and even in this group there was 70 survival rate after five years this would suggest that the firm taa program may help at the margin but without it between 70 and 86 of firms would still adjust on their own 9 the urban institute report pointed to specific characteristics of the taa program that were particularly effective including its unbiased diagnostic approach and competitive bidding process for consulting services its success in targeting viable firms and ensuring they are financially and managerially committed to the adjustment strategy and its customized broadbased and heavily subsidized assistance package on the other hand the firm taa program was criticized for not reaching all tradeimpacted firms being limited and backlogged in responding to eligible firms by funding restrictions and having stringent and cumbersome certification process that needed simplifying also taacs were found to have inco nsistent cost and fee structures and were encouraged to leverage other business assistance services 10 government accountability office gao repo rt points to similar problems in its own evaluation of the taa for firms program it highlights the inability of eda to monitor and evaluate the performance of either firms assisted after leaving the program or the taacs themselves gao also cites the small federal funding levels as reason for backlog of unfunded 8 us department of commerce economic development administration effective aid to tradeimpacted manufacturers an evaluation of the trade adjustment assistance program prepared by the urban institute washington dc november 1998 pp i 814 the study in praising the firm taa program expresses strong philosophical bias for assistance to tradeimpacted firms even to the point of considering increasing tariffs or other trade limiting remedies see p 57 9 the study also attempts to control for industry regional and national economic conditions that can be factors affecting firm recovery or failure ibid pp 1317 the government accountability office gao was even more critical of this study citing the selection bias issue as well as failure to test for other explanatory variables see us gao trade adjustment assistance impact

of the total firm adjustment project costs11 in recent years eda has taken steps to address the above criticisms outreach to more firms has increased through coordination with other federal programs and eda is working to automate forms and streamline the application process in fy2007 eda began to work more closely with the taa programs for workers and farmers to ensure that eligible firms and workers benefit from all programs eda has also enhanced taac performance through increased direct oversight of taacs and implementation of feedback mechanism using firm surveys to gauge their satisfaction and success rates taacs are now allocated funds in part based on performance measures number of firm certifications and adjustment proposals generated and quality measures that include the firm survey feedback mechanism and evaluation of taa client firm outcomes through contract with dunn bradstreet which is intended to provide some indication of successful interventions and progr am best practices one outcome appears to be reduction in time between application submission and receipt of assistance but data from the dunn bradstreet study on firm success rates and satisfaction are not expected until 2009 12 g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g138g151g141g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 by any measure firm and industry trade adjustment assistance is small federal program it remains nonetheless controversial critics point to fundamental arguments opposing taa that have been debated since before the program was initiated in 1962 first if competition resulting from trade liberalization is not considered unfair trade why should the federal government be involved second why should federal assistance be necessary for adjustment to trade competition when there is similar assistance for adjustment to domestic competitive pressures third should not this adjustment process simply be accepted as part of dynamic market economy working to allocate resources more efficiently and in way that is in the countrys longterm interests proponents of the program argue that taa is only modestly funded and provides benefits to firms owners managers and workers that amount to many times the value of federal expenditures also if changes in national trade policy have altered the rules under which businesses compete does not the federal government have some responsibility for assisting firms that bear the costs of adjustment finally point in favor of firm taa is that it focuses on adjustment not longterm financial assistance firms must commit their own resources and have every incentive to make adjustment to ensure their very survival they are not faced with the potential for dependency on longterm cash payments which critics charge is problem with some federal assistance programs in addition to the economic reasoning political considerations also surround the taa debate historically congress has accepted with some reservations that freer trade is in the longterm interests of the united states while those skeptical of trade liberalization may support taa for the assistance it provides to affected workers and firms proponents of freer trade may also embrace taa for its political expedience to the extent that firm and industry taa can address some of the concerns of adversely affected firms it may support trade liberalization as 11 gao op cit pp 13 and 18 12 federal register op cit p 6926 and correspondence with eda

through march 6 2009 in the 110 th congress representative rangel introduced the trade and globalization act of 2007 hr 3920 which incl uded taa reauthorization the house passed the bill by vote of 264 to 157 but the senate could not agree on similar bill s 1848 introduced by senator baucus major changes to the firm taa program from these bills would have included adding services firm eligibility expanding the eligibility criteria and reauthorizing the program through fy2012 at 50 million per year the house also defeated republican alternative by vote of 196 to 226 it reflected an emphasis on cost and effectiveness issues did not address services firms and would have required more stringent performance measures and reporting requirements reauthorization of the taa programs has been at the heart of congressional consideration of the broader trade agenda in the 110 th congress the democratic leadership insisted on taking action on taa prior to considering implementing bills for three bilateral free trade agreements ftas in part because congress did not agree to taa reauthorization bill none of the fta implementing bills was taken up either many members of congress attach high importance to taa programs and given appropriations for them will expire in march 2009 it is possible that taa program reauthorization may be among the first trade bills to receive consideration in the 111th congress13 g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 j f hornbeck specialist in international trade and finance
