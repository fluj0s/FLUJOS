following brief summary of these loan products the report compares perkins loans and stafford loans according to selected criteria this report is intended to provide the interested reader with basic understanding of perkins loans and stafford loans and to highlight some of their key similarities and differences perkins loans the federal perkins loan program is one of the three campusbased hea programs it is currently authorized unde r title ive of the hea and is successor to title ii loans to students in instituti ons of higher education of the national defense education act of 1958 pl 85864 which was incorporated into the hea through the education amendments of 1972 pl 92318 as campusbased program participating institutions play significant role in the programs operation ranging from being required to provide institutional matching funds for the capitalization of institutional re volving loan funds to their discretion in establishing institutionspecific criteria fo r awarding and packaging aid to their responsibility for administering their own perkins loan portfolios under the perkins loan program federa l funds are allocated to participating ihes to assist them in capitalizing revolving loan funds for the purpose of making lowinterest loans fixed at 5 to students with financial need institutions revolving loan funds are capitalized with combination of federal capital contributions fccs and institutional capital contributions iccs5 principal and interest repaid by students previously aw arded perkins loans and any other charges or earnings associated with the operation of the program maximum values for perkins loan awards are set by statute however the actual value of perkins loan awarded to any individual student depends in large part on institutionspecific conditions such as the size of the ihes revolving loan fund the students financial need relative to the need of other fs applicants at the institution and the application of the ihes own policies on awarding campusbased aid borrowers have grace period of nine months after longer being enrolled at least halftime to begin repaying their perkins loans interest accrues on perkins loans prior to student beginning repayment while repa yment is suspended during deferment and during grace periods in general perkins loans must be repaid within 10 years of student beginning repayment students may have their perkins loans cancelled following their employment in certain types of public servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32854crs3 6 key distinction between the ffel and the dl programs is that under the ffel program loans are capitalized by private lenders with the federal government providing lenders with guarantee against loss due to borrowers inab ility to repay their loans whereas under the dl program the federal government is the nder and capitalizes loans with federal funds 7 for more thorough description of an products available under the ffel and dl programs

during deferment borrowe rs of stafford loans may select from among range of repayment options they may also consolidate multiple stafford loans along with other loans including perkins loans to

an institutions cohort defau lt rate is defined as the percentage of current and former students entering repayment on perkins loans received for attendance at that institution who default on their loans before the end of the next award year cohort default rates are calculated over threeyear period for institutions with less than 30 students entering repayment in any one year stafford loans stafford loan borrowers are c onsidered to be in default after failing to comply with the terms of their promissory note or failing to make payments for 270 days for loans repayable monthly or 330

loans are not directly included in the calculation of cohort default rates lthough consolidation loans may ve some indirect effect on the calculation cohort default rates for the federal perkins loan program and the ffeldl programs are presented in table 8 for the period from 1996 through 2003 perkins loan cohort default rates have consistently been several percentage points higher than cohort default rates for ffeldl ans differences between programs in cohort default rates ma be explained in part by the different periods of time before which borrower is considered in default and by differences in the characteristics of borrowers especially considering that borrowers of unsubsidized stafford loans may borrow regardless of financial need table 8 federal perkins loan program and

ilitation borrowers loan may be either sold or reinstated borrowers whose loans have been rehabilitated regain full borrower privileges conclusion according to the criteria used to comp are perkins loans and stafford loans both subsidized and unsubsidized this report has shown that there are distinct differences between the types of loans still subsidized stafford loans might be considered as being somewhat more similar to perkins loans than unsubsidized stafford loans because they are needb ased and because the federal government pays the cost of interest as it accrues dur ing inschool grace and deferment periods this report has also shown that far fewer institutions offer perkins loans than make available stafford loans under either the ffel or dl programs and that far fewer students receive perkins loans than receive stafford loans the extent to which perkins loans may be considered duplicative of subsidized stafford loans depends on range of factors some of which are institution and studentspecific and others which are programmatic perkins loans might be more easily considered duplicative of subsidized stafford loans in instances where an institution offers both loan pr oducts and students financ ial need is less than the annual loan limit applicable to either loan type for give n year of study ie less than 2625 for 1st year undergraduate student on the other hand perkins loans and subsidized stafford loans might be considered as supplementing one another rather than being duplicative in instances where an ihe participates in both programs and students fina ncial need is greater than could be met entirely with either type of loan
