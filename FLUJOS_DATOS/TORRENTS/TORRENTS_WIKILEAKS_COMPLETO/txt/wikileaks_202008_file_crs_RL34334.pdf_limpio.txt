growing debate about whether the food and drug administration fda has the ability to accomplish its mission with the resources provided by congressional appropriations and industry user fees fda plays central role in protecting the public health in the united states by regulating most of the food supply and vitall important medical products including drugs devices and biologics that affect american lives on daily basis 2006 report on drug safety by the institute of medicine iom made the following observation in chapter devoted to fda resources the food and drug administration lacks the re sources needed to accomplish its large and complex mission today let alone to position itself for an increasingly challenging future there is little dispute that fda in general is severely underfunded 1 several individuals who previously held highran king positions in fda or the department of health and human services hhs have organized advocacy groups to lobby for increased funding for the entire agency2 these groups present data to support their position that fda has fallen behind in overall funding in the last 25 years they warn that the agency is at risk of being unable to adequately fulfill the many statutory responsibilities that congress has assigned it while the call for more resources has been heard from many quarters including some in congress some agency critics are concerned about inefficiencies within fda and that it needs to do better job managing what resources it does have 3 in general former fda commissioners and interest groups argue that fda is underfunded for its mission calls for cutting the fda budget or maintaining it at the current level come from organizations like cato and the hoover institute that propose limitations on fdas authority and therefore the need for funding the main voices in support of fda budget levels past and present have been representatives of the various presidential administrations over the last 25 years incumbent fda commissioners when asked during congressional hearings about the adequacy of the fda budget have testified that the budget is sufficient to accomplish the job before the agency however in noncongressional venues those same commissioners have expressed concerns about the constraints on fda resources and that the agencys core budget has not increased in concert with its rising responsibilities they have expressed concern about whether the agency can continue to be considered the worlds premier consumer protection agency when it is forced to focus its priorities based on the current level of resources that it receives 4 1 institute of medicine iom the future of drug safety promoting and protecting the health of the public alina baciu kathleen stratton sheila p burke

devices and animal drugs the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca as amended is the principal source of fdas authority8 the agency also derives some of its authority from certain provisions in other laws most notably the public health service phs act under the phs act fda licenses biological products9 and performs other activities such as setting standards for mammography quality10 an extensive list of the public laws that significantly affect fda activities is in table 4 in the appendix in addition to statutory responsibilities that directly involve product regulation the fda must

general federal management laws is substantial for example the agency supports more than 50 advisory committees most of which are mandated in statute and are subject to requirements of the federal advisory committee act13 also the agency reports that in fy2006 it processed more than 20000 information requests pursuant to requirements of the freedom of information act14 the congressional authorizing committees that oversee fda activities are those with jurisdiction over public health issues the senate committee on health education labor and pensions and the house committee on energy and commerce because medicare pays for fdaregulated products the agency also falls under the jurisdiction of the senate committee on finance and the house committee on ways and means other committees that exercise oversight roles regarding fda include the house committee on oversight and government reform and the senate committees on aging homeland security and go vernmental affairs and the judiciary the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on agriculture have jurisdiction over fdas appropriations this arrangement reflects in part the agencys origin within the department of agriculture as the bureau of chemistry in 1862 since 1940 fda has administratively been part of federal health agencies specifically hhs and its predecessors 15 advocates for increasing fda funding point to this jurisdictional separation of fda appropriations decisions from the rest of phs nd hhs as contributing factor to what they see as underfunding in 2002 former acting fda commissioner michael friedman recommended moving the fda budget process from the purview of the agriculture appropriations subcommittees to the labor health and huma n services education and related agencies subcommittees16 five years later former fda commissioner frank young raised the same concern and made the same recommendation in congressional testimony17 former fda commissioner jane henney made similar observation in february 2007 there are other things congress can do that directly impact this agencys resources if they really wanted to look long and hard fda would longer be under the purview of the agriculture appropriations committees those people that serve on those committees do it with honor but they do it primarily because of their interest in agricultural issues by the time the allocations come out and the interest of the agriculture areas are satisfied there are very limited resources that the agency fda can ever hope to receive out of that process if somebody wanted to

resources is its budget the agencys fy2007 total budget is approximately 2 billion19 the total fda budget also called the program level consists of 1 direct appropriations and 2 other funds ie funding from other sources that are acknowledged in the appropriations acts direct appropriations are the amount of funds that congress assigns to the agency from the annual total available for appropriations as set by the budget committees other funds include reimbursables cooperative research and development agreement crada resources intra and interagency services such as the parklawn computer center mammography fees color certification fees export certification fees prescription drug user fees medical device user fees and animal drug user fees fda annually prepares budget data for congress that it presents in the justification of estimates for appropriations committees justification documents fda transmits its draft through hhs to the white house office of management and budget omb the final justification documents reflecting any hhs and omb adjustments are published with the presidents annual budget request to congress the final justifications are the major source of fda budget figures and tables in this report like most federal agencies fda has over time reorganized its structure activities and budget accounting which makes historical budget analysis difficult endeavor for further information on the difficulties in compiling budget history of the agency and the steps taken to address those problems for this report see the methodology section in the appendix until fy1992 direct appropriations formed over 95 of fdas total program level with other funds contributing the small remainder shif t began in fy1992 when congress authorized 1 the assessment and collection of user fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for the review of human drug and biologics applications and 2 fees for the inspection of mammography facilities congress subsequently authorized the collection of user fees for the review of medical device applications in fy2002 and animal drug applications in fy2004 by fy2007 other funds primarily user fees accounted for almost quarter of fdas total program level budget another indicator of agency resources is personnel available in the justification documents as the number of fulltime equivalent employees ftes this is however an imperfect measure of personnel strength because it is not weighted by type of position pay grade or responsibility each of which would provide different measure of the agencys human resources fda has described how adjusting salaries for standard measures of inflation is inadequate because of the unique elements of its staff expenses such as higher than average employee salaries cost of health and retirement benefits and resources required for recruitment and retention 20 fte numbers do not include contractors and therefore provide only partial measure of workforce continued washington university school

the 28year period covered in this report the numbers of ftes may be an inaccurate measure of agency personnel strength figure 1 shows the total fda budget ie prog ram level for fy1980 through fy2007 all adjusted to fy2000 dollars21 the fda program level is composed of direct congressional appropriations what fda calls budget authority and other funds22 using constant fy2000 dollars allows

figure also provides fte data over the same fiscal years ftes funded by budget authority and total ftes funded at program level budget authority plus other funds primarily user fees as can be seen in figure 1 inflationadjusted budget authority was relatively flat from fy1980 to fy1988 began to increase from fy1989 until fy1 993 when it leveled off coincident with the introduction of user fees in 1993 figure 1 also shows decline in budget authority ftes from fy1993 to fy2001 although the total ftes remained relatively constant due to positions funded by user fees congressional intent in authorizing user fees was that these fees would supplementrather than replaceresources provided by congress to fda level funding from congresswithout adequate allowances for inflation mandatory salary and health insurance increases as well as other workloadrelated unfunded mandateshas resulted in declines in ftes in areas of the agency that do not receive user fees 2002 government accountability office gao report on the impact of user fees resulting from the prescription drug user fee act pdufa states that according to fda officials the agency reduced staffing levels to cover the costs of unfunded pay raises from fiscal years 1994 through 2001 fda paid about 250 million to cover mandatory federal pay raises for which it did not receive increases in its appropriations this situation reduced the agencys ability to support activities not funded by pdufa fda reduced the staffing levels for nonpdufa activities each year leaving the agency fewer resources to perform its other responsibilities for example in its budget justification for fiscal year 2002 fda reported that inspection of medical device manufacturers has decreased and the agency does not routinely inspect the manufacturers of lowerrisk products although fda staffing in fiscal year 2001 was about the same as in fiscal year 1992 about 1000 more ftes were allotted to drug and biologic review activities in fiscal year 2001 and about 1000 fewer ftes were allotted to other fda programs that ensure food safety approve new medical devices such as heart valves and pacemakers and monitor devices once on the

have increased the pay for approximately 250 product reviewers specifically fda conducted studies of staff turnover and found that toxicologists pharmacologists pharmacokinetists and mathematical statisticians were leaving fda to work in private industry and academia for higher salaries under federal personnel regulations fda is authorized to pay retention allowance of up to 10 percent of an employees basic pay to group or category of employees in such circumstances 25 the gao report also found that fda reviewers particularly those in cber center for biologics evaluation and research did not participate in training and professional development activities to ensure that the agency meets pdufa goals26 the 2006 iom report commented on the attrition of fda personnel by stating that although one explanation for the turnover is that fda staff leave for promising opportunities in industry it is possible that turnover is indicative of lessthanideal organizational culture that requires attention 27 potential indicator of the difficulty fda has in keeping experienced staff is the agencys issuance of retention bonuses to some employees this practice is controversial and is under investigation by the house committee on energy and commerce the payments attracted bipartisan criticism from lawmakers who say that at the fda many of the bonuses went to the highestpaid officials rather than the scientists inspectors and doctors most at risk of jumping to the private sector to critics the payments bore little relationship to the agencys performance and reputation or to the likelihood that someone might depart agency officials disagree and call the program success in 2002 the fda lost 12 to 13 percent of its employees while in 2006 with the bonus program in place

frank young david kessler and jane henney all agreed that fda is underfunded dr kessler made the following observations on the funding congress has provided for nih cdc and fda while congress has attempted to provide resources for burgeoning public health needs on other fronts support for the fda has faltered in comparison in 1986 fdas budget was comparable to 97 of the budget for cdc and 8 of the nihs budget by 2006 it had dropped to 28 of cdcs budget and 5 of nihs significantly while the nihs budget to fund the research that leads to discoveries that ultimately fill the fdas drug pipeline has doubled over the last five years fdas budget has not grown 32 on this same point former acting fda commissioner michael friedman made the following observations it is myopic to fund minimal fda when we have doubled the nih budget roughly every 10 years for the past 40 years or when the pharmaceutical industry annually invests more than 30 billion in research and development because regulatory review is the final common pathway for all translational medicine this lack of resources is ratelimiting i cannot predict everything that our citizens demand from fda but i am sure they are not currently getting it the issue is not what the fda needs it is rather what the american public deserves 33 the 2006 iom drug safety report notes that over the years various groups have examined the same questions about the fda and its budget and have made variety of proposals and recommendations to improve the agency that have not been fully implemented the iom report goes on to state that primary obstacle may be the chronic underfunding of core fda activities owing to inadequate attention to resource needs by congress and the office of management and budget34 some members of congress also have expressed concern over the fda funding level and have voiced their frustration at the inability to obtain clarification from the agency on the adequacy of the fda budget source of apparent frustration to those members including some who serve on the appropriations subcommittees and have indicated their willingness to increase appropriations to the agency are the fda officials who year after year neither ask for increased funding in their testimony nor in response to members questions acknowledge what some observers perceive to be the agencys needs for additional resources for example in written testimony regarding the fy2004 proposed budget fda commi ssioner mark mcclellan stated we believe our budget request will allow fda to fund ongoing operations at the current level

each agency and program request reflects the george w bush administrations relative priority for that operation activity or program 35 in contrast to the above testimony which occurred when he was commissioner former fda commissioner mark mcclellan made the following statement at march 2007 hearing of the senate committee on health education labor and pensions first the fda will need significantly greater appropriations to improve postmarket safety the fda is overstretched and lack of trained staff and technical capabilities to perform the oversight necessary on thousands of prescription drugs is an even more pressing issue than providing the fda with new regulatory authorities36 current fda commissioner andrew von eschenb ach provided the following statement when commenting on the adequacy of the fy2008 budget at senate appropriations committee hearing these resources are an essential step in building 21st century fda that responds to the new opportunities and new challenges of science and technology our budget allows fda to strengthen the tools we use to ensure the safety of foods evaluate new products and better predictearlier and more accuratelythe safety and efficacy of drugs biologics and medical devices with these resources we will work to ensure that americans enjoy the benefits of personalized medicine safe and wholesome food supply and the promise of better healthier future 37 the iom committee that worked on the 2006 drug safety report also was not able to ascertain the agencys funding requirements convention dictates that federal agencies do not publicly articulate resource needs that differ from those offered in the presidents budget so the iom committee was unable to understand fully what fda leadership estimate s is needed to meet current objectives let alone the expanded responsibilities the committee envisions for the future38 in his may 1 2007 testimony former commissioner donald kennedy confirmed this point i hope you and your staff will be diligent about pursuing fda resource needs but you may have to rely on grizzled veterans like because budget authorities at hhs and omb specifically prohibit present officials in the agency from speaking out publicly about the need for more funding it is important that americans know when they hear fda 35 written testimony of mark mcclellan commissioner of the

that they have their fingers crossed underneath the witness table39 like all federal agencies fdas budget history reflects both administration requests and congressional decisions on appropriations in gene ral previous administrations have not argued before congress for increased fda funding over the years in some situations however congress has decided to grant additional funds to agencies above an administrations request for example the relevant house and senate appropriat ions bill reports demonstrate that congress has often chosen to increase nih funding when an administration has not requested additional appropriations congress is supported and encouraged in its efforts to increase the nih budget by various health and research advocacy groups which promote their individual causes some agencies are able to bypass budget adjustments made by hhs and omb via alternative mechanisms for example the national cancer institute nci at nih is mandated by the national cancer act of 1971 pl 92218 to prepare and submit directly to the president for review and transmittal to congress an annual budget estimate including an estimate of the number and type of personnel needs for the institute for the national cancer program after reasonable opportunity for comment but without change by the secretary the director of nih and the institutes advisory council 40 the socalled nci bypass budget received by congress describes the increase required to maintain ncis present level of operations and the increases required to expand existing initiatives41 similarly cdc has prepared professional judgment budget in response to requests from congressional appropriations committee42 regulatory agency such as the fda may be perceived as an impediment to achieving the goals of advocacy groups concerned with the expeditious approval of new drugs or devices for the treatment of specific diseases however when drug or device adverse events occur there is heightened concern about fdas approval process in general attention to fda s state of affairs seems to be dependent on reaction to crisis the public and congress tend to focus on the agency when its regulatory processes fail to meet their expectations this phenomenon is perhaps best exemplified by the thalidomide episode in 1962 43 however even significant legislative solutions such as the kefauverharris drug amendments of 1962 which required demonstration of effectiveness prior to drug approval were not accompanied by an increase in funding for fda in his history of fda and its regulation of the pharmaceutical industry philip j hilts referring to passage of kefauverharris reported that unfortunately when congress took this step forward getting serious about science and testing to protect the public it did what it had often done before it voted to give the agency new duties and responsibilities while failing to provide the money to allow the agency to 39 donald kennedy testimony before the

trouble and would not be remedied for three decades44 presumably the remedy hilts is referring to is pdufa and the implementation of user fees by fda in 1993 some critics argue that user fees have not solved fdas funding problems and have led to additional complications for the agency 45 critics also suggest that the way the agency has been managed and the resource structure imposed by statute contribute to the agencys perceived problems in accomplishing its mission g8g6g3g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g162g556g3g155g142g138g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g156g561 fda is organized into six centers which cover the broad activity areas for which the agency has responsibility and two offices that perform agencywide functions 46 the traditional activity areas are somewhat parallel to the current centers fda s major activity areas are foods human drugs biologics animal drugs and feeds and medical devices and radiological health this report focuses on the activity areas rather than the centers to be consistent with the presentation in the historical justification documents center names and their activity area responsibilities have changed over time to reflect shifts in agency organization but the agencys activity areas have stayed fairly constant over the past 25 years although fda consistently reports its budget recommendations broken out by activity areas it is not possible using the publicly available justifications to determine whether these categories have always included the same activities therefore as with other federal agencies it is not always possible to accurately compare categories of budget or staffing over long periods of time an example of this as discussed below is the changing placement of biologics in the agencys budget biologics was encompassed for time within the human drug budget and fdas justifications provide means of separating the two activities this report contains the most consistent accounting that was possible from the information provided in the fda justifications 47 for further information on the difficulties in compiling budget history of the agency and the steps taken to address those problems in this report see the methodology section in the appendix the office of the commissioner and the national center for toxicological research do not have direct regulatory responsibilities and therefore are only described briefly in this report their funding and personnel are included however in the fda totals the office of regulatory affairs ora conducts fdas compliance activities incl uding inspection and enforcement across all activity areas the agencys budget justification documents allocate ora funding to each activity area as field activities 44 ibid p 165 45 frank young testimony before the us house of representatives

statutory authorities assigned to specific fda activity areas frequently mandate initiatives without resources for implementation the implementation of major new initiatives requires adequate time and resources to meet congressional intent former fda commissioner frank young indicated that while he was commissioner there were mandates for 22 new activities without accompanying appropriations which he categorized as unfunded mandates50 he also attested to the difficulty for the agency in th implementation of new statutory language in the case of implementing the hatchwaxman act for the expeditious evaluation of generic drug products he stated the following there were major problems in the developmen t of procedures within fda inadequate resources available for crafting the regulations and difficulties in the implementation of the initial anda abbreviated new drug application processes similarly there were 50 frank young testimony before the us house of representatives

procedures for approval of products developed by industry during the initial implementation of the act the agency was in uncharted water 51 likewise implementation of the fda modernizat ion act of 1997 fdama required the agency to develop 42 new regulations 23 guidances and numerous reports and studies many within year52 at the time hhs secretary shalala commented on the complications and costs of carrying out the effort which she estimated to be 50 million53 the 158 billion that fda has collected in prescription drug user fees since fy1993 has helped the agency improve the timeliness of its drug review process these benefits may mask what some fda advocates see as pdufas distorting effects on withinactivityarea budgeting congress included in pdufa an important limitation of ten referred to as trigger to ensure that the user fees would supplement rather than supplant appropriated funds to collect and spend the drug user fees fda must maintain at least the same level of effort on activities related to human drug review as it had before pdufa that li mitation would not affect other parts of the fda budget if other funding were to keep pace with both inflation and the needs of the agency however according to fda documents and the observations of external experts fdas financial situation has changed over the 15 years since pdufa began fda has had to use directly appropriated funds to keep the pdufarelated activities at least constant over time thereby diverting those funds from other uses fda financial reports required under pdufa have claimed that this unanticipated pdufa effect has resulted in an erosion of core fda programs 54 g8g6g3g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g152g155g162g561g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561 the research program at fda provides scientific

subcommittee dr david korn stated that congress has not been asked to support research explicitly research has always been buried in the agencys budget 58 dr korn suggested that it would require major

congress59 the final report of the subcommittee dated march 1997 stated that the decreasing agency research budget is of overarching concern although there is general appreciation of the fact that in times of constrained resources the agency must take particular care that its mandated regulatory responsibilities are competently discharged there is widely held perception among agency scientists that the research programs do not have strong advocacy at the highest levels of agency leadership and are frontline targets for curtailment or elimination as discretionary resources decline the subcommittee believes strongly that starving the agencys base of intramural scientific expertise must inevitably compromise the quality of review and regulatory activities 60 the role of fda research and the level of resources required for its support continues to be identified as an issue for the agency during the may 1 2007 congressional hearing the former commissioners specified the lack of financial support for the research program at fda as major concern former commissioner frank young stated that research at cber has been eviscerated through recent reorganization and is almost non existent in cder to maintain the expertise necessary for expeditious but highly competent decisions on new breakthrough products it is essential to have well trained scientific staff that is given the time to not only maintain scientific expertise but to pursue career development in their chosen field of science61 on this same point former commissioner david kessler stated that the erosion of funding has struck hard at th agencys ability to pport its proud tradition of groundbreaking research in regulatory science while in the past the agency led the way in developing new scientific paradigms for approving biologics and assessing food contaminantsto the benefit of both industry and consumersresources for fda to lend its intellectual firepower to addressing key regulatory questions are increasingly scarce 62 g8g6g3g561g21g140g146g142g151g140g142g561g4g152g138g155g141g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561 report that assessed whether science and tec hnology at the fda can support current and future regulatory needs was released in november 200763 the report was requested by fda commissioner andrew von eschenbach in december 2006 and was prepared by the fda science board group of independent advisors it found that fda suffers from serious scientific deficiencies and is not positioned to meet current or emerging regulatory responsibilities64 the report points at two reasons for the deficiency the demands on fda have soared and resources have not increased in proportion to the demands it states that due to constrained resources and 59 ibid p 901 60 the science

priority setting or firefighting regulatory posture instead of pursuing culture of proactive regulatory science65 the fda science board was specifically asked to review the status of science and technology at fda and not to evaluate the available resources however the report states that the status of science and technology was so intertwined with two decades of inadequate funding that it was impossible to assess technology without also assessing resources66 the science board also looked at reports on fda issued by previous revi ew committees each given similar charge over the past 50 years it found that the concerns outlined in past reports were the same as those in the present and that fda has consistently been unabl to implement the needed changes an advisor to the science board garret fitzgerald blamed faction of congressional majorities and presidential administrations that has serially stripped the agency of assets67 representative rosa delauro who in the 110th congress was appointed chair of the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture rural development fda and related agencies stated that the november 2007 report confirms facts that she believes have been apparent to congress and fda for some time science at the fda is deteriorating and the agency lacks the planning management structure and resources to restore their scientific capabilities68 she further states that although her subcommittee is working on providing additional funds for the agency money alone will not resolve the problems at fdathese additional funds need to be supported by an adequate management structur and sound plan on how these funds will be used to ensure that they are not wasted 69 the fda science board report concluded that fda can longer fulfill its mission without substantial and sustained additional appropriations and that the agency is in danger of losing its remaining dedicated staff if the chronic underfunding of the agency is not addressed immediately 70 the report stated that there is insufficient investment in professional development for fda staff which means that the workforce does not keep up with scientific advances inadequately trained scientists are generally riskaverse and tend to give decision slow decision or even worse the wrong decision on regulatory approval or disapproval71 the report also concluded that funding increases recommended by other groups such as iom and the coalition for stronger fda are insufficient to allow all the changes necessary for the agency to fulfill its mission without substantial increase in resources the agency is powerless to improve its performance will fall further behind and will be unable to meet either the mandates of congress or the expectations of the american public this will damage not only the health of the population of the us but also the health of the economy 72 65 ibid p 4 66 ibid p 6 67 gardiner harris advisers say fdas flaws put lives at risk the new york times

regulates all foods except for meat and poultry which are regulated by the us department of agriculture usda 76 it is also responsible for assuring that cosmetic products are safe and properly labeled the agency regulated 417 billion worth of domestic food 49 billion worth of imported food and 60 billion worth of cosmetics in 200177 these numbers encompass the economic activity of about 50000 food establishments manufacturers processors and food warehouses and 3500 cosmetic firms 78 not included in these figures are the roughly 600000 restaurants and institutional food service establishments and 235000 supermarkets grocery stores and other food outlets that are regulated by state and local authorities for which fda provides guidance model codes and other technical assistance although fda is responsible for ensuring the safety of the food supply its role is primarily reactive since most foods and their ingredients are not subject to prior approval or even review before they enter interstate commerce the agency does have responsibility over some product ingredients that require premarket approval such as food and color additives fda also performs postmarket monitoring of food labels and investigates food safety problems that arise the agencys surveillance program tests food samples to determine if pesticide residues or heavy metals are present in unacceptable amounts it also sets standards for label information to assist consumers in determining the ingredient and nutrient content of the foods that they are purchasing the agencys current activities related to foods are primarily conducted by the center for food safety and applied nutrition cfsan the pure food and drug act of 1906 gave the agency its initial authority to prohibit the interstate commerce of adulterated or misbranded food products along with the authority to assess criminal penalties for violations and seize offending products the federal food drug and cosmetic act 73 budget size varies

required the agency to promulgate definitions and standards for foods and informative labeling it also prohibited false advertising and the addition of substances that would render the food adulterated over the years several amendments to the act added authorities that required fda to establish 1 tolerances safe levels for pesticides on agricultural commodities 2 premarket approval systems for food and color additives and packaging substances 3 rules for labels to facilitate price comparisons and 4 rules to assure that packages contain the amount of product the label claims by fy2007 congress had added number of new fda authorities to those that existed before fy1980 see table 2 under the infant formula act of 1980 pl 96359 fda established requirements for the manufacturing labeling and nutrient standards for these products the nutrition labeling and education act of 1990 nlea pl 101535 provided authority for 1 mandating nutrition labels on most food products and 2 following the agencys review allowing nutrient content and health claims in addition nlea preempted most state and local requirements for labeling giving fda responsibility for regulating all aspects of nutrition labeling information nlea resulted in the promulgation of significant number of new regulations and revisions of old rules for consistency with the new authorities the dietary supplement health and education act of 1994 dshea pl 103417 provided specific authority for the regulation of supplements and placed the burden of proof on the agency to demonstrate that supplement already on the market was unsafe and needed to be removed the food quality protection act of 1996 pl 104170 established single healthbased standard for pesticides in all foods and provided special safety provisions for infants and children after ffdca provisions were amended by the fqpa of 1996 fda continued to monitor pesticide residue levels in food in interstate commerce which it does through its total diet study and enforce tolerances through its food inspection programs while epa remains the lead agency on setting tolerances and related issues the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 pl 105115 eliminated premarket approval of foodcontact substances ie packaging materials replacing it with notification proc ess along with expanding procedures for fda authorization of health and nutrient conten t claims under the nlea statutory standard the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 pl 107 188 required all domestic and foreign facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for us consumption to register with fda and mainta in records for agency inspection the act also required prior notice to fda of products being imported into the united states and provided the agency with administrative detention authority and penalties the food allergen labeling and consumer protec tion act of 2004 pl 108282 required that specific statement appear on food label when any of the most common allergens are present in food in 2006 the dietary supplement and nonpresc ription drug consumer protection act pl 109462 was enacted which created system for reporting to fda any serious adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplement as well as record keeping and inspection authority that may be necessary in cases of reported adverse event food safety provisions within the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 pl 11085 required the creation of registry for reportable information on foods with safety problems it also allowed for the identification of the supply chain of the questionable food item adjusted for inflation fda s foods budget doubled between fy1980 and fy2007 the number of ftes

certain events and policy initiatives during the 28year period the budget was relatively flat through the 1980s with requests primarily for mandatory costs and program increases the increase in budget and ftes in the early 1990s reflect the considerable amount of work required to implement nlea and the simultaneous cfsan reorganization food safety activities also contributed to the modest increase in ftes and funding the subsequent drop off of ftes from fy1992 to fy1997 represents both deficit reduction efforts and shift in ftes to elsewhere in the agency as noted in the 2002 gao report the new cfsan building opened in college park md in 2001 construction costs were part of the budget increases from 1997 until 2001 increases in both funding and ftes in the late 1990s also signaled president clintons food safety initiative increases in the fy2002 budget and fy2003 ftes represent increased agency attention to the food supply following the domestic terrorist attacks and subsequent passage of the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 however the increases did not continue the foods budget has remained flat while the number of ftes has decreased since fy2002 another reorganization of the foods portion of the agency occurred after 911 as result of reordering of the centers work and priorities recent concerns about food safety problems have

proportion of fda s budget for human drug activities while total funding has increased over the period this has been entirely due to the increase in user fees congressional appropriations have remained essentially flat separating ftes by funding source shows that the overall increase in personnel comes solely from the user fees first collected in fy1993 and that the overall increase in ftes obscures 19 decrease in congressionally funded budget authority personnel from fy1992 to fy2007 the 1992 prescription drug user fee act in prov iding fda with an additional source of funding explicitly stated that the funds were to supplement not supplant congressional appropriations the law included complex formulas known as triggers to enforce that goal fda may collect and use fees only if the direct appropriations for the activities involved in the review of human drug applications and for fda activities overall remain funded at level at least equal to the prepdufa budget adjusted for inflation as specified in the statute 83 these triggers in particular and the relative contributions of appropriations and user fees to fdas budget for human drugs have implications for budget planning both within the human drugs activity area and in agencylevel decisions across all activities the drugrelated tasks for which fda is res ponsible have evolved along with the social economic scientific and technologic developments in the united states even before there was bureau of chemistry in the department of agriculture established in 1862 the ancestral origin of the current fda congress passed legislation to prevent the importation of adulterated and spurious drugs and medicines the 1906 food and drugs act heralded the future influence of the federal government on drug and food regulation to protect the publics health many laws followed see brief descriptions in the appendix table a4 among the most significant are the 1938 ffdca which required that drugs be safe and the 1962 kefauverharris amendments to the ffdca which required that drugs also be effective subsequent laws addressed many issues for fda such as aiming to boost pharmaceutical research and development to speed the approval of new medicines including by supplementing fda resources with user fee revenue and to encourage research in pediatric drugs 84 between fy1980 and fy2007 congress added to fdas responsibilities new areas or expanded existing ones that involved scientific legal and enforcement expertise see table 3 most recently the fda amendments act of 2007 pl 11085 amended dozens of ffdca sections these included human drugs provisions to reauthorize certain programs such as the assessment collection and use of prescription drug user fees to enhance fdas authority in ensuring safety and effectiveness over products life both pre and postapproval it required the secretary to maintain an internet website with extensive drug safety information new authorities include civil monetary penalties for failure to comply with certain postmarket study labeling and television advertisement requirements mandates and incentives for pediatric drug research and labeling and requirements for

responsibility for biologics was first delegated in the early 1900s to the hygienic laboratory precursor of the national institutes of health nih 87 in 1972 regulatory authority for biologics was transferred from the nih divisi on of biological standards to the fda bureau of biologics88 during the early 1980s the fda merged the bureau of drugs and the bureau of biologics to form the national center for drugs and biologics in 1984 all of the national centers within fda were redesignated simply as centers in 1987 the fdas center for drugs and biologics was split into the center for drug evaluation and research cder and the center for biologics evaluation and research cber cber continues to use nih facilities and buildings until the expected move in 2012 to the new fda headquarters in white oak md because biotechnology products frequently cross the conventional boundaries between biologics drugs and devices determining the jurisdictional status of these new products has been difficult for both the fda and industry some products have had characteristics that met multiple statutory and scientific definitions in 1991 the fda publi shed an intercenter agreement between cber

additional specific requirements may also be applied to cvmregulated products though usda and fdacfsan have primary responsi bility for the safety of products intended for human food97 cvm is responsible for some specific aspects of the safety of human foods derived from animals such as determining toleranc safe levels of certain chemicals in meat and poultry and evaluating the food safety aspects of animal clones and their offspring also before cvm approves an animal drug its use in animals must be shown to be safe for humans as well drug sponsors must demonstrate that method is available to detect and measure any drug residues left in edible tissues of foodproducing animals farmers and veterinarians who use drugs on foodproducing animals must adhere to guidelines about how much time must elapse before treated animal can be slaughtered or before its milk can be marketed and any other constraints or warnings that are stated on the drug label figure 8 shows the total fda

effectiveness of medical devices and eliminating unnecessary human exposure to manmade radiation from medical occupational and consumer products105 there are thousands of types of medical devices from heart pacemakers to contact lenses radiationemitting products regulated by the agency include microwave ovens video display terminals and medical ultrasound and xray machines fda reviews requests to research or market medical devices collects analyzes and acts on information about injuries and other experiences in the use of medical devices and radiationemitting electronic products sets and enforces good manufacturing practice regulations and performance standards for radiation emitting electronic products and medical devices monitors compliance and surveillance programs for medical devices and radiationemitting electronic products and provides technical and other nonfinancial assistance to small manufacturers of medical devices the agencys current activities related to devices and radiological health drh are primarily conducted by its center for devices and radiological health as pr eviously noted cber regulates some devices specifically those associated with blood collection and processing procedures as well as with cellular therapies eg stem cell treatments in fy1980 after adjusting for inflation fdas drh budget was 97427000 which supported 1399 ftes see figure 9 at that time the agencys responsibilities with respect to devices were governed primarily by the medical device amendments of 1976 mdma pl 94295 mdma was the first major legislation passed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices including diagnostic products before they could be marketed the amendments required manufacturers to register with fda and follow qua lity control procedures in their manufacturing processes they also required fda to conduct premarket review of some products and to generate performance standards that devices had to meet before they could be marketed between fy1980 and fy2007 several major pieces of device legislation were passed see table 6 some of these added new types of responsibilities in 1990 congress gave fda the authority to enforce postmarket requirements for devices to act on postmarket adverse event reports and to recall unsafe devices pl 101629 in 1992 congress gave fda the authority to require that manufacturers of defective products implement certain consumer accommodations and pursue penalties for postmarket surveillance noncompliance pl 102300 in 1997 congress passed the food and drug administration modernization act fdama major fda reform legislation that tasked the agency with accelerating its pr emarket review and regulating unapproved uses of approved devices pl 105115 other legislation contained provisions that could reduce or minimize rather than simply increase the regulatory burden on fda for example while the mammography quality standards act mqsa added the responsibility of requiring the agency to certify mammography facilities it also provided the authority to collect associated certification fees creating new revenue stream pl 102539 mqsa also allowed certain accredited thirdparties to conduct inspections in order to relieve fda of some of that responsibility 104 this section was prepared by erin d williams specialist in public health and bioethics 105 for

nonappropriations legislation for fdas drhrelated activities in the 28year period under examination the medical device user fee and modernization act mdufma pl 107250106 the law gave fda the authority to collect user fees for premarket device review creating another significant source of revenue it also accredited thirdparties to conduct inspections measure designed to reduce fdas regulatory burden to preclude user fees fr om supplanting direct appropriations mdufma contained trigger requiring certain amount of drhrelated direct appropriations for the collection of user fees to continue in 2005 dire ct appropriations did not meet the trigger amount congress subsequently reduced the trigger amount so fda could continue to collect the user fees pl 10943 between fy1980 and fy2007 congressional appropriations for drhrelated activities generally followed the agencys budget requests as figure 9 indicates the number of ftes and budget remained relatively flat through the 1980s both then increased in the early 1990s beginning in the late 1990s the budget and ftes began to track somewhat differently than they had in the past107 the flat budget in the late 1990s did not occur with fairly constant number of ftes as it had in the 1980s but rather with decrease in ftes likewise the budget increases that have occurred thus far in the 2000s have increased the number of ftes but not by as much as with similar budget increases in the early 1990s readers should note that the drop in ftes between fy2006 and fy2007 apparent in figure 9 is misleading as the fte numbers are based upon continuing resolution which had allowance for user fees while the budget numbers are based upon cost estimate which did include user fees 106 for further information about medical device user fees see

commissioner has broad authority and responsibility to conduct research to support the agencys mission109 the office of the commissioner oc is made up of several components including the ethics program good clinical practice program history office office of combination products and office of crisis management among others110 as reported in the fy1982 budget justification fy1980 funding for the oc was included in fdas program management budget line this line also included funding for the associate commissioners and the general management personnel responsible for the central program direction and administrative support functions of the agency as reported in the fy2008 budget justification funding for the oc in fy2006 was included under the title fda headquarters and office of the commissioner it consisted of agencywide program direction and administrative services to ensure that fda s consumer protection efforts were managed and that available resources were put to the most efficient use

of its statutory responsibilities resources and responsibilities are juxtaposed because as congress requires more from the agency it is important to assess whether fda has the necessary financial resources to meet all those statutory responsibilities the report is intended to assist members and their staff in evaluating whether fdas resources have fallen short and if so how to enhance fdas performance the status of fda resources and agency performance is important to congress because each day fdaregulated products touch the lives of every american citizen as well as people around the world as stated previously about 25 of amer ican consumer dollars are spent on these fda regulated products among the industries that fda regulates are some of the most successful and innovative in the us economy the agency regulates wide range of products valued at more than 1 trillion problems with their safety or effectiveness could affect anyone as is evident from the following sample of things fda regulates the calorie and fat content information on food labels permissible and required information in televised prescription drug ads 109 21 usc 393d2c 110 see httpwwwfdagovoc 111 see

ingredients in prepared foodsfor people and animals inspection requirements for mammography and mri equipment and antibiotics in the feed fed to animals bred for human consumption the data in this report assembled from the annual material that each president submits to congress for the next years appropriation indicate some yearbyyear variation but mostly illustrate few trends for fda as whole comparing fy2006 the most recent year for which we have parallel data sources for both dollars and ftes to fy1980 yields these inflation adjusted findings see figure 1 fda budget almost doubling of direct congressi onal appropriations budget authority more than an 10fold increase in other funds mostly user fees resulting in an overall budget in fy2006 almost 212 times that in fy1980 fda ftes less than 1 increase in budget authorityfunded ftes an almost fourfold increase in ftes funded by other sources mostly user fees resulting in an overall 19 increase from fy1980 to fy2006 similar relationships are observed in each of the major activity areas that receive user fees the foods program does not have userfee funds and are discussed in this report the human drugs program along with biologics was the first to include user fee revenue in its budget and is good example to illustrate the relationship over time between congressionally appropriated dollars and user fee generated dollars again from fy1980 to fy2006 the data show that the human drugs total budget program level which included user fee revenue more than tripled 231 increase although the direct congressional appropriations budget authority increased by 78 the effect of user fees is even more evident in comparing the number of ftes the budget authority funded ftes decreased by 14 but the overall human drug fte level increased by 40 because of user fee funding for the human drug program in fy2006 user fees contributed 46 of the budget and funded 39 of the ftes in general congress has either kept direct ap propriations in line with inflation fy1980fy1988 fy1994fy1997 and fy20022007 or increased them gradually fy1989fy1993 and fy1998fy2001 the exception is fy2002 when congress increased direct appropriations to fda by 23 along with increases to other public safety agencies in response to the attacks of september 11 2001 and the anthrax mailings soon after congress and various administrations have allowed fdas research program to diminish and its many data systems are not meeting the agencys needs the context of this report does not allow distinction between program decisions made by budget constraints and those made by policy intent the focus of this report is the fda budget the discussion does not therefore explore other possible constraints on fdas meeting its responsibilities and the publics expectations such

both externally such as nih has with its patient advocacy groups and internally because of chronic vacancies in key leadership positions including the commissioner independent of whether the fda budget is sufficient to cover agency responsibilities is how fda manage s the resources it does have the influence of nonbudgetary factors likely complicates agency actions though analyzing that is beyond the scope of this report from 1980 through 2007 36 new major statutes were enacted that address fda activities112 this report does not evaluate the impact of individual statutory requirements on the workload and resources needs of the agency however an examination of the fda amendments act of 2007 fdaaa pl 11085 provides examples of the funding issues discussed in this report some news coverage of fdaaa hailed it as the most sweeping overhaul of the food and drug administration in decade 113 in addition to the widely expected reauthorization of drug and device user fees and pediatric drug research incentives fdaaa among other things authorized demonstration grants including ones for improving pediatric device availability established mechanisms for publicprivate partnerships to support fdas mission to accelerate medical product innovation translational therapeutics and enhanced medical product safety required an expanded clinical trial registry databank and strengthened fdas authority to require studies and labeling changes for drugs already on the market implementation of these and other provisions is to involve the development of new regulations and extensive communication with industry and the public carrying out these new responsibilities will require time and resources to fund all these provisions fdaaa authorized annually an additional 250 million in appropriations and 32 million in user fee revenue114 absent appropriations these authorizations re main congressional statements of intent this report has focused on the presentation of fda s financial and human resources and statutory responsibilities over time in presenting that info rmation in context the report also identifies actionsother than straightforward increase in direct appropriationsthat others have suggested as possible steps to help fdas budget situation these propose to restructure the pdufa trigger mechanism to minimize its unintended effect of pulling resources from nonpdufa activities authorize fda to bypass the hhs and omb budget offices in submitting its request for appropriations to congress require in addition to the ombprocessed budget request that the fda commissioner submit to congress professional judgment budget based on his or her personal expertise and experience 112 this number is held down by the concatenation of many in troduced bills into large packages passed as single items for example fdaaa of 2007 is counted once although it included the prescription drug user fee amendments of 2007 the medical device user fees amendments of 2007 the pediatric medical device safety and improvement act of 2007 the pediatric research equity act of 2007 and the best pharmaceuticals for children act of 2007 among many other items 113 drew armstrong major elements of the fda overhaul cq weekly health september 24 2007 p 2767 114 fdaaa included other provisions that could but do not necessarily affect fdas total program level these are direction to transfer appropriated funds for specified purpose s authority to assess certain civil penalties and authority to appropriate funds for certain grants and contracts

fy1980 the goal was to provide about 25 years of budget and fte history accomp anied by changes in the agencys statutory responsibilities only limited budget and fte data are available from bills and reports of the congressional appropriations committees citing constraints on its staff time fda indicated that it would only be able to provide data for recent years therefore this report used data prepared annually by fda for congress at the beginning of each budget cycle and presented in the justification documents the justifications are prepared initially by fda and transmitted through hhs to omb often with adjustments made by hhs and omb these documents provide detailed budget and fte data along with an extensive narrative over the years changes in agency organization accounting methods definitions and other conditions resulted in variations in data presentation in the justification documents although some data inconsistencies found in the documents could be explained other inconsistencies could not this section of the report provides the basic approach used to calculate historical budget and fte numbers highlights inconsistencies among the justification documents and describes the steps taken to make the data as consistent as possible there may be additional data inconsistencies that were not found because they were less readily apparent the annual justification documents present first the overall fda information narrative and budget and fte data followed by information for the various activity areas within the agency except as noted below this report uses data from the actuals column in tables labeled all purpose tabletotal program level all purpose tablebudget authority and all purpose tableuser fees these tables are found at the beginning of each

authority and 2 funds collected or transferred from other sources which this report refers to as other funds and which fda lists under user fees in recent justifications other funds include all of the financial and fte resources that are available to fda as itemized in the justifications that are from sources other than direct congressional appropriations in recent years the largest component of other funds comes from user fees collected under the authority of the prescription drug user fee act the medical device user fee and modernization act and the animal dr ug user fee act grouped
