child welfare financing policy or related program changes which are detailed below finally and unrelated to child welfare policy it amends the federal tax codes uniform definition of child for purposes of claiming variety of credits or deductions and it makes changes to certain investment rules for the treasury department those specific policy changes together with savings projected from the implementation of guardianship assistance and the school enrollment requirement are estimated by the congressional budget office cbo to fully offset the federal cost of the increased spending authorized by the bill over the next 5 and 10 years all of the child welfare policy changes in pl 110351 are made to programs or parts of the law that are administered by the administration for

incentives to support childrens adoption out of foster care permanence via family connections the enacted bill permits states to claim federal support for kinship guardianship assistance under title

these provisions and in doing this will interpret their meaning crs4 social security act makes other policy changes expected to promote or facilitate relative placement authorizes and provides funding for family connection grants and requires states to make reasonable efforts to place siblings together kinship guardianship assistance the enacted bill permits states to claim openended reimbursement under title ive for kinship guardianship assistance provided on behalf of eligible children who leave foster care for placement in legal guardianship with relative as amended by the adoption and safe families act of 1997 asfa pl 10589 federal statute defines legal guardianship for purposes of title ive and title ivb of the social security act as judicially created relationship between child and caretaker which is intended to be permanent and self sustaining as evidenced by the transfer to the caretaker of the following parental rights with respect to the child protection education care and control of the person custody of the person and decisionmaking3 states are entitled to claim federal reimbursement for the cost of providing kinship guardianship assistance payments on behalf of eligible children at their federal medical assistance percentage fmap which may range from low of 50 in states with higher per capita income to 83 in those with lower per capita income states opting to provide such payments may also claim reimbursement of eligible general administrative costs at 50 federal reimbursement rate and for programrelated training costs at 75 federal reimbursement although some of these eligible training costs will initially be reimbursed at lower rate see federal support for training and other changes below since the middle 1990s close to 40 states have implemented some kind of subsidized guardianship program for children leaving foster care however many of those programs were not statewide and not all have been maintained4 under child welfare waivers as many as 11 of those states have experimented with subsidized guardianship programs using federal title ive funds5 some of those earliest experiments found that providing guardianship subsidies increased exits to permanence for children in foster care and that on range of safety and wellbeing measures children placed in subsidized guardianship settings fared at least as well as did children placed in other permanent settings6 in may 2004 the pew commission on children in foster care recommended federal support of subsidized guardianship under title ive of the social security 3 section 4757 of the social security act 4 for programs implemented in place as of 2004 see childrens defense fund states subsidized guardianship laws at glance october 2004 5 congress initially granted child welfare waiver authority to hhs pl 103432 1994 that authority is currently expired although some states continued to operate assisted guardianship programs with title ive dollars under

demonstrations september 2005 crs5 act as part of broader package of child welfare financing reform measures in july 2007 citing evidence that the subsidies could help states increase the number of permanent homes available to african american and other children in foster care the government accountability office gao recommended that congress consider authorizing federal subsidies for legal guardianship7 in its report approving guardianship assistance provisions similar to those that became part of the final legislation the senate finance committee cited both the child welfare waivers and academic research to assert that children in kinship placements including relative guardianships have improved wellbeing that guardianship is good permanency option for children in foster care and that provision of state option to receive federal support for guardianship assistance under title ive is expected to reduce federal costs under title ive by reducing the need for federal reimbursement of case planning and case review activities on behalf of children moved permanently from foster care to guardianship8 changes to promote or facilitate relative placement the option to use federal title ive funds to support children in kinship guardianship is only one of number of changes included in pl 110351 that seek to strengthen childrens connections to their families and to create more opportunity for kinship placements whether guardianship or otherwise9 these include new plan requirement under title ive that states exercise due diligence to identify grandparents and other adult relatives of child within 30 days of removing the child from the custody of hisher parents and to notify those relatives of the childs removal and the relatives options for participating in the care

licensed relative foster family homes and authorization for hhs to make comparisons of names submitted by child welfare agencies to information in the federal parent locator system fpls which may aid in identifying or locating relatives11 family connection grants further the bill establishes new competitive grant program under title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act named family connection grants under this program public child welfare agencies state local or tribal and nonprofit private organizations may seek federal funding to help children whether they are in foster care or atrisk of entering foster care connect or reconnect with birth parents or other extended kin specifically the funds must be used to establish or support one or more of the following kinship navigator programs which through information referral systems and other means assist kinship caregivers in learning about finding and using programs and services to meet their own needs and those of the children they are raising intensive familyfinding efforts that use search technology to locate biological kin of children and then work to reestablish relationships and to explore permanent family placements for these children family group decisionmaking meetings that enable families to develop plans that nurture children and protect them from abuse and neglect and when appropriate must safely facilitate connecting children exposed to domestic violence to relevant services and reconnecting them with the abused parent and residential family treatment centers that enable parents and children to live together in safe environment for not less than six months and that provide onsite or by referral full range of services to meet the needs of the family including substance abuse treatment early childhood intervention family counseling mental health services medical care and other services 11 the fpls was created initially for child support enforcement purposes and only non custodial parents of the child may be identified by name match however this information may also help to locate additional relatives under prior law states could seek information from the fpls indirectly through the state child support agency rather than directly from hhs for more information see us department of health and human services hhs administration for children and families acf information memorandum

may not award grant for period of less than one year nor more than three years grantees are required to provide matching funds equal to less than 25 of the total approved grant program costs in years one and two of grant and less than 50 in year three the enacted bill appropriates 15 million for the family connection grants in each of fy2009fy2013 of which 5 million must be used annually to support kinship navigator programs reasonable efforts to place siblings together finally unless the state documents that doing so would be contrary to the safety or welfare of sibling the bill requires states under the title ive state plan to make reasonable efforts to place siblings together whether in foster care kinship guardianship assistance or adoption it further stipulates that whenever joint placement is not made the state must make reasonable efforts to provide for frequent visitation or other ongoing interaction between the siblings unless the state documents that the facilitated contact is contrary to the safety or wellbeing of any one of the siblings permanence via adoption pl 110351 also expands eligibility for federal adoption assistance to children with special needs revises and extends the adoption incentives program and requires states to provide information to prospective adoptive parents concerning the adoption tax credit phasing out income eligibility and related rules for adoption assistance the enacted bill phases out fy2010fy2018 the use of income tests as part of determining eligibility for federal adoption assistance this change will provide more federal support to special needs children who leave foster care for adoption states must continue to pay part of the cost of providing this support but are required to use any state funds that would be saved because of this expanded federal eligibility for adoption assistance on child welfare purposes12 federal adoption assistance was established in 1980 pl 96272 for children determined by their state to have special needs13 the vast majority of these children then and now are children adopted out of foster care the 1980 law also stipulated that to be eligible for federal adoption assistance child must either be eligible for supplemental security income ssi or have been removed from the home of birth parents in which he or she met the income and other eligibility criteria 12 pl 110351 does not specify how the states savings are to be determined and it is not exactly clear how this requirement will be implemented 13 for purposes of the title ive adoption assistance program to qualify as child with special needs the state must have determined that 1 the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of hisher parents 2 that there is factor or condition specific to the child such as the childs age membership in sibling group raceethnicity medical condition or physical emotional or mental disability that makes it reasonable to conclude that the child will not be adopted without adoption assistance or medicaid further unless this is not in the childs best interest eg because of significant bonding with foster parents the state must determine that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to place the child without such assistance have been made see section 473c of the social security act crs8 of the federal cash welfare program aid to families with dependent children afdc14 afdc was repealed in 1996 by the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act prwora pl 104193 however federal eligibility for title ive assistance continues to be linked to afdc eligibility rules as those rules existed on july 16 1996 prior to the programs repeal beginning in fy2010 and continuing through fy2018 pl 110351 will phase out this link for adoption assistance which the senate finance committee describes as an inappropriate eligibility factor for federal adoption assistance15 as included in the enacted bill the revised eligibility rules for federal adoption assistance also eliminate any income or resourcerelated eligibility requirements that apply to special needs children who have physical or medical disabilities that qualify them for supplemental security income ssi the revised eligibility rules will become effective in fy2010 but only for children who are age 16 or older when their adoption assistance agreement is finalized with each new fiscal year this age will be lowered by two years so that by fy2018 any child with special needs may qualify for federal adoption assistance under the revised rules in addition beginning in fy2010 any child who has been in foster care for 60 continuous months may qualify for federal adoption assistance under the revised eligibility rules regardless of age and any sibling of child who is eligible under the revised rules whether due to age or length of stay in care may also qualify under those criteria throughout this eightyear phasein period the eligibility criteria that applied prior to the passage of hr 6893 including the link to afdc eligibility will continue to apply to any child who does not qualify for eligibility determination under the revised rules at the time his or her adoption assistance agreement is finalized reauthorization of the adoption incentives program apart from the expanded support for federal adoption assistance the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 continues incentives to states for increased adoptions from foster care by revising and extending the adoption incentives program this program was created by asfa pl 10589 and was initially extended in 2003 by pl 108145 state earns bonus for each eligible adoption out of foster care that is above its baseline number of adoptions states earn an award for increases in total adoptions increases in adoption of older children age 14 in certain instances the home from which the child is removed might also be the home of another relative caretaker regarding the creation and evolution of the link between eligibility for federal cash welfare assistance see title ive foster care and adoption assistance in srept 110467 p 2 accompanying s 3038 15 many observers and stakeholders also believe this link is inappropriate for determining eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments under title ive however consensus on how to change this policy has not been reached pl 110351 leaves the link between federal foster care eligibility and the rules of the now repealed afdc program in place and by making eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments pre condition of eligibility for federal kinship guardianship assistance it indirectly establishes this link with regard to the new kinship guardianship assistance program for more information on the link see crs report rl34388 child welfare issues in the 110th congress especially the section delink foster care and adoption assistance from afdc rules and appendix by emilie stoltzfus crs9 9 and above and they may also receive an award for increases in the number of adoptions of children with special needs who are under the age of 9 for adoptions finalized in fy2007 most recent year for which awards were made 21states earned total of 111 million in bonus funds16 states are permitted to spend this award money to provide any service to children or families including postadoption services that is authorized by the major federal child welfare programs under title ivb or title ive of the social security act pl 110351 continues through fy2013 the current annual funding authorization of 43 million for the adoption incentive program it doubles the incentive amounts states may earn for each increase in the number of older children adopted from foster care from 4000 to 8000 and for children with special needs under age 9 who are adopted from foster care from 2000 to 4000 the incentive award for any increase in the total number of children adopted from foster care was not changed and remains at 4000 the enacted bill also makes other changes to the incentive structure of the program which are intended to ensure that states even those with declining overall foster care caseloads continue to have fiscal incentive to increase adoptions these changes include fixing each states baseline adoption numbers at the numbers achieved in fy2007 and allowing provided sufficient appropriations new incentive payment for states that increase the rate of children adopted from foster care17 to earn an award for an increased rate of adoptions the state must increase the share of children adopted out of its foster care caseload that is its foster child adoption rate above the highest such rate it previously achieved in any year beginning with fy2002 and ending with the year just prior to the award year the amount of the award is 1000 times the increased number of adoptions achieved by the state that are attributed to the increased adoption rate18 the increased incentive payment amounts and the incentives for states increasing the rate at which children are adopted out of their foster care caseload will be used to calculate awards earned by states for adoptions finalized in fy2008 those awards are expected to be announced in september 2009 finally pl 110351 also ensures that states have full 24 months to spend any adoption incentive funding awarded 16 these fy2007 award amounts were determined in the last quarter of fy2008 however available appropriated funds for adoption incentives just over 9 million were not sufficient to provide the full fy2007 award amounts at that time hhs indicated its intent to pay part of the fy2007 awards roughly 84 at the end of fy2008 and the remainder roughly 16 at the beginning of fy2009 see adoption incentive award history table at httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramscbprograms_fundadopt_incentive_historyhtm 17 in its fy2009 budget the bush administration proposed fixing the adoption incentive baseline year as fy2007 and increasing award amounts for older and special needs adoptions the enacted bill hr 6893 adopted these proposals although it increased the award amounts differently added others eg incentive for increase in rate but did not adopt another administration proposal to limit state use of any earned incentive award funds for finalizing adoption or other permanency options for more information see crs report rl34388 adoption incentives in child welfare issues in the 110th congress by emilie stoltzfus 18 for description of how to calculate this award see the footnote on this question that is included under section 401 adoption incentives program near the end of the report crs10 information on adoption tax credit as part of supporting the goal of increasing permanence for foster children through adoption pl 110351 requires states under title ive to provide notice to any individual who is adopting child out of foster care or who the state learns is considering such an adoption of the individuals potential eligibility for the federal adoption tax credit the credit is adjusted annually for inflation and for tax year 2008 equals 11650 for individuals who adopt children with special needs19 support for older foster youth and transition to independent living the fostering connections to success and improving adoptions act of 2008 pl 110351 also seeks to strengthen support for children whose permanency outcome is independent living these are youth who emancipate from foster care that is they are released from state foster care custody because they have reached the state age of majority typically age 18 rather than because they have been placed with permanent family at least since the middle 1980s pl 99272 congress has sought to better aid the transition of these youth from foster care to independent living with the chafee foster care independence act of 1999 pl 106169 congress significantly expanded support for services to youth both before and after they ageout and in 2001 pl 107133 it authorized funds for education and training vouchers for these youth even so the number of children leaving foster care via emancipation continues to grow reaching close to 27000 youth in fy2006 and in general their school work and other important life outcomes continue to be poor20 option to extend support for youth remaining in care to age 21 pl 110351 takes new tack in responding to this longstanding concern by permitting states as of fy2011 to provide continued federal foster care maintenance payments on behalf of eligible children even after they have reached their 18th birthday under current law federal title ive assistance ends with childs 18th birthday or possibly the 19th if the child is still completing high school specifically the enacted bill permits states to continue to seek openended federal reimbursement for part of the cost of providing maintenance payments to eligible children who remain in foster care after their 18th birthday provided those children have not yet reached their 21st birthday and are either enrolled in school employed at least 80 hours month or participating in an activity designed to promote or remove barriers to employment states may exempt youth from these requirements so long as the youth has medical condition making him or her incapable of participating in the activity and this incapacity is supported by regularly updated information in his or her case plan pl 110351 also permits continued support to youth in foster care age 18 or older who are living independently in supervised 19 for more information on the adoption tax credit see crs report rl33633 tax benefits for families adoption by christine scott 20 for more legislative history on this issue see srept 110467 p 4 accompanying s 3038 and for comprehensive look at the issue of youth aging out of foster care see crs report rl34499 youth transitioning from foster care background federal programs and issues for congress by adrienne fernandes crs11 setting and it stipulates that hhs must define in regulation what qualifies as such setting21 new transition planning requirement separately the bill requires each state as part of its mandatory case review system to have procedure that ensures every child leaving foster care has transition plan created on his or her behalf the transition plan must be created with the youth by caseworker and as appropriate other representatives of the child earlier than 90 days before the childs 18th birthday or at whatever later age chosen by the state to end foster care assistance it must address specific options for the youth with regard to housing health insurance education local opportunities for mentors and continuing support services as well as workforce supports and employment services option to extend support for youth leaving care for permanent home after reaching age 16 with limited exceptions monthly federal title ive assistance has not generally been available for child who has reached his or her 18th birthday and who left foster care for permanent family via adoption or kinship guardianship however pl 110351 permits states as of fy2011 to choose to continue federally supported subsidies on behalf of eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday for adoption or kinship guardianship so long as those youth have not yet reached their 21st birthday and are enrolled in school employed at least 80 hours month or participating in an activity designed to promote or remove barriers to employment states may exempt child from these school work or other engagement requirements if the child has medical condition that makes him or her incapable of participating in the activity and this incapacity is supported by regularly updated information in the childs case plan in addition state is allowed to continue federal adoption assistance or kinship guardianship assistance up to the 21st birthday on behalf of any child regardless of the age at which the child left foster care if the state determines that the child has mental or physical handicap that warrants the continuation of assistance this was and remains true with regard to adoption assistance pl 110351 will also extend it as of fy2011 to kinship guardianship assistance services for youth leaving foster care after reaching age 16 finally the enacted bill expands the purposes of the chafee foster care independence program to provide that any of the activities or services provided in support of independent living for youth who are expected to age out of foster care without permanent family may also be provided to youth who leave foster care at age 16 or older to either adoption or guardianship the bill also extends eligibility for education and training vouchers which are valued at 5000 annually and may be used for the cost of attending college or an equivalent training program to youth who leave foster care for guardianship after their 16th birthday children who leave foster care for adoption after their 16th birthday continue to be eligible for these vouchers as was true under prior law 21 for additional information regarding living arrangements for older youth see crs report rl34499 youth transitioning from foster care background federal programs and issues for congress by adrienne fernandes crs12 wellbeing of children in foster care the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 pl 110351 makes new requirements of states that focus on ensuring and enabling stable enrollment in school for children in foster care and on their access to needed and appropriate health care including mental health services and dental care for more then decade the primary goals of federal child welfare policy have commonly been expressed as achieving safety permanency and wellbeing for children however the health and educationrelated requirements included in pl 110351 are among the first federal statutory requirements of child welfare agencies that focus specifically on the wellbeing of children in foster care as distinct from their need for safety and permanence22 education stability and enrollment specifically pl 110351 requires state child welfare agencies as part of the title ive case plan requirements that apply to each child in foster care to work with relevant state and local education authorities to ensure that child remains in the same school in which he or she is enrolled at the time of foster care placement or if this is not in the best interests of the child to ensure immediate and appropriate enrollment for the child in new school to help support this requirement the enacted bill permits states to claim federal funding for the cost of transporting children to their school of origin at the same reimbursement rate that is provided for foster care maintenance payments that rate ranges from 5083 with states with higher per capita incomes receiving lower federal reimbursement rate and vice versa23 separately under the title ive plan pl 110351 requires states to assure that children who have reached the minimum age for mandatory school attendance in their state and who are 22 the assertion of safety permanency and wellbeing as primary federal child welfare policy goals was first introduced by the clinton administration as part of implementing new funding for family preservation and family support services authorized in 1993 by pl 103 66 before 2006 then the sole statutory use of the term wellbeing in title ivb and title ive and as distinct from safety permanence or child welfare was reference added by that 1993 law as part of the definition of family support although it is commonly cited as establishing safety permanency and wellbeing as the primary federal child welfare goals the adoption and safe families act pl 10589 1997 focused on safety and permanence and did not add the term wellbeing to the statute the 109th congress however added wellbeing to title ivb and title ive in several places notably pl 109288 2006 restated the purposes of title ivb subpart 1 to include promoting the safety permanence and wellbeing of children in foster care and adoptive families for early discussion of wellbeing of children and families as primary federal child welfare policy goal see us department of health and human services administration for children and families acyfpi9401 january 18 1994 federal register october 4 1994 p 5064650673 and federal register november 18 1996 p 58657 23 this means states are now statutorily entitled to in most cases higher federal reimbursement rate for these transportation costs than was permitted by federal guidance issued on this topic in december 2007 that guidance clarified that states could claim reimbursement of 50 for these transportation costs see us department of health and human services administration for children and families childrens bureau child welfare policy manual section 81b question 27 crs13 receiving federal foster care maintenance payments adoption assistance or kinship guardianship assistance are enrolled in school or have completed high school health care oversight further under title ivb subpart 1 the new law requires each state to develop coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care including mental health services and dental care for all children in foster care this coordinated strategy and oversight plan must be collaborative effort between the state child welfare agency and the state agency that administers medicaid in consultation with pediatric and other health care experts as well as experts in or recipients of child welfare services among other things the strategy and plan must outline schedule for initial and followup health screens how the health needs identified by those screens will be monitored and treated how medical information for children in care will be updated and appropriately shared steps to ensure continuity of health care services and oversight of prescription medicines these new health and educationrelated requirements are unique in federal child welfare policy because they look beyond the safety and permanence needs of children in foster care and focus instead on measures of wellbeing that are considered relevant to any child in the nation24 safety and permanence are also critical to the wellbeing of all children however by definition they are issues of immediate and special concern for children in foster care accordingly federal child welfare policy has long focused on ways to better achieve and ensure them notably the adoption assistance and child welfare act of 1980 pl 96272 recognized the critical need for permanence by providing new incentives for case planning for each child in foster care and by authorizing federal support for adoption assistance to children leaving foster care further more than decade ago asfa pl 10589 asserted the primacy of safety in all child welfare decisions and reinvigorated attention to permanence for children in foster care by establishing new case planning and case review timetables and requirements and by establishing the adoption incentives program direct federal support to tribal programs the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 pl 110351 seeks to improve the child welfare services and supports available to indian children by granting tribes as of fy2010 the same authority that states have to seek federal reimbursement of part of all their eligible foster care adoption and kinship guardianship assistance costs indian children may currently be eligible for title ive assistance if they are in the care and placement responsibility of state however children under the care and placement responsibility of tribe may not 24 for many years states have been required to collect to the extent available and accessible the health and education record of each child in foster care as part of each childs case plan and to take into account the proximity of the school in which child was enrolled when placing child in foster care the 109th congress enacted two changes that moved congress in the direction of the 2008 requirements 1 it removed the modifying phrase to the extent available and accessible leaving simply the requirement that states collect the health and education records of children in foster care pl 109239 and 2 it added new requirement that states must consult with physicians on appropriate care for children in foster care pl 109288 crs14 receive this assistance unless the tribes responsibility of the child is supervised by the state via statetribal cooperative agreement explaining their approval of direct tribal access to federal title ive support which has been goal of tribal child welfare advocates for many years and has been proposed in every congress since at least the 105th 1997 the senate finance committee stated that tribes tribal consortia and tribal organizations may provide higher quality and more culturally appropriate care for indian children25 to receive title ive funds tribe tribal organization or tribal consortium26 must submit plan for approval to hhs and with specific and limited exceptions must meet all the requirements for receipt of this funding in the same manner as they are required of states the bill also permits tribes as of fy2010 to apply to hhs and receive direct federal allotment of chafee foster care independence andor education and training voucher funds in addition it stipulates that current cooperative agreements agreements between tribe and state which permit tribe to receive federal title ive funds via the state must continue unchanged unless either party with the right to revoke or change the agreement elects to do so pl 110351 provides for calculation of tribespecific federal matching rate for foster care maintenance payments adoption assistance payments and kinship guardianship assistance payments tribal fmap tribes with an approved title ive plan are to receive this reimbursement rate directly from the federal government if tribe has cooperative agreement or contract with state to administer title ive payments that state is to receive reimbursement at the tribal fmap for the portion of its title ive foster care maintenance adoption assistance or kinship guardianship assistance payments that are made under the statetribal agreement or contract further as of fy2010 pl 110351 requires state to negotiate in good faith with any eligible tribal entity in the state if that tribal entity requests to enter into an agreement with the state under which the state would provide title ive funds to the tribe for it to administer all or part of the program on behalf of children under tribal authority state will similarly be required to negotiate in good faith with any tribal entity in the state that is not receiving direct federal allotment of chafee foster care independence program andor education and training voucher funds and which requests an agreement or contract that would allow it to receive funds from the state to administer the programs on behalf of indian children under its authority finally to help ensure these new provisions result in improved outcomes for indian children the bill appropriates 3 million for fy2009 and every succeeding year for technical assistance to tribes and states and for implementation grants to tribes that are preparing to submit title ive plan for approval to hhs these 25 srept 110467 accompanying s 3038 p 5 26 the definitions of indian tribe and tribal organization included in pl 110351 are the same as those included in section 4 of the indian self determination and education assistance act and generally extend the authority to apply for these funds to all federally recognized tribes as well as the recognized governing body of those tribes in addition tribal consortium including two or more tribes or tribal organizations acting together may apply for direct federal funding under title ive crs15 implementation grants may be worth as much as 300000 tribal entity may receive this grant only once and it must agree to submit title ive plan to hhs for approval later than 24 months after receiving the grant funding if the plan is not submitted within 24 months the tribe must repay the entire grant amount however hhs must waive this repayment requirement if the tribes failure to submit it within 24 months was result of circumstances beyond the control of the tribe federal support for training and other changes over five years pl 110351 phases in an increased federal reimbursement rate for states that offer shortterm training to workers at private licensed child welfare agencies provided this training is related to the title ive foster care adoption and kinship guardianship program the enacted bill also permit states to claim title ive training reimbursement for certain shortterm training of current and prospective relative guardians and for court and related personnel including attorneys who handle child abuse and neglect cases the bill sets the federal matching rate for costs of providing shortterm training to private agency workers current and prospective relative guardians and for certain court or courtrelated personnel handling abuse and neglect cases at 55 in fy2009 rising 5 annually until it reaches 75 in fy2013 title ive training costs that were reimbursed at 75 before passage of hr 6893 will continue to be reimbursed at that same level throughout this phasein period pl 110351 makes several changes that are unrelated to child welfare policy these include clarifying the uniform definition of child that is used for variety of federal tax code purposes it also amends the law to permit the treasury department to invest excess operating cash for 90 days in repurchase agreements these non child welfarerelated provisions together with savings projected from the implementation of kinship guardianship assistance and the school enrollment requirement are estimated by the congressional budget office cbo to fully offset the cost of the bill to the federal treasury over the next five and 10 years finally the bill prohibits any interpretation of its provisions that would alter any current prohibitions on federal payments to individuals who are unlawfully present in the united states effective date unless otherwise stipulated the provisions of the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 became effective on its date of enactment october 7 2008 however state may have limited additional time to comply with any of the new requirements of the bill if hhs determines that the state must enact legislation other than legislation to appropriate funds in order to meet that requirements as discussed above the bill stipulates delayed andor phased in effective dates for its provisions related to removing income eligibility criteria from the federal adoption assistance program ie delink extending title ive assistance to eligible youth beyond age 18 providing direct access to tribal entities for federal title ive funding and providing new or increased federal reimbursement for certain shortterm training costs crs16 congressional budget office estimates27 although hr 6893 as enacted authorizes significant expansions in federal support for state and tribal child welfare programs cbo projects combined change in federal spending and revenues from the overall bill that is roughly budget neutral over ten years fy2009fy2018 specifically cbo projects that the bill will reduce the federal budget deficit by 15 million over those ten years28 this positive effect ie reduction in federal budget deficit is projected to be much larger in the first five years of the bills enactment 449 million in part because number of the bills provisions that are expected to increase federal spending are made effective year or two after enactment and because the full effect of other provisions is phased in over five or more years29 projected savings and increased revenue as interpreted by cbo four major provisions of the bill are projected to produce significant savings andor increase revenues to the federal treasury over five fy2009fy2013 and 10 fy2009fy2018 years these are as follows authorization of federal title ive support for kinship guardianship assistance projected to save 60 million over

total of 1402 billion in savings plus total of 307 million in increased revenue over 10 years projected increases in federal spending as interpreted by cbo seven major provisions of the bill are projected to have costs to the federal treasury over the next five fy2009fy2013 and 10 fy2009fy20018 years delayed or phased 27 projections in this section are from congressional budget office cbo preliminary estimates of foster careadoption assistance draft september 15 2008 28 in the event of federal surplus the bill projects an increase in that surplus of 15 million 29 over the first five years fy2009fy2013 cbo projects that the bill will reduce federal spending by 326 million plus increase revenues by 123 million for reduction in the budget deficit of 449 million or an increase in any budget surplus by that amount 30 cbo included any expected effect of the policy permitting states to extend federal eligibility for kinship guardianship assistance to age 21 for otherwise eligible children leaving foster care for kinship guardianship at age 16 or older in this estimate crs17 in implementation of number of these provisions helps to reduce their projected cost during these time periods these provisions are as follows annual appropriation of 15 million for family connection grants projected to increase federal spending by 59 million over five years and by total of 75 million over 10 years option for states to provide federal title ive assistance up to age 21 for otherwise eligible children remaining in foster care after their 18th birthday and for those who left foster

of 2008 hr 6893 was introduced by representative jim mcdermott with representative jerry weller on september 15 2008 and passed the house under suspension of the rules and by voice vote on september 17 2008 the bill then went to the senate where it was passed by unanimous consent on september 22 2008 enacted on october 7 2008 as pl 110351 the final legislation represented compromise between bills that were earlier acted on by the house and by the senate finance committee these bills are the improved adoption incentives and relative guardianship support act of 2008 s 3038 and the fostering connections to success act hr 6307 s 3038 was introduced by senator grassley in may 2008 and the senate finance committee approved the chairmans mark version of that crs18 bill on september 10 2008 srept 11046731 hr 6307 was introduced by representative mcdermott with representative weller in june 2008 and it passed the house on june 24 200832 both representative mcdermott and representative weller described the final bill hr 6893 as the product of bipartisan and bicameral legislative work and they cited the importance of senator max baucus and senator grassley in this effort33 congressional activities during the first session of the 110th congress the income security and family support subcommittee of the house ways and means committee held number of hearings to review challenges facing the child welfare system overall and in particular challenges faced by older youth leaving foster care without permanent family following these hearings in february 2008 representative mcdermott who chairs that subcommittee introduced the invest in kids act hr 5466 to address number of these challenges34 some of the provisions incorporated in hr 5466 as well as provisions subsequently included in s 3038 hr 6307 and ultimately those that were included in hr 6893 were inspired by or introduced in other bills during this and earlier congresses from the 110th congress these bills include the kinship caregiver support act s 661 introduced by senator hillary clinton with senator olympia snowe hr 2188 introduced by representative danny davis the adoption equality act s 1462 introduced by senator jay rockefeller hr 4091 introduced by representative jim cooper the tribal foster care and adoption access act s 1956 introduced by senator max baucus hr 4688 introduced by representative earl pomeroy the foster care continuing opportunities act s 1512 introduced 31 as introduced in may 2008 s 3038 included provisions primarily related to reauthorizing the adoption incentives program delinking federal adoption assistance from income and related eligibility criteria and supporting guardianship assistance under title ive the bill approved by the senate finance committee on september 10 2008 was the chairmans mark version of s 3038 brought by senator max baucus which was offered as complete substitute to the original bill the chairmans mark largely maintained the provisions included in the introduced bill while adding provisions related to direct tribal access to title ive funding continued title ive eligibility for youth after age 18 transition planning for youth leaving foster care licensing demonstration project and others see srept 110467 32 hr 6307 was based in large part on the provision of title iv of an earlier bill introduced by representative mcdermott in february 2008 the invest in kids act hr 5466 the subcommittee on income security and family support of the house ways and means committee chaired by representative mcdermott held hearing in late february 2008 at which it received testimony on the provisions of hr 5466 in his prepared opening remarks representative weller noted certain areas of agreement and disagreement with hr 5466 and asserted that we should work together to identify provisions that have bipartisan support so we can get something done this year 33 congressional record september 17 2008

included in the final enrolled bill hr 6893 the us department of health and human services hhs strongly supported revising and extending the adoption incentive program but disagreed with 1 the specific ways in which states will now be permitted to seek openended federal reimbursement for part of the cost of providing guardianship subsidies to eligible children leaving foster care 2 the creation of family connection grants and 3 the approach taken in providing access to federal title ive support for tribes36 in letters sent to congress regarding hr 6307 and the chairmans mark of s 3038 hhs however did not provide any specific comments related to the expansion of federal eligibility for title ive adoption assistance the option for states to continue providing federal title ive foster care assistance to eligible youth after their 18th birthday nor regarding the provisions related to increased federal reimbursement for certain child welfare training costs with regard to the state option to provide guardianship assistance under title ive hhs wrote moving children to permanent homes as expeditiously as possible is an important goal however we oppose creating new entitlement under the title ive program for subsidized relative guardians37 hhs noted that under the child welfare program option it has proposed states would have the flexibility to support guardianship agreements if they choose38 hhs also noted its support for 35 see statement of representative mcdermott congressional record september 17 2008 p h8317 and senate finance committee news

2008 both letters were provided to the congressional research services crs by the us department of health and human services hhs 37 ibid identical language in both letters 38 beginning with its fy2003 budget the bush administration has annually proposed the child welfare program option however legislative language has been publicly offered to implement the proposal according to budget documents under this option states could elect to receive title ive foster care funds as lump sum capped and further to use those funds for the full range of child welfare purposes and in support of any child for more continued crs20 direct federal support to tribes for child welfare programs but again it preferred the approach that would be provided to tribes under the child welfare program option the bush administrations proposed program option would permit federally recognized tribes to receive child welfare funds from fixed sum that would be set aside for that purpose the department wrote that it had serious concerns that the bills would weaken child protection requirements placed on tribes in comparison to those placed on states39 finally in the letter regarding hr 6307 hhs pointed out that the activities allowed under the family connection grants could already be funded under existing title ivb programs child welfare services and promoting safe and stable families and also that the department does not support any new authorization of activities outside the presidents budget40 bill advocates and support the act responds to variety of issues that have been raised for many years and some for more than decade by public child welfare administrators child welfare youth adoption and tribal advocates and children and youth who have been or still are in foster care andor by public child welfare administrators enactment of the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 was urged by many groups including coalition of 581 national state and local entities representing organizations in all 50 states that advocate on behalf of children and youth as well as by the national conference of state legislators ncsl and the conference of chief justices and conference of state court administrators41 38 continued information see crs report rl34388 child welfare issues in the 110th congress appendix by emilie stoltzfus 39 language quoted is identical in both letters see cite above however the letter regarding hr 6307 provides examples of specific provisions hhs believes would weaken provisions for indian children alternative background checks for tribes and broad permission for hhs to waive title ive requirements if requested by the tribe those specific provisions were not included in the chairmans mark of s 3038 and subsequently were not included in hr 6893 as enacted 40 family connection grants were not authorized in the chairmans mark of s 3038 and are not discussed in this letter 41 see letters of support inserted in the

of adoptions achieved by the state that are attributed to the increased adoption rate43 43 to calculate the number of adoptions that are attributed to an increase in the adoption rate you must know the states foster child adoption rate in the award year the number of children in the states foster care caseload on the last day of the fiscal year just prior to the award year and the states highest ever foster child adoption rate states foster child adoption rate must be determined by dividing the number of foster child adoptions finalized in the state in given fiscal year by the number of children in that states foster care caseload on the last day of the previous year for example if state finalizes 150 adoption during fy2008 and on the last day of the previous fiscal year september 30 2007 it had 1500 children in foster care then the states foster child adoption rate for fy2008 is equal to 10 that state earns an award for adoptions in fy2008 if this foster child adoption rate 10 is above its highest ever foster child adoption rate meaning the best foster child adoption rate the state has ever previously achieved beginning with fy2002 for example if the highest ever foster child adoption rate the state in the example above had achieved before fy2008 was 9 then for fy2008 the states adoption incentive award amount based on the rate increase would be calculated as follows multiplying that highest ever rate 9 by the 1500 children in care on the last day of the fiscal year prior to the award year september 30 2007 subtracting this number 135 from the actual foster child adoptions achieved by the state in fy2008 150 and multiplying the difference 15 by 1000 for the award amount 15000 the states highest ever foster child adoption rate for fy2009 would be increased to
