onmental protection agency epa is the lead agency for the erulemaking initiative erulemaking has been described as way to increase democratic legitimacy improve regulatory policy decisions decrease administrative costs and increase regulatory compliance however the implementation of erulemaking in the federal government has been controversial lthough the migration of agencies into the governmentwide docket was originally planned for 2004 that migration is currently not expected to be completed until 2008 congress has objected to how erulemaking and several other egovern ment projects have been funded through appropriations transfers or reimburse ments to the projects managing partner agencies and has voiced other concerns about the overall management and appr opriateness of the initiatives questions have also been raised regarding the erulemaking initiatives centralized structure its costs more than 53 million spent through fy2008 and expected financial benefits the functionality of some of the applications being used and its effect on public participation in the rulemaking process the reasons why the federal erulemaking initiative has had such difficult first five years are many but one appears to be the lack of direct consistent funding from fy2003 through fy2007 congress appr opriated less than 20 million to the egovernment fund for all egovernme nt projects much less than the 345 million authorized in the egovernment act for that period congress has also required approval by the appropriations committees before any transfers or reimbursements of ppropriations are made althoug h some have suggested that better communication is needed between congress and the executive branch the recent conflicts may reflect basic differences of opinion between the two branches regarding control of federal operations and how the branches should interact long term issue is whether erulemaking should continue to be housed in epa this report will be updated as

particular erulemaking initiatives federal regulation like taxing and spe nding is one of the basic tools of government used to implement public policy regulations generally start with an act of congress and are the means by which statutes are implemented and specific requirements are established the deve lopment and framing of rule has been described as the climactic act of the policy making process4 another observer described the rulemaking process as ab solutely central to the definition and implementation of public policy in the united states and said that significant attempt to alter the direc tion of public program can succeed without effective management of the ru lemaking process5 federal agencies issue more than 4000 final rules each year on topics ranging from the timing of bridge openings to the permissible levels of ar senic and other contaminan ts in drinking water the public can play role in the rules that affect them through notice and comment provisions in the administr ative procedure act apa of 1946 as amended 5 usc 551 et seq the apa generally requires agencies to 1 publish notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register 2 allow interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulema king process by provi ding written data views or arguments and 3 publish th final rule 30 days before it becomes effective6 however in order to be involved in rulemaking most effectively the public must be able to 1 know that pr oposed rules are open for public comment and 2 prepare and submit comments to rele vant decisionmakers and 3 should be allowed to access regulatory supporting materials eg agencies legal and economic analyses and the comments of others so that their comments can be more informed and useful to decisionmakers it has the potential to enhance the publics ability to perform all three of these tasks as one author sai d information technology coul d make it easier for agencies to give notice to interested people and allow those people to access and search the proposed rule could allow for more in teractive and collabor ative communications from individuals during the rulemaking pro cess and could make it easier for

does not automatically guarantee success early federal erulemaking initiatives erulemaking in the federal government began with both governmentwide and agencyspecific initiatives in the 1990s in 1994 the office of the federal register made the federal register and the code of federal regulations available online also individual federal agencies began experimenting with electronic rulemaking in the mid1990s with some allowing the public to comment on their rules electronically9 in 1998 the department of tran sportation dot took major step forward and established the first electr onic rulemaking

andambitious erulemaking system at the time other agencies also began implementing their own electronic systems in june 2000 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office reported on efforts to allow the public to participate electronically in the rulemaking process in five federal agencies dot the departments of agriculture usda hea lth and human services hhs and labor dol and the environmental protection agency epa 11 all five of the agencies had websites that conveyed ru lemaking information to th public andor maintained some rulemaking records in electronic

gao reported that fede ral and state agencies were also making extensive use of it to address other aspects of regulatory management12 for example dol had system of electronic advisors imitating the interaction that an individual might have with an employme nt law expert and epa was working with partners in state government to deve lop national envir onmental information exchange network several of the state innovations included interactive systems that allowed regulated tities to identify their regulato ry responsibilities and complete related transactions representatives from nong overnmental organizations suggested that federal agencies improve both the content and access to online information more broadly nd consistently use some existing applications and adopt some new applications factors that re portedly facilita ted or hindered the adoption and diffusion of such applications were 1 toplevel leadership commitment and support 2 adequate financ ial resources and staffing 3 legislative and executive branch it initiatives 4 internal and external partnerships with critical stakeholders 5 reengineering of existing business proce sses and 6 developm ent of an effective communication infrastructure congressional initiatives congress was an early advocate of the use of it in administrative processes for example in 1998 congress enacted the government paperw ork elimination act gpea 44 usc 3504 note which re quired that by october 21 2003 federal agencies provide the public when prac ticable with the option of submitting maintaining and disclosing information electronically instead of on paper gpea made the office of manageme nt and budget omb responsible for ensuring that federal agencies met the acts implementation deadline although gpea did not specifically mention rulemaking both omb and rulemaking agencies told gao that the acts requirements provided an impetus for developing itbased approaches to rulemaking and more generally to regulatory management13 congress has also prompted the use of it in rulemaking specifically for example section 206c of the egove rnment act of 2002 requires agencies to accept rulemaking comments under section 553 c of the apa electronically to the extent practicable secti on 206d of the act requires ag encies in consultation with the omb director and to the extent practicable to 1 ensure that

section of the act also established an egove rnment fund that was to be administered by the administrator of the general services administration to support projects approved by the director assisted by the administrator of the office of electronic government that able the federal government to expand its ability through the development and implementation of innovative uses of the internet or other electronic methods to conduct activities electronically the act stipulated that transfers of f unds from the egovernment fund to federal agencies may be made until 15 days after proposed

of the clinton admin istration in september 1993 the president announced the results of the national performance review15 and one of the reviews specific recommendations was that agencies should use information technology and other techniques to increase opportunities for early frequent and interactive public participation during the ru lemaking process and to increase program evaluation

initiated fairly quickly but the second modul has been plagued with implementation problems module 1 regulationsgov in january 2003 the administration unched the regula tionsgov website there the public could review all proposed rules that were open for public comment by agency and could identify such open rules even if they did not know which agency had issued the rule21 an omb press release issued at the start of regulationsgov said that th website would make the fe deral rulemaking process more accessible and enable citizens and small businesses to quickly access and comment on hundreds of open proposed rule s from all federal agencies this consolidation is estimated to save 94 million by creating single system for the entire federal government22 the website was expected to be able to handle 12000 comments per hour23 and one of the administrations initial goals for this initiative was to receive 200000 comments via regula tionsgov although the time frame for receipt of these comments was not specific24 in september 2003 gao issued report examining the early implementation of regulationsgov25 gao reported that the new website was generally more effective than the systems that the individual agencies used both to identify rules that were open for comment and to allow the public to comment on the rules electronically however gao reported that only two of the 411 proposed rules that were issued in the first three full months of implementation mentioned regulationsgov as commenting option pe rhaps explaining why so few comments were being submitted through the

so significantly at the end of this period and did not put the total number of comments submitted via regulationsgov in context with the total number of comments that had been submitted through other

approach based on the consultants conclusion that it would be more cost effective more stable and provide greater scope and functionality37 daniels memorandum on may 3 2002 omb director mitchell daniels jr sent memorandum to the heads of all executive departments and agencies informing them of our inten tion to consolidate redundant it systems relating to the presidents online rulemaki ng initiative because they make it difficult to find and comment on proposed rules create performance gaps and lead to duplicative spending38 the director said omb had already identified several potentially redundant systems re lated to rulemaking including systems at dot epa and the food and drug administration fda the memorandum went on to say that omb would review the business cases fo r the redundant systems and based on the results single frontend web appli cation for receiving public comments on proposed agency rules will be leveraged nd used by federal rulemaking agencies following the completion of this phase which was then scheduled for the end of 2002 omb said it would move to the velopment of consolidated backend docketing system by the end of

consulting submitted its cross agency edocket assessment to dot excella concluded that epas newly developed edoc kets system was the best suited overall to serve as the basis for governmentwide

mark forman who served as omb administr ator for egovernment from june 2001 through august 2003 in march 2007 mr forman was quoted as saying that dot officials at the time were not willing to surrender their own agency approach or accept the advantages of using single docket system for erulemaking and instead preferred the distributed design with links to agency websites41 because epa officials agreed to the centralized approach mr forman said the leadership of the initiative was given to epa centralized docket in september 2003 epa awarded an indefinite delivery indefinitequantity contract to team led by lockheed martin corporation to integrate federal online rulemaking systems with the regulationsgov portal42 the contract was reportedly for one year with four oneyear options and was estimated to be worth up to 98 million43 as discussed more fully later in this report epa and omb considered three ge neral options for how the government wide docketing system should be structured 1 single centralized system 2 distributed system in which agencies with their own electronic dockets would be linked to main system used by agencies without such dockets and 3 tiered system

initiative on departments and agencies many aspects of this initiative are fundamentally flawed contradict underlying program statutory requirements and have stifled innovation by forcing conformity to an arbitrary government standard most importantly the implementation of this initiative has forced departments and agencies and ffices and bureaus within each to transfer funds without the consent of the committee and has used funds for activities for which funding was not specifically appropriated78 the bush administration initially opposed this and other provisions in the appropriations bill requiring congressional committee approval before action by agencies saying they should be deleted or changed to require only notification of congress79 omb took the position that transfer s of agency funds for erulemaking and other egovernment projects were legal under the economy act 31 usc 1535 because agencies were pa ying for services rendered80 the economy act states that the head of an agency or unit may place an order with unit within the same agency or another agency for goods or serv ices if 1 amounts ar available 2 the head of the ordering agency or unit decides the order is in the best interest of the united states government 3 the agency or unit to fill the order is able to provide or get by contract the ordered goods or services and 4 the head of the agency decides

what government agencies can do more cheaply for each other and that federal agencies should turn to other agencies who ar especially equipped to do the work101 orders were permitted only to agencies

available at httpcerilawcornelle dudocumentserulecommitteedescriptionpdfare available for comment in one place they said they understood that some agencies may feel as if they had not received sufficient value for their contributions to date particularly those agencies that had not migrated into fdms and were not receiving many comments via regulationsgov however they pointed out that for the past two years agencies have been required to vote on approval of the initiatives budgets and business cases wh ich include th amounts of each agencys contributions and that more than 80 of the agencies have approved those documents thereby indicating that the agencies believe they are receiving good value for their egove rnment contributions106 other explanations for these votes are possible for example an official familiar with the practice indicated that agencies are likely to find it difficult to oppose th administrations position in these votes and said that doing so could adversely affect the agencies ability to meet objectives established for them under the pr esidents management agenda effect of funding difficulties on implementation the implementation of the erulemaking initiative has been affected by many factors including difficulties in meeting the needs of diverse agencies and resistence to change from agencies accustomed to established mode s of operation the description of the american bar association group that is ex amining the initiative said the following the stopandstart nature of funding has caused delays in i making technical improvements crucial to the sites functionality ii adding agencies and documents to the system and iii veloping software tools and other enhancements that would make the regulationsgov interface more userfriendly and allow agencies to explore webbased methods for increasing the nature and quality of participation in rulemaking107 structure of the go vernmentwide docket as noted earlier in this report erulemaking in the federal government began primarily as very decentralized effort with individual departments and agencies developing strategies to meet their partic ular needs the egovernment act requires agencies to ensure the development of one or more electronic rulemaking dockets but does not require either centralized or decentralized docket system the bush administrations erulemaking initiative particularly its docket management system is highly centralized with single system to replace agencyspecific systems as mentioned previously from 2002 through 2004 omb epa and agency officials reportedly considered three gove rnmentwide docket structure options 1 centralized design in which all standa rd hardware and software components are centrally located and all existing agency systems are retired when agencies are placed on the system 2 tiered design that uses centralized system but with hardware and software also in stalled at different agency sites and 3

three other contractor assessments which gao said generally f ound that the centralized design was most cost effective had the lowest risk fo r deployment and support instability was the most secure and was most likely to deliver the breadth and functionality sought by agencies and the public108 the decision to construct single centralized rulemaking docket remains controversial among some agencies and othe r observers and has affected each of the other implementation issues di scussed in this report ie funding costs and benefits and functionality the most obvious effect is that agencies that took the initiative in the 1990s and developed their own elect ronic docket systems will have to shut those systems down which appears to be the source of at least some agency resistence relatedly some agency officials have reportedly said that the centralized docket has made it difficult for them to adapt their own rulemaking cultures to the new system109 also participants at confer ence on erulemaking held at george washington university in june 2004 said that the construction of single system that is all things to all people would pr oduce lowest common denominator system that rulemaking agencies and stake holders alike would reject or ignore110 while the centralized approach has certain inherent advantages it also has certain inherent costs as one author put it the centra lizing tendency reflected in the federal docket management system and regu lationsgov has benefits in the form of economies of scale and making it easier for citizens to track and comment on any pending regulations but it also reduces the chances that agencies will experiment with rulemaking initiatives on their own111 the decision to develop single centralized rulemaking docket and eliminate agencyspecific legacy systems differs fro m more decentralized approach taken in another bush administration effort the lines of business initiative some other egovernment initiatives have reportedly been influenced by the lines of business effort for example the gr antsgov project was reportedl supposed to have single website for finding and applying for federal grants however the initiative was reportedly later changed to one in which existing agency grants management systems are made available for other agencies to use112 effect on presidential power some observers have also commented on

oversight would dramatize and enha nce ombs and oiras already central role in the rulemaking process113 the authors went on to say the following as agencies become more transparent they become more transparent to the president as well as to the public it used to be that the number of copies of materials in the docket was limited and it was physically located at the agency now the docket is immediately available on equal and easy terms to all who want it including the president and politics will give him the incentive to use it114 similarly stuart w shulman of the univers ity of pittsburgh said many of the tools employed by the omb when it exerts control over federal rulemaking eg monitoring prompting or early collabora tion in drafting proposals are likely to be enhanced by seamless it systems for erulemaking115 expected financial costs and benefits at different points in the implementation of the erulemaking initiative epa and omb developed estimates of the expected financial costs and benefits eg savings associated with the federal docket management system the cost estimates were consistently in the 1822 million ra nge for the development of single centralized rulemaking docket estimated savings from the system were expected to be more than 90 million over three years when compared to allowing agencies to develop their own electronic dockets as is the case in any costbenefit analysis the validity and reliability of the results depend on the assumptions underlying the analysis cost estimates the june 2003 draft business case said that the creation of the central online docket public comme nting system supporting the federal government regulatory process will cost the federal government approximately 22 million plus 6 million in annual opera tions and maintenance costs116 gaos september 2005 report on the rulemaking initiative indicated that the decision to adopt the centralized docket option was ba sed on three assessments two of which concluded

the third assessment focused on th risk supportability and security of the systems being considered not cost benefits estimates epas and ombs estimates of the financial benefits of the erulemaking initiative appear to have varied over time as have the assumptions that underlay those estimates december 2002 estimate according to draft capital asset plan and business case that was submitted to omb by epa in december 2002 the rulemaking project team identified 145 rule making agencies and subagencies in the federal government118 this count included multiple subunits within departments and agencies for example usda account ed for 20 of these agencies epa concluded that if each agency or even half of the agencies created docket system like epas the cost would be as much as 113 million not including 250000 to 13 million in annual maintena nce and operating costs for each system epa also said that creating single centralized docket system would cost about 21 million to build not including 10 million in nnual maintenance nd operating costs therefore epa concluded that the erulemaking initiative would save the federal government 92 million by not allowing parate docket system s to evolve 113 million minus 21 million plus another 65 million in lower nnual maintenance fees although it is not clear from the data th at epa presented the estimated cost for each agency to build and maintain its own electronic docket system appears to be based on the presumption that each subunit within department or agency would develop its own system however larg departments and agencies like usda might do what dot and epa did and develop single docket system for each of its subunits to use as result the cost of department or agencys pecific systems would likely be lower than epa anticipated and therefore the expected savings from having single system for the federal govern ment as whole would also be lower januaryjune 2003 estimate when regulations gov was launched in january 2003 omb issued press release indicating that the creation of consolidated erulemaking system would save 94 million119 but omb did not explain how that savings estimate was developed however the draft capital asset plan and business case that was submitte d to omb by epa in june 2003 appears to provide some explanation120 epa started its analysis by stating that the rulemaking project team had determined that there were at least 312 federal entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34210crs34 121 ibid p 7 122 ibid p 18 123 ibid pp 7 30 37 5455that were involved in the fe deral regulatory process121

the fede ral aviation administration the bureau of transportation statistics and the bureau of transportation statisticsaviation accounted for 14 of the 33 agencies with we benabled systems however as noted earlier in this report all units within dot have been served by single electronic docket system dms since 1998 epa said the centralized rulemaking doc ket system being veloped as part of the erulemaking initiative w ould result in savings or cost avoidance of 94 million over three years by eliminating duplicate systems 56 m illion and nnual maintenance fees 38 million123 in developing these estimates epa said it assumed that over the next 2 years 76 nononline agencies do not develop their own webbased docket syst ems and 32 legacy system entities cease support of their legacy systems it is not clear how epa arrived at its estimate of 76 agencies not developing their own systems since th 76 agencies mentioned previously were those that already had some type of electronic co mmenting system epa provided its assumptions of what it would cost to build and maintain new systems and to manage paper docket system for larg medium small and microscaled systems however it is not possible to replicate epas cost estimates because epa did not indicate how many of the 76 agencies fell into each size category the 32 legacy systems that would long er be supported appear to have been drawn from the 33 agencies with webenabled systems minus the epa system which would be maintained at the start of fdms however as noted previously 33 agencies with webenabled commenting systems is not the same as 33 rulemaking systems that would have to be mainta ined since 14 of the 33 agencies those within dot were on one system dms also these systems were described as commenting systems not docket systems lthough some such as the one at dot may have also had electronic docket capabilities also the analysis appears to assume that agencies existing electronic or paper docket systems would be eliminated when the agencies were migrated to the new centralized docketing system however fdms is being constructed as date forward system and will not necessarily include records for rules that are longer open for comment therefore to the extent that the agencies are required or desire to maintain ready access to those records the agencies may not be able to eliminate those existing records systems and the expected savings may not occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34210crs35 124 us government accountability office electronic rulemaking progress made in developing centralized

assessments described earlier they also said there was lack of data on how much it cost to develop and operate erulemaking systems so they us ed information from epas own system and their professional judgement in developing the savings estimate124 september 2003 business case the september 2003 business case submitted to omb which was characterized to gao as final version of the june 2003 document did not contain an estimate of the savings likely to occur as result of the erulemaking initiative instead the document simply said that the initiative will save taxpayer dollars and make the federal government more efficient by consolidating redundant docke t information technology sy stems across agencies and by reducing duplicative spending for these systems125 the overall be nefit of the centralized docket system was described as unifies and simplifies the federal rulemaking process the ove rall benefit of the distribut ed and tiered erulemaking options were described as none126 the document also differed from its pred ecessors in other ways for example epa said there were 173 fede ral entities involved in the rulemaking process down from 312 in the june 2003 draft and said that at least 42 of these agencies had some type of online commenting system up from 33 in the previous draft september 2004 business case in its september 2004 business case epa returned to the 94 million savings timate in its june 2003 document and again said that the figure included 56 million for eliminating duplication of systems and 38 million for nnual maintenance fees127 epa also again said that the transition from paper to electronic dockets and the consolidation of reading rooms could result in governmentwide cost avoidance of approximately 58m that includes staff and space reductions more

anticipated requesting actual cost savings and cost avoidance in november 2006 for use in ombs report to congress on the benefits of the egovernment initiatives ombs report to congress on the benefits of the presidents egovernment initiatives fiscal year 2007 asserted that the erulemaking initiative would result in lowered costs but provided details on how those savings would be achieved instead the report noted the number of hits and comments the website had received the number of documents posted and the number of pages downloaded by the public the agencyspecific erulemaking sections also had little in the way of specific cost savings attributable to the initiative129 notably each agency had exactly the same text in their sections of the report saying that the agency will benefit in savings through their pa rticipation and reliance on fdms and regulationsgov and that budget cost savings and cost avoidance will be the results of the agencys transition to fdms and regulationsgov130 none of the agencies quantified those results other than noting the number of federal register notices and other documents that they had posted on regulati onsgov and the number of comments received through that system ombs report to congress on the benefits of the presidents egovernment initiatives fiscal year 2008 said that the erulemaki ng program provides several process benefits eg agency manage ment and dissemina tion of regulatory information as well as cost avoidan ce benefits over trad itional baseline paper processes to level of 30 million over five years131 the report went on to say that based on calculations by an independent economist who was hired by the rulemaking program the centralized docket system is estimated to save range of 106 129 million over five years when comp ared to more decentralized systems the agencyspecific sections again had virtually identical language and again noted the number of documents posted in regula tionsgov some of the agencyspecific

considerably more to build their own systems than the cost of buying into fdms on the other hand she said agencies that had such systems already eg dot and fda may not see significant benefits or savings and will wind up paying more than before but the tradeoff is that the citizens are better served134 functionality of regulationsgov several issues regarding the functionality of fdms within regulationsgov have been raised by different observers including the general navigability of the website the consistency and completeness of the data whether the system allows users to adequately search existing dockets and whether certain functions available in agencies electronic dockets will still be available in fdms each of these issues is discussed below the design of fdms has long been subject of interest to scholars of rulemaking for example in november 2004 group of 55 scholars wrote to the administrators of oira and the office of electronic government and information technology within omb to suggest three pr inciples to guide the design of fdms 1 consistency in data both across agencies and over time 2 flexibility in the use of docket fields for searches and 3 ease of

epa proposed rules ultimately allowed crs to locate the ru identified in october 2007 and then to sort the materials in th docket by document type eg supporting materials or public comments and by date of submission consistency and completeness of data another set of concerns expressed about fdms is reported lack of consistency in how key data are submitted into the system the regulations gov

how information is submitted to the system to accommodate differing agency rulemaking practices and legacy systems robert carlitz director of information renaissance said its chaotic theres standardiz ation and said rulemaking program managers provided few standard fields but allowed agencies to add any additional fields they wanted he said this led to certain amount of anarchy because you can have the same information submitted in different ways by the agencies140 at minimum critics argue omb and epa could have required agencies to include the same types of descri ptors used in relation to othe r regulatory requirements eg whether the rule is significant or ec onomically significant under executive order 12866 and therefore must be reviewed by omb before being published in the federal

capabilities other concerns previously centered on the limited search capability in fdms in octobe r 2007 the system only allowed searches within certain data fields g the titles of documents not throughout the text of the documents in the rulemaking docket barbara brandon law librarian at the university of miami school of law was quoted as saying that if the system is not going to provide full text searching then it has really been oversold142 she pointed out that the epa docket system that the agency had before migrating to fdms had full text searching but fdms did not cary coglianese pr ofessor of law and political science at the university of pennsylvania said the lack of fulltext search capability was surprising and in the age of google not up to the state of the art143 epa officials said they were aware of this limitati on and said that fulltext searching would likely be added but must first be approved by change control board group of agency it and rulema king representatives and the 25member executive committee by march 2008 regula tionsgov permitted fulltext searching of documents loss of certain capabilities at one of the public meetings in august 2004 deputy assistant administrator in epas office of environmental information was quoted as saying that fd ms would provide at least the same utility as existing agencyspecific electronic dockets and

open up the rulemaki ng process and allow more public participation both in terms of number of particip ants and types of participants to allow participation in more meaningful way and as result to improve the quality of the rules developed through that process in january 2003 omb said that regulationsgov would mak the federal rulemaking process more accessible and enable citizens and small businesses to quickly access and comment on hundreds of open proposed rule s from all federal agencies147 from its earliest days of implementa tion regulationsgov has demonstrated its potential in this regard gao reported in 2003 that regulationsgov did better job of identifying rules available for comment than agency websites and was more likely to allow the public to provide electronic

costbenefit and risk analyses and the comments of others that was sometimes difficult to obtain particularly in agencies that did not already have electronic dockets the u tility of fdms in this

electronic dialogues between those commenting on rules and agency officials150 more recent observations have been less optimistic and some have been cautionary for example one author entitled his article the internet still might but probably wont change everything and concluded that series of focus groups suggested that erulemaking may simply digitize established paperbased processes151

groups and other commenters more influe nce over agencies rulemaking activities by 1 initiating formemail campaigns to demonstrate political muscle and 2 submitting detailed sophisticated comments that will have to rise to the top of the agencys comment pile therefore he concluded that we need to think hard about the ramifications of technology here to our participatory democracy153 another author wrote that empirical research shows that rulemaking makes little difference citizen input remains typically sparse notwithstanding the relativ ease with which individuals can now learn about and comment on regulatory proposals154 still another author c oncluded in 2006 that there are good reasons to believe that erulemaking initiatives costs outweigh their benefits but also advocated m

more transparent or account able and little chance that it will enable the public to participate in rulemaking more effectively157 the authors advocated that regulationsgov be substantially redesigned to allow it to achieve those goals including better guidance in locating the relevant agency or proceeding and basic educational cues about the objectives nd procedure of the rulemaking process the description of the american bar association group that is examining rulemaking in the federal government evidenced similar conclusion although the panel praised the epa working group in ch arge of the administrations initiative as having performed remarkably in th face of uncertainty criticism and cumbersome management structure it c oncluded that erulemakings potential to improve public partic ipation in and understanding of the rulemaking process has not been even modestly tapped by regulationsgov and fdms158 concluding observations in the first sentence of november 2001 article in federal times agency officials were quoted as saying that pl an to create governmentwide online rule making process could wind up being more co stly and workintensive than the bush administration envisions159 more than six years later that statement seems prophetic regulatory commenting system that was constructed to handle up to 16000 comments per hour had after more than four and onehalf years of implementation processed an average of about three comments per hour and about half of those comments were submitted in the last two months of the period160 governmentwide electronic docket system

elsewhere and is not yet fully implemented because timates of cost and imp lementation have not been met erulemaking was on ombs list of it projects with performance shortfalls some experts predicted that the initiative would transform the rulemaking process and would level th playing field between the general public and the politically well connected161 however as noted previously several academic and empirical studies suggest that erulemaking has not yet had and may never have that effect also recent claims notwithstanding pr edictions in 2003 that the erulemaking system would save 94 million now seem unlikely to occur162 this savings estimate appears to have been based in part on questionable judgments regarding the number of existing online docket systems and ther efore the cost of maintaining those systems also because paper and electronic legacy docket systems may need to be maintained agencies may not be able to retire their existing paper or electronic dockets thereby saving money as dot di d through reduced administrative costs omb now says that fdms will be more expensive for some agencies than if they developed their own electronic docket systems but will still cost less government wide than allowing agencies to deve lop and maintain their own systems nevertheless the erulemaking initiative continues to be implemented agencies are more rapidly being added to fdms with some of the agencies representing the bulk of federal rulemaking activity having recently been migrated eg dot or scheduled for migration in th near future how erulemaking should be assessed and even whether its effects can actually be measured are matters of considerable controversy for example even if the costs of implementation are higher than anticipated and even if the expected financial benefits do not occur are the nonfinancial benefits of more informed public worth those costs even if relatively few public comments on rules ar receive via regulationsgov do the high number of hits and downloads indicate that the system is still valuable to the public number of areas of inquiry rema in to be explored some with immediate ramifications should the public be requi red to use regulationsgov to comment on rules as some agencies are currently doing or should other commenting options remain available how can the effects of erulemaking on the quality of rules and regulatory decisions be asse ssed some have suggested that these and other issues could be addressed by reauthorized nd funded administrative conference of the united states163httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34210crs46

inauspicious first five years are many but one reason appears to be lack of direct consistent funding congre ss appropriated less than 20 m illion to the government fund from fy2003 through fy 2007 for all egovernment projects much less than the 345 million authorized in the egovernment act for that period and less than was requested by the presiden t congressional reluctance to fund these projects stems in part from what has been viewed as ombs effort to force its management priorities on agencies that w ould otherwise choose different approaches to serving the public164 with regard to erulemaking this appears to refer to the decision to have single centralized docket system rather than decentralized system built on the foundations of the electr onic dockets that were already operating in certain agencies in reaction the ad ministration develope d method of funding erulemaking and other initiatives through contributions from participating agencies to the managing partners of the initiatives congress has in turn expressed concerns that these contributions circumvent th congressional appropriations process and violate appropriations law therefore for the past several years congress has instructed agencies not to tr ansfer funds to the managing partners of these initiatives until the house and senate appropriations committees have given their approval kimberly nelson former cochair of th erulemaking initiative was quoted as placing much of the blame for the lack of progress on ombs failure to build sustainable infrastructure for the project in their haste to show success she reportedly said they failed to establish proper gove rnance structure the project lacks an adequate system for funding polic ies reserve funding for contingencies and most importantly shared vision with congress165 similarly one senate committee staff member was quoted in 2005 as sa ying that there needs to be better communication between omb and the appropriators166 however spokesperson for the h ouse appropriations committee was quoted in the same article as saying that omb is intentionally going around congress and weve said multiple times that this program doesnt make lot of sense and omb continues to do poor job convincing us that it does make sense congressional appropriators point out that the constituti on gives congress the authority to fund or not fund particular initiatives and the president cannot decide to fund and operate them without congressional approval therefore the conflicts between the administration and congress regarding the funding and management of erulemakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34210crs47 167 jeffrey w seifert keeping erulemaking on the docket analog challenges to digital government in erulemaking at the

operations of government and how the two branches of government should interact another part of the problem may be what one author called fundamental mismatch between the horizontal nature of governmentwide egovernment initiatives and the vertical organization of governme nt funding and oversight mechanisms167 the stovepipes that egovernment initiatives are designed to eliminate are he said mirrored in the organization of congressional committee jurisdictions an october 2004 federal times commentary sounded similar theme after noting that erulemaking and other projects would be delayed by provisions in appropriations bills the author said that congress like these projects is hostage to its own archaic organizati on structure crossagency electronic government projects are necessary relatively easy and effective way to bring many agencies together for the common good but lawmakers have effective means to manage these projects that must change the current arrangement in which each contributing agency secures the approval of its appropriations subcommittees before contributing funds to the managing partner is one way to strike balance between executive and legislative control how long this arrangement will continue is at this point unclear longterm location of erulemaking although the erulemaking initiative is fr equently identified as presidential initiative it also has statutory underpinning s section 206c of the egovernment act of 2002 requires agencies to accept rule making comments electronically to the extent practicable secti on 206d of the act requires ag encies in consultation with the omb director and to the extent pr acticable to 1 ensure that publicly accessible federal government web site contains electronic dockets for rulemakings and 2 make available in those dockets all submissions under the administrative procedure act and all other materials that are usually included in such dockets even if not submitted electronically given these statutory requirements and assuming that regulati onsgov and the centralized docket system that has been constructed dur ing the past five years is unlikely to be disassembled even by new presidential administration it is reasonable to consider where the federal governments eru lemaking effort should be housed long term one possibility is to have epa continue in its lead agency role after all epa has gained valuable experience in developing the initiative and is certainly familiar with both regulationsgov and fdms on the other hand reasonable questions could be raised as to whether the deve lopment and longterm maintenance of an electronic rulemaking system for all federal agencies is consistent with epas core mission of protecting human h ealth and the environmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34210crs48 168 for more information see http wwwgpoa ccessgovnaraindexhtmlanother possibility is the office of the federal register ofr within the national archives
