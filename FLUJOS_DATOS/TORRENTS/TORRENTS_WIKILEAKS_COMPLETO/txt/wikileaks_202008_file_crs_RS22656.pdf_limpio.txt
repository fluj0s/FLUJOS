solomonfears domestic social policy division september 25 2007 abstract the longawaited experimentally designed evaluation of abstinenceonly education programs commissioned by congress in 1997 indicates that young persons who participated in the us department of health and human services title v abstinence education block grant program were more likely than other young persons to abstain from sex the evaluation conducted by mathematica policy inc found that program participants had just as many sexual partners as nonparticipants had sex at the same median age as nonparticipants and were just as likely to use contraception as nonparticipants for many analysts and researchers the study conﬁrms that comprehensive sex education curriculum with an abstinence message and information about contraceptives and decisionmaking skills is better approach to preventing teen pregnancy others maintain that the evaluation examined only four programs for elementary and middle school students and is thereby inconclusive separate experimentally designed evaluations of comprehensive sexual education programs found that some comprehensive programs including contraception information decisionmaking skills and peer pressure strategies were successful in delaying sexual activity improving contraceptive use andor preventing teen

there have been divergent views with regard to sex and young persons many argue that sexual activity in and of itself is wrong if the persons are not married others agree that it is better for teenagers to abstain from sex but are primarily concerned about the negative consequences of sexual activity namely unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases stds these two viewpoints are reflected in two teen pregnancy prevention approaches the abstinenceonly education approach centers on the abstinenceonly message and exclusively funds programs that adhere solely to bolstering that message the title v abstinence education block grant administered by the department of he alth and human services hhs supports this approach the comprehensive sexual education appr oach provides funding through many other federal programs for both prevention programs that often include an abstinence message and programs that provide medical and social rvices to pregnant or parenting teens g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 since 1991 teen pregnancy abortion and birth rates have all fallen considerably in 2002 the latest available data the overall pregnancy rate for teens aged 1519 was 754 per 1000 females aged 1519 down 35 from the 1991 level of 1153 the 2002 teen pregnancy rate is the lowest recorded since 1973 when this series was initiated 1 however it still is higher than the teen pregnancy rates of most industrialized nations after increasing sharply during the late 1980s the teen birth rate for females aged 1519 declined every year from 1991 to 20052 the 2005 teenage birth rate of 404 per 1000 women aged 1519 is the lowest recorded birth rate for us teenagers in 2005 the number of births to teens was 421123 102 of the 41 million births in the us of which 6717 births were to girls under age 15 3 nearly 23 of all nonmarital births were to teens in 2005 although birth rates for us teens have dropped in recent years they remain higher than the teenage birth rates of most industrialized nations according to recent report on children and youth in 2005 34 of ninth graders reported that they had experienced sexual intercourse the corresponding statistics for older teens were 43 for tenth graders 51 for eleventh graders and 63 for twelfth graders4 about 30 of female teens who have had sexual intercourse become pregnant before they reach age 20 5 1 the alan guttmacher institute us teenage pregnancy statistics national and state trends and trends by race and ethnicity updated september 2006 p 5 2 in 1970 the teen birth rate was 683 births per 1000 women aged 1519 the birth rate dropped to 502 in 1986 and rose back to 618 in 1991 since 1991 the teen birth rate for women aged 1519 has decreased each year declining almost 35 during the 14year period from 1991 to 2005 from 618 births per 1000 women aged 1519 in 1991 to 404 births per 1000 women aged 1519 in 2005 3 national center for health statistics births preliminary data for 2005

pregnancy estimated that in 2004 adolescent childbearing cost us taxpayers about 9 billion per year research indicates that teens who give birth are less likely to complete high school and go on to college thereby reducing their potential for economic selfsufficiency the research also indicates that the children of teens are more likely than children of older parents to experience problems in school and drop out of high school and as adults are more likely to repeat the cycle of teenage pregnancy and poverty the 2006 report contends that if the teen birth rate had not declined between 1991 and 2004 the annual costs associated with teen childbearing would have been almost 16 billion instead of 9 billion 6 in recognition of the negative longterm consequences associated with teenage pregnancy and births the prevention of teen pregnancy is major national goal

g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g142g156g561 although number of different techniques are available to evaluate the impact of policy changes there is widespread consensus that welldesigned and wellimplemented studies that require random assignment to experimental and control groups provide more reliable valid and objective information than other types of approaches rand om assignment experimental studies generally assign potential participants to two groups individuals assigned to control group are subject to current policies or practices policy change individuals assigned to the experimental or treatment group are subject to different policy initiative ie intervention such as abstinence only education individuals are randomly assigned to these two groups and any differences between the experimental and control group are attrib uted to the policy initiative being examined the random assignment experimental approach attempts to estimate programs impact on an outcome of interest it measures the average di fference between the experimental group and the control group for policy to have an impact it must be determined that the impact did not just occur by chance in other words the difference must be determined to be statistically significant differences between experimental and control groups that pass statistical significance tests are reported as policy impacts 7 the random assignment experimental approach generally is considered to provide the most valid estimate of an interventions impact and thereby provides useful information on whether and the extent to which on average an intervention causes favorable impacts for large group of subjects for information about some of the problems with the experimental approach see crs report rl33301

from youth aged 10 to 14 four to six years after study enrollment the report among other things presents the estimated program impacts on sexual abstinence and risks of pregnancy and stds according to the report findings indicate that youth in the program group were more likely than control group youth to have abstained from sex and among those who reported having had sex they had similar numbers of sexual partners and had initiated sex at the same mean age program and control group youth did not differ in their rates of unprotected sex either at first intercourse or over the last 12 months overall the programs improved identification of stds but had overall impact on knowledge of unprotected sex risks and the consequences of stds both program and control group youth had good

showcased programs that were among the first funded by the 1996 welfare reform law it stated that its recent directives to states have encouraged states to focus abstinenceonly education programs on youth most likely to bear children outside of marriage ie high school students rather than elementary or middleschool students it also mentioned that programs need to extend the peer support for abstinence from the preteen years through the high school years 10 g5g152g150g153g155g142g145g142g151g156g146g159g142g561g21g142g161g158g138g149g561 g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 advocates of more comprehensive approach to sex education argue that todays youth need information and decisionmaking skills to make realistic practical choices about whether to engage in sexual activities they contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence gives them the information they need to resist peer pressure and to set relationship limits and also provides them with information on prevention of stds and the use of contraceptives 11 according to recent report by the national campaign to prevent teen pregnancy five random assignment

program information address peer pressure teach communication skills reflect the age sexual experience and culture of young persons in the programs although there have been numerous evaluations of

the approach taken is so multilayered that researchers have had difficulty disentangling the effects of multiple components of program in other cases the approach may have worked for boys but not for girls or vice versa in some cases the programs are very small and thereby it is harder to obtain significant results in other cases different personnel may affect the outcomes of similar programs

continues to support an abstinenceonly program intervention with some modifications others argue that an abstinence message integrated into comprehensive sex education program that includes information on the use of contraceptives and that enhances decisionmaking skills is more effective method to prevent teen pregnancy recent nationally representative survey found that 90 of adults and teens agree that young people should get strong message that they should not have sex until they are at least out of high school and that majority of adults 73 and teens 56 want teens to get more information about both abstinence and contraception 13 the american publicboth adults and teens supports encouraging teens to delay sexual activity and providing young people with information about
