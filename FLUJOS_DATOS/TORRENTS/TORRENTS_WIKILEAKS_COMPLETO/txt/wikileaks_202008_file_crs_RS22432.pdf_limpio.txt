of state death row inmates if the state has provided an approved level of appointed counsel th supreme court has held that congress enjoys considerable authority to limit but not to extinguish access to the writ this is an abridged version of crs report rl33391 federal habeas corpus brief overview by charles doyle without the footnotes or appendices and without most the quotation marks and citations to authority found in the original introduction colonial america was well acquain ted with habeas corpus and with occasional suspensions of the writ the draf ters of the united states constitution after enumerating the powers of congress inserted the limitation that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it consistent with the common law the writ was available to those confined by federal officials without tr ial or admission to bail but was not available to contest the validity of confinement pur suant to conviction by federal court of competent jurisdiction even one whose judgment was in error in 1867 congress substantially increased the jurisdiction of federal courts to issue the writ by authorizing its issuance in all cases state or federal where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution or of any treaty or law of the united states early in the forties the court stopped requiri ng that an alleged constitutional violationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22432crs2 void the jurisdiction of the trial court before federal habeas relief could be considered federal judges soon complained that fede ral prisoner abuses of habeas had become legion congress responded by incorporating into the 1948 revision of the judicial code the first major revision of the federal habeas statute since 1867 state courts exerted little pressure for revision of the federal habeas statute in 1948 although habeas relief had been available to state prisoners by stat ute since 1867 and subse quent decisions seemed to invite access the hospitality that federa l habeas extended to state convicts with due process and other federal constitutional claims had not yet become apparent this all changed over the next two decades some of the change was attributable to expansive supreme court interpretations of the procedur guarantees of the bill of rights and of the extent to which those guar antees were binding upon the st ates through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by the early seventies the supreme court had begun to announce series of decisions grounded in the values of respect for the work of state courts and finality in the process of trial and review thus state prisoners who fail to afford state courts an opportunity to correct constitutional fects are barred from raising them for the first time in federal habeas in the absence of justification nor may they scatter their habeas claims in series of successive petitions those who plead guilty and thereby waive as matter of state law any constitutional claims may not use federal habeas to revive them and state prisoners may not employ federal habeas as means to assert or retroactively claim the benefits of previously unrecognized interpretation of constitutional law ie new rule antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa opting in the aedpa offered procedural advantages to the states in order to ensure the continued availability of qualifie d defense counsel in death penalty cases it gave the states three options state could elect not to ta ke advantage of the expedited procedures in which case it would be g overned by the usual habeas provisions alternatively state could opt in and ect to provide mechanism for the appointment and compensation of counsel to assist indige nt state prisoners unde r sentence of death in state postconviction review state habeas proceedings finally rather than use the mechanism for appointment of counsel for parate level of state collateral proceedings state could use the mechanism in conjunction with unified system of review which merges state direct appeals and collateral review the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act simplifie s the election by dropping the unitary review provision states may opt in if they provide for assi stance of counsel in manner approved by the attorney general when state opts in federal habeas review of claim filed by state death row inmate is limited to issues raised and decided on the merits in state court unless the state unlawfully prevented the claim from being raised in state court or the claim is based on newly recognized retroactively applicable constitutional interpretation or on newly unearthed previously undiscoverable ev idence in cases where the federal habeas application has been filed by prisoner under sentence of death under the federal law or the laws of state which has opted in the government has right enforceable through mandamus to determination by the district court within 450 days of the filing of an application and by the federal court of appeals within 120 days of the filing of the parties final briefs deference to state courts the aedpa bars federa l habeas relief on claim already passed upon by state c ourt unless the adjudication of the claim 1 resulted in decision that was contrary to or i nvolved an unreasonable application of clearlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22432crs3 established federal law as determined by th supreme court of the united states or 2 resulted in decision that was based on an unr easonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court occurs when state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the courts decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the case before it moreover the court has said on several occasions the questi on before the federal courts when they are confronted with challenged state court application of supreme court recognized principle is not whether the federal courts c onsider the application incorrect but whether the application is objectively unreasonable on the other hand decision is contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court if it applies rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme courts cases or if it confronts set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from decision of the court but reaches different result obviously state cour t determination of question which relevant supreme court precedent leaves unresolved can be neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of court precedent exhaustion the deference extended to state courts reaches not only their decisions but the opportunity to render decisi ons arising within the cases before them state prisoners were once required to exhaus t the opportunities for state remedial action before federal habeas relie f could be granted the aedpa preserves the exhaustion requirement and reenforces it with an explicit demand that states waiver of the requirement must be explicit on the other hand congress appears to have been persuaded that while as general rule constitutional questions may be resolved more quickly if state prisoners initially bring their claims to state courts in some cases where state prisoner has mistakenly first sought relief in federal cour t operation of the exhaustion doctrine may contribute to further delay hence the provisions of 28 usc 2254b2 authorize dismissal on the merits of mixed habeas petitions filed by state prisoners successive petitions the aedpa bars repetitious habeas pe titions by state and federal prisoners under earlier law state prisoners could not petition for habeas relief on claim they had included or could have included in earlier federal habeas petitions unless they could show cause and prejudice or miscarriage of justice cause could be found in the ineffective assistance of couns the subsequent development of some constitutional theory which would have been so novel at the time it should have been asserted as to be considered unavailable or the discovery of new evidence not previously readily discoverable prisoner unable to show cause and prejudi ce might nevertheless be entitled to federal habeas relief upon showing of fundamental miscarriage of justice this required showing by cl ear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error reasonable juror would find the petitioner guilty or eligible for the death penalty under applicable state law the courts preaedpa tolerance for second or successive habeas petitions from state prisoners was limited the tolerance of the aedpa is if anything more limited if the prisoner asserts claim that he has already presented in previous federa l habeas petition the claim must be dismissed in all cases claim not mentioned in an earlier petition must be dismissed unless it falls within one of two narrow exceptions it relies on newly announced constitu tional interpretation made retroactively applicable or b it is predicated upon on newly discovered evidence not previously available through the exercise of due diligence which together with other relevant evidence establishes by clear and c onvincing evidence that but for the belatedlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22432crs4 claimed constitutional error reasonable factfinder woul d have found the applicant guilty moreover the exceptions are only available if three judge panel of the federal appellate court aut horizes the district court to cons ider the second or successive petition because the panel concludes th at the petitioner has made pr ima facie case that his claim falls within one of the exceptions and the section purports to place the panels decision beyond the banc jurisdiction of the circuit and the certiorari jurisdiction of the supreme court the supreme court in felker v turpin held that because it retained its original jurisdiction to entertain habeas petitions neither the gatekeeper provisions of section 2244b3 nor the limitations on second or successive petitions found in sections 2244b1 and 2 deprive the court of appella jurisdiction in vi olation of article iii 2 at the same time it held that th restrictions came well within congress constitutional authority and did not amount to suspension of the writ contrary to article i 9 in castro v united states 540 us 375 37981 2003 the court held that section 2244b3e constraint upon its certiorari juri sdiction is limited to instances where the lower appellate court has acted on request to file successive petition and does not apply to instances where the lower appellate court has reviewed trial courts successive petition determination statute of limitations the aedpa established one year deadline within which state and federal prisoners must file their federal habeas petitions the period is tolled during the pendency of state collateral re view when the state appeal is not filed in timely manner when it is untimely under st ate law that is the end of the matter for purposes of 2244d2 amendments submitte d after the expiration of year to petition filed within the one ear period limitation that assert claims unrelated in time and type to those found in the original petition do not relate back and are time barred state may waive the statute of limitations defense but its intent to do so must be clear and not simply the product of mathematical miscal culation the statute of limitations provisions initially presented novel problem for distri ct courts faced with mixed petitions of exhausted and unexhausted claims as resu lt of the interplay between aedpas 1year statute of limitations and lundys dismissal requirement petitioners who come to federal court with mixed petitions run the risk of fo rever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims if petitioner files timely but mixed petition in federal district court and the district court dismisses it under lundy after the limitations period has expired this will likely mean the termination of federal review nevertheless the district court is under obligation to wa rn pro petitioners of the perils of mixed petitions although cautioning against abus if too frequently employed the court endorsed the stay and abeyance solution suggest ed by several of th lower courts under which in appropriate cases the portion of state prisoners mixed petition related to exhausted habeas claims are stayed and held in abeyance until he can return to state court and exhaust his unexhausted claims appeals appeals are only possible upon the issuance of certification of appealability coa upon substantial showin g of constitutional right petitioner satisfies the requirement when he can show that reasonable jurists would find the district courts assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong this does not require the petitioner show likelihood of success on the merits it is enough that reasonable jurists would find that the claim warrant cl oser examination should the district have dismissed the habeas petition on procedural grounds coa may be issued only upon the assessment that reasonable jurists would cons ider both the merits of the claim and the procedural grounds for dismissal debatablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22432crs5 other habeas features default and innocence in wainwright v sykes the court declared that state prisoners who fail to raise claims in state proceedings are barred from doing so in federal habeas proceedings unless they can establish both cause and prejudice the court later explained that the same standard should be us ed when state prisoners abused the writ with successive petitions asserting claims not previously raised and when they sought to establish claim by developing facts whic h they had opted not to establish during previous proceedings of the two elements prejudice requires an actual substantial disadvantage to the prisoner what constitutes cause is not easily stated cause does not include tactical decisions ignorance inadvertence or mistake of counsel or the assumption that the state courts would be unsympathetic to the claim cause may include the ineffective assistance of counsel some forms of prosecuto rial misc onduct the subsequent development of so constitutional theory whic h would have been so novel at the time it should have been asserted as to be considered unavaila ble or the discovery of new evidence not previously readily disc overable federal courts may entertain habeas petition notwithstanding default and the failure to establish cause in any case where failure to grant relief based on an error of constitutional dimensions would result in miscarriage of justice due to the apparent conviction of the innocent murray v carrier in order the meet this actually innocent standard the prisoner must show that it is more likely than not that reasonable ju ror would convict him when the petitioner challenges his capital sentence rather than his conviction he must show by clear and convincing evidence that but for the constitu tional error reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death pena lty this miscarriage of justice exception whether addressed to the petitioners guilt or sentence is matter that can be taken up only as last resort after all nondefaulte d claims for relief and the grounds for cause excusing default on other cl aims have been examined harmless error the mere presence of constitutional error by itself does not present sufficient grounds for issuance of the wr it unless the error is also harmful ie unless the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdict the writ will issue how ever where the court has grave doubt as to whether the error was harmless new rules and retroactivity under teague v lane new rule cannot be sought through federal habeas and new rule may only be applied retroactively for the benefit of habeas petitioners when 1 th new interpretation places certain kinds of primary private individual conduc t beyond the power of the cr iminal lawmaking authority to proscribe or places certain cat egory of punishment for class of defendants because of their status or offense beyond th power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe or 2 the new interpretati on significantly improves the preexisting fact finding procedures which implicate the funda mental fairness of the trial and without which the likelihood of an accu rate conviction is seriously diminished the court has more recently indicated that the rules cove red in the first exception the exception for rules that place certain conduct beyond proscriptive reach are more accurately characterized as substantive rather than pr ocedural rules and thus not subject to the teague rule from the beginning the court observed in beard v banks that it has yet to rule on case that satisfied this second teague exception httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22432crs6 congressional authority to bar or restrict access to the writ one of the most interesting and perplexing features of federal habeas corpus law involves the question of congress authority to restrict access to the writ the constitution nowhere expressly grants right of access to the writ although it might be seen as an attribute of the suspension clause or the due process clau or both yet the suspension clause says more than that the privilege of the wr it of habeas corpus sh all not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it us const arti 9 cl2 and the due process clause speaks with an equal want of particularity when it declares that person shall prived of life liberty or property without due process of law us const amend v balanced against this is the power of congress to ordain and establish the lower federal courts us const art iii 1 to regulate and make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court us const art iii 2 cl2 to enact all laws necessary and power to carry into effect the constitutional powers of the cour ts as well as its own usconst art i 8 cl18 and at least arguably the power to suspend the pr ivilege to the writ in times of rebellion or invasion us const art i 9 cl2 exceptions clause and the original writ the question as to the scope of congress control over courts appellate jurisdiction in habeas cases surfaced when prisoner challenged the aedpas habeas limitations in felker v turpin in particular felker argued that the provisions which declared the appellate court determination of whether to authorize second or successive habeas petition was ne ither appealable nor subject to petition for rehearing or for writ of certiorari the court took offense to the limitation of habeas appella jurisdiction since the aedpa does not repeal the courts authority to entertain petition for habeas corpus there can be plausible argument that the act has deprived the court of appellate jurisdiction in violation of article iii 2 review remained possible under th original writ of habeas corpus suspension of the privilege of the writ the felker court disavowed any contention that the aedpas pr ovisions violated the suspen sion clause it did not stop with the proposition that the suspension clause does not extend to convicted prisoners or any other prisoners ineligible for the wr it under common law however but assumed that the suspension clause of the constitution refers to the writ as it exists today rather than as it existed in 1789 even under this rela xed standard it found any claim based on felkers case wanting the aedpas limitation on repetitious or stale claims was seen as variation of res judicata which in the area of habeas had been an evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage st atutory developments and judicial decisions the added restrictions which th act places on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary process and do not amount to suspension of the writ contrary to article i 9 shortly after felker however the court narrowly construed congressional efforts to restrict review of various immigration decisions and recognized that the courts retained jurisdiction to review habeas petitions with the observation that otherwise serious suspension clause issues would arise
