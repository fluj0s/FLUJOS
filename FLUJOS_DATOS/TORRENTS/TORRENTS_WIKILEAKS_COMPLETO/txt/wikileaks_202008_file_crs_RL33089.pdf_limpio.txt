since the original building was constructedfacility is eligible the fac ility may be eligible to recei ve support through the stafford act8 the stafford act does not provide assistance to forprofit institutions that provide educational services thus pr oprietary ie forprofit postsecondary institutions are not eligible to receive disaster relief assistance through the stafford act available benefits for schools that are eligible for public assistance through the stafford act variety of emergency work and permanent work services may be available9 for example schools would be eligible for debris removal assi stance and emergency work to provide such services as access to the building and communications support is also provided for the temporary relocation of essentia l services such as school classrooms govern ment facilities and private nonprofit critical health facilities under the permanent work category fema is to address needs related to buildings and equipment schools would be eligible for the repair or replacement of buildings and their contents10 contents includes furnishings and equipment assistance may also be requested to re place supplies and inventory and library books and publications the initial deadlines for completing debris removal and emergency work is six months from the time major disaster is declared these deadlines may be extended by the state for an additional six months for extenuating circumstances the deadline for completion of permanent work eg re pairs is 18 months from the declaration date of major disaster but this deadline may be extended by the state for an additional 30 months for extenuating circumstances eligible entities needing assistance following major disaster must apply for support eligible applicants include stat government agencies local governments indian tribes and private nonprofit organi zations and institutions that provide specific services based on these applicati ons determination is made as to how much support an applicant will receive from fema although grants provided by fema are not capped at specific amount they may be limited by congressional appropriations for di saster relief httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33089crs4 11 see discussion in subsequent s ections on waivers granted by edonce the funds are received it is up to th applicant to determine the priorities for the uses of the funds that is stat and local communities must determine which structures to rebuild or repair first in some communities for example priority may be given to hospitals while in other comm unities priority may be given to schools as this decision is made on communitybycommunity basis it is impossible to determine how quickly schools may r eceive needed repairs and renovation duplication of benefits the stafford act prohibits entities suffering losses as result of major disaster such as the recen t hurricanes from receiving dup licate benefits for the same project 42 usc 5155 that is if funds ar appropriated to provi the same types of benefits that may alread be provided through the sta fford act the result may be considered duplication of benefits payments from insurance companies are considered duplication of be nefits and fema is required to reduce the amount of assistance provided by any actual or antic ipated insurance payments thus if congress acted to provided parate funding to schools ffected by major disasters through other federal agencies such as ed this would be considered duplication of benefit unless congre ss made an exception to the provision alternatively recipients of aid through separate ed program could be prohibited from receiving benefits under the stafford act and vice ve rsa the premise of separate funding source assumes that the ed funding would pr ovide for repair or reconstruction of the facility and its contents just as the stafford act already does an advantage an ed program might have would be to get aid to schools more quickly than may occur under the stafford act waiver of administrative conditions the stafford act provides for waivers of administrative conditions 42 usc 5141 the provision reads as follows any federal agency charged with the administration of federal assistance program may if so requested by the pplicant state or local authorities modify or waive for major disaster such ad ministrative conditions for assistance as would otherwise prevent the giving of assistance under such programs if the inability to meet such conditions is result of the major disaster this provision provides the secretary of education secretary with broad authority to waive regulatory requireme nts upon request because the provision applies to administrative conditions for assistance the statutory language implies that regulatory but not statutory requi rements may be waived currently the secretary has already taken several actions to waive various administrative requirements pertaining to elementa ry secondary and higher education11 whether the secretary will use this authority to grant additional waivers is unclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33089crs5 12 for more information about national

all teachers teaching in core academic subjects25 within the state will meet the definition of highly qualified teacher generally speaking this means that all teachers must have full state certification not have had any certification requirements waived on an emergency temporary or provisional basis nd have at least bachelors degree26 this requirement might make it difficult for receiving schools to fill vacancies it may also be difficu lt for schools affected by the recent hurricanes to comply with this requirement if they are not fully operational this academic year the secretary has previously used authority under the new law to waive andor create flexibility in these requirements for specific gr oups of teachers or types of schools eg science teacher s and rural schools the recent reauthorization of idea also required all teachers of core academic subjects to be highly qualified by th end of the 20052006 academic year and applied the nclba definition of highly qualified with certain exceptions to all special education teachers27 in the wake of the recent hurricanes at least one state has requested an extension of this deadlin although the secr etary has indicated in her response to this request that we are cu rrently reviewing this topic in general28 to date policy guidance has been posted on the ed website it is unclear whether dislocated

17 who are at or near the poverty line hereafter these children are referred to as formula children30 as previously discussed the requirements relating to the allocation and distribution of funds are among the provisions that may not be waived due to the considerable displacement and migration of students caused by the effects of major disaster and because title ia allocati ons are based on the number of formula children residing in leas prior to the year for which funds are allocated there may be considerable difference between th number of formula children upon which the allocation of title ia f unds was based and the numbe r of formula children who enroll in the current school year becau of the potentially large numbers of students including students with disab ilities who have

this issue in general by noting that ed will work with states and school districts that want to transfer or reallocate federal funds between districts when particular district or district s are unable to use funds they previously received31 aside from the general prohibition against waiving provisions related to the allocation and distribution of funds num ber of other concerns may need to be addressed when considering whether and how to reallocate title ia funds across affected states and leas these include d eciding whether leas th at have closed for part or all of the current school year shoul d be permitted to carry over their funds for an additional fiscal year determining whet her current year funds may be reallocated across affected leas and if so how this would be accomplished and determining whether holdharmless provisions would apply to temporarily closed leas in this or subsequent school years these i ssues are briefly addressed below under esea title ia

funds across affected leas as discussed in the previous bullet idea provisions the secretary has also identified number of idea specific concerns several of these issues relate to various time lines for example the texas commissioner of education requested extensions of the time line between parents consent for childs evaluati on and the determina tion of his or her eligibility for special education and the time line between the eligibility determination and the initial individualiz ed education program iep meeting36 regarding the first time line the secretary noted that idea provides for state flexibility the time between evaluation and eligibility determination is 60 days or if the state establishes time frame within which the evaluation must be conducted within such time frame section 614a1 cii the secretary notes that ordinarily statedetermined alternative to the 60day time line would apply to all leas in the state however under th extraordinary and unprecedented conditions faced by texas in dealing with the aftermath of hurricane katrina it would be reasonable for the tea texas education agency to establish different time line for completing evaluations of all children suspected of having disability in districts enrolling significant numbe r of displaced students37 regarding the deadline for the first iep meeting which is established in regulation as 30 days38 the secretary notes there is currently legal authority to waive this time line39 relevant programs the following section discusses the rele vant federal programs that are most suitable for

of students displaced from their homes and considered homeless as result of an event such as major disaster could result in an lea placing these students in separate facility if that would be an efficient and effective way to ensure their education needs were met for short period of time this grouping of cohort of children evacuees appears to be allo wed under the mckinney act as an exception to the general prohib ition against homeless student segregation leas could invoke this authority without requiring additiona l congressional action at least on temporary basis leas serving large numbers of displaced students from the recent hurricanes have already used this authority to provide free appropriate education in separate facilities to meet the educational needs of these students for example the houston chronicle reported that the houston independe nt school district is opening two previously closed elemen tary school campuses to educate up to 1350 students who have been displaced by hurricane katrina41 the education for homeless children and youth program was funded at 625 million in fy2005 the states are likely to have already distributed these funds to meet

gulf coast hurricanes54 some of the proposals would authorize the provision of direct or indirect federal aid to priv ate and parochial schools that enroll displaced students in addition to aid for public schools the administration has proposed making funding available on perpupil ba sis to support the attendance of displaced students in both public and private schools in the house and the

private schools both the house and senate proposals will be discussed in detail below however key distinction between the tw is the methods through which federal funds would be made available to schools this is of pa rticular concern with respect to religiously affilia ted schools there is ongoing debate over the appropriateness of using public funding to support the costs of enrolling students in private schools especially religiously affilia ted private schools two asp ects of this debate are of primary concern the political feas ibility of providing portable aid ie vouchers to students as part of sc hool choice program unde r which parents have some degree of control over directing the expenditure of funds on behalf of their childrens education and b constitutional concerns that might be raised if public funding were to be provided directly to religiously ffiliated schools rather than indirectly such as through voucher program55 idea many of the issues related to idea

and the specialized services your child was receiving under the best of circum stances parents advocating for special education for their child is challenging following major disaster such advocacy

secretary to waive the moe requirement for states that experienced major disaster such as the recent hurricanes these states may spend less on special education this year than they did last year at

or repay their award students who owe refund are not ab to receive dditional federal student aid until all aid owed is repaid at present the secretary does not have the authority to wa ive the return of these funds although the expected family contribution efc is based on the prior years income families must use existing resources to pay this amount many families may longer have the necessary resources to pay their efc for this academic year options to allow the efc for students affected by the disaster to be recalculated might be considered in addition adjusting next years efc calculation might beconsidered as well most people will have worked for twothirds of the year and may have substantia l earnings during this period that could affect the calculation of their efc for the next

other title iv programs the hea requires the secretary to reallocate any unused funds in excess of 10 of the total amount received that participating ihe returns in addition any ihe that returns more than 10 of their campusbased aid will have their following years allocation reduced by the amount returned however the hea does grant the secretary authority not to impose this provision if enforcing it would be against the interest of the program the disaster relief letter indicated that the secretary would consider an institutions inability to expend all of its campusbased aid due to major disaster as an acceptable reason for waiver the ihe is required to submit request for this waiver because the campusbased programs are unique in that the programs and the funds are institutionally based if student who is affected by the disaster transfers to another institution that does not participate in the campusbased programs heshe will not be able to receive funds from th federal campusbased programs options that allow ihes to transfer some of their campusbased monies to ihes with which they have established written agreements might be considered both pl 10967 the student

grace period section 67431 the fy2005 appropriation was 66 million72 borrowers who are in repayment status can be granted forbearance if the borrower is not able to continue making timely payments as

as those in the ffel programs75 approximately 57 billion in loan aid was made available in fy2005 the waiver requirements for both loan programs are comparable to those discussed for the perkins loan program except that the disasterrelated forbearance period is not counted against the student the other waivers for the loan programs pertain to institutional reporting requirements specifically the secretary indicated that waivers for the submission of disbur sement records conf irmation reports and promissory notes would be ndled on casebycase basis the following options might be consider ed to provide student loan borrowers with some additional relief during this time providing student borrowers in re payment deferment rather than forbearance might also be consid ered although this option would add costs to the student aid program because the government would subsidize the interest on subsidized stafford loans during this period and participating ihes would subsidize the interest for perkins loans it would also provide thes individuals with added relief student aid recipients especially loan borrowers are required to enroll for certain amount of credit hours per semesterquarter to maintain eligibility and to avoid repayment for example once loan borrower drops below halftime enrollment status heshe goes into repayment many of the indi viduals affected by this disaster may not enroll during this semesterquarter or the following one as they try to rebuild their lives as result these students would be required to begin repaying their loan s waiving this requirement for
