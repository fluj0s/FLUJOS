policy issues corps of engineers project backlog and agency priorities the policy debate on how to structure the corps budget and priorities is ongoing the corps civil works program has been criticized by some observers as an agglomeration of projects with underlying design these observers see th corps backlog of authorized activities as an example of this lack of focus prior to enactment of the 23 billion authorization bill for the agency known as the water resources development act wrda in november 2007 timates of the backlogs size had varied from 11 billion to more than 60 billion depending on which projects are included although some observers view the backlog as nothing more than corps to do list others are concerned that projects face construc tion delays and related cost overruns as available appropriations are spread acro ss an increasing portfolio of projects the corps backlog of authorized pr ojects and concerns about the fiscal planning and management of the agency s portfolio contribute to support for performancebased criteria for structuring the agencys budget and for concentrated appropriations on small set of priority projects othe rs also express concerns about the agencys fiscal planning and manageme nt yet reject both th use of performance based criteria that have been proposed nd the focus on 6 to 10 priority projects these critics argue that the criteria used are too simplistic and that basing the corps budget on performance criteria does not produ ce an integrated multiyear program for the agency they also argue that the focus on priority projects has resulted in disproportionate amount of the agencys budget being concentrated on few projects resulting in less investment in other authorized costbeneficial projects and in those regions of the country th at do not have priority projects performancebased budgeting one way recent administration requests have tried to address the b acklog of corps projects has been the application of performancebased budgeting approach for termining which projects to include in its requests for constructi on and maintenance funds th performance measures were based on their economic and nvironmental returns and pr otection of human safety the construction projects selected for fund ing were chosen largely on their having either high ratio of benefits to costs or for environmental projects high costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs5 effectiveness the fy2008 budget request continued the administrations movement toward presenting the agencys budget according to business lines eg navigation flood control recreation hydropower for example of the 4871 billion budget request 2009 billion 41 is for comme rcial navigation 1384 billion 28 is for flood and coastal storm damage reduction and 274 million 6 and 110 million 2 are for the agencys relatively new roles in aquatic ecosystem restoration and environmenta l stewardship respectively the agencys regulatory responsibilities represent 180 million 4 of the agencys budget although little of the debate about performancebased budgeting is reflected in the omnibus report language the earlier house and senate reports illustrated differing opinions about how best to ma nage the corps budget hrept 110185 generally supported the ad ministration performanceba sed budgeting approach it states while the committee agrees in large part with the prioritization of projects it does not believe the level of funding provided by th administration is sufficient to meet the needs of the nation in c ontrast the senate appropriations committee report stated from the committees persp ective the corps budget seems to be developed exactly in the oppos ite manner that it should be it then echoes the house by stating the country needs to invest mo re heavily in its water resources the senate appropriations committee report critic ized the administrations focus on small number of projects and its lack of support for projects at the different stages of development eg planning it also questioned the effect that focusing on few projects would have on the ability and interest in partnering with the corps of the local project sponsors for the corps ot her authorized but unbudgeted projects and studies priority projects and new starts to address the backlog of authorized corps activities the administrations request limited the number of new activities started to only two planning activities and one maintenance assessment the presidents request would fund constructi on projects that could be completed in fy2008 and six projects considered by the ad ministration to be priorities similar to the presidents fy2007 fy2006 and fy2005 requests although little of the debate about new starts is reflect ed in the omnibus report language the earlier house and senate reports illustra ted differing opinions about how best to manage the corps budget hrept 110185 expr essed general support for the administrations new start polic as applied to the fy2008 budget for the corps the exception noted by the committee is that it will consider funding for the major rehabilitation at specific locks on the ohio and mississippi river systems because it does not view the rehabilita tion of existing infrastructure as new construction start but rather necess ity the senate appropriations committee recommended limited number of new construction starts numerous construction projects that were not included in the pres idents request were included among the projects funded in the om nibus report language financial management and om budgeting unlike previous budget requests the fy2007 and fy2008 requests did not specify the amount that individual corps projects would receive for om instead the administrations recent requests divide the country into 21 regions and sp ecify om funding for each region for six different categories of ac tivities commercial navigati on flood and coastal stormhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs6 damage reduction environment hydropower recreation and wa ter supply the corps has provided estimates of how much individual projects are expected to receive however these estimates are not part of the agencys formal budget request and budget justification package this budgeting approach appears to allow the agency flexibility to move money across projects within the region as om needs arise without being subject to many of the reprogramming restrictions put into place with the agencys fy2006 appropriations some project stakeholders are likely to be uncomfortable as result of the decreas ed certainty in the om funding available for particular projects under this regional om budgeting approach although little of the debate about new starts is reflect ed in the omnibus report language the earlier house and senate reports illustra ted differing opinions about how best to manage the corps budget hrept 110185 was cr itical of how the administration developed its request for each of the 21 regions and it adopts the regional approach to om funding by specifying an om funding level for each region the senate appropr iations committee recommended rejecting the regional budgeting for om arguing that this budge ting tactic serves real purpose other than circumventing reprogramming guidance and that corps projects not regions are authorized by congress the omnibus report language did not adopt the om regions instead it directed the corps to prepare integrated om budgets for four regions the ohio river the great lakes the texas coast and the california coast the omnibus report language also provided direction to the corps on reprogramming of funds fiveyear budget pl ans budget submission materials and the use of multiyear continuing contracts everglades the corps plays significant coordination role in the restoration of the central and southern florida ecosystem the agency received 131 million for fy2008 everglades restoration activities in the omnibus report language the fy2008 budget request was for 162 million down from the 164 million requested and provided for fy2007 the fy2008 funds consist of central nd

were included in the corps budget request and enacted appropria tions previously the project was funded solely through department of the inte rior appropriations the omnibus report language noted

program plan p 8a decision will be made on moving to the phas ii design and construction stage according to the fy2008 doe budget justification in conjunction with the gnep technology monstration program the generation iv program will also focus on developing sodium cooled fast reactor sfr existing us commercial nuclear reactors use water to slow down or moderate the neutrons released by the fission process splitting of nuclei the relatively slow thermal neutrons are highly efficient in causing fission in certain isotope s of heavy elements such as uranium 235 and plutonium 2398 therefore fewer of those isotopes are needed in nuclear fuel to sustain nuclear chain reaction in whic h neutrons released by fissi oned nuclei then induce fission in other nuclei and so forth the downside is that thermal neutrons cannot efficiently induce fission in more than few specific isotopes in contrast fast neutr ons which have not been m oderated are less effective in inducing fission than thermal neutrons but can induce fission in much wider range of isotopes including all major plutonium isotopes therefore nuclear fuel for fast reactor must have higher proportion of fissionable isot opes than thermal reactor to sustain chain reaction but larger number of different is otopes can constitute th at fissionable proportion fast reactors ability to fission most heav radioactive isotopes called transuranics tru makes it theoretically possible to repeatedly separate those materials from spent fuel and feed them back into the reactor until they are entirely fissioned in thermal reactor the buildup of nonfissile isotopes sharply limits the num ber of such separation cycles before the recycled fuel can longer sustain nuclear chain reaction given the benefits of continuous recyclin g at this time gneptdp is focused on the development of fast reactor t echnologies recognizing that fa st reactor operating experience is much more limited than ther mal reactor operating experience and that fast burn reactor fuels or transmutation fuels are not fully developed according to the doe program plan9 the house appropriations committee report di rected doe to make the gascooled ngnp higher priority than fast reactors for gnep and begin competitive solicitation for commercial demonstration plant at the idaho national laboratory the senate panel also emphasized gascooled reactors in the

millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs21 the fy2008 funding request of 395 million for afci the primary component of gnep was more than double the fy2007 funding level of 1675 million which in turn was more than double the fy2006 appropriation the omnibus act reduced afci to 1810 million as discussed above according to the doe budget justification afci will develop and demonstrate nuclear fuel cycles that could reduce the longterm hazard of spent nuclear fuel and recover additional energy such technologies would involve separation of plutonium uranium and other longlived radi oactive materials from spent fuel for reuse in nuclear reactor or for transmutation in particle accelerator much of the programs research will focus on separations technolog called urex in wh ich uranium and other elements are chemically removed from dissolved spent fuel leaving mixture of plutonium and other highly radioactive elements pr oponents believe the pro cess is proliferation resistant because further purification would be required to make the plutonium useable for weapons and because its high radioactivity woul d make it difficult to divert or work with fy2008 funding was also to have been us ed for conceptual design work on an advanced fuel cycle facility afcf to provide an engineeringscale demonstration of afci technologies according to the budget jus tification at the sa time industry design teams were to complete conceptual designs for nuclear fuel recycling demonstration facilities to be used for gnep however the omnibus measure specifically rejected funding for development of afcf in fy2008 removing uranium from spent fuel would eliminate most of the volume of spent nuclear fuel that would otherw ise require disposal in deep geologic repository which doe is developing at yucca mountain nevada th urex process also could reduce the heat generated by nuclear waste the major limit on the repositorys capacity by removing cesium and strontium for separate storage nd decay over several hundred years plutonium and other longlived elements would be fissione d in accelerators or fast reactors such as the type under development by the generation iv program to reduce the longterm hazard of nuclear waste even if technically feasible however the economic viability of such waste processing has yet to be determined and it still faces significant opposition

million at present expansion of the reserve is authorized to 1 billion barrels by the ener gy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the fy2008 request from the administration was intended to achieve capacity of 1 billion barrels by adding 115 million barrels of capacity at three ex isting sites and establishing new site in richton mississippi where 160 million barrels of capacity would be created the fy2008 budget request indicated that the administrati on would seek authority at later date to expand the spr to 15 billion barrels and th at planned spending during fy2008 would be start toward that goal the proposal to raise spending significantly to expand the spr was anticipated to be controversial in its report on the b ill hrept 110185 the house committee on appropriations indicated that it did not support expansion of the spr at this time noting an estimate that it would cost 10 billion for crea ting additional capacity and 55 billion to fill and expansion would not be completed til 2027

recommendation of 1635 million the omnibus bill provides 1885 million an increase of 25 million which is directed to be spent to acquire land at new site the explanatory statement on the bill is explicit that the appropriations committees do not support expansion of the spr to 15 billion barrels meanwhile fill of the spr with royaltyinkind rik oil continues to be controversial critics argue that it is inadvisable to add oil to the spr when markets are tight and prices are touching inflationadjusted historic highs and that the additional oil adds little to us energy security supporters of rik fill argue that the f ill rate is too little to have discernible impact on markets and that currently high product pri ces are sustained owing to factors other than crude supply which is more than

expensive cold war relic into smaller more efficient modern complex and allowing longterm savings by phasing out the multiple redundant cold war warhead designs that require maintaining multiple obsolete production technologies the senate appropriations committee stated that the reco mmended funding increase for rrw is to accelerate the planning development and design for comprehensive rrw strategy that improves the reliability longevity and certifiability of existing weapons and their components the conference report emphasize d that rrw must stay within the military requirements of the existing deployed stockpile and must stay within the design parameters validated by past nuclear tests pl 109163 the fy2006 national fense authorization act section 3111 set seven objectives for the rrw program including to increase the reliability safety and s ecurity of the united states nucl ear weapons stockpile and to further reduce the likelihood of the resumpti on of underground nuclear weapons testing for fy2007 the administration requested 277 million for rrw the house appropriations committee linked rrw with restructured smaller and consolidated nuclear weapons complex t he committee s upports th rrw but only if it is part of larger package of more comprehensive w eapons complex reforms it recommended 527 million for rrw but restricted use of th additional 250 million until nnsa delivered an infrastructure plan to congress the committee also directed nnsa to have the jason defense advisory group conduct peer review of competing rrw designs and to analyze the premise of rrw that new warhead can be designed and deployed without nuclear testing the bill as passed by the house left these provisions unchanged also under dsw the committee 1 reduced the 2327 million request for warhead life extension programs by 800 million directed nnsa to terminate the life extension program for the w80 warhead for cruise missiles nd used the funds to support weapons complex transformation and 2 increased funding for warhead dismantlement from 750 million to 1050 million to accelerate that activity the bill as passed by the house left these provisions unchanged the senate appropriations committee supported rrw it f ound the directors of alamos sandia and livermore national labs and the commander us strategic command share the belief that maintaining incremental modifications to the existing and highly optimized legacy systems ie life extension programs leps of warheads now in the stockpile is not sustainable it urges th nnsa to accelerate the tr ansition to responsive infrastructure and to proceed expeditiously w ith the rrw design it noted that dod and the nuclear weapons council longer s upport the w80 lep and provided 100 million for design competition for second rrw in lieu of w80 lep activitie s it recommended 627 million for rrw and reducing funds fo r warhead dismantle ment to 350 million preferring to ensure that facilities for disassembling pits and for fabricating mixedoxide fuel will be built before providing full funding does fy2007 operating plan included 358httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs34 million for rrw 2644 million for life extension programs and 750 million for weapons dismantlement and disposition nnsa requested 888 million for rrw for fy2008 the navy requested an additional 300 million for rrw those funds are in the defense appropr iations bill and are not discussed here nnsa d planned to use the fy2008 rrw funds mainly to develop detailed cost scope and sc hedule baseline for rrw othe r dsw funds requested for fy2008 include 2387 million for life extens ion programs 3467 million for stockpile systems 523 million for weapons dismantle ment and disposition and 7208 million for stockpile services the latter category incl udes for example funds for production support safety and other work supporting multiple wa rhead types or otherwise not linked to one specific warhead the house appropriations committee expresse d extreme dissatisfaction with the rrw program its fy2008 report stated the committee finds the rrw program the dod and nnsa have pursued at the direction of cong ress goes far beyond the scope and purpose of the original congressional language nd intent the committee is unconvinced that pursuing the rrw design competition to pr oduction phase is necessary at this time further particularly troubling issue for the comm ittee related to the rrw proposal is the contradictory us policy position of dema nding other nations give up their nuclear ambitions while the us aggressively pursu program to build new nuclear warheads the administration needs to develop po licy rationale that explains why the rrw program is not contradictory and does not undermine our international nuclear nonproliferation goals as noted above the committee felt it necessary to have the planning sequence described earlier before continuing rrw design activities accordingl it recommended providing funds for rrw for fy2008 the committee recommended providing 13366 million for dsw reduction of 1106 million from the request this refl ects reductions of 888 million for rrw 274 million for stockpile systems because of the termination of w80 warhead activities and 1155 million for stockpile services and an increase of 1210 million for weapons dismantlement and disposition regarding the latter category the committee stated that doe must view dismantlement as priority in and of itself rather than as workload leveling function to fillin for down times in the life extension workload at pantex the committee also recommended transferring nnsas activity to build p it disassembly and conversion facility from the office of defense nuclear nonproliferation to the office of defense programs and directed doe to begin the siting process to build the facility at pantex plant tx rather than at savannah ri ver site sc to avoid security risks in transporting pits from texas to south carolina the senate appropriations committee provided 660 million for nnsa for rrw in order to complete phase 2a as noted earlier it made clear that it was not committed to proceeding with phase 3 but wanted more vigorous analysis and debate first it wanted more information to help with this decision ch as characteristics of the future stockpile the possible effects of rrw on us nuclear nonpr oliferation efforts and comparative costs of rrw vs lep it will be incumbent upon nnsa to provide specific details as to howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs35 many rrw weapons will be manufactured how the department of defense intends to integrate the system into the stockpile nd how many weapons from the existing deterrent can be retired while it r ecommended funds to continue phase 2a work on the first rrw type it barred the use of funds for initial research on second rrw type in other areas of dsw the committee recommended net reduction of 377 million 228 million from rrw and 149 million the entire amount request ed from responsive infrastructure management program to support decisions on the complex it expressed concern with cost growth in the w76 lep and commended doe for recent efforts to increase the rate at which it dismantled nuclear warheads the consolidated appropria tions bill eliminated nnsa f unds for rrw the explanatory statement said congress believe s new strategic nuclear deterrent mission assessment for the 21st century is required to define the associated stockpile requirements and determine the scope of the w eapons complex modernization plans the largest change under dsw was to increase funding for wea pons dismantlement and disposition from 523 million requested to 1359 million the bill also provided funds for the pit disassembly and conversion facility at savannah river site ra ther than at pantex campaigns these are multiyear multifunctional efforts th at provide specialized scientific knowledge nd technical support to the directed stockpile work on the nuclear weapons stockpile the fy2008 request in cludes six campaigns each with multiple components science engineering inertial confinement fusion and high yield advanced simulation and computing pit manufacturing nd certification and r eadiness many items within campaigns have significance for policy decisions as one example the science campaigns goals include improving the ability to assess warhead performance without nuclear testing improving read iness to conduct tests should the need arise and maintaining the scientific infrastructure of the nuclear weapons laboratorie s campaigns also fund some large experimental facilities such as the national ignition facility at lawrence livermore national laboratory the dualaxis radiographic hydrotest facility at alamos national laboratory and the microsystems and engineer ing sciences applicati ons complex at sandia national laboratories nnsas proposal to build modern pit facility mpf had been controversial for years pit is the fissile core of nuclear weapon that is used to trigger thermonuclear explosion the united states has been unable to manufactur pits that can be certified for use in the stockpile since 1989 alamos has small scale pit manufacturing facility called ta55 nnsas plan is that ta55 would be able to manufacture 10 pits per year by the end of fy2007 and 3050 rrw pits per year by fy2012 but nnsa saw that capacity as insufficient to maintain the stockpile and favored building mpf with capacity of perhaps 125 pits per year hr 2419 the fy2006 ener gy and water devel opment appropriations bill as passed by the house eliminated mp f funds until capacity requirements tied to the longterm stockpile size are determined and until the longterm strategy for the physical infrastructure of the weapons complex has incorporated the reliable replacement warhead strategy the bill as passed by the sena provided the amount requested for mpf 77 million the appropriation bill as passed provided funds for mpf conferees on the energy and water bill directed nnsa to focus instead on improving manufacturing capability at ta55 nnsa requested funds for mpf for fy2007 and instead planned to increase capacity at ta55 it requested 2376 million fo r the pit manufacturin g and certification campaign for fy2007 hr 5427 as passed by the house provided that amount

appropriations committee r ecommended providing 1500 million for pit manufacturing and certification for fy 2008 reduction of 1312 million on grounds that the request has funds in multiple lines t hat assume preferre d future programmatic approach that ensures unnecessary expenditure s and lack of accountability it linked pit funding to the strategi c plan discussed above the committee will not continue to fund activities that are not part of clearly articulated facilities strategy until the committee receives new nuclear weapons strategic plan that addresses the future requirements for plutoni um production including specifically how plutonium facilities factor into supporting the future stockpile the committee will not support funding activities that assume modernizationinplace strategy for the current nuclear weapons complex the committee recommendation includes f unds for the consolidated plutonium center proposal the senate appropria tions committee recommended 2563 million for pit manufacturing for fy2008 reduction of 249 million it does not endorse the consolidated plutonium center and has not pr ovided any funding for this activity because dod has been unable to articul ate coherent policy and pit requirement for the stockpile the consolidated appropriations bill pr ovided 2158 million for pit manufacturing and certification it provided funds for the conso lidated plutonium center according to the explanatory statement until modern nuclear weapons strategy including required pit production capacity defined by nuclear stockpile requirements is developed the nnsa is directed to constrain the outyear planning for plutonium operations to pit production capacity greater than 80 pits per year the nnsa admi nistrator is directed to provide quarterly reports to the committees on appropriations on pit production with the first report due on april 1 2008 the appropriate test readiness posture the time between presidential order to resume testing and the conduct of the test has been c ontentious the posture was set at 24 to 36 months after the cold war but nns and others expressed concern that it had become 36 months or more the administration and congress sought to shorten it but there was dispute over how much nnsa and the armed services committees favored an 18 month posture on grounds that it would take that long to prepare test but that any testing should not be delayed beyond that time the appropriations committees favored 24 month posture seeing an 18month posture as provocative and more costly the fy2006 appropriation was 198 million in its fy2007 re quest nnsa stated that it achieved 24 month readiness posture in fy 2005 and planned to maintain th at posture at least through fy2011 it stated that the posture is 18 months

for test r eadiness but plans to request funds for fy2009 the house provided 200 million for test readiness to restor funding to this activity and keep it from being degraded the house appropriations committee stated that it was baffled by the administrations d ecision to elimin ate funding for nuclear test readiness after four budget cycles of insisting that shortening to an 18month test readiness posture was required for national security reasons the senate appropriations committee recommended funds for test readiness th consolidated appropr iations bill provided 50 million for this activity the consolidated appropriations b ill provided 150 million for new campaign advanced certification to be focused very narrowly on addre ssing the longterm scientific issues related to continued certification of the nuclear st ockpile without underground nuclear testing and certain scientific uncertainties the engineering campaign includes the enhanced surveillance program esp which seeks to develop predictive capabilities for early identification and assessment of stockpile aging concerns to give nnsa firm ba sis for determining when systems must be refurbished it is conducting experiments to determine the service life of pits based on plutonium aging characteristics the fy2007 request for esp was 865 m illion the operating plan provided 875 million and the fy2008 request is

enhanced surety and authorized transf er of 100 million for refurbishing an ion beam laboratory at sandia national laboratories according to nnsa the inertial confinement fusion icf and high yield campaign is to develop laboratory capabilities to create and measure extreme conditions approaching those in nuclear explosion and conduct weapons related research in these environments key part of this campaign is the national ignition facility nif at lawrence livermore national laboratory which is already the worlds most powerful laser nnsa plans to complete the nif project by march 30 2010

without any nuclear nonpro liferation benefit accrued to the us taxpayer the committee recommended transferring the mox plant and another project the pit disassembly and convers ion facility pdcf both at savannah river sc to the nuclear energy program and nnsas weapons program respectively in contrast to the house action the senate appr opriations committee recommended 6095 million for the fissile materials disposition program including full funding for the mox plant and the pdcf instructing doe to proceed expeditiously with construction of the two facilitie s and to focus on delivering this

weapons background and issues for congress by david bearden and anthony andrewsand environmental risks vary considerably among indivi dual sites depending on the type and quantity of waste and contamination present at each site and the potential for exposure to wastes and contaminants the adequacy of funding to address h ealth and environmental risks resulting from the past production of nuclear wea pons is longstanding issue doe established the office of environmenta l management in 1989 to consolidate its efforts to administer the cleanup of former nuclear weapons sites these efforts include the disposal of radioactive and other hazardous wastes management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated from such wastes and th decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities through this program doe also administers the disposal of wastes and re mediation of conta mination at sites where the federal government conducted ci vilian nuclear energy researc h altogether there were 114 geographic19 sites in 30 states where these activities resulted in the generation of wastes and contamination some of the ongoing issues associated with the disposal of wastes and the cleanup of contamination have been the adequacy of riskbased approaches to address these needs the technical soundness of waste treatment facility designs how to safely remove treat and dispose of highlevel radioactive waste stored in underground tanks20 the effectiveness and costsavings of incentivebased cleanup contracts and the pace and adequacy of cleanup overall the challenges of the environmental management program to dispose of wastes and clean up contamination are substantial and require significant resources as such this program represents approx imately onefourth of the departments total budget congressional action on fy2008 appropriations the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 provide d total of 575 billion for does environmental manageme nt program however the fi nal funding is subject to two acrosstheboard rescissions somewhat reducing the appropr iation nearly all of the 575 billion is subject to 091 resc ission whereas 175 million of that amount for congressionally designated projects is subject to higher rescission of 16 these rescissions apply to funding not only for the environmental management program but to all doe activities funded in title iii of division c as required by section 312 of that title prior to the fi nal bill the house had proposed higher amount of 621 billion for the environmenta l management progra m and the senate appropriations committee had recommende d 600 billi on the pres ident hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs45 proposed the lowest amount under c onsideration for fy2008 requesting 566 billion for the program congre ss appropriated 619 billion for fy2007 although the house initially had proposed the highest amount for fy2008 nearly 200 million of its increase would not have provided additi onal resources for the program rather this increase was due to the houses proposal to consolidate funding for the office of legacy manage ment with the envi ronmental management program this office has been funded independently under other accounts and is responsible for longterm site care after cleanup is complete under the environmental management program in its initial bill the senate appropriations committee had rejected the houses proposal and r ecommended that the office of legacy management continue to be funded in other acc ounts independent of the environmental management program taking this accounting difference into consideration the house and the senate appropria tions committee had recommended similar levels of funding for the environm ental management program as whole in the final bill congress followed the approach of the senate appropriations committee and did not conso lidate funding for these two functions see the office of legacy management section later in this report the fy2008 enacted appropriation of 575 b illion prior to rescissions for the environmental management program is significantly less than the 619 billion that congress appropriated for fy 2007 however this difference in total funding is largely because of 4257 million decrease in funds for accelerat ed closure sites where all planned cleanup actions ar complete under the environmental management program these sites incl ude rocky flats co fernald oh and several other defense sites congress had increased funding at these sites for several years to speed the pace of cleanup these sites were suitable for accelerated cleanup because the challenges were more technically feasible to address than those at more complex sites now that most of the work is completed at some sites and nearing completion at others there has been corresponding downward trend in funding as these needs have diminished although doe has accomplished much in accelerating cleanup at the above sites substantial challenges remain at many other site s where cleanup is not complete and large quantities of wastes and contamination are still present for these and other pending sites there are varying decreases and increases in funding when comparing the appropriation enacted for fy2008 to th initial recommendations of the house and the senate appr opriations committee the presid ents fy2008 request and the appropriation for the prior year in fy2007 see table 14 these differences in funding are due to differing priorities among other competing needs within the federal budget opposing views on the adequ acy of funding to meet cleanup needs and varying factors at individual sites ch as the technical complexity of cleanup the prioritization of remedial actions based on health and environmental risks scheduling of actions to meet time frames in regulatory agreements and numerous other considerations the hanford site is the largest and mo st complex site administered under the environmental manageme nt program this site alone represents about onethird of the funding for the entire program the adequacy of funding to clean up hanford has been particularly cont roversial for many reasons including potential risks fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs46 radioactive contamination migrating through groundwater into the columbia river and the delayed construction of the waste treatment and immobilization plant this facility is key element in does plans to treat the substantial volume of highlevel radioactive waste to be removed from the underground tanks at hanford and to solidify that waste for permanent disposal in geologic repository this task is one of the more costly cleanup challe nges across the complex of sites various engineering and design issues have delayed constr uction of the waste treatment and immobilization plant at nford the president had requested 6900 million for the construction of this facility in fy2008 the same amount as congress appropriated in fy2007 the reque st also included 2734 million for the management of the wastes still stored in the underground tanks slightly less than the fy2007 appropriation of 2771 million prior to rescissions the appropriation enacted for fy2008 incl uded 6900 million for the construction of the waste treatment plant and 2884 million for ma naging the tank wastes while the construction of the plant continues the house initially had proposed 5900 milli on for the waste treatment plant and the same amount as the president request ed for managing the tank wastes in its initial report the house ppropriations committee had indicated that its proposed lower funding for the plant could ve been augmented with 1000 million in uncosted balances carried over from fy2007 because of slow construction progress raising the total available to the presidents request of 6900 million the senate appropriations committee had recommended the full request for the waste treatment plant without the use of thes uncosted balances and had recommended higher amount of 3260 million for managing the tank wastes table 14 indicates appropriations

completion date for activities of the richland office is 2035 and the projected completion date for activities of the office of river protection is 2042 the primary purpose of this latter office is to remove treat and dispose of highlevel radioactive waste stored in underground tanks near the columbia river 23 doe uses the term end state to denot the intended condition or land use of contaminated site once cleanup is complete determining the end state is critical to making cleanup decisions as the degree of cleanup re quired and the specific action to achieve that degree of cleanup are dependent on the potentia l pathways of human exposure that would occur as result of how the land will be used in the future land uses resulting in greater potential for human exposure generally require greater degree of cleanup 24 doe performance and accountability report for fy2006 doecf0012 pp 173175these needs accordingly there has been much debate about how to ensure public health and safety and the pr otection of the environment in the most expedient and costeffective manner doe reports that it had cleaned up 81 of the 114 geographic sites as of the end of fy200621 although doe has disposed of substantial quantities of waste and remediated many areas of c ontamination at the remaining sites much work remains to be done to complete cleanup at many of them doe expects to complete cleanup at certain sites within the next few years however the department anticipates clea nup to continue for decades at the larger and more complex sites such as nford savannah rive r and the idaho national laboratory where highlevel radioactive waste is in need of treatment and disposal and soil and groundwater contamination ar generally more severe based on recent assumptions doe expects cleanup and disposal of wastes to be complete at savannah river in 2031 at the idaho national laborator in 2035 and at hanford in 204222 accurately assessing the time and funding needed to complete cleanup and dispose of all radioactive nd other hazardous wastes is difficult at best developing reliable estimates is especially challenging for the larger more complex sites where many final decisions have yet to be made because of technical limitations and uncertainties such as the end state23 of many sites doe periodically revises its estimates of outstanding costs to complete cleanup and dispose of wastes as individual project baselines and assumptions change these estimates have varied widely over time by many billions of dollars doe reports its financial liabilities for the environmental management progra m and all of its other program responsibilities in its annual financial statements cont ained in the departments performance and accountability reports does most recent performance and accountability report for fy200 6 estimated that 159 billion would be needed to complete cleanup and dispose of wastes at the remaining s ites administered under does environmental management prog ram the 159 billion estimate is in fy2006 dollars and doe notes that future inflation could cause actual costs to be substantially higher than the recorded liability24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs50 25 ibid 26 ibid 27 ibid 28 when there is continuing mission longterm site care is transferred to the program office within doe responsible for administering that mission or is the landlord of the site 29 likewise at sites with continuing ssion payment of pensions and postretirement benefits is assigned to the program office w ithin doe that is responsible for administering that mission or is the landlord of the site rather than the office of legacy managementin addition to inflation other factors could cause actual costs to exceed the 159 billion estimate for example actual costs could be higher than expected depending on whether federal and state regulators may require more stringent and costlier cleanup actions than doe plans to ta ke costs also could rise if in itial cleanup actions prove inadequate to protect human health and th environment over the long term future performance of cleanup actions is especially critical for nuclear waste sites because of the rate of decay of radi oactivity which can be thousands of years depending on the particular radionuclide predicting the effectiveness of methods to contain radioactive wastes over such long periods of time is challenging if not impracticable in some cases consequen tly additional funding could be needed at sites where cleanup was thought to be complete if the initial cleanup proves inadequate over time does 159 billion estimate also does not include the costs of longterm care of sites once wastes are disposed of and cl eanup remedies are in place to ensure the protection of human health and the nvironment into the future does performance and accountability report for fy2006 estimated that as of the end of fy2006 18 billion would be needed for cleanup and pos tclosure site res ponsibilities after work under the environmental manage ment program is completed25 t h s responsibilities include surve illance and monitoring longterm operation and maintenance of soil and groundwater clea nup remedies and disposal of excess materials remaining onsite after closeout under the environmental management program doe estimated that this 18 b illion cost would be incurred over 75 years through fy208126 doe expects some longterm site care to be needed beyond this time requiring additional fundi ng however the departme nt believes that costs beyond 75 years cannot reasonably be timated because of certainties inherent to such distant time frames27 funding for longterm s ite care and other related responsibilities at these site s is discussed below longterm site care once site is cleaned up and there is continuing doe mission responsibility for longterm care of the site is transferred to does office of legacy management28 this office also manages the payment of pensions and postretirement benefits of former c ontractor personnel who worked at these sites29 as indicated in table 15 congress appropriate d total of 1906 million prior to rescissions for the office of legacy management in fy2008 of this amount 1564 million was allocated to defense sites and 342 million was allocated to nondefense sites the house in itially had agreed to the presidents total request of 1942 million for the office of leg acy management while the senate hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34009crs51 recommended slightly higher amount of 1947 million all of these amounts are large increase above the 641 million th at congress appropriated for fy2007 as discussed earlier the house had r ecommended consolidating the funding for the office of legacy management with the environmental ma nagement program in its initial report the house appropriations committee had noted its expectation that the office of legacy management continue to operate as separate office within the environmental management program the effect of this proposed consolidation would appear to have been shift in f unds among accounts rather than change in the offices administration or function the senate appropr iations committee had not recommended this change in accounting but had proposed funding within the existing account structure as was adopted in the enacted bill but in slightly lower amount although the appropriation enacted for fy2008 is somewhat less than the president requested and the house and the senate appropriations committee had proposed the enacted amount is s till 1265 million increase above the fy2007 appropriation the reason for such subs tantial increase is primarily because of greater funding needs for longterm care and pension and post retirement benefits at defense sites transferred from the environmental management program after physical cleanup is complete as more sites are transferred upon the completion of cleanup in
