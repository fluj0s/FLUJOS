notable feature of presidential transitions and testament to the legitimacy and durability of the electoral and democratic processes yet at the same time variety of events decisions and activities contribute to what some may characterize as the unfolding drama of presidential transition interparty transitions in particular might be contentious using the various powers available sitting president might use the transition period to attempt to secure his legacy or effect policy changes some observers have suggested that if the incumbent has lost the election he might try to enact policies in the waning months of his presidency that would tie his successors hands on the other hand presidentelect eager to establish his policy agenda and populate his administration with his appointees will be involved in host of decisions and activities some of which might modify or overturn the previous administrations actions or decisions both the incumbent and the newly elected president can act unilaterally through executive orders recess appointments and appointments to positions that do not require senate confirmation additionally president can appoint individuals to positions that require senate confirmation and presidential administration can influence the pace and substance of agency rulemaking the disposition of government records including presidential records and vice presidential records the practice of burrowing in which involves the conversion of political appointees to career status in the civil service and the granting of pardons are three activities associated largely with the outgoing presidents administration the incumbent president may also submit budget to congress or he may defer to his successor on this matter in light of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 national security is an overarching issue for presidential transitions and national security concerns may be heightened during the transfer of power from the sitting president to his successor depending upon the particular activity or function the extent and type of congresss involvement in presidential transitions may vary as an example of direct involvement the senate confirms the presidents appointees to certain positions on the other hand congress is not involved in the issuance of executive orders but it may exercise oversight or take some other action regarding the administrations activities this report will be updated as events warrant

administrative and symbolic event in american politics presidential transitions can be notable for the smooth and orderly transfer of power from an incumbent administration to the next president and shift in focusfrom campaigning to governingby the incoming administration yet as william galston and elaine kamarck point out the peaceful transfer of power from one president to the next is an enduring and gripping drama of american democracy 1 variety of events and actions contribute to the unfolding drama of presidential transition for sitting president who is not reelected and barring any electoral disputes or is serving second term election day marks the beginning of the end of his presidency while some commentators would argue that lame duck president can accomplish little during the 11 weeks between election day and inauguration day william g howell and kenneth r mayer offer an alternative perspective portraits of outgoing presidents going quietly into the night overlook an important feature of american politics and of executive powernamely the presidents ab ility to unilaterally set public policy using executive orders pr oclamations executive agreements national security directives memoranda and other directives presidents have at their disposal wide variety of means to effectuate lasting and substantive policy changes both foreign and domestic 2 howell and mayer also note that an outgoing presidents level of activity during his final months in office is influenced by the party of his successor an outgoing president whose successor is from the same political party has little cause to hurry through slew of lastminute directives3 when the opposing party is poised to regain co ntrol of the white house however the sitting president might exercise these powers with exceptional zeal making final impressions on public policy in the short time available before inauguration day4 moreover the incumbent might use the transition period to enact policies and effect changes that might stymie his successor 1 william galston and elaine ciulla kamarck the transition reasserting presidential leadership in mandate for change ed will marshall and martin schram new york berkley books 1993 p 336 2 william g howell and kenneth r mayer the last one hundred days presidential studies quarterly vol 35 2005 p 537 notable examples of lastminute presidential actions include the following it was president john adamss midnight appointments which his successor thomas jefferson refused to honor that prompted the landmark marbury v madison supreme court decision grover clevela nd created twentyonemillionacre forest reserve to prevent logging an act that lead to an unsuccessful impeachment attempt and the passage of legislation annulling the action then in response to the congressional uprising cleveland issued pocket veto and left office jimmy carter negotiated for the release of americans held hostage in tehran implementing an agreement on his last day in office with ten separate executive orders many of which sharply restricted the rights of private parties to sue the iranian government for expropriation of their property in late december 1992 george bush pardoned six reagan administration officials who were involved in the irancontra scandal step that ended independent counsel lawrence walshs criminal investigation in single stroke mr bush swept away one conviction three guilty pleas and two pending cases virtually decapitating what was left of mr walshs effort which began in 1986 during his final days in office clinton

presidential administration political uncertainty shifts to political certitude the president knows exactly who will succeed hi mhis policy positions his legislative priorities and the level of partisan support he will enjoy within the new congress and if the sitting president or his party lost the election he has every reason to hurry through lastminute public policies doing whatever possible to tie his successors hands 5 during the 20th and 21st centuries and beginning with theodore roosevelt who took office in 1901 there have been 17 presidential transitions 10 of which were interparty transitions woodrow wilson warren g harding franklin d roosevelt dwight d eisenhower john f kennedy richard m nixon jimmy carter ronald w reagan william j clinton and george w bush regardless of an incumbent presidents intentions however his decisions and actions in several areasas well as the activities of his administrationcould affect his successor and could be cause for congressional concern acting unilaterally president can issue executive orders appoint individuals to positions that do not require senate confirmation pa positions and make recess appointments additionally the president can appoint individuals to positions which require senate approval pas positions the administration can influence the pace of agency rulemaking significant decisions regarding presidential and vice presidential records may be made and some political appointees might be converted to civil service positions in practice known as burrowing in depending upon the timing frequency content in the case of executive orders and regulations and other salient features of certain presidential or administration actions or decisions some may question the propriety of an outgoing administrati ons actions during the presidential transition period certain decisions or actions could affect the incoming president forcing him to choose between accepting objectional policies as law or paying steep political price for trying to change them 6 in addition to the possibility of having to address certain actions taken by the outgoing administration new president and his staff have to deal with the challenges of moving from campaign to governing stance which can include handling the issues of staffing management agenda setting and policy formulation 7 eager to hit the ground running an incoming president can use the same tools his predecessor did during the transition periodfor example executive orders agency rulemaking and political appointmentsto establish his policy agenda populate the executive branch with his appointees and possibly overturn or modify some of his predecessors policies and actions if the sitting president defers to his successor regarding the submission of budget this is an additional task for the newly elected president alternatively if the incumbent submits budget his successor may revise it the significance of the transition period for the presidentelect cannot be overstated since the 5 ibid p 533 on the other hand the incumbent administration might be significant resource for the presidentelect and his team one of the most important transition oppor tunities an incoming president and his team has is the outgoing administration they are source of valuable information on personnel positions and can be used

the actions that presidentselect undertake before inauguration day have been seen by scholars journalists other observers and even presidents themselves as critical in determining their successesand failuresonce in office8 the congress has role to play in presidential transitions though the extent and type of its involvement varies it is most directly involved in the confirmation of presidential appointees that is individuals appointed to pas positions the budget process and under certain circumstances agency rulemaking other administration activities such as the issuance of executive orders the disposition of presidential records and vice presidential records and the granting of pardons may be of interest to congress and in some cases might become the subject of congressional oversight or other congressional action even the practice of burrowing in some would suggest might warrant congressional interest finally an overarching issue for presidential transitions in light of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and continued concerns about terrorism is national security while this is an ongoing issue for the nation national security concerns might be heightened during

regulation like taxing and spending is one of the basic tools of government used to implement public policy regulations generally start with an act of congress and are the means by which statutes are implemented and specific requirements are established federal agencies issue more than 4000 final rules each year on topics ranging from the timing of bridge openings to the amount of arsenic and other contaminants that is permitted in drinking water the off budget costs and benefits associated with all federal regulations have been subject of great controversy some have estimated those regulatory costs as more than trillion dollarsgreater than all federal domestic discretionary spending estimates of the benefits of federal regulations are even higher 9

that subsequent administration can change or eliminate the rule is by going back through the often lengthy rulemaking processes that are required by the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq and various other statutes and executive orders12 when there has been change in party control of the presidency recent incoming presidents have responded to this phenomenon by stopping or delaying new agency rulemaking and by attempting to reverse certain rules for example few weeks after he took office president reagan issued executive order 12291 which among other things generally required covered agencies to suspend or postpone the effective dates of all major rules that they have promulgated in final form as of the date of this order but that have not yet become effective 13 president clinton also imposed moratorium on rules issued at the end of the first bush administration as discussed below the current bush administration delayed the implementation of many rules issued in the last months of the clinton administration and ultimately reduced the number that took effect it has also attempted to protect rules issued in its own last months from the possibility of similarly being rendered ineffective by establishing an effective date prior to the advent of the new administration g5g138g155g141g561g15g142g150g152g155g138g151g141g158g150g561 during the final months of the clinton administra tion federal agencies issued hundreds of final rules many of which were expected to have substantial impact on regulated entities in response to this action on january 20 2001 the chief of staf f and assistant to the new president andrew h card jr sent memorandum to the heads of all executive departments and agencies generally directing them to 1 not send proposed or final regulations to the office of the federal register ofr 2 withdraw regulations that had been sent to the ofr but not published in the federal register and 3 postpone for 60 days the effective date of regulations that had been published in the federal register but had not yet taken effect 14 the memorandum cited the desire to ensure that the presidents appointees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations in 2002 gao reported that 90 final rules had their effective dates delayed as result of the card memorandum and 15 rules still had not taken effect one year after the memorandum was issued15 continued roth after midnight the durability of the midnigh t regulations passed by the two previous outgoing administrations wake forest law review vol 40 2005 pp 14411465 11

the bush administration has also taken action in anticipation of possible midnight rules at the end of the current presidents term on may 9 2008 white house chief of staff joshua b bolten issued memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies stating that the administration needed to resist the historical tendency of administrations to increase regulatory activity in their final months therefore bolten said that except in extraordinary circumstances regulations to be finalized in this administration should be proposed later than june 1 2008 and final regulations should be issued later than november 1 2008 16 he also said that the administrator of the office of info rmation and regulatory affairs oira within the office of management and budg et would coordinate an effort to complete administration priorities in this final year and the oira administrator would report on regular basis regarding agency compliance with this memorandum17

review act cra 5 usc 801808 requires federal agencies to submit all of their final rules to both houses of congress and the government accountability office gao before they can take effect and also delays the effective date of major rules eg those with 100 million impact on the economy until 60 calendar days after submission and publication 18 under this requirement any regulation published in the federal register in accordance with the bolten memorandum by november 1 2008 will have taken effect before the 111th congress begins and the next president takes office in january 2009 as result the bolten memorandum may also have the effect of preventing the next presidential administration from doing what was done via the card memorandumforestalling the implementation of rules published during the previous administration by laying their effective dates or withdrawing them before they can take effect however even if they have taken effect many rules submitted before the bolten memorandum deadline will be subject to congressional disapproval in the 111 th congress19 the cra established special set of expedited or fast track legislative procedures primarily in the senate through which congress may enact joint resolutions disapproving agencies final rules although the general powers of congress permit it to overturn agency rules by legislation the cra is unique in permitting the use of expedited procedures for this purpose if rule is disapproved through the cra procedures the act specifies not only that the rule shall not take 16 between june 1 and august 8

that the rule may not be reissued in substantially similar form without subsequent statutory authorization once rule has been submitted to congress members have 60 days of continuous session to introduce resolution of disapproval20 the cra also provides that if congress adjourns its annual session sine die less than 60 legislative days house of representatives or session days senate after rule is submitted to it then the rule is carried over to the next session of congress and treated as if it had been published in the federal register on the 15 th legislative or session day after congress reconvenes21 the purpose of this provision is to ensure that both houses of congress have sufficient time to consider disapproving rules submitted during this end ofsession carryover period in any given year the carryover period begins after the 60th legislative day in the house or session day in the senate before the sine die adjournment whichever date is earlier the renewal of the cra process in the following session occurs even if resolution to disapprove the rule had been introduced during the session when the rule was submitted although the exact starting point for the cra carryover period in the second session of the 110th congress can be determined only after sine die adjournment has taken place the likely date or range of dates may be illuminated by examining congressional activity in prior years across all sessions of congress since the cra was enacted in 1996 the second session of the 104th congress the starting point for the carryover period was always determined by the schedule of the house of representatives and was always earlier in the second session of congress ie during election years than in the first session in those second sessions of congress the starting points ranged from may 12 to june 23 with the dian starting point being june 7 ie half occurring before half after if congress follows this general pattern in the second session of the 110th congress the data suggest that any final rule submitted to congress after june 2008 may be carried over to the first session of the 111th congress and may be subject to resolution of disapproval during that session however the starting point for the carryover period could slip to late september or early october if an unprecedented level of congressional activity occurs late in the session even without the cra though congress can st op agency rulemaking in other ways for example each year congress includes provisions in appropriations legislation prohibiting rulemaking within particular policy areas preventing particular proposed rules from becoming final and prohibiting or affecting the implementation or enforcement of rules22 however unlike disapprovals under the cra the regulatory requirements that have been put into effect are not rescinded and the agency is not prohibited from issuing substantially similar regulation in the future 20 days of continuous session includes all calendar days except those in which either house of congress is adjourned for more than three days during session 21 legislative days end each time chamber adjourns and begin each time it convenes after an adjournment session days include only calendar days on which chamber is in session 22 crs report rl34354 congressional influence on rulemaking and regulation through appropriations

authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the united states the general term for this authority is executive clemency of which the more commonly used term presidential pardon is but one form executive clemency may also take the form of commutation which is the reduction of prison sentence remission which is the reduction of fine or mandated restitution or reprieve which delays the imposition of punishment 23 the president has few restrictions on how and when executive clemency may be exercised other than it may only apply to violations of federal lawsthereby precluding state criminal or civil proceedings from its scopeand it may not be used to interfere with the congresss power to impeach 24 clemency in the form of pardon for example may be granted at any time even before charges have been filed25 in addition while not frequently done president may bestow clemency on groups as president lincoln did when he issued pardon to all persons who participated in the rebellion against the united states with number of conditions and exceptions26 the presidents use of this broad authority may come under increased scrutiny during period of transition in part because presidents have historically granted petitions for clemency at higher rate in the closing months of their administrations table 1 shows that since 1945 every president that completed his term of office except president johnson increased the rate at which he granted clemency in the final four months of hi s administration when compared to his previous months in office t able 1 average

concerns about the volume timing and content of executive orders may be heightened during presidential transitions particularly during the months leading up to the inauguration the perception if not necessarily the reality exists that an outgoing presidents inclination to act unilaterally increases during the transition period presidents decision to use executive orders may be based on practical political or personal reasons or any combination thereof executive orders are significant vehicle for unilateral action by the president they have the force and effect of lawunless voided or revoked by congressional presidential or judicial actionand they combine the highest levels of substance discretion and direct presidential involvement 30 being able to act unilaterally enables president to establish control over policymaking presidents are sometimes aided in this endeavor by the proliferation and ambiguity of statutes which increase their opportunities for justifying presidential action31 another appealing feature of executive orders is that they allow presidents to act quickly forcefully and if they like with advance notice32 capitalizing on these features enables presidents to seize the initiative on an issue shape the national agenda and force others to respond for practical or political reasons presidents may choose to use executive orders to circumvent congress that they perceive as hostile to their policies after considering whether the congress is likely to overturn particular executive order33 or as moving too slowly34 executive orders suit the needs of an outgoing president who wants to establish or change policy or is striving to secure his legacy howell and mayer have noted that when presidents successor belongs to the opposition political party he has every reason to hurry through last minute public policies doing whatever possible to tie his successors hands35 an outgoing presidents use of unilateral directives such as executive orders might be greeted with criticism from some quarters some scholars note that the directives lack the sort of legitimacy that preelection activity has because by definition they are issued after president and in many cases his party has been repudiated at the polls moreover there are opportunities for democratic 29 keith koffler stevens case puts spotlight on pardons roll call newspaper online oct 28 2008

to express their approval or disapproval36 an incoming president who is eager to act quickly on his policy agenda seeking to modify or overturn certain of his predecessors actions or distinguish himself from his predecessor particularly when they are from different parties would find executive orders an effective way to accomplish these objectives37 he might be stymied though in his efforts to amend his predecessors actions occasionally presidents cannot alter orders set by their predecessors without paying considerable political price undermining the nations credibility or confronting

the preelection period the lame duck period shows the greatest variation reagan and bush issued comparable numbers of executive orders 12 and 14 respectively clinton issued 22 and carter issued 3640 however nearly onethird of the executive orders president carter signed at the end of his term had to do with the hostage crisis in iran study that examined executive orders issued between april 1936 and december 1995 found that while the start of new presidents term does not result in higher number of executive orders the end of presidents term is notable for an increase in the quantity of executive orders issued41 presidents who were succeeded by member of the other party signed nearly six additional orders in the last month of their term nearly double the average level42 when party control of the white house did not change following presidential election there was corresponding increase in order frequency43 the author of this study asserts that these data are evidence that executive orders have strong policy component as otherwise presidents would have little reason to issue such lastminute orders mayer also found that reelection plays role in the number of executive orders signed and issued presidents who are running for reelection issue approximately 14 more executive orders per month14 during campaign season from january 1 through the end of octoberthan when they are not running for reelection 44 40 the quantity of orders president carter signed during the preelection and lame duck periods is consistent with the pace he maintained throughout his fouryear

particular concern for the 2008 transition are electronic records countless federal records are being lost to posterity by one recent account because federal employees grappling with staggering growth in electronic records do not regularly preserve the documents they create on government computers send by email and post on the web 53 while the transition does not contribute to this development it has increased awareness of the situation many federal officials are reportedly saying they are unsure what electronic materials they are supposed to preserve this confusion is causing alarm among historians archivists librarians congressional investigators and watchdog groups that want to trace the decisionmaking process and hold federal officials accountable with the imminent change in administrations the concern about lost records has become more acute 54 the washington representative of the american association of law librarians whose members are major users of government records

the president in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional statutory or other official or ceremonial duties of the president 60 the statute states nothing in this act shall be construed to confirm limit or expand any constitutionallybased privilege which may be available to an incumbent or former president61 this provision constituted recognition of the presidents historical constitutionally based privilege to exercise discretion regarding the provision of information sought by another coequal branch of the federal governmentthe socalled executive privilege 62 on november 1 2001 president george w bush issued eo 13233 which among other interpretations offered an expansive basis for the invoking of executive privilege by the incumbent president or former president the vice president or former vice president or representative or group of representatives acting on behalf of former president63 the order also reversed the challenge procedure set out in the statute by forcing persons seeking access to the records of former president to bring lawsuit to overcome claim of executive privilege instead of requiring the former president who is claiming the privilege to obtain judicial concurrence attempts in the 107 th and 110th congresses to overturn the controversial order through remedial legislation were not successful the orders application of the presidential records act to the executive records of the vice president among other concerns prompted group of historians and open government advocates to file lawsuit in early september 2008 asking federal court to declare the records of vice president richard cheney to be subject to the requirements of the act and preventing their destruction removal or withholding without proper review in response spokesman for the vice president said the office of the vice president currently follows the presidential records act and will continue to follow the requirements of the law which includes turning over vice presidential records to the national archives at the end of the term 64 on september 20 federal judge in response to the

necessarily indicate that the act was committed to test the newly elected presidents decisionmaking ability the timing of such acts may be solely based on the convergence of an entity attaining

the presidentelects nominated senior leadership team regardless of the level of involvement in the presidential transition desired by the incoming and outgoing administrations congressional leaders

been sworn in two weeks prior to the presidential inauguration some analysts see this as the ideal time for the new congress to meet with the incoming presidents national security leadership team and establish foundation to allow for expedited confirmation hearings soon after the president takes the oath of office as noted by recommendation of the 911 commission report of 200480 since catastrophic attack could occur with little or notice the federal government should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments we 911 commission think the process could be improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to

these nominations within 30 days of submission by the newly elected president in undertaking this responsibility many security observers see healthy tension between congress desire to act quickly to hold confirmation hearings and the need to ensure that individuals with the relevant national security background and experience have been put forth by the presidentelect in many cases highly qualified career senior executive service personnel will be in an acting capacity for some of these senate confirmed positions thus the perceived urgency to fill these positions quickly may be negated while congress ensures individuals capable of meeting the demands of the position are selected and confirmed congress may also work with the new administration to understand its national security priorities and where applicable have the changes in policies and programs reflected in the 2010 budget quickly assign new and existing members of congress to committees focusing on national security issues to allow these individuals to receive briefings and understand the issues for which they have oversight hold hearings comprised of national security experts to gather ideas on prospective us

york university who has studied appointees over the past several administrations reportedly believes that the pay benefits and job security of career positions underlie the desire of individuals in noncareer positions to burrow in 87 beyond the fundamental concern that the conversion of an individual from an appointed noncareer position to career position may not have followed the legal and regulatory requirements burrowing in raises other concerns when the practice occurs there may be these perceptions whether valid or not that an appointee converting to career position may limit the opportunity for other employees who were competitively selected for their career positions following examination of their knowledge skills and experience to be promoted into another career position with greater responsibility and pay or that the individual who is converted to career position may seek to undermine the work of the new administration whose policies may be at odds with those that he or she espoused when serving in the appointed capacity both perceptions may increase the tension between noncareer and career staff thereby hindering the effective operation of government at time when the desirability of creating common ground between these staff to facilitate government performance has been emphasized 88 appointments to career positions in the executive branch are governed by law

appointments and compensation for federal employees gaos oversight focuses on review after the fact of conversions from noncareer to career positions the agency has begun to collect data from executive branch departments and agencies on such conversions that have occurred since its last evaluation was published in may 2006 the results of that audit covered the period may 2001 through april 2005 and provide the most current retrospective data the evaluation found that of 130 conversions at gs12 or higher for 37 of these conversions it appears that agencies did not follow proper procedures or agencies did not provide enough information for us to make an assessment for 18 of the 37 of these conversions it appears that agencies did not follow proper procedures some of the apparent improper procedures included selecting former noncareer appointees who appeared to have limited qualifications and experience for career positions creating career positions specifically for particular individuals and failing to apply veterans preference in the selection process 93 as part of its oversight of government operations congress also monitors conversions in the 110th congress staffing at the departments of homeland security dhs and justice doj has been of particular interest especially in the wake of the leadership and management deficiencies at dhs during and after hurricane katrina and improper procedures used by doj staff in selecting and removing united states attorneys94 both departments received letters from members of congress reminding them to exam ine conversions the chairman of the house committee on homeland security representative bennie thompson wrote to the dhs secretary in february 2008 and senators dianne feinstein and charles schumer members of the senate committee on the judiciary wrote to the attorney general in july 2008 about this issue in assessing the current situation congress may decide that the existing oversight is sufficient if congress determines that additional measures are needed to further ensure that conversions from appointed noncareer positions to career positions are conducted according to proper procedures and transparent congress could direct opm and the departments and agencies to include information on conversions in the annual performance plans that accompany the submission of their budget justifications to the hill each february the government accountability office and opm could jointly explore options that would result in their recommending and taking respectively any remedial actions that are necessary to address improper conversions promptly opm also could be directed by congress to report on whether any changes are needed in the time continued 92 us office of personnel

certain circumstances outgoing presidents have used the constitutional authority of the office to make recess appointments that lasted into the succeeding presidency

in general the president and the senate share th power to fill the top nonelected offices of the united states government as part of its system of checks and balances the constitution provides general framework for appointments to these positions the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments 95 in practice the appointment process has three phases 1 the president selects vets and nominates an individual with or without input from senators 2 the senate considers the nomination with or without further action and 3 if the nomination is confirmed by the senate the president signs commission and the appointee is sworn in the constitution also empowers the president unil aterally to make temporary appointment to such position if it is vacant and the senate is in recess96 such an appointment termed recess appointment expires at the end of the following session of the senate97 at the longest recess appointment made in early january after the begi nning of new session of the senate would last until the senate adjourns sine die at the end of the following year period that could be nearly two years in duration 95 art ii 2 cl 2 96 article 2 2 clause 3 reads the president shall ve power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session 97 each

unless otherwise specified in law appointees to executive branch positions usually serve at the pleasure of the president that is they serve for an indeterminate period of time and can be removed by the president at any time for any reason or stated reason98 by tradition appointees to these positions usually step down when the appointing president leaves office unless asked to stay by the presidentelect congress has periodically elected to set specific term of office for particular position restrict the presidents power of removal for particular position or both some removal restriction provisions require only that the president inform congress of his reasons for removing an official while others require that certain threshold such as neglect of duty or malfeasance in office or for other good cause shown be met99 the use of fixed terms and removal restrictions has been more common for positions on regulatory and other boards and commissions for which congress has elected to establish greater level of independence from the president than for positions in executive departments and agencies100 an appointee to position with fixed term and protection from removal may serve during more than one presidency he or she is not required to step down when the appointing president leaves office and the incoming president may not remove him or her unless the grounds for such removal would meet the threshold established in statute an appointee to position with fixed term but specified protection from removal may be protected from removal nonetheless based on case law 101 even where an appointee to such position is not protected from removal it could be argued that the fixed term establishes the expectation that the incumbent will be able to serve for certain period however removal of such an appointee by the incoming president might entail the expenditure of more political capital than would otherwise be required under the constitution most federal judgesthose appointed under article iiihold their offices during good behaviour102 and this is generally understood to confer lifetime tenure consequently although they like the executive branch officials discussed above are appointed to their offices by the president with the advice and consent of the senate they are not subject to 98 it has long been recognized that the power of removal is incident to the power of appointment ex parte hennen 38 us 13 pet 230 259 1839 99 there appears to be standard clarifying under what circumstances the thresholds set by these statutory terms regarding removal might be met see marshall j breger and gary j edles established by practice the theory and operation of independent federal agencies administrative law review vol 52 2000 p 1111 at pp 11441145 senate committee has asserted however that removal for good cause must be based on some type of misconduct as opposed to the refusal to carry out presidential order see us congress senate committee on governmental affairs independent counsel reauthorization act of 1987 report to accompany s 1293 100 th cong 1st sesssrept 100123 washington gpo 1987 pp 1213 100 although fixed terms and removal protections for departme nt and agency positions are unusual notable examples do exist the position of commissioner of social security for example has sixyear term and an individual serving in the office of commissioner may be removed from office only pursuant to finding by the president of neglect of duty or malfeasance in office 42 usc 902a 101 see for example sec v blinder robinson co inc 855 f2d 677 681 10th cir 1988 in which the court of appeals for the tenth circuit stated that it is commonly understood that the president may remove commissioner only for inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance in office 102 article iii 1

outgoing presidents have made recess appointments during their final months in office to each of the kinds of positions described above the potential tenure for recess appointees to positions without removal protections is the same as it would be if the appointee had been confirmed by the senate they typically leave with the appointing president recess appointees to positions with fixed terms and removal protection however may serve until the expiration of the term to which they were appointed or the expiration of the recess appointment whichever occurs earlier 104 recess appointees to article iii judgeships ma serve until the expiration of the recess appointment105 president could at the end of his presidency use recess appointment to bypass the senate and fill fixedterm position or federal judgeship for period that would outlast his time in office by year or more as noted above even an appointee without explicit statutory removal protection might prove difficult or costly for an incoming president to remove in some cases recess appointees who serve past the end of an administration might be consensus appointees who have the support of the incoming president and the reconstituted senate in other cases however an outgoing president could install more controversial appointees who would not be nominated by the new president or confirmed by the reconstituted senate to the positions to which they are appointed it could be argued that the outgoing president carries the full constitutional authority of the office until his term is over that he must be able to exercise that authority as he sees fit and that he should not be expected to abstain from implementing his agenda until he l eaves office furthermore it might be argued other recent presidents have made recess appointments in their final months in office and some of these recess appointments have been to positions with terms that carry over into the following presidency counter argument might be made that in making recess appointments to fixed term positions with removal protections an outgoing president would be effectively circumventing the senate and undermining the incoming president

beginning in the fall of 2007 the senate has used parliamentary procedures to prevent the occurrence of recess during which the president might make recess appointments such procedures if employed during the final months of presidency might prevent the president from exercising the authority in the manner described above 103 see crs report rl32935 congressional oversight of judges and justices by elizabeth b bazan and morton rosenberg section v impeachment 104 as previously noted recess appointment can last for as much as nearly two years full fixed term is usually of longer duration but sometimes individuals are appointed to the final portion of an unexpired term that is already under way eg the final year of five year term begun by another appointee 105 recess appointments to article iii judgeships though not uncommon historically have become rare and controversial in recent decades see crs report rl32971 judicial recess appointments legal overview by t j halstead president william j clinton made one such appointment less than month before he left office on december 27 2000 as of november 24 2008 president george w bush had made two recess appointments to
