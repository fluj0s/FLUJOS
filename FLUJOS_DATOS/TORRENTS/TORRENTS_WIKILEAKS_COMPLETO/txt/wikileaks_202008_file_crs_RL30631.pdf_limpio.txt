social security the member pays 80 of salary for the rest of the year to csrs during retirement the individuals csrs pension is reduced by the amount of the so cial security benefit that is attributable to his or her federal service the reduction in the csrs annuity begins at age 62 whether or not the retiree elects to receive so cial security at that time as an example of the csrs offset plan assume that representative or senator retires at the end of the 110th congress with 30 years of congressional service according to the csrs benefit formula this members in itial retirement annuity would be 124150 however if he or she we re age 62 or older this amount would be reduced by an amount equal to the social security benefits earned from congressional service from january 1 1984 through d ecember 31 2008 for an individual retiring in december 2008 at age 62 with 25 years of congressional service covered by social security the reduction would be approximately 14300 replacement rates the adequacy of pension plans is often evaluated by comparing the benefits paid at the time of retirement w ith preretirement earnings the initial annual pension is computed as percentage of
