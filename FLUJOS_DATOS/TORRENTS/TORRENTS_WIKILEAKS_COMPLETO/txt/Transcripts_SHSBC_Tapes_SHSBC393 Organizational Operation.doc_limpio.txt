organizational operation lecture given on 15 july 1964 thank you see i didnt even propitiate you by starting it early today thats whats known as being strong willed whats the date audience 15th of july fifteenth of july ad 14 saint hill special briefing course and lecture on wednesday and thats partially because i have an appointment tomorrow afternoon and partially because i want you to hear yesterdays tape again before youre examined on it and before you hear that tape tomorrow afternoon particularly people who have just started on this you understand you go get that glossary bulletin and tomorrow afternoon why you burn some time on that glossary of class vi terms so that theres slightest quibble in your head about what these various words mean got it and burn that and then youll find mysteriously that the lecture emerges clean and clear and isnt confusing at all you already got enough in lecturing on that material in terms of restimulation not to add you see the other liabilities that could be connected with it do you see so get yourget your nomenclature down before you rehear that tape all right thats besides the point i havent anything to talk to you about today i dont know why i had wednesday lecture there isnt anything to talk about anyhow there were some things one could talk about offhand that ive been dealing with lately which are somewhat amusing and amongst them is organizational operation and has to do with personnel operation and it has to do with lot of things of that particular lineup and it also has to do with the fact that you as scientologist very often find yourself in the sphere and realm of business activities and promotions whether you like it or not your practice very often carries you into this perimeter now along at the level of i adviceand particularly the level 0advice is part and parcel of your stock in trade now you say dont evaluate for the preclear whos preclear you understand whos preclear now your perimeter of action goes out wider than simply sitting down and processing somebody and if you go on and think of scientologist as somebody who only audits then you have very limited view of scientology scientology is the science of life and life is composed of lots of factors and amongst these factors are the economic woof and warp which makes the trap and cage that keeps civilizations interiorized into themselves amongst these various factors of life are the other dynamic relationships besides the first there are after all eight dynamics now we take one individual and he is being processed and we tell him what to think about processof course weve had it thats evaluation but advice is not evaluationi mean its not auditing evaluation now because that is part of your auditing discipline you very probably eschew it when you get into the other perimeters but its very difficult to audit group and its very difficult to audit mankind now the best way to approach the problem of course is the auditing of individuals because group is simply collection of individuals and the basic building block of group as the communist and socialist has totally overlooked is the individual there is such thing as the masses the reason they go in for the massesits gpm end word it doesnt mean people at all it means mest so they make that exact mistake and they say then people are mest because they go in for the masses dont you see very simple how they make this particular mistake but there are eight dynamics there are definitely eight dynamics and when you move off the first dynamic with regard to the pchis eight dynamics now you seewhen you move off that first dynamic with regard to the pc youre into the remaining dynamics and of course second dynamic isnt just sex thats the creation of forms bodies that sort of thing and that includes the family and you will find the roughest roughest roughest points in interpersonal relationships between this fellows first dynamic and other and so forth that occurs in the second dynamic person can be ripped to pieces very easily because its so intimate to the first dynamic you see the second dynamic is very close there and its not close simply because it isbeen named number two it isit is very close now of course the next thing adjacent to the individual beyond that is the group the individual joins group and you have group as something which is collection of individuals now this collection of individuals is again more stressful thing than the remaining dynamics once more closerand the loyalty to group the conflict of this group with other groups in this you have of course business you have social activities which are of much less importance to the individual in this particular type of society or even in socialist society than business in fact the toughest dynamic to have anything to do with in russia today is the business third dynamic and thats because their basic premise isis there aint business nohow because you cant make profit you bum thats their i think their more educated view of the subject theyre bunch of people that havent even got their shoes on with regard to this sort of thing see theyre all running around barefoot on the tacks so they found out that some of their tractor factory boys were trying to expedite Ã¤ henry j kaiser well of course these birds had to expedite for the excellent reason that they would be shot up against wall or something of the sort if they didnt meet their quota of tractors so they knew which side their vodka was going to be pouring in on and they promptlyand which way their lifeblood was going to be pouring out ofso they probably got ahold of some horatio alger jr textbook or something on the subject and they heard of expediting and they said gee thats good ideaexpediting the way you expedite is to pay bonus or give favor for getting the stuff you want in order to run the place they thought this was marvelous ideain other words the introduction of the reward system which is unheard of youre not supposed to get any rewards in the communist system thats why it doesnt work you see theyvetheyve taken 50 percent of pavlov if you ring the bell and beat the dog why thats as far as they got in the textbook if theyd gone down the rest of the paragraph theyd found out that you also had to feed the dog to train him to the other half of the reaction and thats not missing in pavlov but its missing in their handling of people see the reward factor for instance they cant get anybody to produce in cuba well everybodys trying to produce in cuba just for one reasontheyre going to get shot if they dont produce you know viva the state you see and therefore theyre supposed to produce these thoughts just dont even go together see the state is commonly thought of by somebody as nonproduction type unit to such an extent that government trying to produce somethingit can spend more money trying to produce something it could have bought at woolworths its marvelous if general motors or somebody exclusively was producing the space program for instance youd find out it would fit well within their automotive manufacturing budget and nobody would ever hear about it but the government get ahold of it see wow see one rocketone rocket oh man thatshuhoh thatll be 100 million dollars thats per rocket you know its typical see so people dont think easily in terms of government and production see but in these socialist communist states theyve got these two factors jammed together and then theyve neglected the other half of pavlov the reward system now the dogthe dog trained and reacted the way he was because when you showed him circle and gave him food hes being rewarded for seeing circle see and he could only be driven crazy because he was being rewarded when he saw the circle they think he was being driven crazy because he was punished when he saw the square the way they were driving him psychoticyou know they drive dog psychotic this was the high peak of pavlovian act they could actually create psychosis in dog and have been doing it in russia ever since and what they would do is show dog athis experiments run both waysbut theyd show dog circle on screen projected circle you see and give him some pork chops or something you see and hed get all educated to the idea that when he saw circle he was going to be fed and then theyd throw square on the screen and beat him and the point im trying to make here is that the square finally equated to the dog i am now going to be beaten see and then they would continue to use these symbols in association and reduce the circle till it was more squarish and make the square so that it was more circlish and when these two things moved into merger then the dog couldnt tell whether he was going to be fed or going to be beaten and so he would go crazy and hed develop real first class psychosis and of course this destroyed his stable datait gave him stable data and then it destroyed it see and then it substituted the wrong stable data for each other see so that he couldnt then tell the difference and he got into total identification of eating and being beaten and so he couldnt tell the difference so hed go screaming mad and the dogs would howl and scream and so forth and go nuts and have to have prefrontal lobotomies thats the only effective treatment for psychosis you know thats the only effective one its just to cut out the brain because thats of course what people think with everybody knows that joke all right now look atlook at this theres reward factor there see everybody adjudicated it on the basisand the adjudication was that it was themostly beatings you see but there was reward factor there and that reward factor destruction of was more contributive to the psychosis than the punishment thats something that youthat because its softer quieter thing it is something that people overlook its the carrot see its not study in punishmentnot study in crime and punishment its study of rewards so that in cuba its all very well to try pavlovian by the way pavlov was whistled up at the kremlin by stalinthis is not rumor im telling you this is the truthhe was whistled up to the kremlin by stalin about 19 i dont know when it was think about 28 and he was put in room and i hope it didnt have bell in it and square screen but and he was toldi should say invited i should be sarcastic about it and say invitedand to write everything he knew about dogs that could be applied to human beings and he turned out about 400 page manuscript which isanybody knowsnobody has ever seen outside the kremlin and it is the textbook on which communism goes forward quite interesting isnt it and so their lovehate cycles and lot of things become immediately explained youll find out theyll go on big pitch of love love love you know and how wonderful the united states is and how wonderful this outfit oh i love you all we are going to write big treaties and lets all be buddies and have another drink of vodka and then the next thing you know it the calendar loses few sheets and its hate hate hate kill them you mustnt do this you must take your u2 planes out of our soup and you know and we hate you and you ought to all go die and youre capitalists and warmongers and so forth and then few more pages of the calendar falls off and so forth and its love love lovewe love you and so on and of course the type of fairy that they employ in the state department of course is completely unable to cope with either love or hate and he of course has never figured it out its in any textbook of anybody who knows anything about communism but he never figured it out so he always falls for the love cycles and resists the hate cycles you see proper thing to do is just to start love cycle you see when they start hate cycle and drive them nuts see theyd go mad they wouldnt know what to do handleable situation on the third dynamicall youd have to know is their textbook you had to know what theyre trying to do and then reverse the effect and of course then you could create an effect on it and the west wouldnt be backing up and losing wars and for long time you know i expected the north korean flag to be flying over the white house after all there were half dozen soldiers there and they could all shoot guns and seemed like at any moment they were going to effect landing on the western coast and march on the white house at least thats the thing it looked here was the most powerfully armed nation on earth you see being backed up by few rifles you know that was the silliest thing anybody ever saw well how was such thing as that engineered well its engineered by psychological warfare its engineered by mental tricks of one kind or another they had everybody hypnotized into believing that they could fly bombers out of chinese and manchurian bases and bomb south korea but nobody must touch that and truman was so hypnotized into believing this it was just propaganda you see wasnt any reason why anybody couldnt do it nobody would have gone to war china was in state to go to war with anybody macarthur said ive got to be able to attack those bases so truman sacked him instantly you want to know the power of the mind and power of propagandahere was the president of the united states busily fighting the war for russia see thats the way wars are fought they are fought mentally these days of course war isnt war at all anymore itd be twenty minute sfugh see so nobody can fight war so this only leaves the significance now you see there are two thingsthere are two things in gpm that give you trouble and naturally you can say well one of these things is product of the other thing its just an idea of it and all this sort of thing you can rationalize it out of existence if you want to but the truth of the matter is that they do exist and you do experience them and thats significance and mass and when person is driven out of mass he has to go into significance this is your figurefigure type see he can never do anything or handle anything touch anything or reach anything but boy can he think he thinks himself in lots of triangles and squares and battle royals you see this iswho was the character that was always so very very timid but yet was going around dreaming upsome comic strip character audience walter mitty hm audience walter mitty aw yeah mitty thats the boy and this is mitty you know he can figurefigure and dreamdream you know butand so on he has ball but if you ever had put awell actuallya lit firecracker in his hand even small one you see why he would have turned gray overnight you know well hes fallen away from mass and force and he only has one refugeidea now they actually gohe has the refuge of ideas dont you see thats called an unbalanced character hes all ideas and do he can think yes see but do see he cant handle mass now theres the other side of the thing which is equally unbalanced and people think that this is the only side there is and that is that person is very beefy and very brawny but cant think you know and we hear of this character all the time the football hero who cant pass any of his subjects you know and i know of one i saw him come in here one time he was bringing to mein new organ new wurlitzer and he carried it in the front door and bonwick wasbonwick was sort of tagging along behind not carrying very much weight and this boy just packed this wurlitzer organ in through the front door he never even cracked or damagedhe set it down very easily and gently dont you see very very interesting and hes little bit on the dull side so you very often see this but it is not necessarily the case you see that is not necessarilybecause somebody can handle mass well does not mean he cant think but you do see it overbalanced occasionally that the individual handles mass very well and so forth and yet cant think at all so you see these two factors of mass and significance do go together in the field of the mind and can become overbalanced so that person can only think but cant handle mass or person can only handle mass and cant think and there is reason why person cant handle mass and can think see thats the ideal combination you very often find this one to be the case similarly an occupational activity where an individual is only handling mass and doesnt have to think will bring him to point where he has little difficulty thinking you see you could occupationally move yourself into this perimeter too and the sedentary worker who does nothing but think eventually gets to believe that he cant have much to do with mass and mustnt handle mass dont you see so he can sort of professionally move himself into these things not only by aberration but by practice and activity see he can sort of live that way hes saying all the time well i have to sit up here in the office and do all these contracts so the workmen will have something to move and there they are down there running those caterpillars and big earth movers and so forth and ive got to keep those things moving and i sit up here in the office and eventually hell get the idea that he mustnt well actually he reallyif he was going to keep the business runninghe really couldnt go down there and also run those earth movers and so forth from the seats you see that would be too much of split of attention and that is the limitations of the society in which we live its doozy of society for making you concentrate and specialize in something which means that it gives you an awful lot of things that it tells you you mustnt confront and basically it is only telling yourself that there are certain things you mustnt handle and confront that moves you into any groove and lets you find yourself up some blind alley someplace now getting back to what we were talking about in cuba there all theyd have to do is tell all the cubansall the cuban guys you seethat if they met their quotas theyd all get brandnew pair of highheeled shoes or wildcolored sport shirt and tell the girls theyd have goodlooking dress if they met their quota see all of sudden theyd have production because theres the reward side of the system you see see the reward side of the system is actually more workable and functional than the punishment side of the system now punishment if its strenuous enough and tough enough and certain enough can occasionally seem to accomplish something i think classic example that always sticks in my mind when i looked at the citadel christophe of caphaÃ¯itien in haiti and that thing was built over period of years by christophe the great emperor of haitiand he was tough boy and they couldnt move stone up the hill thered be hundred man standing therethis is fantastic structure its in the very best french siegecraft tradition and so forth he surrendered its still full of powder and shot by the way and he surrendered it he merely became dispirited and he went up there he was feeling kind of bad and he was retreating before the oncoming forces dont you see and he just sort of said well i cant hold out the hell with it the whole place full of powder and shot and he just threw in his chips it didnt matter how many stones had been put up there it was after all the attitude of the man which surrendered the place not the assault and he didnt think it was worthwhile to go on living he felt there was reward in living anymore so he surrendered the whole citadel he just gave it up thats it blew his brains out and that was the end of it that was very impressive structure and his method of building that is classic hed have hundred men trying to move one of these heavy stones up the hill and they couldnt move it so hed turn around to his guards and hed say shoot every tenth man and they would and hed tell the remaining ninety move that stone up the hill and they would see enough punishment enough threat and so forth but then this has what this is denying the person the reward of having body and going on living and breathing so its again not punishment but the denial of reward see when you get it right down to that fundamental its the denial of life youre not going to take life away from him youre just going to deny him the rewards that life give him whatever rewards they are and its very funny that slave or something like this will still hang on to life hell still go on living up to pointunder duress and so forth but hes being rewarded to some degree all the time when the individual is longer rewarded and when the individual is not in any way handled from standpoint of reward and theres reward figured into the setup of his existence because if hes not getting anything out of itan americanization of this approach and thats very crude materialisticy because rewards are many things seebut if he wasnt getting anything out of it why he wouldnt play that game see now thats crude materialistic rendition of this which more or less gets this idea into trouble the truth of the matter is there are many rewards and so on theres thejust the satisfaction of having done your job okay you see thats reward it doesnt have to have somebody come up now unions and that sort of thing go on the basis that reward is totally and only paycheck so theyre raising hob with the societies at this particular time you see on reward of paycheck i could get seven strikes started for every one theyve got started right now using the same principles im talking about now in reverse i would show them how there were certain things rewards which they probably could obtain from the work of being postman and postal workers which they were not obtaining i could think of brandnew series of rewards you see because im dealing with basic equation not how many bucks they got and whats the cost of living and how many pounds shillings and pence this all amounts to lets go on it on fundamental lets say the reward is the thing which theyrethe line which they would most easily travel all right very good lets figure out some reasons for postmen to strike using it reverse wed wind up with some very interesting answers wed get such things as well large business houses and so forth arent sufficiently respectful to the postman and they never thank him for the mail see so you couldyou could actuallylets put itlets put this on this little tiny basis now youd be surprised what stir that would make amongst postmen i mean lets just take it to an almost ridiculous tininess you see and insist that part of their conditions of work and so forth that they only delivered mail to people who thanked them for bringing it youd be surprised how many guys would sort of go overboard sideways for you on that one see had nothing to do with pay had nothing to do with anything you see all right now lets just start adding to that and add some sensible ones you see add some sensible ones and so forth and lets have the post office authorities and so forth providing better looking uniforms easily carried packs dont you see have them providing more status for the postmen better working quartersdid you ever see the back end of one of these post offices you could start adding this up dont you see on the basis of statusthis is the way youd figure it out you seestatus and respect you see and acknowledgment you start figuring it out in these particular directions and so forth you got ball now postmen will walk around drive around and so forthshouldnt be working six days week they should go on different types of shifts and you would find however that it isnt necessarily true that all strikes must occur on the basis of more pay and less work now i could as easily get strike started on these bases for not being permitted to work enough see its actually dirty trick to play on bunch of workmenthe idea that they are being overworkedbecause thats the sympathy line and that would be very very bad thing to pull on group of workmen because its noconfront now lets see where this noconfront leads you say this is very wandering sort of lecture im giving you im not ive taken you up as far as the third dynamic well people dont get much further you someday will get further up into the fourththe fourth versus another fourth well you say yeah this planet is the fourth dynamicall men on this planet thats the fourth dynamic yes thats what i said too see so fourth versus fourth you as operating as scientologist youre going to see this whats going to happen whats going to happen when one race of beings comes in collision with another race of beings im not trying to go space opera on you im just being sensible about this i mean well you say well there must be some kind of an idea here where were dropping back into groups because culture would be so differenteven body form communication factors technology beliefs ideas of what they should be doing and what was right and what was wrong and what was moral and immoralwould be so wildly different that you wouldnt even have man you see he might even have mans shape but he wouldnt be man if you were to listen to rocket jockeys morals and whats right and whats wrong for rocket jockey from some other civilization and listen to this for while your hair would stand on end now we compare this to an airline pilots ideas of whats right and whats wrong on this planet and weve got two widely screamingly different approaches weve got two cultures here see theyre entirely different what are the rights of one whats the rights of the other in other words weve got too great disparity and we get up into the fifth dynamic weve got the plant world and i dont notice the plant world talking to man very much man sometimes talks to it but it doesnt say much and animals have very little to say and so forth they arent allowed to vote now we get up into the sixth dynamic and we have mest and it doesnt talk at all it never has anything to say some people hear voices coming out of it occasionally but it really in actual fact hasnt got anything to say for itself if you melt it up and put it in crucible why it sizzles but it doesnt say you see its resistances are plotted in terms of retaining its form or refusing to attain form or refusing to condense or expand its just the resistances dont you see now we get up into the seventh as far as man is concerned today he is so out of communication even with himself on the seventh dynamic that we frankly dont have to worry about that one at all in our present coverage and when we go into the idea of supreme beings or gods or big thetans or something like that well weve just taken the whole curve all the way around and the only thing weve got on this planet today is just pure nuttiness on this subject seethe theory of the big thetan see actually the big thetan theory is simply one of the gpms and ittheres end words that have to do with gods and things like this you see and theres one of the root wordsseveral of the root wordshave to do with worship and so forth and its just goofiness see there isnt anybodythere isnt anybody any big thetan around whos permeating everything that just because you say now please give cake and ice cream for my supper tonight is going to suddenly go into brown study and wonder how to get you cake and ice cream tonight see there just is such being and if youre in trouble youd better not go out and think that some big thetan someplace is going to be interested even if he existed in some ant who couldnt botherif he couldnt get his antennae out of crack of rock believe he isnt going to give seconds thought to this it would scare you withinto gray hairs if he did all of sudden huge hand scoops out of somewhere and probably youd die from shock if it occurred plot it yourself on your own attitude toward insects you sometimes help an insect but mostly its sort of amusing andusually the devil with it and you get into this idea of the big thetan and all that sort of thing youre not into the field of religion youre just into the field of the gpms again that doesnt mean that there couldnt be big thetans that doesnt mean that there couldnt be godlike beings but let assure you that mans idea of them is so laughable as to cause you to roll on the floor for half an hour and hold in your sides i think one of the best commentaries on thismark twain did some very interesting commentaries on itand i think ingersoll was the great atheist he had lot to say about it the only thing i find very amusing about mark twainthe second that you begin to read about god and holiness youre just reading one of the longest parades of end words and root words i think i have ever laid my eyes on his essays on this subject are just absolutely planted if theyre justthey just run consecutively you seeend word end word end word root words root words root words end words you see and gets quite interesting because he must have been keyed in like crazy on that particular subject he was mostly mad at it and making fun of it he wasnt taking really very rational view of it some of the things he had to say were quite amusing but itthe people say well ron is against god ron is against people making fool out of god if god exists i think if theres any god around who singlehandedly built this universe hes probably so plowed into it by this time that its probably its him that needs help not us and you could findyou could probably found whole church on the basis of help god he needs your help you know but you see how interiorized people are on this particular dynamic or scope of action which is the superior life being you see is all that its the dynamic of and there are always going to be superior life beings around so that it is dynamic and definite dynamic and its been muddied up by gpms but its definitely there dont you see there is something there but its simply in psychotic state look how interiorized it is if everybody thinks it is going to help them they say god well therefore they worship itits somehow or other going to do something for them and so forth well i want to show you the common denominator all the way up the line on all of this is simply understanding and communication and where you run into difficultywhere you run into difficulty on any dynamic including the first difficulty of the first dynamic which is the inability to know self you see from that period right on up dynamic after dynamic the only reason you have trouble inside dynamic or one dynamic with another dynamic is communication factor and the less communication is feasible the more trouble you actually would have in doing something with it not necessarily the more trouble you would have with it because it might be so out of communication youre unaware of it but the breakdown is in the field of communication and then once communication has been establishedunderstanding now the rocket jockey from some other technology appearing here if he could speak our language compared with what an airline pilot here would think was right and wrong and what he should do about his job even though he spoke english this rocket jockey would not be understood by most do you see hed not be understood by most he would say well the pilot of plane is expendable thats his first duty to be expendable and youd say well whats the matter i thought he was supposed to protect the equipment oh he wouldnt protect equipment thats very cheap see and right away youd sort of hang up well where does he get the idea that hesthat his first duty is to be expendable must be very dangerous business and theyve hypnotized him into believing something or other about it so thered be any rocket jockeys at all but you justyou understand im not trying to give you an answer to that im just trying to say youd be figuring you see you would be in noncomprehension even if you had the understand see youd have the affinity and reality would therefore breakdown so you have the english culture and the german culture the language is different so they had basic difficulties in talking to each other but even the slight difference of the cultures was such that even when they spoke the same language they still didnt understand each other well enough to do anything but go to war and they periodically been going to war for very long time see and theyll go to war again germans sitting over there saying weve got to get them damned englanders and so forth and sunday times pictorial up here its stuck in 1914 man every few issues why heres this 191418 war cropping back up again and so forth you go out and try to sell germans to englishmen and youre not going to make much progress the only reason theyre standing there politely is because the english believe that every man should have his say this fools lot of people they believe this implicitly it isnt necessarily true because he says it but certainly every man should be permitted to say it and so forth you can often get into trouble by interrupting an englishman before hes finished talking he thinks youre ungentlemanly that is really more important than whats being discussed thats right german doesnt operate that way im just giving you the idea the germans approach even to communication is entirely different if corporal in the army is three days superior in rankyou know he got his corporalship three days before the next corporaland he is speaking and the other corporal even looks like hes going to change his expression see they just chop him to pieces and if the junior corporal is talking it doesnt matter where he has progressed to the fact that he is the junior corporal makes him fair game to be cut off at onceloudly harshly and instantly whereas in england youd see the lord of the manor sitting there patiently patiently man while the fifth gardener is telling him all about his marital affairs and how he is in trouble down in the cottage so hed just sit there and listen to it all the way through till the man is finished talking hes liable now to say something rather rude and curt to him but he has heard him you understand the german superiority is the right not to hear im your superior so i dont have to listen to you see all right lets take those two little things and look at the number of wars the reason i dont throw america into that particular thing is because america is so muddied up with germans and so muddied up with english and so forth that it is about as easy to trace the antecedents ofas one of these dogs you see running down the street of east grinstead cant do it see but you have two races here which arehave definite similarity they carry back to some degree theyre mixed of course in many ways but they have developed different cultures and there have been number of wars and theyve been very savage wars and they were all about nothing the british more would have letknocked off that war with hitler than anything see they just wouldnt have knocked it out the only thing hitler wanted as far as i can tell from the historical records is try to knock the war off see he was holding up holding up holding up trying not to fight that war on this front he was thinking boy if i could just not fight this war i could lick the russians see and he couldnt get anybody to listen to him see and the english on their side says well we have idea whatsoever what the devil hitlers trying to do but we know one thinggermans see now the british didnt even feel bad about any of the various atrocities that hitler was involved in you try to trace why and there is good reason its kept historians busy for long time trying to figure out exactly what is the causes of this war well thats why so many words have been written on it theyre not isolatable see as little pinpoint causes of this that or the other thing theres these basic causes of communication and the basic causes of understanding of course our sympathies in this of course go with the british i fought by their side throughout that war and so forth but i justusing these as two rather pure examples and here they sit within stones throw of each other you dont drive jaguar very very fast seeyou dont drive jaguar fast into the southeast you find yourself almost instantly on boat and youre almost instantly off the boat theres not enough water there to get your feet very wet and then if you kept on driving that jaguar for just few minutes see you would find yourself in germany i mean there is distance involved you could hitchhike it you see its not the distance between rhode island and delaware see theres distance involved from here over to germany and yet hardly anybody goes over to germany you think its long way away it is not long way away in racing car and so forth suzie and i had an awful hard time trying to get the brakes on we did we got the brakes on in time to stop in germany and so forth we might have gone right on through into the balkans too because these are all rather postage stamp and we did insult the whole duchy of luxembourg it was touch and go for few minutes one time down in luxembourg whether or not we would be let out of the country or arrested on sight or something of the sort because wed insulted the whole grand duchy of luxembourg at one fell swoop withso much so that i even feel guilty sometimes listening to their radio luxembourg down there enjoying its program i should write through and ask for royal pardon or something but id just gottenid just gotten myself oriented in luxembourg and i was stopped see and the guardthe guard asked all about it and i started answering the questions about entering luxembourg and he told i was leaving luxembourg and i wouldnt believe it because i hadnt gotten into luxembourg yet see so of course he had wonderful ease staring him in the face of illegal entry it must be illegal entry the man doesnt even know hes leaving luxembourg very confusing anyway you look over this situation what then causes on each one of these dynamics trouble were not wondering what causes them to be different dynamics you see but what causeswhat causes the trouble youve got dynamic one what causes the dynamic one fellows out of communication with himself and his own bank and cant understand himself all right thats trouble on unit one on unit two hes gotten all out of communici mean on dynamic twoon dynamic two hes gotten all out of communication with the second dynamic and he doesnt understand the second dynamic third dynamic hes gotten all out of communication on thesubject of the third dynamic and he doesnt understand the third dynamic on the fourth dynamic hes gotten all out of communication very out of communication with all other fourth dynamics and he doesnt understand the point of where most people hearing say something about it say well of course he used to write science fiction naturally you know they wouldnt evenheres this universe expanding to infinity as far as everybodys concerned and man pronounces this idiocy that we are the only race and technology alive in it anywhere you even read in the field of science fiction how all life spread out from earth oh come off of it i was so amused about this i once wroteread story about this marvelous civilization that these fellows were exploring and that they were mining and so forth and they were simply mining the liver of worm in larger apple but thejust to sort of sneer at them see the vast importance of this civilization you see the highest peak of its space travel eventually was able to mine the liver of worm in an apple in larger civilization see now other fourth exists well how out of communication can you get youll find the similar situation if you go out and look very hard today into some back desert some place or another youre going to find some tribe some place or some bushman some place or some pygmy some place or something like that who wont believe that any other races exist they wont believe that such thing exists as white men and that youre telling them fancy stories because you say there are white men theyre liable to get very nasty to you when you insist youre just another race and not god theyll instantly put you on another dynamic like they put columbus much to their dismay eventually motors often act like gods but seldom are now you get into this and theres just total breakdown on the subject of communication so of course theres understanding even attempted on the subject but we do have this little thread of science fiction literature that runs through the society that attempts it but its mostly full of menace and science fiction editors are to point if an author sends them story which has to do with invasion from the men from mars they will reject it instantly just because it is story of an invasion theyre so tired of these stories in other words clichÃ© its longer an original story we must assume that if there is another culture we would be at war with it hey theres wild assumption if another culture existed we would be at war with it and they would be attacking us well thats wild stable datum to have you havent met the other culture you dont know anything about their intentions at all but the instant assumption is that it would be theyre angry at you and ready to attack you and eat you all up i think thats fascinating point of communication seethey cant communicate with them at alland understanding and then also that understanding would be necessary because of course wed just fight them these are interesting assumptions now we get out into the fifth and youre talking to dogs and thats fairly easy and dogs are often trying to talk to you and cats try to talk to you and you talk to cats and people run off at the mouth most remarkably talking to animals and animals do fine though as long as you talk to them they expect you to communicate and theyre very happy about it and they actually lack vocal chords more than they lack ideas to say back see and vixie out here shes gotten up to point of where shes trying hard toi dont know whereshe must have somethese welsh dogs must have been unthinkably careless she must have some cat in her ancestry you know because she purrs little corgi dwarf you know and she purrs shes gotten so she purrs thats her effort to communicate with see she doesnt purr to anybody else that ive ever listened to maybe shes doing it now but she tries to purr sounds very funny to hear dog purring but shes picked up to the fact i talk to her so she tries to talk back dont you see trying to make communication well theres lot of understanding there dont you see so here is an understanding that really is not dependent on communication because the communication exists only in the crudest form of contact and awareness it doesnt exist in the form of significance and meaning to amount to anything you see so understanding in that particular case can exist you see understanding can exist independent of the significant communication thats an interesting thing so you dont always have to have perfect communication see as long as youve got understanding your reality and affinity will go on right on up without the significance of the communication expressing itself at all and that continues on out through the fifth dynamic and we automatically assume that certain things in the fifth dynamic and so forthbut we can look around and we can see them functioning between certain parts and kinds of men and the fifth dynamic but if we look into the fifth dynamic we find out it internally is consistently and continually at war with itself theres creepers up choking trees and theres wasps having ball with caterpillars and theres warfare so theres not much mutual understanding inside the fifth dynamic and just because man can speak to the fifth dynamic often puts him into some odd state of high affinityperfectly all rightof high affinity dont you seethis isnt what makes it oddhigh understanding you see high reality and so forth with regard to other parts of the fifth dynamic because you see man has also made himself part of the fifth dynamic and he has feeling in this direction every once in while youll notice some being or another who has gone completely overboard on this thing and theyll only talk about the gorgeousness of the birds and bees and how nice and sweet it is and how sweet everything is and how nice nature is and how beastly man is this person must have rocks in his head i dont have to hate nature because its vicious but believe its not very theetieweetie all you have to do sometime is wound shark in pack of sharks and youre not watching very much just because this shark is bleeding even slightly causes him to be attacked by his own brother sharks you see and nature can go completely daffy inside of one of its own little subdivisions on the fifth dynamic and can be intensely noncommunicative and nonunderstanding inside of one of those little subdivisions of the fifth dynamic thats pretty wild one thats wild one you dont have to hate it for it you dont have to be in awe because of it but you should have at least the sense to recognize what youre looking at you go out here and you see these beautiful vines well here at saint hill if i let these beautiful vineswhen i first came here somebody had been talking about these beautiful vines just about long enough and they practicallywell if it had been left gone another three or four years this i dont know what the totality of trees and so forth here are at saint hill there are quite few of them and id say about 75 percent of them would have been dead if theyd been let go another threefour years somebody had been careless enough to let ivy grow around the trees and two or three of the big firs up here at the top of the hill and so forth are gone but boy that ivy it isnt just parasitic and that sort of thing it has murder in its eye man it grows big ropes of stuff and it goes right around in the exact method necessary to shut off all the circulation of tree you see and the next thing you know it just chokes all the circulation of the tree and the tree dies pretty so i guess somebody thought it was so pretty that theyd better not do anything about it or something of that sort but it would have been the end of all the trees here you go around and you look at things like this in nature and you recognize that it is at war now the scientist who then makes whole total crash out of one philosophythe law of the tooth and claw the law of the jungle is the only law which governs so forthought to come around sometime or another and get off of his ivory tower and look out in the real world and find out that it isnt uniformly anything see it isnt uniformly bad see see he could findhe could learn lot if hed just look youll find all sorts of wild things youll find that there are many assistive factors and there are many points of high communication between two different branches and high points of understanding you point to obvious onesthe scientists remarks such as i think the hippos get their ticks picked off by tick birds or something like this and theres various things like this and they say thats symbiosis and so forth it isnt i dont think hippos need ticks picked off particularly by tick birdsprobably doesnt do them any harm at all and they probablyi dont think probably tick birds are very efficient at it ive seen various types of fish and so forth that clean the teeth of other fish and all kinds of things like this and ive noticed they very often dont do good job you know you see you got to look little closer and you find out that it isnt all that practical it must be something about hippopotamus sort of finds life more interesting with tick birds crawling around on him you know there isnt just that one crude reward theres probably some other rewards involved you find lot of these things you start looking for them you find the rewards of livingness are many and they are picked up on various lines but you get too concentrated on how bad it all is and of course there doesnt appear to be any reward of living and thats why people commit suicide when they commit suicide theres more reward to living not life is too dreadful to live theres reward in it anymore and now they go on down to point of where they add up all the punishment factors too and thats enough to tip it over and they could blow their brains out or something of this sort dont you see this is almost secondary considerationi assure you almost secondary consideration what men will go through to hang on to body is so astonishing that i am very often gawping at the subject see well theyd go through modern medicine can i say more wildest stuff you ever had anything to do with in the old days its much simpler they said well theres nothing we can do for it and he kicked the bucket and goes and picks up another body see but what theyll go through today to go on living well theres reward in life theres reward in all of this now when we add this up as scientologist we arent just and solely and only in the field of processing were in the field of advice were in the field of looking over the situation on these various dynamics were looking over these various things and what youre looking forwhat youre looking for then is the reward and punishment balances but that doesnt really lead you to an immediate conclusion for this reason that youll find its as far out as the communication is out oror the understanding is out and you can treat these things as slightly separate some communication of one form or another has to be there but understanding is not totally dependent on the communication understanding can exist for other reasons rather than communication you might have divined what is going on with that person and understood it therefore see so you didnt have to have much communication about it see you didnt have to have much information on the subject now if youre trying to settle up or square around somebody in life or set him right the easiest way to do it is by processing him i assure you that that is the easiest way to do it because youre going to get failure on most of your advices when theyre directed at one individual nevertheless i dont say dont do it you very often find out its necessary to give somebody some advice so he can get some processing quite often you have to approach this with advice first and you mustnt leave that out of your bunch of tricks here because its very vital even on the first dynamic well how about itbefore you start processing somebody you really are saying i advise you to get some processing so actually advice comes first if even in that ridiculous form you see you say well the best thing for you to do mr jones you keep talking about this lumbosis you got if i were you mr jones if im going to do anything for you at all in fact not only if i were you but you betterid sort of square it up and id check into hotel for the next week or so while youre being processed and dont have anything more to do with those problems for that period of time and then approach it with fresh look afterwards well thats very limited piece of advice but its certainly advice isnt it well you should never feel yourself constrained about issuing such advice realize however that their problemsto themare very very complex and therefore require very complex solution sometimes you have to issue little more complicated advice than you would ordinarily issue to get it understood sometimes it has to be very complicated yes i know your business is going to suffer what you do is write your brother letter who is out in des moines iowa and you have him come in and you train him on the job here for ten days in order to get this so that you can have this week off and then you soandso you get the idea see you sometimes give them this terrifically involved piece of advice and they will take it then it seems that youre acknowledging how complicated their lives are well the first dynamic we understand that pretty well but advice definitely fits in it and then why as soon as you move up into the other dynamics and you are unable by various reasons to carry out program of processing on each individual let us say on the second dynamicyou face that very oftenor the third dynamic you cant at this momentwouldnt at this moment be able to do anything but advise the republican convention you couldnt process them all dont you see you could advise them to have some processing maybe run some group processing on them that might work and is verya very workable activity in actual fact but youll find yourself seldom with both sides of the third dynamic under your control or understood or in communication you could talk to the british you see but not to the germans dont you see see thatd be thatyoud be that monosided about it so therefore in settling any third dynamic activity you do have group processing you should use such tools and so forth but youll find yourself more and more operating in the field of advice and i assure you in two or three years if there was any communication with other life in space the first one that they would think of talking to probably would be scientologist so that again we were on the advice side of the picture and its advice advice advice and advice is after all instruction isnt it and theres real difference in what im saying between advice and instruction so when you depart from the first dynamic you then have instruction as your dominant activity you have advice in other words but advice easily slides over into the this is it of instruction see so training instilling cultural patterns figuring out how it ought to be and squaring it up that way becomes very much part of scientologists livingness couldnt be otherwise so he has these two things he has advice and he has processing when you move off the individual or when you move away from being able to collect the group together and process it collectivelywhen you move away from that building block the individualyoure sure dealing with much better ground if youre dealing in the field of advice see and if that advice is just casual advice its still advice you see now when it becomes less casual and more directed that becomes instruction and on seven of the dynamics those that are not the first dynamic youll find out thats the one which you basically use well in view of the fact they arent all seven highly operative why it doesnt give you ratio of seven to one see but it does give you an overbalanced ratio that youre apt to use advice and instruction more often really than processing new look see because theres more of it if you were being totally active in the handling of the society that you certainly would be using advice and instruction far more frequently than processing far far more frequently so the conduct and practice of scientology is slightly more advice and instruction than it is processing but before you have any any right whatsoever to advise anybody you certainly better be able to do something in the field of processing right so actually it starts with being good auditor and not evaluating for your pc and telling him what to think about what hes just dreamed up now evaluation is reallypc says he doesnt know what kind of an answer youd expect on this so you tell him the right answer and you say all right you answered the question its answering his auditing questions for him that youre shying off for there telling him what to think about the auditing question or something like this but evaluation has nothing to do with instruction we use the word evaluation roughly and not technicallyi would say towelli just evaluate day after day hour after hour as long as im in communication with people they expect to give methey expect to give mewell they expect to give them some kind of an answer to their situation so i do i dont mess around with it fellow says what will i do about my wife see what will i do about my wife well hows she been acting lately soandso and soandso and soandso you instantly realize that its not processing problem in the first place you cant do anything in this particular team there couldnt be any coaudit possible on this team we wouldnt get all unreal about the situation then and say well she better be audited and you better go into coaudit on it well my god the girl is climbing wall and nobody can keep her down for three minutes and shes gone totally loopy over some other guy somewhere or another and shes racing off and gone till 200 am every morning you know thats this sort of thing and its completely out of control see well maybe they could have been processed years ago see but nothing you can do about it far as processing is concerned well see you better just get into the advice business right away what i do about it well let her go away with the other man of course and take bunch of responsibility forworry about taking responsibility for her actions actually youre being irresponsible if yousupposed to be the person who knows and are informed about life and livingness and that sort of thingsit there with dumb look on your face now youre being irresponsible guy wants to know what to do all right tell him what to do see first thing you think of well lets see if we could get you some processing get her some processing thats obviously the best answer see and you figure out is this possible in any way even by any stretch of the imagination or even by an heroic action is this possible well you find out this isnt possible and so forth and isnt feasible dont also be fool and say well of course if all iveive got all this ive got all my auditing time all taken care of here for the next ten and half weeks somehow or another ill fit this fellow into my schedule and so forth youre just being fool youre being irresponsible you know you wont get around to processing this guy you got more pcs than you can shake stick at something like that you wont get around to processing this guy lets be real all right the thing to do is say well thats advice oh the thing id do if i were you id just let her go you say shes running off every night and that sort of thing well ill tell youill tell you what heres aheres piece of paper here that you have typed and get her signature on itll keep you from getting into any trouble it says i having been unfaithful to my husband so forth hereby grant him divorce and full custody of the children without further upset and get ithere it is all right get it typed and see if she can sign so you know this will catalyze something man because youve put the end product of what this girl is heading for right in front of her face now shes either going to jump one way or the other way isnt she see you catalyze the situation and maybe the guy whos asking you for the advice is hell to live with remember that and maybe the other guy is real dream see you dont know about this see so you just give you just give as close as you can give to solution which is practical on all dynamics that you can think of in the next two or three seconds you understand dont go taking these things under advisement so all right within the reality of thatof the data youve gotthen give the best solution that you can give which fits all the way around without pretending that youre not on his side but also not exclusively being on his side do you understand you actuallytheres big trick in this ill give you the trick in giving advice is the advice you give should not be partisan now this is the other thing im trying to arrive in talking about the dynamics so long that maybe overstressed it you only get in trouble when you get partisan when you cease to be pandetermined because that brings you down into selfdeterminism and brings you down into onesided specialization and moves you right on downstairs into all the specializations and economic traps there are you cease to be pandetermined in the advice you give you say well im not going to process this or that or the other thing or this type of individual because i dont like him youve already become specialized you should never make limit on what kind of person youll process in actual fact see if you dont enjoy processing this kind of person well also dont be masochistic but dont say well im never going to process any blondes see because im liable to get in trouble with blondes and figure it all out see thats for the birds see thats sillyto get an endall category see and similarly its very silly to give partisan advice but remember this it is also unacceptable to give advice which isnt partisan and thats where the most of the argument comes against the savants they put the pose of detachment and disinterest in with it and you mustnt do that either dont go aroundthis is really the way to exteriorize out of everything and become zerodetermined in all directionsis just pretend youre never part of anything and never interested in anything you see but somebody comes up to you and they want you to get real mad at their motherinlaw theyre asking you for bunch of advice well you dont have to get mad at their motherinlaw this is what im saying see you dont have to get mad at the men from mars to advise earthmen how to handle the men from mars you understand you dont have to get mad or partisan or upset about some other side in order to issue advice about it but neither do you have to sit around and say well im really part of this conflict im just an agitated i mean detached individual im being calm yeah and im being dadadabluuh delete that from your histrionics just look at the guy interestedly and say oh there are men from mars in washington yeah they need advice over there oh yeah and youre wondering what to do and so forth well instantly see if you cant set up communications network see if there isnt some common exchange of communication and make that your sole concentration see see if we cant set up some kind of communication thing well he says its impossible theyre just flying around in the air and we havent got any radio all right abandon the city well the guy says thats more like it well abandon the city hes off see thats the other piece of advice hed take all right now look at this you say well see if we cant arrange coaudit between you and your wife you see you look this over thats communication and then estimate the degree of understanding that will occur and advise accordingly if he cant do that then estimate the degree of understanding that will occur or the understandingestimate the understanding that can occur and advise it advise something on that basis you say well if theyre flying around overhead and this guy says he cant get into communication with it anyway and they probably tried something in this direction theyre all scared stiff realize there are some other factors you havent been told always in giving advice youve never been told all you dont really know very much about the situation dont make abe fool to think you have where you make mistakes in giving advice is to think you know about it and have the perfect solution one you dont know all about it ever and two you cant give them the perfect solution and they probably arent going to take it theyll take as much of it as they can apply so the best thing to do is give them something they can apply right now and do whatll they take off of you oh well ive been talking toive been talking to the scientologist up in fairfax and he says we ought to abandon the city oh is that what he says well lets get the city abandoned and at least theyre doing something see and the martians say well they arent going to fight us because theyre running look at them run theyre scared of us hey you see weve been scared of them theyre scared of us maybe we ought to try to get into communication with them maybe communication factor would get established after all see see whats the best advice you can give them that will be taken thats the equation youre operating by whats the best advice you can give them that will be takenthat will be taken now you can give them the perfect solution that wont be taken but whats the solution that will be taken well lets find out and you sometimes have to plow around for while to find out what advice will be taken the fellow says oh i just cant stand it anymore ron yeah i just have asthma i wheeze and so on i cant take off any time for processing and that sort of thing and you say youve got too much of schedule to process anyway and there isnt any way i can do this anyway because i after all have an awful hard time in processing and so forth and so on but i really got to do something about this eooohthis asthma and so forth and i dont know and so forth well you ever been down to lower altitudes youre at high altitudes see if youre in high altitude figure out it must be high altitude just give him change change his environment thats one of your first oldtime rules and so forth but give him piece of advice he takes so you say well how about how about getting some blankets and sleeping warmly and getting some well i cant do that because you see im too agitated and so on hes refusing all this all of sudden you finally work your way down some channel and you say why dont you go down to lower altitude he says yes ill go to lower altitude and so on yeah you say all right put the pressure in right at that point see all right you go right down to lower altitude and youll feel better at once and so forth put the hope factor in see go down to the lower altitude youll undoubtedly feel better at once very good fine fine he writes you back couple of weeks later and he appears yeah i went down to vacation and im feeling fine now and asthma see the point im trying to make with you here what im trying to teach you is handle it see handle it and you dont have to say well i cant process him for 8645 hours so therefore i cant help him out oh hell you got lot of more strings to your bow youve got advice whats advice anything you can deal off the cuff that hell accept and do that is more beneficial to him than what hes doingmore beneficial to him than hes doing right now thats for sure if he doesnt change the way hes going hes going to crash thats usually the moment theyre asking for advice its just before they go over the cliff you know so its all usually overthecliff type of advice you have to give him dont sit down and give him five hour lecture on his problems or something like this find out what hell accept hunt and punch around generally in giving advice you can develop sensitivityyou can get that sensitivity pretty good and you notice this guy has got reservation about what youre saying well you gave him the wrong piece of advice see why shift your gears now lot of youyou have some reservation about doing this with regard to your boss whats the matter well you see ii really dont go to work anymore thats why i cant do it all right fine fine well whatswhat is your trouble then maybe i didnt understand you completely and so forth well ii want to handle him so i can get back to work ohhe didnt tell you in the first place see he didnt give you all the data there you areyoure being foolish if you ever assume youre ever given all of the data or that all the data thats given you is true youre actually being fool if you work on this premise that every word that youre told is the gospel truth and youve become partisan and so forth that is what gets wrong with giving advice you become instantly partisan you believe everything youre told is true you take sides against the mythical person you always will to some slight degree emotionally youll say well she did my god you know of course were not listening to what he did and the situation is that you dont want to give wild piece of advice that will wind up as total destruction on all fronts but dont mind giving slightly destructive advice either see dont minddont give the type of advice of well the best thing to do is shoot her dont give the type of device of something or other just from as far as you can tell at this particular instant this seems to be workable feasible thing and so forth she wants to go off with the other man well let her go oh i never thought of that well you know if she did go you know you could sue him for loss of her services well you know i give her eleveneleven pounds week right now and i think maid only costs about six pounds week i think id make money on the deal you say all right then the best advice is get her to sign this paper and so forth gives him something to do takes his mind off his trouble youre answering out of your experiential line dont mind doing that either dont be selfconscious about it is what im trying to say so you all of sudden feel like pontifical ass saying these things pontificating to this degree and so forth well laugh at yourself if you want to but dont cease to give advice because of that see give them something handle it thats the thing and the way you handle it is try to bring about auditing if you cant bring about auditing try to bring about communication if you cant bring about communication and so forth why bring about understanding but of course the communication and understanding are all under the heading of advice if you cant audit them advise them and it just doesnt matter what you advise them because youre people of good heart and youll listen to this and youll say and you say your motherinlaw has been living with you for the last thirteen years and now wont let you sleep anymore in your wifes bedroom your motherinlaw wont let you sleep anymore in your wifes bedroom you want to know what to do about this huh well youre just stonied see what youre stonied by is that situation like this can exist youre not stonied about what advice to give him you see youre just slightly stunned see well the upshot of the thing is that you can deal one off the cuff and you say the old ladys been living with you for thirteen years and now she says soandso and soandso whats your house like you know youve got clue now what to do oh theres only two bedrooms hers and you and your wife where are you going to sleep then you have to sleep in the living room you got big back yard or something like that or you got anything like that oh why dont youwhatwhat do youlets seewhats yourwhats your businesswhats your business youre commercial artist why dont you tell them you got to have studio out in the back yard immediately start building yourself studio out in the back yard theyll try anything they can to get you back in the house again the guy say thats good ideaa studio out in the back yard with door opening on the alley yeah thats good idea in short it doesnt much matter what you advise him see but the system of your advicethe system of your advice would be in the direction of handling something so you dont let lot of human problems walk into your perimeter and sort of drop see guys coming to you for help all right give him help and help isnt just what processing you can give him or actually what formal training you can give him you can also give him advice and as very informal type of information dont you see and thats yours youll find youll do it very often youll find out you do very well if you pursue that and youll find out that the world has very badly fallen apart one from another and youll find out the dynamics are very badly separated from one from another and youll find out theres enough warfare going around to please most anybody youll find out that life amongst the wogs is pretty confounded grim as matter of fact i was looking at it recently and i couldnt believe the number of catastrophes which i found per square cubit of thetansee of enturbulated thetan i just couldnt believe it its fantastic you cant audit all of it that comes your way but you can advise it and you can handle it and youre only really doing your job as addition to other things as an auditor if people who come to you with trouble and people who are having trouble in life and so forth if you dont try to help them handle their situation and just go ahead and try to handle it help them handle it and give them some advice as to what to do and so forth its all part of it and youll find out that they very normally dont do what you told them to do but you find out that you got them to thinking in some forward line and they will do something else along the line but you will have catalyzed the situation in the direction of better smoothness or solution life will become smoother in that particular quarter if you would simply and only acted as catalyst in your immediate environment you would be doing your job in that particular field and area thats all thats all you expect out of it see the guy comes back two weeks later i got better idea after i left you and so forth i built house in the back yard for her and shes going to live in it now and so i got the idea but he knows that you helped him it doesnt matter whether he says your idea worked youre not listening for that so there is an entirely different field that an auditor works in all the time he is auditing and if you feel forbidden to do it because of the auditors code remember thats evaluation with relationship to session and has nothing to do with giving people advice and you give people advice all the time and youll find out that anytime somebody comes to you and tells you their troubles if you give them something to do about it its practical you tell them about touch assist i dont care what you tell them in advice you see give them something practical give them something they can do and that sort of thing and youll find out that youre just aces up and your life will start running very very smoothly indeed and youll listen to lots less problems because he actually will tell you only up to the time you give him some advice or something of that sort dont you see youve shortened the amount of upset in other words of people telling you endlessly their troubles and only their troubles and so forth one of two things will happen they either solve their troubles or they dont want them solved and so wont keep handing them to you see but you have again done something about it and the fact that you are helping people handle their environment in your immediate vicinity does put you kingpin and aces up and youre actually occupying role that whether i said you would or whether anybody tailormade you to do so or not that you very certainly willare occupying and will increasingly occupy as you go forward in life and scientology rolls along thank you very much
