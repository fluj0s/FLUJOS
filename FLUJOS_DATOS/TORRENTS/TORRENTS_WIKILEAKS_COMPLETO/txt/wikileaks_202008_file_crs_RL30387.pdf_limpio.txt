pay taxes to social security nor were they eligible for social security benefits federal employees were instead covered by separate pension plan called the civil service retirement system csrs the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 required federal employees hired after 1983 to participate in social security because the csrs was not designed to coordinate with social security congress directed the development of new retirement plan for federal workers the result was the federal employees retirement system fers act of 1986 pl 99335 the fers has three elements 1 social security 2 the fers basic retirement annuity defined benefit plan and 3 the thrift savings plan defined contribution plan the fers basic retirement annuity is determined by three factors 1 the salary base 2 the accrual rate and 3 years of service the salary base is the average of the highest three consecutive years of pay under fers the benefit accrual rate is 10 per year of service or 11 for workers retiring at age 62 or later with 20 or more years of service worker with 30 years of service retiring at age 62 would have accrued fers pension equal to 33 of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of pay the thrift savings plan tsp is defined contribution retirement plan similar to the 401k plans provided by many employers in the private sector the income that retired worker receives from the tsp will depend on the balance in his or her account in 2007 employees covered by fers or csrs can contribute up to 15500 to the tsp employees age 50 or older can contribute an additional 5000 contributions of up to 5 of pay made by workers covered by fers are matched by the federal government workers covered by csrs can contribute to the tsp but they receive matching contributions one measure of retirement income adequacy called the replacement rate is the ratio of firstyear retirement income to the workers salary in the last year of employment for an employee retiring at age 62 after 30 years of service the fers basic annuity will provide firstyear retirement income equal to 32 of final salary social security replacement rates decline as workers income increases because the social security bene fit formula is tilted in favor of lowwage workers for federal worker retiring at age 62 at the gs4 level after 30 years of federal employment monthly social security benefits will replace an estimated 25 of final salary for worker retiring at the gs15 salary level social security will replace just 14 of final annual pay higherwage federal workers need to contribute more to the tsp to reach the same rate of income replacement as lowerpaid workers can achieve from just the fers retirement annuity and social security the tsp is key element of fers especially for workers at the upper ranges of the federal pay scale these workers are unlikely to achieve adequate retirement incomeas measured by the replacement ratefrom just social security the fers basic annuity and the agency automatic contribution of 1 of pay to the tsp even at modest annual rate of return of 60 income from the tsp can replace about 45 of final pay for worker who contributes 10 of pay over 30 years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30387g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g7g150g153g149g152g162g142g142g156g514g561g20g142g157g146g155g142g150g142g151

civilian federal employees are provided through two programs the civil service retirement system csrs which was established in 1920 and the federal employees retirement system fers which was created in 1986 prior to enactment of the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 federal employees were not covered by social security because the social security system needed additio nal cash contributions to remain solvent the 1983 amendments mandated coverage for civilian federal employees hired in 1984 or later congress recognized however that csrs provided so of the same benefits as social security and that enrolling federal workers in both plans would have required payroll deductions equal to more than 13 of employee pay consequently congress directed the development of new federal employee retirement system with social security as the cornerstone and which would incorporate many features typical of retirement programs among large employers in the private sector the result of this effort was the federal employees retirement system act of 1986 pl 99335 the fers consists of three elements 1 social security 2 the fers basic retirement annuity defined benefit plan and 3 the thrift savings plan defined contribution plan fers now covers all federal employees whose initial federal employment began on or after january 1 1984 as well as employees who voluntarily switched from csrs to fers during open seasons held in 1987 and 1998 1 of 2516000 federal civilian and postal service employees enrolled in federal retirement plans as of september 30 2005 18 78000 75 were covered by fers and 638000 25 were covered by csrs2 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g152g151g561g20g142g157g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g561g18g149g138g151g561g6g142g156g146g144g151g561

defined contribution plans defined benefit plan typically pays pension based on years of service and some measure of average salary during those years social security is defined benefit pension plan in which the benefit is based on the workers average wage during his or her 35 years of highest earnings which are indexed to current values based on national average wage index both csrs and the fers basic retirement annuity are defined benefit plans with each year of service the worker accrues pension benefits equal to percentage of average pay during his or her three highest consecutive years of earnings the amount of the retirement annuity is calculated by multiplying the accrual rate the average of the three highest years of pay and the number of years of service for example worker covered by fers accrues retirement benefits at the rate of 10 for each year of service or 11 for workers retiring at age 62 or older with 20 or more years of service worker retiring at 62 with 30 years of service therefore would be entitled to retirement annuity equal to 33 of his or her high3 average pay 1 relatively few employees who were covered by csrs chose to switch to fers only about 5 of eligible employees switched in 1987 and fewer than 2 switched in 1998 2 federal retirement thrift investment board quarterly statistics november 2006

maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employee the employer contributes specific dollar amount or percentage of pay into the account which is usually invested in stocks and bonds in some plans the amount that the employer contributes depends on the amount the employee contributes from his or her pay when the worker retires the benefit that he or she receives is equal to the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest dividends and capital gains or losses the retiring worker usually has the choice of receiving these funds as lump sum as series of fixed payments over period of years or as life annuity the thrift savings plan t sp is defined contribution plan 3 an important characteristic of defined contribution plans is that the employer has financial obligation beyond commitment to make contributions to each employees retirement account in these plans it is the employee who bears the investment risk if the contributions to the account made by the employer and the employee are insufficient or if the securities in which the account is invested lose value or increase in value too slowly the employee risks having an income in retirement that is not adequate to maintain his or her desired standard of living although the employee bears the risk of investment losses in defined contribution plan he or she also reaps the reward if investment returns produce more retirement income than was expected

minimum retirement age for those who choose this option their benefit is permanently reduced by 5 for each year the employee is under age 62 at the time the annuity begins for example an employee who retires at 56 with fewer than 30 years of service would have his or her annuity reduced by 30 below the amount that would have been paid if the individual were age 62 or older at retirement csrs has provision for early retirement with reduced benefit except for special circumstances such as when an agency is implementing reduction in force of the 53227 federal employees covered by csrs who retired under normal voluntary rules in fy2006 55 were between the ages of 55 and 59 they had an average of 346 years of federal service 5 twentynine percent of federal workers who took normal retirement under csrs in 2006 were age 62 or older the average age of all federal workers covered by csrs who retired in 2006 under normal voluntary retirements was 60 years their average length of service was 340 years because relatively few employees hired before 1984 elected to switch to fers those who have been retiring under fers have tended to be those who joined or rejoined the federal work force relatively late in their careers in fy2006 22274 federal employees retired with immediate annuities under fers their average age was 631 years and their average length of service in the federal government was 189 years the average length of service for workers retiring under fers will rise over time as the proportion of federal employees who spent their entire careers covered by fers continues to increase g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g138g151g157g156g561g152g143g561g8g7g20g21g561g138g151g141g561g5g21g20g21g561g3g151g151g158g146g157g162g561g3g150g152g158g151g157g156g561 both csrs

g21g138g149g138g155g162g561g4g138g156g142g561 many defined benefit plans use salary earned in the years immediately preceding retirement called final average pay to determine the initial amount of pension earnings generally rise over time as workers experience and productivity increase so the years just before retirement usually will be the years when workers earnings are highest defined benefit plans in the private sector often base the retirement annuity on the average of workers last five years of earnings 6 in both csrs and fers the salary base is the average of the three highest consecutive years of federal pay sometimes called high3 pay7 g3g140g140g155g158g138g149g561g20g138g157g142g561 the accrual rate is the percentage of the salary base that worker earns in pension benefits for each year of service under fers benefits accrue at the rate of 10 per year worker with 30 years of service will have accrued pension benefit equal to 30 of the fers salary base which is the average of the workers highest three consecutive years of pay8 employees with 20 or more years of federal service who retire at age 62 or later are credited with fers accrual rate of 11 for each year of service resulting in higher replacement rate for example worker covered by fers who retires at 61 with 29 years of servic would receive fers annuity equal to 29 of high3 average pay delaying retirement by one year would increase the annuity to 33 of high3 average pay federal employees covered under csrs accrue pension benefits at rates that increase with length of service under csrs benefits accrue at the rate 15 for each of the first five years of service 175 in years six through 10 and 20 for each year of service after the tenth year 9 this results in retirement annuity equal to 5625 of the csrs salary base for worker who retires with 30 years of service

congress intended fers to be complete retirement package comprising three components social security the fers annuity and the thrift savings plan because social security retirement benefits cannot begin before age 62 congress included in this package of benefits temporary source of income for federal workers who retire before age 62 this fers supplement is paid until age 62 to workers who retire at age 55 or older with at least 30 years of service or at 6 if earnings rise each year the average of the five highest years of pay will be lower than the average of the three highest years 7 this calculation is based on nominal current dollars rather than indexed constant dollars 8 under fers members of congress congressional staff and certain public safety workers accrue benefits at the rate of 17 per year for the first 20 years of service and 10 per year for service over 20 years these rates yield pension equal to 34 of the fers salary base after 20 years of service and 44 after 30 years of service provide that both the age and length of service requirements for retirement with full fers annuity have been met 9 under csrs initial benefits are capped at 80 of high3 average salary members of congress and congressional staff accrue benefits at the rate of 25 for each year of service this yields an annuity equal to 75 of the csrs salary base after 30 years of service certain public safety workers accrue benefits at 25 per year for up to 20 years of service and 20 per year for service beyond 20 years

retirement comparable to that which he or she had while working the adequacy of retirement income is often measured by calculating the ratio of retirement income to the workers salary in the last year of employment this measure called the replacement rate is expressed by the following ratio annual retirement benefits annual preretirement earnings because retirees do not have the expenses that are associated with being employed most people are able to maintain their previous standard of living with less income than they had while working many financial analysts recommend that retirees attempt to replace 70 to 80 of their preretirement income adjusted for inflation in order to maintain their accustomed standard of living in retirement workers who had lowwage jobs generally need replacement rate near the high end of this range because relatively high proportion of their income is spent on nondiscretionary items such as food clothing shelter health care and taxes 10 under both csrs and

table 6 and table 7 the replacement rates have been estimated for an employee who retires on december 31 2026 at age 62 after 20 years of service under fers the results presented in each of the

actual rates of return on an employees tsp account will vary from year to year and over 30 years an employee could achieve average rates of return that are higher or lower than the results shown here moreover many employees begin their careers contributing little or nothing to the tsp and gradually increase their contributions as their incomes increase and as they become more aware of the need to save for retirement consequently these examples should be regarded as illustrations only

for federal employee who begins his or her career in 2007 and retires after 30 years of service the fers basic annuity will provide firstyear retirement income equal to about 32 of the workers final annual salary see table 4 and table 5 the dollar amount of the annuity will be higher for higherpaid employees but the replacement rate will be approximately the same regardless of the employees final salary level the replacement rate of social security benefits however declines as workers income increase s the benefit formula for social security is tilted in favor of lowwage workers therefore the percentage of earnings replaced by social security is greater for lowwage workers than for highwage workers 21 the lower rate of income replacement provided to highwage workers by social security is one of the main reasons why these workers need higher rate of personal saving in order to reach the same total income replacement rate as lower paid workers are able to attain through the combination of the fers retirement annuity and social security for federal worker retiring at the gs4 salary level at age 62 after 30 years of federal employment monthly social security benefits will replace an estimated 25 of final salary see table 4 and table 5 for worker retiring at the gs8 salary the replacement rate for social security drops to 22 of final pay for worker retiring at the gs12 salary level social security will replace only 19 of final pay social security will replace just 14 of final pay for worker who retires at the gs15 salary level the proportion of preretirement income that will be replaced by converting the employees thrift savings plan into retirement annuity will depend on the balance in the account and the interest rate at which the account balance is converted to an annuity the account balance at 20 the real rates of return are derived as follows 1061028 1031 and 1081028 1051 21 social security is intended to replace relatively higher percentage of careeraverage pay for lowwage workers than for highwage workers in part because congress recognized when designing the program that lowwage workers are less able to save for retirement

for an employee who contributes 5 of pay over 30year career an 80 annual rate of return on investment would result in tsp account balance that when converted to retirement annuity would by itself

rate of return 10 employee contribution to the tsp over 30year career would result in replacement rate from the tsp of approximately 45 of final pay see table 4 when combined with the fers basic

table 6 and table 7 show the estimated replacement rates achieved by the combination of the fers basic annuity social security and the tsp for an employee who retires at age 62 after 20 years of service under fers note that the social security benefits shown in all examples are only those that the worker earned during the period that he or she was federal employee for worker retiring at 62 with 20 years of service the basic fers retirement annuity would replace about 21 of final earnings regardless of the gslevel from which he or she retires because social securitys benefit structure favors lowwage employees social security benefits replace higher percentage of final earnings for worker retiring at the low end of the general schedule than for one who retires from job at the high end of the pay scale social security benefits earned during 20year period of federal employm ent would replace approximately 21 of final earnings for worker who retires from job at the gs4 level compared to replacement rate of 18 at the gs8 level 15 at the gs12 level and 12 at the gs15 level see table 6 and table 7 the estimates presented in table 6 and table 7 make clear that the fers retirement annuity and social security benefits accumulated over 20year period would not provide level of retirement income that would meet the minimum 70 replacement rate recommended by most financial advisors in these examples the combined replacement rates achieved by the fers annuity and the social security benefits attributable to the workers period of federal service range from 35 for highlypaid employee to 44 for lesserpaid employee for employees who make voluntary contributions to the thrift savings plan the tsp would add negligible amount to these replacement rates for an employee with 20 years of service who makes contributions to the tsp the agency automatic 1 contribution would replace about 2 of final pay based on 60 annual rate of return see table 6 assuming 80 annual investment return the agency automatic contribution would still replace only 2 of pay for an employee retiring after 20 years of service see table 7 the estimates displayed in table 6 and table 7 also show that worker who participates in the tsp only during the 20 years immediately preceding retirement will achieve much lower income replacement rate than an employee who participates for 30 years table 6 shows that an employee contributing 5 of pay and earning 6 annual rate of return would be able to replace

average 30 per year over those 22 years the retirees firstyear annuity of 4000 would be worth only about 2100 in 2007 dollars23 in contrast to the example just cited the value of defined contribution plan like the tsp can continue to grow throughout an individuals working life regardless of how often he or she changes jobs if the employee in the example above had contributed the maximum permissible amount to the tsp each year and the contributions had earned an average rate of return of 6 the tsp account would have reached value of approximately 65000 after 10 years24 if the departing employee were to leave this money invested in the tsp or transfer it to another taxdeferred retirement account this sum would co ntinue to grow until the employee withdrew the funds 25 assuming that the funds earned relatively modest annual return of 60 the total will rise to 279000 by the time this individual reached age 65 at current interest rates this would be sufficient to

replacement recommended by pension analysts from the benefits paid by social security and the fers basic retirement annuity but this is not so for higherwage federal workers federal employees at all income levels can significantly boost their retirement income by contributing to the tsp and such contributions are essential in order for those in the upper third of the federal pay scale to achieve
