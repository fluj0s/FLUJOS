pension plan must be joint and survivor annuity with at least 50 survivor benefit retirement plan must comply with the terms of qualified domestic relations order qdro issued by state court that divides retirement benefits between the parties to divorce the written consent of both spouses must be secured in order for married participant in defined cont ribution plan to name anyone other than his or her spouse as the beneficiar if the participant were to die and the default form of annuity in defi ned contribution plan that offers this form of benefit must be joint and survivor annuity retirement benefits for federal employees are governed by chapters 83 csrs and 84 fers of title 5 of the united states code these chapters establish rights of the spouse or former spouse of current or former federal em ployee that are similar in many respects to those established by erisa for privatesector plans however there are few important differences for example like erisa title 5 requires the default form of benefit under csrs and fers to be joint and survivor annuity and both erisa and title 5 require the written consent of th participant and s pouse in order to waive the survivor annuity on the other hand while both erisa and title 5 allow pension to be divided between the parties to divorce the laws differ with respect to when pension payments to the former spouse can begin under erisa court can require plan to begin paying benefits to the former spouse when the plan participant has reached the earliest retirement age under the plan regard less of whether the participant has yet retired4 in contrast even if state court d ecree of divorce or annulment has awarded share of federal employees retirement annu ity to former spouse title 5 prohibits payment of any part of csrs or fers annuity to former spouse until the employee has separated from federa l service is eligible to receive csrs or fers annuity and has applied for an annuity5 another difference between erisa and title 5 is in the designation of beneficiaries in defined contribution plans erisa re quires married participant in defined contribution plan to secure the written consent of his or her spouse in order to name anyone other than the spouse as the plan beneficiary in the ev ent of the participants death in contrast federal re gulations allow participant in the thrift savings plan for federal
