and is system which makes use of reduced performance lots of 84 mm ffv65 heat cartridges restricted from live shoulder firing in the carl gustaf weapon the mine is remotely operated from safe distance making the shoulderfire restriction irrelevant the mine is characterised as oneshot horizontal effect standoff weapon designed to attack moving targets such as vehicles afvs and tanks by means of projected shaped charge warhead the mine is suitable for both offensive and defensive operations and is designed as simple easily emplaced weapon which can complement existing defensive minefields other suitable uses for the c14 mine are as delaying tactic to close narrow defiles lanes of approach or crossing choke points description see figures 1 and 2 2the mine is packed in wirebound box and consists of amodified at4 launch tube containing cartridge 84 mm ffv65 heat btripod assembly cpercussion firing device dnonel shock tube 100 m with igniter assembly etrip wire 100 m and fbraided cotton pull cord 10 m modified at4 launch tube see figure 1 3the launch tube is standard swedish ffv at4 barrel assembly constructed of fibreglass reinforced plastic with an aluminum alloy venturi the standard at4 trigger mechanism has been replaced by squib activated assembly see figure 4 and minor changes have been incorporated in the launch tube chamberventuri area to accommodate standard 84 mm ffv65 heat cartridges each end of the launch tube is jilted with rubber bumperblowout seal assembly to provide internal protection against moisture and foreign object contamination note these seals are left in place for firing 4a ball socket adapter is fitted at the launcher point of balance to allow attachment of tripod assembly locking lever allows both units to be attached quickly and without the use of tools the original at4 sights have been retained and are of an adjustable pop up rifle type when not in use the sights are folded down and protected by sliding plastic covers the front sight has three aiming posts to aid alignment on either stationary or moving targets in the off route mine role the centre aiming post is normally used the rear sight is graduated from 100 to 500 metres in 50 metres click increments and is of the sliding aperture type two sizes of aperture are incorporated with the larger size designed for either low light or battle emergency sighting conditions tripod assembly see figure 1 5the tripod is conventional in design and is used in sweden with the ffv area defence mines types ffv013 and 016 the tripod is attached to the launch tube by inserting the tripod ball in the adapter and clamping the unit in place with the locking leverc74345bf0ta000 2note due to the length and inherent instability of the launch tube the tripod legs should be firmly entrenched or secured in place by sandbags or equivalent means when siting and setting up the equipment percussion igniter see figure 3 6the percussion igniter is standard swedish army firing device designated as model m42p the device may be activated either by pressure or by tripwire pull on the trigger pin figure 1 mine off route 84 mm c14 assemblyc74345bf0ta000 3 figure 2 mine off route 84 mm c14 packaging detail figure 3 firing device m42pc74345bf0ta000 4nonel shock tube assembly 7the shock tube assembly consists of 100 metre length of olive drab coloured polyethylene tubing which is fitted with percussion cap at one end and squibpropellant charge unit at the other the tubing is coated internally with thin layer of finely powdered hmx explosive composition which when properly initiated transmits low intensity shock wave signal along its length at approximately 1900 to 2000 metres per second the light explosive loading of 15 to 20 milligrams per metre ensures that the explosive signal does not disrupt the tubing but is of sufficient intensity to activate the mine percussion firing mechanism when augmented by the squibpropellant charge assembly see figure 4 trip wire 8a 100metre coil of 25 swg steel trip wire is provided to facilitate remote or tar get selfactivation of the mine assembly note that the trip wire is of standard variety and is interchangeable with trip wire used with the m49a1 trip flare cord cotton 9a 10metre roll of waterproof braided cotton cord is provided for use with the p ercussion igniter or for general applications such as attaching the launch tube to objects other than the tripod eg trees or fences safety features storage and transport 10the mine assembly safety features incorporate aa launcher transport safety pin which locks the firing mechanism firing pin away from the cartridge primer cap bdisassembly and separate stowage of the firing device and shock tube within the package and ctwo independent safety devices in the warhead fuze to hold the electric detonator out of line with the main explosive filling and out of contact with the electrical circuitc74345bf0ta000 5 figure 4 squib housing and firing mechanism assemblyc74345bf0ta000 6inflight warhead safety 11on firing two setback sleeves are released by accelerati on forces in excess of 5000 g the detonator rotor is immobilized by setback force and cannot rotate into the armed position until the warhead has left the launch tube full arming is completed at between 7 and 15 metres from the launch tube muzzle small electrical charges generated by the piezoelectric assembly on firing setback and when firing through light undergrowth are dissipated by two parallel circuit bleeder resistors solid strike on hard target surface is required to generate voltages in excess of the resistor threshold limits and initiate the electric fuze detonator functioning 12with the mine assembled in ready to fire configuration the following actions occur athe percussion firing device fires the percussion cap when the trip wire is pulled bflash from the percussion cap is picked up and transmitted as rapid explosive signal along the nonel shock tube to initiate the squibpropellant charge within the launcher firing mechanism cgas pressure from the squibpropellant charge acts on the freefloating piston see figure 4 to drive the firing rod forward against the bevelled head of the firing pin this action in turn forces the firing pin down to strike the percussion primer located in the side wall of the ffv65 cartridge case dthe percussion primer ignites in turn the cartridge igniter and main propellant charges resultant rapid gas pressure buildup ruptures the plastic blowout disc in the rear of the cartridge and simultaneously drives the projectile from the launch tube ejection of gas through the rear launch tube venturi acts to balance the recoil forces generated by the moving projectile and thus neutralise rearward motion of the launcher there is backblast danger area of 60 m to the rear of the launch tube as result of this action eadditional detail on 84 mm ffv65 ammunition may be found in cfto c74315eaota000 parts 2 and 3

operational training bgl304003ts0a1 volume 3 part 1 training safety and applicable range standing orders aobserve minimum 60 m danger area to the rear of the mine extending out at an angle of 45 degrees to the sides from the launch tube venturi ensure that all material equipment and friendly troops are kept clear of this area bmaximum distance to the intended target should not exceed 150m as the projectile tends to lose stability and accuracy beyond this distance censure that target area is provided with solid backstop to activate warheads in the event of target miss dthe warhead becomes armed at distance of between 7 and 15 metres from the launch tube however to ensure maximum warhead function the minimum target distance should be approximately 20 m ethe warhead has shaped charge effect and moderate fragment hazard all personnel should observe remote firing procedures and be under suitable cover when operating system the nonel shock tube firing assembly should be extended to the full 100metre length whenever possible and firing points should not be located forward of the launch tube fdo not cut or otherwise modify the shock tube assembly as increased failures will result gensure that the launch tube is securely anchored to preven t inadvertent movement off original target setting misfires 22misfires may be caused by any one of or combination of the following aa faulty firing device mechanism or percussion cap ba faulty squib assembly cdampness breaks knots or kinks in nonel shock tube da faulty firing mechanism on launch tube ea failure to remove launch tube transport safety pin jammed mechanism fa faulty ffv 65 cartridge primer misfire procedures 23the following procedures are applicable before investigating any of the foregoing misfires aobserve minimum
