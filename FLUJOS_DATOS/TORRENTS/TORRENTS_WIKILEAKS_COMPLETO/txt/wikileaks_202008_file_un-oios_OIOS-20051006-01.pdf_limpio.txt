services unhcr audit service review of retrenchment benefits for unhcr implement ing partner staff in pakistan ar200513106 executive summary in june 2005 at the request of unhcr oios conduct ed review of retrenchment benefits claimed by unhcr implementing partner ip staff in pakista n draft memorandum was shared with the director bureau for caswaname and with the represe ntative in pakistan the comments of the representative which were received in august 2005 are reflected in this final memorandum policy unhcr has so far not established retrenchment ben efit policy for its implementing partners the representative stressed that unhcr needs an overall policy on the payment of retrenchment benefits and that the criteria for payment if the policy dictates that payment will be made must be precise clear and applicable to all countries it was also stressed that it should be firm commitment paid under separate lois from funds tha t are specifically provided for that purpose oios will further look into the issue and prepare separate report on the retrenchment benefit payments to unhcr ips staff in general that will include suggestions regarding an overall policy with regard to the funding and method of im plementation lessons can be learned from the previous payments in pakistan previous payments in the past unhcr funded retrenchment benefits in p akistan during two distinct periods that of 1991 to 1996 and that of 2003 to 2005 the method f funding and implementation as well as the actual beneficiaries were substantially different i n the periods concerned funding and implementation for the period from 1991 to 1996 unhcr funded the retrenchment benefits totalling us32 million through specific lois and projects 92ap pakcm209 and 95appakcm209 were formulated to implement the payments it was unhcr pakistans intention to conclude unhcrs obligations by stating in the 1995 loi that this will bring to conclusion unhcrs obligations to pay retrenchment benefits to all pro ject staff hired under its assistance projects the intention to stop the payment of retrenchment b enefits was further made explicit by the subsequent change of salaries in subproject budget s to allowancesstipends in 1996 and the change in section 606 of the governing clauses ex plicitly excluding termination benefits between 1997 and 2001 the representative was of the opinion that the paym ents already made created precedent for the payment of retrenchment benefits between january 2003 and january 2005 the funding of retrenchment benefits totalling more than us200000 came from project savings in car and maintenance projects these 3 payments created precedent for the payment of r etrenchment benefits in the sense that they allowed for ad hoc payments from funds saved unde r care and maintenance projects on the other hand the payments were carried out after ips individually negotiated with unhcr pakistan and only upon availability of such projec t savings unhcrs financial obligation was thus limited to the total amount provided for in th related subproject budgets beneficiaries projects 92 and 95appakcm209 intended to pay re trenchment benefits only to retrenched ip staff however this did not happen payments were also made to ip staff who continued to work under unhcr subprojects the actual number of staf f who continued working under unhcr subprojects is not known but it is likely to be t he larger part of those that were paid from 2003 the ips paid staff at retrenchment only legal situation firm legal liability to pay retrenchment benefits could not be established for unhcr pakistan or its ips the standard unhcr governing clauses t hat exclude such liabilities were included in the subagreements oios could not establish the applicability of the w est pakistan industrial and commercial employment standing orders ordinance 1968 or an other available pakistan labour case law to unhcr or its ips and neither bo islamabad n or its ips could provide documentary evidence or otherwise demonstrate unhcrs liability or that of its ips none of the local ips and only few of the interna tional ips included provision granting retrenchment benefits in the contracts with their s taff in most of the contracts reviewed by oios the payment of benefits in excess of the lump sum s alary was specifically excluded the representative argued that decision not to pa retrenchment benefits based on the lack of legal obligation would not be realistic and woul d put the progress made on solutions staff and property of unhcr at risk other factors that may effect unhcrs position ips expect unhcr to provide for the funds to pay fo r retrenchment benefits in the future in addition unhcr pakistan has been under the impress ion that it is legally liable to do so following the advice of its local legal advisor th payments made between 2003 and 2005 as result of that impression indicated the intention to pay for future retrenchment benefit claims and thus created certain precedent retrenchment benefits were except for those paid i n 1992 and 1995 not provided for in sub project budgets since most ips implement projects that are funded exclusively by unhcr it would be unrealistic to expect them to provide for the funds to pay for retrenchment benefits in its reply the representative provided strong po litical arguments to pay retrenchment benefits these included maintaining good relationships with the gop and the ips while comprehensive solutions are discussed at the highest level in s pirit of mutual trust and respect in addition the representative pointed to the perception that ip st aff were unhcr staff and the expectation that unhcr would pay retrenchment benefits pressure on unhcr pakistan included numerous demonstrations almost daily news articles and even hunger strike 4 unhcrs estimated liability the grand total financial liability of us36 milli on was an estimate made by the ips which had not been validated by unhcr the amount consisted f backlog payment of us650000 benefits not yet paid to former staff that had been retrenched since 1996 and accumulated potential benefits of us295 million benefits c alculated from 1996 for staff who were still working under subprojects some 74 per cent of the total amount related to two partners only namely befare us 16 million and car us 11 llion oios stressed that the accumulated potential benef its represented payment that was not due andor payable simply because the related staff we re not retrenched yet oios recommended paying retrenchment benefits only upon retrenchment and cautioned against payment of 13 th month salary in lieu of future retrenchment benefit s the payment of the benefit at retrenchment will spread the financial burden over number of ears making the exercise more manageable and reducing the risk of abuse the representative pointed out that retrenchment be nefits should be paid through separate lois established for that purpose oios cautions against retroactive payments to ip st aff who were retrenched prior to 2006 because it would be difficult to determine the elig ibility of those staff ten years have passed since the last formal payments took place and some ips that have retrenched staff may not even be working for unhcr pakistan anymore the payment of the benefits to some may create an unwanted precedent and result in claims from form er project staff of whom there are records available to verify their eligibility bo islamabad agreed that retroactive payments shoul d not be made square4 october 2005 5

introduction general 1 from 19 to 30 june 2005 oios conducted review of the retrenchment benefits for unhcr implementing partner ip staff in pakistan 2 unhcr requested the review which was conducted i n accordance with the following terms of reference for oios to assess the reasonableness of the assump tions on which unhcr bases its financial liabilities to pay retrenchment benefits to staff of implementing partners and to determine whether unhcr complies with the applicable regulations rul and other legally binding documents for oios to assess whether the modalities and metho ds used to calculate retrenchment benefits are reasonable and for oios to advise on the steps to be taken to ensu re the accuracy and completeness of the calculation of future liabilities 3 the findings contained in this memorandum have b een discussed with the officials responsible for the reviewed activities during the exit conference held on 1 july 2005 draft of the memorandum was then shared with the director b ureau for caswaname and with the representative in pakistan the comments of the re presentative which were received in august 2005 are reflected in this final memorandum b retrenchment benefits in pakistan 4 pakistan hosted one of the largest refugee popul ations in the world more than 3 million refugees and unhcr spent approximately us12 bill ion over the course of 25 years to assist refugees in the country the three most important ears in terms of mass repatriation to afghanistan were 1988 1992 and 2002 5 from 1990 to 1992 series of staffing review xercises took place in order to rationalize and consolidate the programme activities in 1992 unhcr pakistans rationalization strategy provided grounds for the consolidation of camps and sectoral activities this resulted in reduction and separation of staff in light of which unhcr pakistan provided retrenchment benefits for the government of pakistan gop and i p staff the payment process was carried out under special retrenchment benefit projects 92 abpakcm209 and 95appakcm209 and totalled us 32 million 6 following the mass repatriation that started in 2002 23 million refugees from 2002 to 2004 unhcr pakistan embarked again on reduction of projects and consequently the retrenchment of ip staff without retrenchment be nefit policy in place and taking into consideration funding constraints ips paid retrenc hment benefits from 2003 to 2005 with the consent of unhcr under care and maintenance projec ts from project savings project 7 savings are amounts set out in subproject budgets for specific purposes that have not been used for the intended purpose the staff retrenched bet ween 2002 and 2004 were limited in number so that the related costs could be covered by these project savings 7 since 2004 the situation has changed dramaticall and reflects strategy to explore and identify comprehensive solutions with gradual but c onsistent reduction of care and maintenance activities and associated ip staff the numbers of staff to be retrenched are ever increasing and even if available project savings may not be suf ficient to cover the costs unhcrs alleged retrenchment benefit liability was estimated at som us36 million 8 ii findings and recommendations c p revious payments agreementconsensus to pay 8 there was established retrenchment benefit po licy in unhcr operations in the case of the pakistan operation the level at which an ag reement or consensus was reached was substantially different for the two relevant period s in this review the period from 1991 to 1996 and the period from 2003 to 2005 in the former per iod the payments followed high level meeting between unhcr wfp undp and the government of pakistan gop and the subsequent approval by the prime minister of the pr oposed modalities and criteria for the payment of retrenchment benefits in the latter per iod unhcr pakistan agreed to the payment of retrenchment benefits following requests from at least seven ips and the gop 9 the representative stressed that in the future hcr needs to establish an overall policy or policies on the payment of retrenchment b enefits that will be applicable to all countries the criteria for payment if the policy dictates th at payment will be made must be precise and clear b funding and implementation 10 for the period between 1991 and 1996 funding w as obtained through specific letters of instruction and projects 92appakcm209 and 95a ppakcm209 were formulated to implement the payments oios was of the opinion tha t these payments did not create precedent for the payment of retrenchment benefit s in pakistan the 1995 letter of instruction made clear reference to unhcrs intention to conclu its obligations by stating this will bring to conclusion unhcrs obligations to pay re trenchment benefits to all project staff hired under its assistance projects the intention to discontinue the payment of retrenc hment benefits was further made explicit by the subsequent changin g of salaries in subproject budgets to allowancesstipends in 1996 any staff retained in 1996 will not be working u nder employment contracts per and remuneration will be in the f orm of allowancesstipends and the change of section 606 of the governing clauses in 1997 s discussed later these decisions would normally limit unhcrs obligations to those provide d for in future subproject budgets 11 the representative felt that the abovementioned pa yments between 1991 and 1996 did create precedent the mere fact that unhcr paid indicated that unhcr was willing and able to pay the act of payment set the precedent 12 between january 2003 and january 2005 the fund ing of retrenchment benefits came from project savings in care and maintenance projects and therefore substantially different methodology was used to implement the payment of re trenchment benefits these payments did create precedent for the payment of retrenchment benefits in the sense that they were not limited by specific requirements set out in speci fic loi but rather open to ad hoc use of available savings under care and maintenance projec ts it should be noted however that the payments were carried out after ips individually ne gotiated with unhcr pakistan and only in 9 cases where such savings were available unhcrs financial obligation was thereby limited to the total amount provided for in the subproject bu dgets c beneficiaries 13 projects 92appakcm209 and 95appakcm209 provided for the payment of retrenchment benefits to limited amount of benefi ciaries all of whom would first and foremost have to be retrenched however the payments were m ade to staff who continued to work under unhcr subprojects although the actual number of s taff that continued working under unhcr subprojects is not known it is likely to be the larger part of those that received retrenchment benefits total of us32 million wa s paid to ips under retrenchment benefit sub projects substantial portion of which was paid t staff who were not retrenched in the future the payment of retrenchment benefits to staff not ctually retrenched should be avoided 14 from 2003 the ips adhered to the main criterio n for payment of retrenchment benefits and paid staff at retrenchment only d justifications 15 the justifications for paying retrenchment bene fits were documented for 1995 in the email to hq covering project 95appakcm209 and included the following justifications that may well be applicable throughout the pakistan operation 1 maintaining good relationships with ips including the gop 2 the fact that payi ng retrenchment benefits is an obligation to which unhcr feels committed 16 apart from the above there was little document ation regarding the justifications for paying retrenchment benefits and an adequate justificatio n for the payment of retrenchment benefits to staff who were not retrenched was not found d unhcr s legal situation 17 the oios review confirmed that there was est ablished legal obligation for unhcr pakistan to provide funds for retrenchment benefits the standard unhcr governing clauses with the exception of section 606 between 1997 an d 2001 that clearly exclude such liabilities were included in the subagreements liabilities and budgetary provisions 18 the governing clauses included the standard unh cr clauses with regard to liabilities and budgetary provisions as is the case for unhcr in g eneral the clauses place the onus on the ips to comply with all laws of the country and they lim it unhcrs financial responsibility to the amounts provided for and the related purposes to that reflected in the subproject budgets the standard governing clauses in the subagreements we re different than those normally used in unhcrs operations 10 b clauses with regard to ip personnel 19 the standard governing clauses in respect of ip personnel included in the subagreements regarding the responsibilities of the government or agency to present flat monthly rate in sub project budgets to cover staff costs as well as th eir responsibility to cover any additional costs not provided for in the subproject budgets include d the following square6 the governmentagency shall meet all the costs of staff seconded or reassigned at levels commensurate with established scales and in accorda nce with generally accepted standards and practices as defined in the applicabl regulations 602 square6 the governmentagency shall for each post fully or partly funded by the high commissioner as part of this subagreement present flat monthly rate proforma costs which includes all salaries benefits and c osts payable at source eg overtime costs travel costs and per diem taxes social sec urity contributions housing costs and board hardship and other allowances 603 and square6 the governmentagency shall adhere to provisions c oncerning the number and costs of project staff in the sub project description and the budget attached to the unhcr standard agreement or as described in the short agr eement the costs of any unauthorized project staff or remuneration in exces s of the amounts agreed with the high commissioner and not provided for in the budget at tached to the agreement shall be borne by the governmentagency 607 20 unhcr pakistan did however change the wording in section 606 of the standard governing clauses between 1997 and 2001 which norm ally reads the government or agency shall square6 establish contracts with staff recruited or seconde d under the project governed by the unhcr agreement in accordance with the applicable regulations including inter alia description of duties and functional responsi bilities b remuneration including applicable benefits and employment termination indemnities 21 this provision was amended by article 214 of t he subproject agreement in 1997 to read excluding instead of including bo islamabad ggested that the standard section 606 of the governing clauses seems to imply that unhcr by re quiring ips to provide for employment termination indemnities in the contracts they estab lish with their staff acknowledges budgetary responsibility in that regard 22 as of 2001 and following gtzs query in this re gard1 the relevant clause was amended to read including and became the standard unhcr clau used in subagreements again the additional clause included in annex d of the subag reement since 19962 stipulating that anyall other benefits required to remunerate these and any other personnel costs shall be the full responsibility of the implementing partner as we ll as the related use of allowancesstipends 1 following gtzs objection to the implementation of this amendment in 2001 after they had signed the amended agreement from 1997 to 2001 article 214 was amended to read the matter of contract termin ation indemnities will be clarified at the soonest possib within the terms of the labour laws of the islam ic republic of pakistan 2 as of 1996 following the change from contracts to allowancesstipends an additional clause was incl uded in annex d of the subproject agreement stipulating t hat anyall other benefits required to remunerate these and any other personnel costs shall be the full responsib ility of the implementing partner 11 instead of contracts remained however placing th responsibility to cover the costs as provided for in the agreements with their staff on the ips 23 it is important to add in this regard that oios reviewed and compared unhcrs governing clauses with the governing clauses of oth er international organisations such as ilo unicef undp and wfp that have not paid retrenchme nt benefits at any point in time to see if the latter better safeguarded their immunities oio s found that this was not the case though ilos governing clauses included specific paragra ph 4 relating to personnel of the ips which was indeed more clear and concise than similar prov isions in unhcrs governing clauses the opposite could be stated with regard to the compari between unhcr and the other international organisations who were nevertheless never held liable to pay for retrenchment benefits l egal situation of unhcr s ip s 24 as the previous paragraph indicates unhcr did not maintain contractual relationship with ip staff if existing at all liability to p ay retrenchment benefits to ip staff could only be considered as indirect with regard to unhcr direct liability would lie with the ips 25 bo islamabad mentioned that although it is legally true that there is contractual relationship with ip staff there is perception t hat staff employed by the ips are unhcr staff and that unhcr agreed to pay retrenchment benefits in the past and has moral and legal obligation to do so now and in the future contractual arrangements between ips and their staff 26 oios was not able to review all the contracts b etween the ips and their staff as submitted during the mission it became clear however from t he contracts we did review that the type and the provisions in the various contracts differed bstantially several ips did not issue contracts to any of their staff at all 3 27 none of the local ips and only few of the int ernational ips included provision granting retrenchment benefits in their contracts to the co ntrary it was specifically stipulated in most contracts with reference to the unhcr agreement t hat all other claims and demands of any kind and in any form shall not be admissible nor pplicable b pakistan labour law 28 with regard to the ips alleged liability to pay retrenchment benefits reference has been made to the pakistan labour law andor the west pakistan industrial and commercial employment standing orders ordinance 1968 and more in particular in 2000 reference was made by unhcr pakistans local legal advisor to sec tion 12 6 of the latter regarding termination of employment 3 it is important to note in this regard that the g opunhcr rules of procedure for inservicepayment of retrenchment benefits to unhcrpaid staff as subm itted by letter dated 4 june 2005 read under parag raph i eligibility i unhcrpaid staff purely employed on contract basis will be eligible to receive the retrenchment benefits 12 29 unhcrs local legal advisor was previously and during our mission of the opinion that the abovementioned law applies to international ng and other nonprofit organisations and that unhcr and its ips were thus liable to pay retrenchment benefits the legal advisor of sharp unhcr ip whom oios consulted as well sh ared this opinion however neither of them were able to establish formal documented l egal link between the aforementioned law and unhcrs andor its ips liability thereunder or could even verbally explain in their opinion why the law that applies to industrial and commercial establishments would apply to unhcr andor on what other legal basis unhcr cou ld be considered liable to pay retrenchment benefits 30 oios repeatedly requested both legal advisors nd ips during various meetings to submit case law government instructions andor any other documentation that they would see relevant or applicable in this regard and that would provid us with information indicating unhcrs andor its ips liability under pakistan law to pa retrenchment benefits in addition we requested copies of other possibly relevant legal d ocuments such as the statutory rules of service conduct or discipline we have not recei ved any such documentation 31 oios concluded that firm legal liability to p ay retrenchment benefits could not be established for unhcr or its ips it was understood that the payment of retrenchment benefits is normally political decision in this regard bo islamabad felt strongly that unh cr has moral responsibility to its partners and its own st aff to pay these benefits in pakistan in light of that responsibility unhcr should establish specia l project which would guarantee the availability of funds to the extent possible and ar ticulate an unhcr policy on the payment of such benefits in the pakistan operation and elsewhe re f ther factors that may effect unhcr s position expectations of ips and intentions of unhcr pak istan 32 from our meetings with ips it was evident that there is an expectation that unhcr pakistan will provide the funds to pay for retrench ment benefits although it had been the intention of unhcr pakistan to avoid the payment of retrenchment benefits after 1996 the intention changed in 2001 after unhcrs local legal advisor advised that unhcr and its ips were liable to pay retrenchment benefits since the n unhcr pakistans continued intention to provide funds for retrenchment benefits was evident from its consent to the payments under unhcr subagreements during the period from 2003 to 2005 33 bo islamabad provided strong arguments to pay retre nchment benefits these included maintaining good relationships with the gop and the ips while comprehensive solutions are discussed at the highest level in spirit of mutua l trust and respect decision not to pay might in light of that actually put the progress made on solutions at risk compromising even the staff and property of unhcr bo islamabad mentioned that there had been numerous demonstrations almost daily news articles and even hunger strike furthermore as there may be donor fatigue which dictates the level of supp ort for continuing with business as usual and the incentive for unhcr and the gop to identify and implement durable solutions hospitality fatigue of the gop should be prevented by unhcr an d thus create an incentive to find comprehensive solutions 13 b provisions for staff costs in subproject budge ts 34 with regard to the funding of retrenchment bene fits after 1996 the provisions in sub project budgets did not include provision for ret renchment benefits while most ips operated under unhcr subagreements only it would therefore be unrealistic to assume that ips in particular the local ips could pay retrenchment be nefit costs without unhcr funding 35 on the other hand the amounts provided for sta ff costs in subproject budgets varied substantially between partners and were in most ca ses substantially higher than those of the related government salaries following oios sugges tion unhcr pakistan embarked on standardization process to benchmark the remunerati on of ip staff to ensure equal treatment during such an exercise it is obvious that the hig her remunerations cannot be lowered the lower remunerations will have to be increased therefore and subsequent to the standardization process some ip staff will receive an increase in their remunerations and these increased amounts will then become the denominator in the cal culation of retrenchment benefits ie one month salary for each completed year of service t his created yet another argument to deal with the payment of retrenchment benefits in conservat ive manner g estimated potential liabilities 36 during the review 22 ips resubmitted their timated potential retrenchment liabilities calculated as from 1996 to the end of 2005 car was not requested to and thus did not submit their estimates and related staffing lists because of the number of cells and project director health pdh offices at numerous locations the mos t recent unverified estimate of car was therefore included in the calculation 37 the grand total as per our calculation was us3 6 million including us650000 backlog request in respect of former staff who we re retrenched between 1996 and the present which was based on onemonth salary per completed ear of service since 1996 of the afore mentioned total us106 million related to car sta ff and us16 million to befare previously gtzbefare staff representing 74 per cent of the total estimated amount h ligibility accumulated potential retrenchment benefits nd backlog payments 38 for staff member to be eligible she must be retrenched ie their post must have been abolished this is the main criterion for retrench ment until 1996 and although actual retrenchment was requirement as per the respectiv lois this requirement was not complied with in practice instead the staff concerned conti nued to work with the ips they had thus received benefit to which they were not entitled yet the exclusion of any period prior to 1996 in the calculation of individual benefits endeavour s to make up for these erroneous pre payments made until 1996 39 however bo islamabad was considering paying re trenchment benefits to staff still working for the respective ips as accumulated pote ntial retrenchment benefits payments for the period from 1996 to present in addition to the bac klog request of us650000 for staff actually retrenched since 1996 it was envisaged that by pa ying off the backlog request and accumulated potential retrenchment benefits paym ents unhcr could close the issue and start afresh by for instance paying 13th month salari to avoid future retrenchment benefit claims 14 40 similar reasoning followed from the gopunhc r rules of procedure for inservice payment of retrenchment benefits to unhcrpaid staf f dated 4 june 2005 4 that would have resulted when implemented in the payment of accu mulated potential benefits to staff that were actually not retrenched the retrenchment benefits shall be paid to all eli gible employees for the preceding years in the months from january to march of the succeedi ng year provided funds are available with unhcr both unhc r safron agree to pay retrenchment benefits to all eligible unhcr paid em ployees until december 31 2004 subject to joint exercise by the unhcr islamabad safron division unhcr sub office and the concerned aroarrc as soon as possi ble and submission of list of eligible staff as per attached proforma 41 oios wishes to stress that retrenchment is defi ned as making an employee redundant in order to reduce costs retrenchment benefits are compensation for the loss of employment but do not constitute reward for years of service as such oios therefore strongly cautions against any payment of such benefits without actual loss of employment in the view of oios accumulated potential benefits represent paymen t that is not due andor payable simply because the related staff have not been retrenched yet such payment could not be seen as retrenchment benefit payment properly speaking ev if the calculation of the payment would be based on the formula normally used for the calcu lation of retrenchment benefit payments unhcr would pay for benefit that the beneficiary was not yet entitled to and may never become entitled to in case of resignation or retir ement 42 more importantly the accumulated potential be nefits payments would result in peak financial requirements in the year of implementatio n from an accountability point of view it would also be difficult to control such payments an d to prevent abuse furthermore staff could feel inclined to resign after they receive such preretrenchmentpayment whereas those staff that actually resigned between 1996 and 2005 would not have received the same resulting in unequal treatment i f urther considerations implementing partners matters to take into conside ration commissioner for afghan refugees car 43 unhcr pakistan properly monitored the most rece nt payments to retrenched car employees in quetta to ensure that only eligible s taff ie those retrenched were paid and that each individual payment was verified by unhcr staff the accountability of car in particular that of the pdh had been questioned for many years neither the cells nor the pdh had the capacity in their finance sections to establish ind ividual eligibility andor to perform the required calculations 4 paragraph ii v and iv ii respectively please n ote that these rules have not been signed by unhcr 15 b international ips 44 there were various differences between the inte rnational ips with regard to their potential liability to pay retrenchment benefits such as pas t retrenchment benefit payments the contractual status of their staff the existence of severanc pay policy split funding of staff costs the existence of multiple donors and salary packages 45 for example dacaar and hni had severance pa policy in place dacaar had been paying retrenchment benefits since 2000 scf s igned memorandum of understanding with the government and accrued termination benefit s since 1998 in addition 30 to 40 per cent of their 250 permanent staff were split funded by different donors arc cws and irc had other donors as well and they also applied split funding to some of their staff irc provided 13th month salaries and implemented handshake pro gramme for its regular staff but not for its casual workers amda paid retrenchment benefits fro m their own funds in 2004 when they retrenched staff all liabilities were cleared up to 31 december 2004 including those for staff that remained on the payroll amda thus paid accum ulated potential retrenchment benefits 46 the differences between the international ips were such that unhcr pakistan would have to consider the specific circumstances of each of t he ips before deciding on the payment of retrenchment benefits to project staff under unhcr subagreements also with regard to the extent of unhcrs funding factors such as multiple donors split funding of positions and the retrenchment policies of the respective partners sh ould be taken into account this could only be based upon clear and concise information obtained f rom the international partners and subsequent in depth negotiations 47 bo islamabad correctly mentioned that double standa rds should be avoided if decision is made to pay retrenchment benefits for example ips that did not provide for retrenchment benefits in employment contracts will also claim re trenchment benefits and cannot be excluded this being understood the circumstances of each in ternational ip should be examined because single policy will not provide equal treatment fo r all and will not be in the interest of unhcr past retrenchment benefit payments from other sourc split funding and the ips retrenchment policies should be taken into consideration to ensu re that the staff of ips are treated equally recommendation the unhcr representative in pakistan should if ret renchment benefits are to be paid consider the specific circumstances of each of its international implementing partners also with regard to the ext ent of unhcrs funding factors such as multiple donors split funding of positions and the retrenchment policies of the respective partners sh ould be taken into account rec 01 48 the representative agreed with this recommendation c local ips 49 the situation was much less complicated in the case of local ips most of them only worked under unhcr subagreements and the following criteria applied to all of them they had letters of appointment that did not provide for ret renchment benefits they had retrenchment 16 policies and they did not pay any benefits other t han the salary provisions as agreed with unhcr d implementation 50 there were two sets of payments under discussio n the first was the backlog payment of retrenchment benefits that comprised of retrenchmen t benefits to staff that were already retrenched the related retrenchment period is from 1996 to the date of retrenchment covering retrenchments within period of almost ten years which presented number of difficulties that included locating the people especially afghans th at returned to afghanistan and personnel files should unhcr provide funding for these payme nts it will have to do so through specific letter of instruction which should be implemented through subprojects specifically formulated for this purpose and not under care and maintenanc projects 51 oios cautioned against these retroactive paymen ts ten years have passed since the last formal payments and some ips that retrenched staff may not even be working for unhcr pakistan anymore the payment of the benefits to so staff may create an unwanted precedent and result in claims from former project staff for whom there are records available to verify their eligibility apart from these practical diffi culties the estimate of us 650000 was most probably an under estimation as the amount only in cluded benefits for retrenched staff of ips that were implementing projects for unhcr pakistan at the date of the audit 52 the representative agreed that retroactive payments should not be made but disagreed that the cut off date should be the date of for mal decision they suggested that retroactive payments should not be made to ip staff who were re trenched within the period 1996 to 2003 only ip staff retrenched since 2004 should therefor be paid they based their argument on the assumption that the decision to pay or not to pay c ould take months the payment of retrenchment benefits to ips staff retrenched sinc 2004 will result in much smaller backlog payment than the estimated us 650000 recommendation the unhcr representative in pakistan should request funding through separate letter of instruction and formulate separa retrenchment benefit projects if retrenchment benefits are to be paid to former implementing partner staff retrenched since 2004 rec 02 53 the second set of payments the payment of bene fits to staff at retrenchment would result in spread over number of years namely as and w hen staff are retrenched thus reducing the financial burden for unhcr as well as the risk of buse and making the exercise more manageable the numbers of staff that would be retr enched in each of the forthcoming years are not known bo islamabad was requested to provide s ome scenarios and provided estimations of the total obligations on the assumption that all re trenchments would take place in particular year on the aforementioned assumption bo islam abad estimated the total obligations at us 700000 in 2005 us 1 million in 2006 and us 13 million in 2007 oios however is of the opinion that the estimated increase from 2005 to 20 06 that is above 40 per cent and the increase from 2006 to 2007 30 per cent is too much becaus the increase should only reflect the additional period served that is one month of retr enchment benefit for one of year of service taking into consideration that staff on board in 19 96 10 years ago were paid the maximum period of accumulative benefits could not exceed 12 years therefore less than one years 17 salary would have accrued as retrenchment benefits to staff member by 2005 for subsequent years benefits would therefore also not accumulate at more than one months salary per year that is less than 10 per cent 112 54 therefore and to illustrate the spread of the f inancial burden oios considered bo islamabads 2005 estimate of us 700000 as basis and added one month of salary 112 for the following years that is already an overestimat as explained above assuming again that all staff are retrenched in particular year the tota l estimated obligations would be us 760000 in 2006 us 820000 in 2007 us 900000 in 2008 us 980000 in 2009 and us 1 million in 2010 also we took the scenario that ip staff are retrenched proportionately over period of time for instance that all staff are retrenched over period of two to five years one half of the staff in 2006 and the remaining half in 2007 two third of the staff in each of the years 2006 to 2008 three quarter of the staff in each of the years 2006 to 2009 and four fifth of the staff in each of years 2006 to 2010 us scenario description 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 total 1 half in each of 2006 and 2007 380000 410000 790000 2 third in each of the years 2006 to 2008 250000 270000 300000 820000 3 quarter in each of the years 2006 to 2009 190000 205000 225000 245000 870000 4 fifth in each of the years 2006 to 2010 150000 160000 180000 200000 200000 890000 this table is merely an indication of possible paym ent scenarios it should not be read or used for planning or budgetary purposes 55 oios was of the opinion that the payments could be implemented under care and maintenance projects the retrenchment costs would be largely compensated by corresponding reductions in staff costs retrenchment costs would exceed the staff costs provided for in the subproject budget only for staff who have served m ore than twelve years for staff who have served twelve years or less the staff costs provid ed for in the previous subproject budget would be sufficient to cover the retrenchment costs this would avoid expenditure peaks and would allow for gradual reduction of the subproject bu dgets over number of years 56 the representative stated that care and maintenance budgets were subject to regular and sometimes substantial reductions that may prevent t he payment of retrenchment benefits in the view of the representative should unhcr decide to pay there should be firm commitment and payment should be made under separate lois as had been the case in 1992 and 1995 57 oios is open as to the funding mechanism as long s benefits are restricted to those implementing partner staff who loose their employm ent as result of retrenchment recommendation the unhcr representative in pakistan should in the future only provide for retrenchment benefits in subproject budgets and or letters of instruction if these benefits are to be paid at retrenchment f unds should be provided for payments in lieu of potential future benefits rec 03 18 calculation of retrenchment benefit liabilities and verification of payments 58 the calculation of the actual retrenchment bene fits payable to retrenched staff is cumbersome exercise for which neither the ips nor u nhcr pakistan have the capacity even if the potential liability is only calculated for staf f to be retrenched within specified period of implementation eg one year it would take lot of time and effort 59 for this reason oios suggested that bo islamabad engage private audit firm in accordance with the relevant procurement procedures to assist in the calculation of the retrenchment benefit liability and in the verificat ion of payments to the retrenched staff the representative agreed to this suggestion 60 in light of this it is important to note that b islamabad has already engaged private audit firm one of the largest auditing firms in p akistan through competitive bidding procedure to conduct the auditing of its ips exclu ding car which have expressed its interest to assist in this matter iii acknowledgement 61 i wish to express my appreciation for the assis tance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and its implementing partners in pakistan egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of
