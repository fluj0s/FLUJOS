decisionmakers need to know about and how the csir should respond keynote address clean south africa presented at the csir conference science real and relevant 18 november 2008 pretoria dr anthony turton natural resource and environment unit fellow aturtoncsircoza south africa is fledgling democracy with turbulent history that history is cocktail of good and bad of success and failu re but it has provided us with rich incubator for ingenuity to the simple question is what role should national science council like the council for scientific and indus trial research csir play in south africas fledgling democracy while this question seems simple at first glance it is in fact highly complex so it is my intention to unravel that complexity in way that creates space for fruitful debate in the near future i will start th at process by focussing on certain fundamental drivers that impact on every citizen of this country in the belief that by understanding those drivers we can collectively make sensible decisions about answering the question i have posed above for purposes of my argument i intend to fo cus on three fundamental drivers that we all need to be aware of i will present an argument for the preser vation of our capacity to generate ingenuity this logic will then be filtered through c onceptual tool that has been developed at the csir called the tr ialogue model in order to gain sufficient insight for us to collectively answer the stion i have posed but more specifically to identify three strategic wa ter quality issues that cisionmakers need to know about the current social and economic wellbeing of south africa has three fundamental drivers that have shaped the processes of development to date and will continue to shape those processes as we move into the future these three drivers are things we simply cannot change they are so powerful that if we fail to recognize them then all of our efforts at solutionseeking will mount to naught at least in my professional opinion csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 2driver 1 dilution capacity the most important driver is the climate and in particular our precipitation patterns map 1 shows the mean annual precipitation map for the entire southern african re gion few important aspects immediately become evident when one examines the data on that map the most striking feature is the spatial distribution patterns of rainfall with steep gradient from north to south and from east to west more subtle f eature is the global average of 860 mmyr shown as thick red line on map 1 signifi cantly three of the most economically developed countries in the southern african development community sadc mainland region south africa botswana nd namibia are all on the wrong side of this global average even more subtle is the national average shown in parenthesis under each country name on the map s outh africa has paltry 497 mmyr marginally better than bots wana with 400 mmyr and somewhat better than namibia with mere 254 mmyr this has led to conclude that water scarcity is fundamental developmental constraint not only to south africa but also to the entire sadc region ashton turton 2005 2008 turton 2008a turton ashton 2008 map 1 mean annual precipitation map in the southern african region courtesy of prof peter ashton the situation becomes more interesting than this however because it is not only the availability of water that is constraint but also the allocation of it in this regard south africa has allocated around 98 of the national water resource at high assurance of supply nwrs 2004 this is highly significant because the data used in the national water resource strate gy was from 1998 making it somewhat outdated and i am on record as saying th at i do not believe we can measure these things as accurately as this turton 2007 in essence then for purposes of the 10020030040050060070080090010001250150020002500mean annual rainfall mm namibia 254 botswana 400 south africa

development and thus soci wellbeing will be constrained by this one fundamental fact that few have as yet grasped an important implication of this fundamental fact is that south africa has lost its dilution capacity so all pollutants and effluent streams will increasingly need to be treated to ever higher standards before be ing discharged into communal waters or deposited in landfills this gives us very hard set of choices that need to be made either we need to change our current velopmental trajectory and accept that the targets specified in the accelerated and sh ared growth initiative for south africa asgisa 2006 are simply unobt ainable or we have ra dical rethink about how to mobilize the science engineering and technology set cap acity of the south african nation in concerted effort designed to support the targets specified in asgisa the decision is not actually difficult to make because if we accept the former option then we can say with reasonable degree of certainty that social instability will grow and south africa will slowly slide into an archy and chaos see johnston bernstein 2007 for an example the recent xenophobic vi olence is in my professional opinion but foretaste of things to come if we follow this trajectory johnston wolmarans 2008 sibanda 2008 so the former is simply not an option this leaves us with the alternative of radically rethinking how we should mobilize the national set capacity as matter of strategic priority embedded in this issue is the notion of comparative advantage because the south african economy is already at global disadvantage so if we add additional costs to production th we are faced with doublewhammy driver 2 spatial development pattern another fundamental driver is the unique spatial pattern of development in sout h africa as country but also within the mainland sadc region as whole in this re gard the uniqueness arises from the fact that all of the major centres of economic development and thus cities and urban conurbations are located on watershed divide s nowhere else in the world is this pattern evident to the best of my knowledge the global norm is for large cities to be located on rivers lakes or the seashore but not so in our part of the world where we have johannesburgpretoria as one massi ve urban conurbation in south africa gaborone and francistown as smaller cities in botswana windhoek as sizeable city in namibia and bulawayo and harare in zimb abwe all located on or very close to watershed divides ashton et 2008 turton et 2006 turton 2008a the significance of this fact is twofold it has taken major engineering and tec hnology to mobilize the water needed to sustain these industrial and urban conurbations it now means that effluent return flow out of these major industrial and urban conurbations is major threat to fu ture economic development simply because the quality of the water is so degraded that it becomes unfit for human and industrial consumption coetzee 1995 coetzee et 2002a 2002b 2005 2006 dalvie et 2003 iwqs 1999 kempster et 1996 oberholster ashton 2008 oberholster et 2004 2005 2008 slabbert et 2007a 2007b toens et 1999 wade et 2002 this is driving growing concerns from the public that will need to be addressed if social stability is to be maintained if investor confidence is to be restored and if the csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 4legitimacy of the government is to remain intact bega 2008a 2008b johnston bernstein 2007 tempelhoff 2008 this makes the set we develop or fail to develop profoundly political act and to ignore this factor simply because scientis ts labour under the daily illusion that all they do is the science will be to our peri l both as council and as nation driver 3 historic legacy the most insidious but potentially more volatile of these fundamental drivers is our historic legacy in this regard the country we call south africa was forged out of the extrem violence of the second angloboer war mills williams 2006 turton et 2006 this was an event so traumatic that it sowed the seeds of the subsequent quest for afrikaner nationalism as vehicle for recovery of nation smashed not on the fiel d of battle but by the gross injustice of the scorched earth policy that targeted noncombatants and the resultant squalor of the british concentration camps in whic h africans women and children died of dysentery cholera starvation and desp air hasian 2003 hobhous 1901 1907 van reenen 2000 van rensburg 1980 the social pathology caused by this one historic event which gave birth to our country as legal entity merged with three other sets of significant social trauma from the prest atehood era the combined effects of which are still being felt today the plight of the amaxhosa after centu ry of war which culminated in the great cattle killing that re duced that great nation after 1857 to wage earners unable to sustain themselves m eer 1990 peires 2003 welsh 2000 the ethnic cleansing in the 1820s and 1830s of many nonzulu tribes during the mfecane that laid the hinterland of the country waste creating the vacuum into which the trekboers moved duri ng the great trek edgecombe 1986 turton et 2004 welsh 2000 and the destruction of the amazulu as hegemonic nation at the battle of ulundi in response to their defeat of the british at the epic battle of isandlwana in 1879 mills williams 2006 welsh 2000 the combined effect of these four events s created historic legacy that is based on violence and the disrespect of human right s that still lives with us today these historic events have given us country without coherent sense of nationhood buzan 1991 thompson lamar 1981 our science is embedded in this legacy whether we choose to acknowledge it or not in the context of th topic at hand this means that all decisions taken at strate gic level need to be fully cognizant of three vitally important consequences of our historic legacy the propensity to resort to mass viol ence when expectations exceed the capacity of the government to deliver see image 1a the legacy that has left country with coherent sense of nationhood prone to popular rhetoric that reflects cr udely defined racial stereotypes manifestation of which is majority of citizens who are mired in endemic poverty with little prospect of escaping that trap without massive government planning and support csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 5 the systematic erosion of investor co nfidence punctuated by bouts of extreme violence such as the recent xenophobic attacks see image 1b which cause great harm to the perception of the international financial community that south africa is viable destinati on for foreign direct investment image 1a left shows the extreme anger of people during riots in phumelela and merafong city in 2004 driven by failure of service delivery poor governance and lack of capacity fu elling perceptions of an uncaring and corrupt government johnston bernst ein 2007 4 24 image 1b right reflects the anger of people arising from failed immigration policies during the xenophobic violence that occurred in 2008 image courtesy ogrishcom the propensity to resort to mass violence when public expectations exceed the capacity to deliver cannot be ignored in south africa percival homerdixon 1995 1998 2001 this violence is both unpredictable and unanticipated which can be regarded as manifestation of failure to mobilize sufficient social ingenuity see homerdixon 1996 2000 coul d this type of anger be unleashed in response to perceptions of deteriorating public health as result of declining water quality so if these three drivers are of strategi c importance our loss of dilution capacity caused by the overallocation of national water resources ou r unique pattern of spatial development and our historic legacy then we need to take cognizance of them if viable solutions are to be found it is to this that we now turn our attention in the recent past cana dian scholar named thomas homerdixon looked at the world and was struck by one obs ervation that seemed to be repeated in number of different geographies that observation was th at poor countries seemed to be locked into poverty from which little prospect of delivery seemed likely whereas developed countries seemed to be able to become richer this sparked significant research program in which number of startling discoveries were made all of which are directly relevant to our current disc ussion barbier homerdixon 1996 homer dixon 1994 1995 1996 1999 2000 perc ival homerdixon 1995 1998 2001 what homerdixon discovered are in esse nce two profound causal relationships richer countries seem to be in position to avoid most debilitating crises when compared to poorer countries because of their cap acity to create csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 6solutions to complex problems in order to give this concept name he called it technical ingenuity which he defined as the capacity of nation to develop technical solutions to problems being driven by exogenous changes this is obviously relevant in global change cont ext but it is qually relevant to south africa as watercons trained politicaleconomy in order to develop technical ingenu ity necessary precondition is what homerdixon called social ingenuity whic h he defined as the capacity of nation to generate incentives that create the institutional environment in which technical ingenuity could be generated now the argument becomes inte resting because if one analyses this whole issue of ingenuity one is struck by the fact that problems facing society in general have propensity to become more complex over this is driven in part by the unintended consequences of our technologi cal solutions this means that as we develop technical ingenuity we set in mo tion chain reaction that will almost always result in an unantic ipated consequence this is what tenner 1996 called revenge effect in the south african case we have many classic examples we develop antibiotics to counter infecti on and over time we breed drugresistant bacteria we manage water scarcity by engi neering dams and inte rbasin transfers and over time we create an ideal environment in which toxic cyanobacteria bloom harding paxton 2001 hunter 2003 oberholster ashton 2008 pitois et 2000 we apply chemicals to kill mosquito and we reduce the potency of human gametes aneckhahn et 2007 and create urogenital defects in unborn infants bornman et 2005 given the first two fundamental drivers noted earlier the loss of dilution capacity and our spatial development patterns we have mobilized masses of technical ingenuity to move water from distant river basins and mine minerals from ever greater depths but these have caused secondorder problems the socalled reve nge effects such as loss of ecological integrity in aquatic systems arising from interbasin transfers ibts basson 1995 blanchon turton 2005 davies day 1998 heyns 2002 snaddon et 1999 and increased levels of pollution from radionuclides heavy metals and sulphates arising from mining cobbing 2008 coetzee 1995 coetzee et 2006 hobbs cobbing 2007 hobbs et 2008 oelofse 2008a 2008b oelofse et 2007 wade et 2002 it is here that th analysis becomes really interesting clearly we have mobilized ma sses of technical ingenuity over time with which we have developed our national economy to the level of diversity we have in the face of such significant constraints as water and energy but we are again at the threshold of new set of challenges deve lopment like life is journey and not destination we have not yet arrived and i ndeed never will what we have learned in the past is not necessarily relevant to the future because of the propensity to greater complexity over time we cannot base tomorrows solutions on yesterdays experiences and todays science turton 2007 so the question now shifts to new focal point using homerdixons logic if we have mobilized that much technical ingenu ity to give us economic development in the face of such environmental scarcities can we continue to do so the answer to that i am afraid is chilli ng all things remaining equa l the economic principle of ceteris paribus why is this so my argument is ba sed on the fact that south africa is csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 7the most economically developed country in af rica i argue that this is so because we have six national science councils all of which have mobilized the necessary technical ingenuity on which that econom ic growth and development has been predicated yet the viability of some of these councils is longer guaranteed for example the recent analysis by walwyn scholes 2006 shows quite convincingly that the csir is in trouble figure 1 figure 1 trends in funding and staff rnover at the csir walwyn scholes 2006241 programstyled funding builds nati onal capacity but contractdriven funding does not retain that capacity the cause of that loss of viability is shift from grantbased model to mixed income model this research shows qu ite convincingly that set capacity was developed at national leve l before 1985 when massive programs were in place see figure 1 those programs generated high qualit science such as the isolation of the molecule that makes up th toxin known as microcysti n csir 1984114 which is found in growing quantities in our national waterways today oberholster ashton 2008 recent article published in water wheel gives some insight into this era of science until the mid1980s south africa was world leader in research in the field of eutrophication unfortunately th is advantage has since been lost due to eutrophication being afforded lower priority status by government which led to the terminati on of funding for research in this field many of the researchers involved in early eutrophication research have since moved into better research fields into consultation or have emigrated as csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 8a result appropriate management strate gies directed against eutrophication have been seriously constrained by wi despread lack of understanding of the problem particularly at the cisionmaking leve l van vuuren 200815 those programs in the 1980s also generated cadre of phd graduates who went on to become foundation of the nationallevel t capability the shift to contract driven income model has d catastrophic effect on ou r national set capacity at the very time when we are being confront ed by revenge effects arising from our earlier application of technical ingenuity to which we simply have solution this means that we are now flying blind as nation significantly we cannot import those technical solutions because in the case if microcystin as an example there are few other places in the world where there are similar levels of toxin in the national water resources china is an exception so there is simply need in most countries to solve this specific problem with the same urgency that we are confronted by similarly our need to reduce nitrogen and phosphate endofpipe loads by orders of magnitude at sewage works if we ar to mitigate the exponential growth in cyanobacteria blooms that now threaten our national water security harding paxton 2001 humpage et 2000 oberholster ashton 2008 will have to be homegrown solutions because other developed country faces this challenge likewise we need to prevent the unchecked growth in numbers of babies being born with urogenital fects bornman et 2005 and counter the loss of male fertility aneckhahn et 2007 in both cases the result of endocrine disruptors caused by the use of chemicals to control malaria in some of the poorest communities in this country using the conceptual lens of ingenuity provided by homerdixon 2000 let us examine what the south african case has been in terms of water quality management at the national level over time see figure 2 figure 2 schematic representation of the demand and supply of technical ingenuity in south africa since the ac t of union in 1910 using the conceptual lens of an ingenuity gap as hy pothesized by homerdixon 2000 1910 1966 1985 2008 timeqty q1 q2 q3 supply of technical ingenuity demand for technical ingenuity current ingenuity gap q4 csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 9the demand for technical ingenuity is presented as blue curve showing exponential growth over time as the level of complexity has increased at the national scale the supply of technical ingenuity is presented as an orange line which has three distinct phases to it the first pha started in 1910 when the act of union formed the constitutional basis for what we today call south africa at the time of union the demand for technical ingenuity mostly to sustain the mining industry exceeded the supply so there was an ingenuity gap that grew in magnitude to q1 in 1966 in 1966 there was commission of enquiry into water matters which identified water as being major constrai nt to future economi c growth and national prosperity turton et 2004 2008 this established water resource management as national strategic priority with the water research commission wrc being formed as world first to fund the research needed to make that management more robust the trajectory of the supply of t echnical ingenuity thus changed radically after 1966 growing to point when it reached peak q3 in 1985 also see figure 1 for the csir case it must be noted that the supply of techni cal ingenuity probably exceeded the demand for technical ingenuity in 1985 or was at least in balance the year 1985 is important because that was wh the csir reached its peak in staff numbers see walwyn scholes 2006 241 figur 1 it is signifi cant that it was just before this date that the chemistry of microcystin became known for the first time csir 1984 the third phase in the suppl of technical ingenuity saw the gradual demise of set capacity in the csir to point q2 where it is way below the current demand for technical ingenuity this means that there is current ingenuity gap in south africa with acute shortages occurr ing in the energy and water sector the supply curve for technical ingenuity from 1966 to 2008 q1 q3 q2 coincides with the trajectory of the number of csir employees shown in figure 1 walwyn scholes 2006 241 if we are to learn from the past then what is needed is new commission of enquiry into water matters in order to set new national priorities and align them with the set capaci ty of the country turton et 2008 more significantly however this decline star ted decade before the birth of our democracy so when the current government came to power they inherited robust infrastructure but declin ing level of technical ingenuity it is not their fault this is part of their legacy but it is they who have to deal with it now south africa thus presents today with classic case of what homerdixon 2000 calls an ingenuity gap our needs fo r technological solutions are growing exponentially while our capacity to create those solutions is d eclining exponentially this is caused by failure of social ingenu ity the capacity to create incentives for the continued creation of technical ingenuity something we will need to address as nation if we are to dig ourselves out of the hole we are sliding into i therefore interpret the finding of walwyn scholes 2 006 as classic example of what has previously been called s econdorder scarcity ashton haasbroek 2002 ohlsson turton 1999 turton 1999 2002 or scar city of social adaptive capacity ohlsson 1999 in essence the mixed funding model is manifestation of shortage of social ingenuity it is failure to find th right incentives for the continued creation of technical ingenuity and that is national concern because of the implications to society at large how will we change this in this regard i have endless optimism in south africa as nation we have consistently dug deep in to that intangible strength we have as nation when at the eleventh hour often having our backs to the wall with collapse csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 10into chaos seeming imminent and unavoidabl we pull yet anothe r rabbit out of the hat that is what happened during 1994 when we faced our darkest hour as nation teetering literally on the very brink of fullscale civil war spitz chaskalson 2000 turton 2006 this is what will happen again now as the public r ealizes the role that the various national science councils play in delivering what i call science in the service of society and as the various government departme nts start to realize that service delivery is serious issu that they can longer avoid after all the uhuru decade came to an end with the electricity crisis in early 2008 this uhuru decade has been manifest all across africa when liberation movement has inherited infrastructure that works fo r about ten years before starting to break down through lack of investment in ope ration maintenance and skilled human capacity in south africas case that infrastr ucture was particular ly robust so it has lasted decade and half but it is now cl early under pressure and if left alone will collapse piece by piece in the midterm future the trend in infrastructure investment for water at the national level shows this pr ognosis to be probable in startling way see figure 3 figure 3 the age profile of assets currentl on the books of the department of water affairs and forestry dwaf shows peak period of capital investment in the 1980s followed by dramatic decline top the remaining useful life of those assets shows worrying trend bo ttom both of these graphs have similar pattern to figure 1 suggesting trend towards the erosion of the assurance of supply needed to grow th national economy in sustainable manner both graphs courtesy of dwaf 2008 csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 11if figure 1 gives an indication of what is happening to our highly qualified human resources at national level and if figure 3 gives an indication of what is happening to our physical infrastructure in the water ctor then it is not hard to conclude that we are heading for significant crisis in th water sector that crisis can best be understood as being driven by an ingenu ity gap as described in figure 2 the impact of this conclusi on is evident when tested again another alarming trend the south african institute of civil engi neers saice did presentation to the parliamentary portfolio committee on the 4th of june 2008 in that presentation they revealed number of startling facts one of these relates to th number of engineers per municipal area across south africa map 2 it is evident from this map that significant proportion of south af rica has civil engineerin g professional support in local authority it is precisely these rural areas that are most likely to be affected by the deteriorating water quality arising fr om eutrophication in rivers and dams see below for more details it is also these cal authorities that are the least capable of adapting water treatment processes and pl ant to remove microcystins endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and antiretr oviral medication arv s that are likely to arise from population with heavy bur den of aidsrelated diseases see below for more information map 2 the number of civil engineering pr ofessionals per municipal area in 2005 has distinct spatial maldistribution pattern to it courtesy south african institute of civil engineers 2008 this suggests that the water quality crisis presented in this paper is more like ly to occur unless well designed and informed intervention takes place csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 12when one considers that in 2004 south africa had 15000 engine ers technologists and technicians saice 2008 new insight is shed onto the notion of an ingenuity gap see figure 4 the age distribution of one subset of this larger category certified professional engineers shows ma ldistribution in terms of race and age there is large bulge of aging white male engineers followed by massive gap in the age group 35 49 this is the age group that has been most affected by affirmative action employment rules and sadly many of this cohort have left the country as result this is another manifestation of failure to mobilize soci ingenuity because it has created disincentive to the retention of skilled engi neering staff at the national level to the detriment of the entire country figure 4 the age distribution of engineers in south africa shows that we are producing fewer engineers than are leavi ng the profession saice 2008 similar trend is evident when one examin the distribution of the 15000 engineers technologists and technicians that south africa had in 2004 s aice 2008 presented in figure 5 figure 5 the distribution of the 15000 engineers technologists and technicians that south africa had in 2004 shows th at few are in research national and provincial government with most in private consulting firms saice 2008 0

that few are found in research national and provincia l government while many are found in private consulting practice this is again manifestation of scarcity of social ingenuity because the incentives have not been created to attract and retain qualified engineers to research councils na tional and provincial government which poses the question what do we need to do about this at na tional level do we wish to avert the water crisis before it happens or are we to be content with the status quo happy to deal with it after it has been thrust upon us like the electricity crisis was remember alternatives to coalfired electricity do exist with disruptions to service delivery being at best temporar disruption but at worst slowdown of the economy and loss of jobs but water is diffe rent chronic exposure to microcystins can cause human health impacts harding paxton 2001 humpage et 2000 oberholster ashton 2008 oberholster et 2004 2005 2008 pitois et 2000 ueno et 1996 with fears of radioactivit and heavy metal contamination coetzee et 2002a 2005 2006 becoming new scar in which the panic factor makes the management of the process that much more volatile the csir has invested large amounts of financial and intellectual capital into the development of an internal th inking process that will prepare us for new role in our fledgling democracy this has resulted in wh at has been called the trialogue model in terms of which the relationship between three actorclusters government society and science is mediated by set of comp lex interfaces in which partnerships are formed and feedback loops provide the signal s necessary for all actors to modify their behaviour in response to specific stimuli turton et 2007 see figure 6 figure 6 the trialogue model illustrates the relationship between three actor clusters being mediated via interfaces turton et 2007 it is clear that science needs to engage in different ways with govern ment and society if it is to have an impact csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 14i believe that it is the trialogue approac h which will empower the csir to navigate the uncharted territory of these new waters in this process i see three critical challenges internal to the csir that will need to be managed if we are to succeed in playing our role in the mitigation of th looming water crisis suggested above internal challenge 1 communicating science the way that we as scientists engage in the communi cation of our socalled academic consumables will change gone are th days when we generated technical solutions and tossed them over the fen ce hoping that they would hit passing problem to quote pete ashton the feedb ack loops inherent to the trialogue approach means that we will have to listen as much as speak and become more responsive to the needs of our st akeholders more should we speak of clients and increasingly we mu st think of these as partners we must also start to hold ourselves accountable to the citizen s of this country because it is their tax money that will be converted by the csir into useful technical ingenuity our communication will therefore have to be bold honest and done via channels not familiar to most scientists the mass media that simply scares most scientists and they recoil in horror at the very thought of it internal challenge 2 public funding sustained access to public funding is the new challenge it is clear that the mixed funding model is failing walwyn scholes 2006figure 1 and that we have unintended consequences arising from this failure oberholster ashton 2008 van vuuren 2008 it is also clear that we cannot allo w this to happen because that failure will eventually lead to the total erosion of the national set capacity and the country will be the poorer it is significant that it is public funding that has allowed for the massive breakthrough that occurred when the water research commission wrc decided to fund the groundbreaking studies that revealed the existe nce of radionuclide and heavy metal contamination in streams downstream of gold mining activities coetzee et 2006 wade et 2002 turton in prep it is also significant that the wrc was willing to fund study into human health arising from environmental risks in groundwater toens et 1999 and is curren tly considering funding the first ever high confidence study of human health ri sks arising from chronic exposure to populations living adjacent to gold mining operations csir 2008 it is for this reason that we need more access to public funding because it is the public nature of that funding that places th science generated back into the public domain private funding removes that science from the public domain by placing contractual re strictions on both its scope and dissemination without this funding we simply cannot do science in the service of society because it exposes th csir as national asset to the risk of being hijacked by private interests which have wish to open up these complex legacy issues for various reasons this is the unique contribution that the csir can make to deepen our democracy by empowering society to engage with government and industry over i ssues that affect their daily lives very few scientists that i know have ever thought that they ar engaged in this important task of deepening our democrac but in essence that is what we are doing already if you read the fi ne print it is what we should be doing because it is actually implicit in th second portion of our parliamentary mandate csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 15 internal challenge 3 building trust trust is vital in country which is still engaged in nation building but has not yet ad equately dealt with the legacy of century of violence abus of power and nonaccountability trust is earned and in this regard the csir has unique potential to act as honest broker when contested situations aris needing robust sc ientific solution mmemezi 2008 smillie 2008 i think here of the need to mitigate the impact of acid mine drainage amd from both the coal and gold sectors which has the capacity if left unmanaged of destroying the last remaining water resource on which the economic as pirations of nation depend oelofse 2008b likewise with th human health implications of cyanobacteria and microcystins and unc ontrolled endocrine disruption arising from our loss of dilution all of which will require concerted effort to re build the trust we need the social inge nuity that has to be mobilized if we are to find sustainable technical so lutions to these vexing problems these are our internal challenges the jour ney has already begun nd even as i speak the csir is engaging with specific government departme nt about the possibility of developing national water quality science technology and policy support program likewise we are engaging with other government departments in an effort to go back to the programstyle of managing parts of the csir we are also engaging with major players in the energy sector that rely on coal as prim ary feedstock because just as they are faced with the challenge of developing new energy the csir is faced with the challenge of developing technologies that will create new water some from acid mine drainage caused by their operations significan tly the natural resource and environment nre unit at the csir s already made decision to develop acid mine drainage and associated human health into flagship pr ogram based on recent recommendations made by the research advisory panel rap this new dispensation for set will therefore be based on the trialogue in which we engage more proactively but always with integrit because after all good science is never afraid of robust public scrutiny and debate we can now answer the question posed in th opening statements of my presentation the simple answer is that our parliament ary mandate says we must do two things develop the setbase for the national econom and apply our minds to issues of national importance we will do that using the trialogue ap proach process that is already underway three strategic water quality challenges now to deal with the title of this presen tation the identificati on of three strategic water quality challenges that decisionmakers need to now about turton 2008b as result of the fact that we have lost our dilution capacity we are now faced with an increasing water quality problem this will be addressed through the national water quality science technology and policy support program currently under development in terms of which there wi ll be three highly specific focal points these are all based on three strategic challenges that decisionmakers in both government and the private sect or are being confronted wi th on daily basis turton 2008b these are the following csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 16 strategic challenge 1 na tional quest for sustainability south africa is one of the few countries in the world that has gislated for sustainability in their national constitution we therefore need to turn th noble words into actual deeds supported by robust science to this nd the csir has already invest ed heavily in what is known as sustainability science we need to now turn that theory burns et 2006 burns weaver 2008 into concrete science t echnology and policy in that process our available scientific knowledge tells us that th ere are two major issues that are about to burst into the board rooms of large corpora tions and into the corridors of government power in pretoria and cape town these two issues are acid mine drainage our entire national energy strategy is largely based on coal as feedstock that dependence is complex and will not be easily changed oelofse 2008b so we have to focus our attention in the quest to develop sustainable solutions to amd both coal and goldbased this is highly complex issue and can only be ove rcome by leveraging all of our set assets in concerted and focussed nati onal strategic program with all major players in both the energy sector coa lbased amd and mining sector gold based amd as fullyfledged partners to do this we must move away from the current posture of being on quest to hold corporations legally liable for legacy issues because that drives them into defensive positions from which cooperation is not possible in this re gard we are already learning from the german experience after unification wher similar challenges arose we need to build robust partnerships both nati onally and globally to achieve this objective we also need to solve technica l problems that result in new water that is generated in way that is both environmentally and economically sustainable the set component of this challenge will need to be robust probably exceeding the combined capac ity of all our existing research institutions meaning that cooperati on and partnerships are an absolute necessity in this regard the principl being applied is that the level of ingenuity needed to solve problem exceeds the level of ingenuity that created the problem in the first place this means that by definition one institution will be able to solve this perplexing problem alone partnerships and only partnerships working in highly coordinated manner will be capable of achieving this strategic objective leadership for this process will be major challenge given the complexitie s of the issue the degree of transdisciplinarity needed to find viable solutions and the leve l of political and commercial sensitivities involved the d ecision to appoint and mandate an appropriate person for this leadership role will thus be pivotal to the prognosis for any future success eutrophication south africa already highly wa ter constrained is now also faced with levels of eu trophication that are almost unprecedented globally left alone this will slowly poison our waters rendering them useless for future economic development plans and driv ing up production costs for various industries further undermining the s outh african economy this also has major implications for national populat ion that already has high level of people with compromised immune syst ems ashton ramasar 2002 the science underpinning this was lost when the transi tion to the mixed funding model occurred see figure 1 van v uuren 2008 we need to rebuild that csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 17capacity as matter of national priority nd in this regard the recent decision by the wrc to revive the fight against eutrophication is to be welcomed and fully supported van vuuren 2008 strategic challenge 2 na tional quest for human health south africa has number of healthrelated cha llenges hunter 2003 offringa et 2007 one of the most notable is that associated with th scourge of hivaids that has left substantial portion of our population with compromised immune system ashton ramasar 2002 overlaid onto this is deve lopmental legacy that has exposed large portions of the human population to hea vy metal and radionuclide contamination arising from more than century of gold mining much of which was largely unregulated adler et 2007a 2007b this has many ramifications which in my professional opinion have not yet been unrave lled in any concerted way so if we are to get serious about the science we do we are going to have to show leadership in this regard turton 2008b this means focussing on the following known problem areas microcystins south africa has microcysti n load in our water storage impoundments that is amongs t the highest in the world the last serious science we did on this topi c was in the decade before the start of the collapse noted in figure 1 we need to rebuild that national capacity van vuuren 2008 specifically with respect to high confidence studies of human beings that might have been exposed to chronic doses of microcystin that work will be costly complex and politically sens itive but we cannot allow these factors to cause us to waiver high confiden ce studies have been done and this is bordering on the criminally negligent if we do not address this issue as matter of national priority we need to know if microcystins are causing human health problems hunter 2003 humpage et 2000 ueno et 1996 specifically in communities that are immunecompromised and then design intervention strategies base d on this new robust science endocrine disrupting chemicals south africa also has growing problem with endocrine disrupting chemicals dcs driven larg ely by our loss of dilution this means that edcs are be ing recycled without being removed this leads to concentration and bioaccu mulation so our focus needs to be on understanding the fate and pathways in order to design appropriate interventions both technological and policyrelated partially metabolized medication given our high hiv aids rate south africa has growing anti retroviral arv load which passes like any other medication through the body in partly meta bolized forms this means that we are going to be seeing higher levels of arv in our rivers which by implication means that these complex chemical compounds will be entering the human population over time either th rough the drinking water stream or via produce that has been irrigated with contaminated water this specific south african issue is nested in bigger technical problem known as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps which is growing global concern but is sufficiently unique to warrant strategic attention on its own we need to develop the science to understand this better because nowhere else in the world is there coincidence of loss of dilution and high levels of arv use as in this country this is clearly national priority that has csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 18major political implications this science might even be world first but it is certainly national strategic priority in which we will have to take the lead radionuclide and heavy metal contamination as result of more than century of largely unregulated gold ning we now have legacy of heavy metal and radionuclide contamination in rivers flowing out of most gold mining areas we also have high population density living in close daily contact with dust and sediment arising from mine taili ngs dams large portions of soweto and the east and west rand residential complexes are located on land that in most developed countri would be considered to be contaminated south africa has neve r done high confidence study of off mine populations to determine what the impact has been from chronic exposure to heavy metals and radionuc lides csir 2008 this will be complex and costly but we need such study as matter of national urgency strategic challenge 3 national quest for climate change adaptation given that our water resources ve already been fully allo cated and in many cases over allocated we have more buffer capacity this means that global climate change has very specific implications for us as nation to which we have not yet developed an adequate response hunter 2003 therefore we need to start by focussing on the following key areas of strategic importance cyanobacteria while gores movie an in convenient truth tells us to be afraid of sea level and temperature rise in the future our own science is showing us that we are being threaten ed by toxic microcystins produced by cyanobacteria at present harding paxton 2001 oberholster ashton 2008 to which we have known solution the future is already here and gores movie is merely causing us to take our eye off the ball because there is tentative evidence that cyanobacteria population dynamics are influenced at least in part by changing ambient mperatures in our water bodies hunter 2003 we therefor need to revive the national eutrophication program that collapsed at the end of the 1980s van vuuren 2008 see figure 1 in order to unders tand the exact linkages between climate change and cyanobacteria current indicators are that there is link but we need to drill down in gr eater detail to truly understand this with higher degree of certainty dilution capacity given that south africa has lost its dilution capacity we need to understand exactly what climat change will do to our national water resource that is so vita l to our economic and social survival turton 2008b more specifically will future coal combustion in the face of reduced precipitation mean an increase in acid rain what will this do to our agricultural production capacity how will th is change soil chemistry what will the impact be on rivers and wetla nds already under stress will this cause an increased mobilization of radionuclides and heavy metals how will this impact on edcs will this trigger dditional eutrophica tion as iron and phosphate is mobilized from sediments these are all complex questions that need focussed and concerted scient ific effort to answer reliably csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 19 ecosystem thresholds given that so much of our current effluent streams enter aquatic ecosystems often through terrestrial ecosystems we need to understand their dynamics better specifically with regard to their assimilative capacity as environmental sinks for h eavy metals radionuclides edcs arvs and the myriad of chemical pollutants we discharge daily more specifically we need to know if climate change will nudge any of these aquatic ecosystems across thresholds pushing them into catastrophic collapse such as that already in existence in the hartebeespoor t and roodeplaat dam systems what i have presented here is the embryo of what is hopefully going to become the national water quality science technology and policy support program which will reverse the trend noted by walwyn and schol 2006 see figur 1 this program needs of necessity to be bold and ambitious it must have ambitious targets such as producing 50 phd graduates after ten years 200 msc graduates after the same time period and range of patents designed to overcome the problems presented above in way that is both financially viable and eco logically sustainable this means working closely with every university in the countr because they will be unable to produce this number of graduates alone and only iversities have the legal mandate to do this in this program the csir would beco the space in which human capacity is nurtured in highly structur ed manner probably with many of the existing principal and chief scientists being appointed as extr aordinary professors in these partnership universities simply to create the superv isory capacity needed for such massive undertaking this can only happen if the csir funding model is changed because as it now stands those principal and chief scie ntists are the mainstay of cash generation and therefore institutional survival rather than of the development of technical ingenuity in the national interest the csir funding model is thus question of fundamental national significance and the way we deal with it will be an example of social ingenuity creating the capacity to generate future technical ingenuity as defined by homerdixon 2000 if kennedy could commit his nation to pu tting man on the moon in decade why can we as nation not commit ourselves to overcoming impediments to the quality of life that each south african citizen deserv why can we not decide to solve the problem of amd in decade so that our ning can continue wit hout the albatross of externalizing production costs around the necks of major mining houses i believe we can do these things i believe we should do these things i believe it is noble to do these things but i believe we are negligent if we fail to do these things this sums up what i think about these issues specifically with resp ect to the way that the set leadership within nre should be applying their co llective minds to problems of national st rategic importance i wish you luck as you grapple with these issues over the next few days months and years i close by saying that the new role of the csir will be to deepen our democracy by generating high quality science that is mostly uncontested presented in way that helps the public government and corporations to engage in complex debates that will slowly transform south africa from nonaccountable oligarchy into fully accountable democracy in which ev ery citizen can reach their full human potential in life ba sed on dignity csir report csirnrewrexp20080160a 20 this is what i call science in the service
