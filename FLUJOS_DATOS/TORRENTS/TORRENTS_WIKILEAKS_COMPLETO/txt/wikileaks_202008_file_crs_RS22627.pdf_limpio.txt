22 2008 abstract there is consensus deﬁnition of middle class neither is there an oﬃcial government deﬁnition what constitutes the middle class is relative subjective and not easily deﬁned the midpoint in the distribution is the median and in 2007 the median household income was 50233 how far above and below that amount the middle stretches remains an open question the us census bureau has published ﬁgures for 2007 breaking the income distribution into quintiles or ﬁfths the narrowest view of who might be considered middle class based on that presentation would include those in the middle quintile which includes households with income between 39100 and 62000 more generous deﬁnition might be based on the three middle quintiles those households with income between 20291 and 100000 surveys suggest that from 1 to just over 3 of the population consider themselves to be upper class comparing those ﬁgures with the income distribution would put the dividing line between middle and upper class close to if not above 250000 similarly survey responses suggest that the lower end of the middle class might be close to 40000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22627g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

legislation considered by congress is in the name of the socalled middle class but there is consensus definition of middle class neither is there an official government definition and it is not the aim of this report to establish one what constitutes the middle class is relative subjective and not easily defined most people likely have decided views as to whether they are middle class at the same time those who refer to the middle class have rough idea whom they have in mind how closely these two definitions correspond is another matter in some contexts the term middle class may refe r to group with shared values or views but much of the time it is intended to refer to those who fall within particular range of incomes for example tax cut proposal may be promoted on the grounds that it would benefit the middle class where the distinction is based solely on income the term middle income is sometimes used this report will use the terms middle class and middle income interchangeably what defines the middle class is discussed here solely in terms of income this paper attempts to put the term middle class or middle income into some perspective it begins by presenting available income distributio n data as way of identifying what constitutes middle income then it presents the results of some subjective surveys in an attempt to identify what income levels are considered to fall into the middle class finally it discusses some economic findings that may help explain how those in the middle class feel about their place in the distribution

money income1 the census bureau publishes income distributions fo r both households and families with households including slightly more of the population households are relevant to the discussion here because members pool whatever income they have and can be presumed to share common standard of living 2 any discussion of the middle income necessarily starts with the very middle the midpoint in the distribution is the median household income and in 2007 it was 50233 how far the middle stretches above and below that amount is the issue while distribution figures are available for fairly small income classes what many analysts find most useful are data showing the distribution by quintile the population of households is divided into fifths and these quintiles are arranged from lowest to highest income table 1 shows what income levels separate the five quintiles from one another in 2007 and also show what share of total household income is accounted for by each quintile in addition the census bureau provides separate data for the top 5 of the households in the income distribution 1 money income accounts for wide range of income sources but it is usually incomplete money income includes income from earnings interest and dividends social security and other forms of social insurance it does not include the value of nonmoney benefits such as food stamps or housing subsidies neither does it include capital gains 2 in 2007 there were an estimated 116783000 households in the united states m

narrow view of who might be consider ed middle class would include only those in the middle quintile those households with income between 39100 and 62000 but it seems unlikely that so small an income range would correspond with many impressions of who is middle class more generous definition might be based on the three middle quintiles those households with income between 20291 and 100000 that group accounts for 60 of all households and 469 of all household income perhaps the broadest definition of middle class to be had from these numbers would be to add the part of the top quintile just up to the point where the top 5 begins that would put those households with income between 20291 and 177000 in the middle class that group accounted for 754 of all household income in 2007 one other consideration as to where to draw the lower income limit for the middle class is the official poverty threshold there are multiple poverty thresholds depending on size of household and ages of children given that the average household size in 2007 was 26 people the poverty threshold for family of three might be appropriate that threshold was 16530 in 2007 whether household just above the poverty threshold might be considered part of the middle class seems subject to debate clearly the further household is above or below the median income the more subjective its inclusion in the middle class becomes g7g159g146g141g142g151g140g142g561g143g155g152g150g561g21g158g155g159g142g162g156g561 since who is middle class is subjective question the way the term is used might help define it thus opinion surveys might provide some basis for identifying the relevant income bounds number of surveys in recent years have asked people to indicate to what social class they consider themselves to belong the classes they are usually asked to choose from are lower working middle sometimes divided into lower and upper middle and upper

identify their social class3 the results showed only 1 of those surveyed considered themselves to be upper class 67 considered themselves to be middle or uppermiddle class 35 were working class and 7 were lower class that the official poverty rate in 2007 was 125 suggests that either some who are in poverty consider themselves to be working class which may be because they believe their poverty status to be temporary or there were problems surveying those at that end of the distribution in the census bureaus detailed household income distribution data the highest income class is 250000 the share of households with income over 250000 accounts for 19 of all households if the survey answers correspond to the income data then the selfreported middle class broadly defined includes hous eholds with income over 250000 similarly comparing the survey responses with the income da ta puts the lower end of the middle class just over 40000 in 20074 the national opinion research center norc at the university of chicago has asked people to identify their social class in number of surveys beginning in 1972 the cumulative results of those surveys can also be used to compare the income distribution with selfreported class divisions the average of the norc survey da ta between 1972 and 2006 suggests that 33 of the population consider themselves to be upper class that would put the dividing line between middle and upper class at just over 200000 in 2007 the norc surveys indicated that 48 of the population considered themselves to be lower class and 478 classified themselves as working class that would put the dividing line between working class and middle class at about 52500 again assuming correspondence between the survey data and the income distribution the pew research center sampled opinions regarding middle class attitudes5 they found that 53 of americans considered themselves to be middle class comparing the proportion of those who identified themselves as middle class could include incomes from about 25000 up to 95000 when those who considered themselves to be either lower or upper middle class the income range expanded to include those with income near 10000 up to just under 250000 given the income quintile data presented in the previous section the survey responses seem to suggest that while some households in the second quintile 20291 to 39100 might be considered middle class the term middle class might be more likely to refer to those in the middle and fourth quintile 39100 to 100000 and to many of those households between the 80 th and 95th percentile 100000 to 177000 in the distribution as well g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 among the many assumptions economists make to facilitate analysis is that of diminishing marginal utility of income this concept refers to the assumption that as income increases each additional dollar yields less satisfaction than the one that came before with respect to middle 3 the new york times published series of articles in may 2005 under the title class matters which are available at httpwwwnytimescomindexes20050515nationalclassindexhtml 4 because the upper end of the income distribution is small pr oportion of the population it is possible this group is underrepresented in surveys like this that would mean relatively greater measurement error in their response 5 pew research center inside the middle class bad times hit the good life april 2008 available at

greater gains in satisfaction to be had moving up into the middle class than there are to be had moving up from the middle to the upper end of the income distribution it might not be unreasonable to say that those who consider themselves middle class are relatively content at least with their economic situation but while middleincome household may be well above subsistence level of income the satisfaction or happiness afforded by that income may also depend on where that income level fits into the overall income distribution the idea that happiness depends on both the absolute and the relative level of income is known as the relative income hypothesis if individuals care about where they are situated in the overall distribution that would seem evidence of the economic impor tance of middleincome group with shared stake in the health of the economy interest in the economics of happiness has led to number of studies that have found evidence of the importance of ones place in the overall distribution of income while ultimately happiness is subjective one study analyzed what would seem to be an objective measure of happiness or more accurately unhappiness daly and wilson looked at how changes in income may have influenced suicide rates 6 they found evidence that changes in relative income had significant influence on suicide rates the authors used three measures of relative income the ratio of income at the 90th percentile to median income the ratio of median income to income at the 10th percentile and the ratio of income at the 90th percentile to income at the 10th percentile in the distribution among their findings was that an increase in the 9010 rati interpreted as an increase in overall income inequality was not associated with an increase in suicide rates however the study also suggested that an increase in the 5010 ratio was associated with decline in the suicide rate and that an increase in the 9050 ratio was associated with an increase in the suicide rate this was considered evidence that relative income had an important influence on happiness in particular those at the middle 50th percentile were happier the larger the gap was between them and those at the lower end 10th percentile of the distribution at the same time those at the middle were less happy the larger the gap was between them and those at the upper end 90th percentile of the distribution luttmer also presents evidence that relative income is an important determinant of happiness7 he used survey data that matched individuals selfreported happiness with income data he found that an increase in ones own income raised reported happiness but that an increase in ones neighbors income had negative effect further he found that decline in ones own income resulted in about the same decrease in happiness as occurred when ones neighbor experienced an increase in income 6 mary daly and dan wilson keeping up with the jonese s and staying ahead of the smiths evidence

between happiness and income and developed model to explain it8 he found number of studies showing that at any given time cross section comparisons were likely to show that higher income is correlated with greater happiness at the same time it was also typical that as income rose over the course of ones lifetime there was corresponding increase in happiness easterlin suggested that self assessments of happiness at particular income level are dependent on aspirations as incomes rise so do aspirations the rise in aspirations has an effect on happiness that tends to offset the effect of rising income this hypothesis would explain the apparently contradictory evidence that in cross section analysis happiness rises with income but that over time as income rises happiness is relatively stable the conclusions of these studies might not seem robust since they are based on crude self assessments of happiness or well being but if they are correct they may be relevant to the notion of middle class together they suggest that happiness insofar as it is determined by income depends on ones status in the overall distribution the daly and wilson study looked at specific points in the distribution to reach their findings and related them to median income 50 th percentile but it might not be unreasonable to apply their conclusions to larger group at the middle of the distribution in other words the happiness of the middle class however that might be defined could be argued to depend on both keeping up with the joneses and staying ahead of the smiths as they put it in their article the happiness of those who identify themselves as middle class would seem to depend on what happens to those with less as well as those with more income g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 attempt to identify the middle class in the income distribution can be expected to yield precise answer but the term is used so often that it is worth the effort to attach some numbers to it if the middle class is taken to be those who have more than enough to afford basic necessities it can be presumed to exclude those at or near the poverty thresholds surveys indicate many people felt an income near 40000 was the minimum to be considered middle class on the other end surveys suggested that those with income approaching 200000 might still be considered middle class 9 whatever else they may have in common those who constitute the middle class may have more or less similar sentiments regarding their position in the income distribution being well above the bottom is source of satisfaction but when those at the upper end of the distribution fare better than they do it is source of consternation 8 richard easterlin income and happiness towards unified theory the economic journal july 2001 pp 465484 9 if those who consider themselves to be upper class were underrepresented in the survey then the actual number of those who consider themselves to be upper class would be larger if that is the case the actual level of income that divides the middle from the upper class would be lower than is suggested by the survey
