resources science and industry division sara lister domestic social policy division september 8 2008 abstract bisphenol bpa is used to produce certain types of plastic containers made of these plastics may expose people to small amounts of bpa in food and water some animal experiments have found that fetal and infant development may be harmed by small amounts of bpa but scientists disagree about the value of the animal studies for predicting harmful eﬀects in people at least one regulatory decision in the face of the scientiﬁc disagreement has led to congressional inquiry into the extent to which the decision was based on good science legislation proposed in april 2008 s 2928 would prohibit use of bpa in some products intended for use by children legislation proposed in june

synthetic chemical compound produced in the united states in large quantities approximately 23 billion pounds annually2 the dominant use is in manufacturing certain forms of plastic relatively hard clear polycarbonate pc and epoxy resins that are used to line food cans under certain conditions bpa may migrate ie be released from pc containers and plasticlined cans into the food or liquids they contain the widespread use of bpa and the potential for human exposure together with accumulating scientific evidence about possible bpa toxicity led the national toxicology program ntp at the national institutes of health nih to select bpa for comprehensive review ntp released draft brief on bpa on april 14 20083 its conclusions prompted some to call for federal restrictions on certain bpa uses and sparked congressional and media interest in the past and current positions of the food and drug administration fda fda regulates bpa and other chemicals used in food containers and maintains that current uses of bpa are safe final ntp monograph on bpa was released september 3 2008 4 g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 exposure to large amounts of bpa is acutely toxi c to humans and animals but levels of bpa exposure from plastics are low the possibility of human health effects from exposure to low doses of bpa is controversial although animal evidence of possible harmful effects has been mounting for about 10 years it is clear that bpa is capable of interfering with the action of estrogen an important regulator of reproduction and development interference with hormonal action is often referred to as endocrine disruption therefore many recent studies have focused on the potential effects of low levels of bpa exposure on fetal or newborn rats or mice some of the developmental effects seen among rodents exposed to low doses of bpa include changes in brains and behaviors precancerous lesions in the prostate and mammary glands altered prostate and urinary tract development and early onset of puberty5 these lowdose experiments are difficult to conduc t in part because bpa is ubiquitous in the environment thus different studies have produced different results scientists employed by bpa manufacturers and some independent contractors argue that the hundreds of studies conducted so far have produced inconsistent results and are insufficient justification for more stringent bpa regulation other scientists maintain that welldesigned and executed studies of sufficient statistical power on sensitive strains of laboratory rodents have clearly demonstrated the toxicity 1 bisphenol also is commonly known as carboxylic acid it is the single molecule that is chained together polymerized to form polycarbonate 2 us department of health and human

exposure for potentially vulnerable human populations some researchers have proposed that bpa may interfere with hormones that regulate functions other than reproduction recently released study found that lowlevel exposure to bpa inhibits the release of adiponectin from human adipose fat tissue adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity and helps regulate glucose metabolism6 the researchers hypothesize that environmental bpa exposure may increase susceptibility to obesity and diabetes the body of research in this area is less extensive than that into bpas potential effects on

national survey by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc found bpa in the urine of more than 92 of the people studied which included children six years of age and older and adults8 among these people the highest average concentrations were found in children9 the ntp monograph estimates that the highest daily intakes of bpa occur in infants and children10 bpa has been found in human breast milk but the ntp report estimates that infants who are formulafed have higher daily bpa intake levels than those who are breastfed11 because there is more bpa in infant formula than in breast milk and because bpa may increase when pc baby bottles are used for formula feeding especially if the bottles are heated these bpa exposure levels in humans are similar to levels of bpa associated with several low dose laboratory animal findings of effects on the brain and behavior prostate and mammary gland development and early onset of puberty in females according to the final ntp

guidance for industry include recommendations and guidelines for studies of potential reproductive developmental and neurological toxicity that may result from exposure to food contact substances14 these sources do not suggest that there is systematic review process to study such effects that may result from exposure to previously approved products some consumer groups have sought for more than

expert panel to conduct comprehensive review of the scientific literature on bpa the panel met during 2007 and issued its report on november 26 200715 it concluded that animal studies were sufficient to elicit some concern about possible effects of bpa exposure on the neurological development of human fetuses and newborns but minimal concern about effects on the early onset of puberty or development of mammary or prostate cancer the expression of some concern is midway in qualitative scale used by ntp in order from greatest to least the levels of concern are serious concern concern some concern minimal concern and negligible concern some scientists disagreed with these conclusions ntps own scientists reviewed the panel report as well as numerous studies that were not considered by the panel many that were completed or published in late 2007 and early 2008 ntp then issued its draft bpa brief on april 14 2008 which largely agreed with the panel report but expressed higher level of concern with respect to early puberty and effects on the mammary and prostate glands the draft report concluded the possibility that bpa may alter human development cannot be dismissed 16 specifically the ntp report concluded that there is some concern for neural and behavioral effects in fetuses infants and children at current levels of human exposure and some concern in those same groups for effects on the prostate gland mammary gland and on earlier age of puberty in females public comment on the draft brief was invited through may 23 2008 17 on june 11 2008 the ntp board of scientific counselors met to review the draft report and public comments the board voted to lower the level of concern for bpas effects on the mammary gland and on the onset of puberty in females 18 this vote is reflected in the final version of the ntp brief which was included in the ntp monograph and issued september 3 200819 thus the official ntp view is that current levels of human exposure to bpa warrant continued consumer update safety and food packaging at httpwwwfdagovconsumerupdatesfoodpackaging081908html 14 see in particular fda toxicological principles for the safety assessment of

prostate gland in fetuses infants and children minimal concern for effects on the mammary gland and an earlier age for puberty in female fetuses infants and children and for workers exposed occupationally and negligible concern for all other current exposures and reproductive or developmental effects canada published its risk assessment of bpa in april 2008 finding that the main source of exposure to bpa for newborns and infants is through the use of polycarbonate baby bottles when they are exposed to high temperatures and the migration of bpa from cans into infant formula the scientists concluded in this assessment that bisphenol exposure to newborns and infants is below levels that may pose risk however the gap between exposure and effect is not large enough 20 the canadian government has said that although exposure levels are below those that could cause health effects they are close to those levels and the government wants to be prudent and reduce exposures further it announced its intention to reduce bpa exposure in infants and newborns by 1 banning pc baby bot tles 2 developing stringent migration targets for bpa in infant formula cans and 3 working with industry to develop alternative food packaging and code of practice also in april 2008 the american chemistry c ouncil which represents chemical manufacturing companies called on fda to update its review of the safety of bpa in food contact applications saying the extensive body of scientific study regarding bpa is well documented and well reviewed nevertheless recent media reports have raised concerns about the safety and use of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins unnecessarily confusing and frightening the public 21 shortly thereafter fda formed an agencywid task force to review current information regarding bpa in all fdaregulated products in june 2008 fda asked its science board the advisory board to the fda commissioner to establish subcommittee to review research on bpa and exposures from food containers and deliver its findings to the boards annual meeting in the fall 22 subsequently rosa delauro chairwoman of the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture which funds fda wrote to fda urging that the science board review bpa exposures from medical devices as well23 in august 2008 fda published draft risk assessment of bpa in food contact applications saying fda has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses at later date fda will publish separate document that provides safety assessment of bpa exposure from other fdaregulated products 24 the bpa subcommittee of the fda science board is due to meet on september 16 2008 to review the draft risk assessment the ntp brief and
