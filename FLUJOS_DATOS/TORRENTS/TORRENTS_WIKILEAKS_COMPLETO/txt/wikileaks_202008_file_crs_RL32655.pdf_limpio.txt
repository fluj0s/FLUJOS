million and 48 million doses of flu vaccine for the us market for the imminent 20042005 flu season almost half the expected nationwide supply the announcement of chirons suspension prompted the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and its advisory committee on immunization practices acip to redefine the groups most at risk to be given priority for the available vaccine doses cdc coordinated nationwide tracking of available vaccine highpriority individuals who might need it and infections signaling the start of the winter flu season the food and drug ad ministration fda sent team to the liverpool plant to determine whether an of the chiron vaccine lots could be salvaged they later determined that they could not and sought additional sources of vaccine from other manufacturers domestically and abroad states launched plans to locate and redistribute or ration v accine and responded to reports of price gouging the response of local state and federal agencies was limited because most of the us flu vaccine market is in private hands several bills were introduced in re sponse to the shortage and proposals introduced earlier in the 108th congress in response to flu vaccine supply problems during the 20032004 season received renewed attention two hearings on influenza vaccine were held immediately prior to announcement of the shortage indicating congresss ongoing interest in this issue additional hearings were held after the shortage was announced congress also passed in pl 108357 the american jobs creation act of 2004 provision adding fl u vaccine to the national vaccine injury compensation program vicp and pr ovided 100 million in fy2005 funding for influenza preparedness which could be used to purchase flu vaccine the shortage illustrates the challenges that the federal government faces in responding to public health threats mu ch of the responsibility for preventing or managing the shortage rests with the stat or with the private sector and the threshold over which the fede ral government would wrest control from either appears high as result the federal government may appear disorganized or unresponsive the shortage also raises questions about th role and effectiven ess of government in rationing scarce health resource as communities across the country saw long lines of sick and elderly citizens waiting in vain for flu vaccine and c oncerns about the supply for the 20052006 season emerged as well policymakers asked why the system to provide this potentially lifesaving product was so unreliable and wh at could be

peculiarities of flu vaccine pr oducti on especially its finite shelf life it is good only for the one season for which it is produced have led to supply and demand imbalances in recent years overall demand for flu vaccine has grown over the past decade but cdc reports that there have been vaccine surpluses each of the past five winters and unused vaccine has been discarded see table 1 within

use in some of the highrisk priority groups identified by cdc the defense partment sought to obtain doses of laiv for its healthy recruits slated for overseas deployment in order to assure force protection without consuming the limited ci vilian supply of injectable vaccine the announcement of chirons suspension prompted cdc and its advisory committee on immunization practices acip to

premise that the company had not fulfilled its disclosure obligations states responded to the shortage by launc hing plans to locate and redistribute or ration doses of vaccine and by pursuin g widespread reports of pricegouging some states exercised authority to prohib it administration of v accine to nonpriority individuals some localities held lotteries to pportion limited vaccine to those in priority groups by early december 2004 some states were reporting that all those in priority groups who sought vaccine had received it and that they had doses remaining in order to prevent possible wastage of vaccine cdc sent an update to states on december 8 2004 suggesting that they consider expanding vaccination recommendations to those outside the prior ity groups if circumstances warranted number of states that had earlier placed restrictions on providers relaxed them in response shortage to surplus it is not uncommon for there to be patchwork of vaccine shortages and surpluses at different times and places in the course of flu season or for there to be early shortages that resolve into an even tual surplus at seasons end the causes of this paradoxical imbalance include the timin g and severity of the flu season which affect demand the overall supply for the season and the supply at times of peak demand3 in early december 2004 cdc officials were reporting

the surveys were published th acip reviewed the status of flu vaccine supply and issued revised guidelin for groups that s hould receive vaccine essentially restoring its preshortage recommendations6 the challenge for public health officials was to maintain demand among unvaccinated highrisk individuals as vaccine continued to be produced each week while avoiding surplus at years end historically manufacturers distributors and providers have absorbed the cost of unused vaccine the cost of additi onal vaccine in 2004 when it was specifically requested by the us government would ve to be borne by the us government in this special circumstance some vaccine policy experts voiced concern about the possibility of surplus and discussion ensued about financial responsibility for vaccine doses

2005 2006 season became matter of serious concern when in early december 2004 britis h regulators extended their suspension of chirons liverpool plant through march 200510 while the action was intended to allow more time for chirons remediation efforts at the plant many were concerned that the company might not succeed in its efforts to return as licensed us supplier for the upcoming season it was reported that aventis would be able to expand its production in addition hhs launched an unprecedented effort to license the glaxosmithkline vaccine in less than one year with the company saying it could supply 10 to 20 million doses for the us market for 20052006 the process typically ta kes several years another manufacturer id biomedical of canada sought fda licensure for its flu v accine but did not anticipate its availability in the us before 2007 scientific and technical issues annual strain selection and vaccine production in general vaccines which are regulated as biologics by the fda center for biologics evaluation and research cber are more tricky to produce than are drugs manufacturers must successfully grow the particular virus or other organism of interest while avoiding the growth of other organisms that might contaminate the final product several pecu liarities of the influenza vi rus itself and its production process make flu vaccine production esp ecially complicated there are numerous points at which the process could fa il and has failed in recent years the influenza virus changes over time from year to year the dominant strains of virus in circulation change which is why we may get sick every year from flu in contrast with having lifelong immunity to more stable viruses such as measles each year in late winter the fda with input from the national vaccine advisory committee and using surveillance information from the world health organization who and cdc reviews virus strains in gl obal circulation and selects three that are most likely to cause serious illness in the united states during the subsequent winter season ie one year hence the chosen strains are incorporated into that next winters trivalent flu vaccine which typically contains at least one new strain each year strain selection may be based on both the dominance and severity of strains in circulation but may be limited by certain obstacles fo r example an especially virulent strain called fujian was an obvious choice for the 20032004 flu vaccine but it could not be successfully grown in eggs in time to include it in the vaccine this problem was eventually surmounted and ba sed on its continuing circulation the fujian strain was included in the 20042005 flu vaccinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32655crs6 to make large amounts of virus for vacci ne production the virus must be grown in fertilized eggs large numbers of fer tilized eggs are required each year to support vaccine production they must be specially produced assuring the health of the laying hens appropria sanitation care in transport incubation and other actions as required by the fda to assure vaccine safety and efficacy this endeavor is far more complicated than the production of unfertiliz ed eggs for food reliance on eggs and is ratelimiting step in flu vaccine pr oduction requiring many weeks for growing the virus and extracting it from the eggs and introducing c ontamination risks each year the current flu vaccine produc tion system is race against the clock strains must be selected by february in order that they can be grown purified processed and made into vaccine under optimal cond itions vaccine is made in batches from august through november bare ly making it to market ahead of the annual influenza epidemic breakdowns in the process especially one occurring in the fall as with the chiron vaccine can s ubvert the entire production volume it is difficult if not impossible to start over w ithin given season so as with the chiron situation largescale process failure can l ead to complete loss of the entire seasons vaccine production from that supplier opportunities to streamline vaccine production the flu vaccine production process can be optimized in number of ways promising option is replacement of the cumbersome egggrowth step with cell culture methods in which the virus is grown in t ubes or vats of certa in cells with this technique growth is faster more c ontrolled takes up less space and introduces fewer contamination problems than using eggs cell culture techniques could make the annual flu vaccine production cycle less prone to failures nd more amenable to restarting production within season if pr oblems do arise in other words cell culture techniques can provide surge capacity within existing infrastructure this technique is not currently fdaapproved for flu vaccine production but is in early stages of clinical trials f unded by the national institutes of health nih potential problems must be evaluated such as the risk of cell components and genes getting into the vaccine or the virus also for existing flu vaccine manufacturers to use this method they would have to renovate existing facilities or construct new ones and would have to develop consistency in meeting good manufacturing practices gmps and other standards if they are to reliably produce vaccine each year flu vaccine production can also be optimized by using reverse genetics to produce vaccine strains strains of influenza virus with the right combination of traits to stimulate immunity and to grow well in eggs currently obtaining strains with the right characteristics for vaccine production is trialanderror process strains are grown together in batches and sampled in search for those with the desired traits with reverse genetics the desired parts of the viral genome are cloned and combined to create the needed traits more quickly and reliably reverse genetics is not currently approved for vaccine produc tion but nihfunded clinical trials are currently underway using the technique to produce vaccine for the strain of avian influenza bird flu now circulating in asia in the event that it becomes serious human pathogen the safety and effi cacy of flu vaccine produced using this technique remains to be evaluated in addition there are potential consumerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32655crs7 11 us department of health and human servic flu vaccines and antivirals transcript of news conference oct 19 2004acceptance concerns especially in europe because the vaccine virus produced is genetically modified organism another opportunity to optimize annual fl u vaccine production rests with steady enhancement of global influenza surveillance which could improve the speed and accuracy of strain selection ultimately the influenza virus holds two trump cards for which science does not offer solutions on the near horizon first there is limited ability to predict how the virus will modify itself into each years dominant circulating strains once these strains emerge there is race against time to produce vaccine while the strains are actually causing illness somewhere on the planet second the regular drifts of the viral genome and the more cataclysmic shifts that define pandemic are inherent in its genes and the resulting evasion of the human immune response is inherent in our genes this relationship has exis ted for eons and nearterm scientific breakthrough is likely to change it those seeking to prevent influenza infection are stuck with the prospect of annual fl u vaccines for the foreseeable future legal and policy issues overview the flu vaccine shortage announced on october 5 2004 unfolded within complex interaction of government and private sector actions leading many to question whether the federal governments authority is adequate to prevent these types of crises states and the federal government have different roles and authorities with respect to this event in general public health authority rests with the states as an exercise of their police powers as result states took the lead in restricting vaccine distribution to highrisk individuals and in prosecuting pricegouging the federal government under the commerce clause in the constitution may regulate the safety and efficacy of vaccines in commerce in the united states but this authority does not extend to controlling the distribution or administration of the product in public health emergency the public health service act grants the secretary of hhs broad authority to take such actions as necessary to control infectious diseases traditionally the fe deral government s supported states in exercising their public health author ities rather than subsuming them hhs secretary tommy g thompson said that he did not intend to declare the flu vaccine shortage public health emergency11 flu vaccination is medical procedure and many people voluntarily choose to be vaccinated in settings that are primar ily nongovernmental such as physicians office workplace or local grocery store while federal state and local governments do not control these activities directly they play an important

this respect has rested with states as cons equence when the flu vaccine shortage was announced and cdc recommended that vaccine be prioritized to certain groups several states counties and the district of columbia issued orders requiring healthcare providers to comply and established fines for the administration of scarce vaccine to nonpriority individuals some of the states declared the situation public health emergency while others used narro wer authorities to support their orders number of states and localitie s relaxed these restrictions beginning in december 2004 when they had

tioning system for its entire medicaid program allocating various types of services rather than distributing one scarce resource the rationing system was designed to provide coverage to all oregonians living below the federal poverty line not just those who met more selective financial eligibility standards by ra nking conditiontreatme nt pairs in order to determine on an annual basis what services would be c overed for which ailments the system was based upon combination of costeffec tiveness available funding and prioritization of medical services from most to least important to the entire population19 oregons rationing plan caused so controversy when it was first enacted because it explicitly involved c oncept of rationing in providing access to care and because it created difficulty in determining which services would be covered however the system is still in place today despite the moral difficulties involved with rationing allocation of scarce medical resources must still occur when the supply is not sufficient to meet the demand allocation decisions can be made with range of rationing mechanisms each with its own benefits and drawbacks potential mechanisms are discussed

ws20030414 hlsc0414htmsome recent scientific studi suggest that there ma be two additional methods of rationing vaccine the first study indicates that vaccine is more effective in some populations

also one that is most likely to suffer health consequences from the flu th elderly for this reason the vaccines effectiveness in population is unlikely to be used as tool for rationing the second study indicates that less than full dose of some types of flu vaccine may create serum antibody re sponse indicating that the vaccine may be effective in healthy individuals28 this finding could lead to system of rationing that increases the number vaccine doses by gi ving certain populations less than full dose however this strategy has not been fully evaluated to test its effectiveness and it was not implemented durin g the 2004 vaccine shortage one confounding issue is that studies suggest that particular populations including some minority groups are less likely to participate in vaccination programs29 the rationing system of choice mig ht have some mechanisms designed to encourage participation by targeted popul ations that historica lly have low rates of vaccination when

policymakers point to number of problems in assuring adequate supply including too few manufacturers low vaccination rates among groups who are advised to be vaccinated unpr edictable timing and severity of annual flu seasons and reluctance of manufacturers to overshoot demand estimates the 2004 flu vaccine shortage resulted from failure of production by company that held almost 50 of the

sustained significant losses from unused surplus vaccine which led to its decision to drop out of the market many have noted that expanded public purchase of vaccine would have helped this situation

reducing their incentives for remaining engaged number of these issues have been discussed in the context of project bioshield program to prom ote research and developmen t of countermeasures for bioterrorism in some ways project bioshield is an imperfect model for flu vaccine shortages because bioshield is designed to create production incentives for products that lack commercial market nonethele ss there are enough similar issues at play that flu vaccine supply may be added to th agenda in ongoing discussions of the bioshield program for example the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 contains provision which allo ws the secretary of hhs to temporarily authorize the emergency use of nonlicensed drugs and v accines some in congress called on the secretary of hhs to exercise this new authority in response to the flu vaccine shortage by locating available flu vaccine in other countries nd making it available to americans as quickly as possible as congress considers fo

making flu vaccine is not good business proposition the product is not highly profitable furthermore production of vaccines is technically difficult and lot failures resulting from sterility breaks or

targets w ithout knowing chirons status with certainty proposals to mitigate economic risk some in congress and others have proposed number of incentives to vaccine manufacturers to encourage entry into the market and to guarantee demand for vaccine which would in turn promote diversity of manufacturers and increase annual supply government buyback of surplus under this proposal the federal government would purchase vaccine that remained unused at the end of season this would work in theory by encourag ing manufacturers to produce more than they believed they could sell thereby providing cushion if annual supply were to fall short for any reason however if manufacturing problems or other supply disruptions did not occur wastage of unused doses would become government expense rather than private one in fy2005 appropriations congress pr ovided hhs with100 million to ensure yearround influenza vaccine production capacity stating that the secretary could use the funds for flu

influenza preparedness neither statutory language nor committee report language clarifies the intended use of these funds government purchase for stockpiling under this proposal the federal government would purchase doses of vaccine at the beginning of the season to serve as cushion if needed however because of its oneseason shelf life flu vaccine is not an attractive candidate fo r stockpiling products such as smallpox vaccine have long shelf life and stockpile purchases can be considered onetime expenditures for which high cost is acceptable cdc purchased 45 million doses of flu vaccine to

not in signated priority groups mostly deferred vaccination while small number of them reported that they sought vaccination but were unsuccessful of partic ular concern were findings that significant numbers of highrisk individuals did not seek vaccination because th ey doubted they could get it and that willingness to be vaccinated dropped off when the vaccine was investigational and require d signing consent form these findings remind public officials of an important premise for public health preparedness that imperfect compliance with recommendations is expect ed and should be taken into account in planning serious questions remain about the ex ercise of federal authority during an influenza pandemic many of these questions were raised in the face of the 2004 flu vaccine shortage should the federal gove rnment have or exercise authority to identify and control doses of scarce flu vaccine should the federal government have or exercise authority to control administration of vaccine by healthcare providers is the current model which leverages state authorities with federal assistance adequate for the current shor tage or for pandemic influenza or other public health emergencies given that the federal govern ment has overarching emergency authorities but has not used them will federal officials know how to conduct themselves if such authorities we re invoked in an emergency the flu vaccine shortage presents small study of these important questions conclusion it is intuitively appealing to think that federal officials when faced with public health emergency could take charge of information and assets and assure that remedies and burdens were equitably and efficiently di stributed actually thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32655crs26 shortage of flu vaccine illust rates two serious challenges that the federal government faces in public health emergency law and trad ition place much of the responsibility for preventing or managing the shortage either with the states or with the private sector and the threshold over which the federal gove rnment would wrest control from either appears high the federal government does not dictate the practice of medicine or compel companies to do business as result in situations like this one free market forces operate the public health system responds in decentralized fashion efforts may seem disorganized and th federal government may appear unresponsive since the terror attacks of 2001 some barriers have been overcome without substantial changes in the legal landscape an example is state preparedness planning with uniform guidance so that st ates aim for the same targets in planning for mass drug distribution or in ove rhauling their emergency public health authorities decentralization of public health authority to states is less of problem if all of them can respond capably and in consistent fashion another example is the government use of proprietary informa tion such as drug store sales to conduct surveillance for unusual health events the flu vaccine shortage has prompted further examination of the coordination of these pa rtners in response to national challenge posed another opportunity to explore crea tive solutions and offered another chance for lessons learnedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32655crs27 appendix congressional action in the 108th congress legislation selected
