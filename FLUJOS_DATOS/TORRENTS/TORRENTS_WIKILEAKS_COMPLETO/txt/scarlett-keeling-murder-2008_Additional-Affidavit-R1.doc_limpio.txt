artlibori resorts pvt respondent 1 herein do hereby solemnly state on oath as under 1 that i have been duly authorised to swear the present affidavit on behalf of the company and the contents thereof are based on the records available in the office of the company as well as those available with various statutory authorities etc 2 that the petitioner has filed the above company petition under section 397 and 398 of the companies act 1956 against the respondents the respondents filed their respective replies to the above petition on 9th april 2007 the petitioner has thereafter filed detailed rejoinder affidavit against the replies submitted earlier by the respondents herein it is most respectfully submitted that the petitioner has raised several fresh facts and issues which need an appropriate response by the respondents for an effective adjudication in the matter by this honble board it may be submitted that the present affidavit is only clarificatory in nature and new issues have been raised by the respondents 3 that the replies furnished by the respondents are in accordance with law hypertechnical adherence to procedure cannot substitute what has been effectively dealt with on merits by the respondents in fact since the petitioner seems to realise an absence of any substance or merits in his contentions he has been making non essential false and vexatious submissions 4 that the honble board made the following order on 23052007 in ca 1962007 application mentioned petitioner may write to the company listing the documentsrecords that he seeks and the company will give inspection of the same within week of the said letter after inspection the petitioner shall submit the rejoinder by 256 2007 the case will be heard on 190707 at 230 pm 5 it is submitted that the company was required to change its registered office on an extremely short notice at the behest of the landlord it had taken lawful measures to inform the concerned authorities about the said change of address the petitioner was fully aware of this fact as admitted in the rejoinder that interestingly the advocates for the petitioner had additionally sent registered letter dated 56 2007 to the respondent 2 containing notice for discovery inspection and production of documents at the new address of the company namely house 96 bhati wadda post morjim pernem goa 4039512 these were duly received and acknowledged by advocate for the respondents on 8062007 as stated in the rejoinder of the petitioner therefore the contents and projection by the petitioner in 3 to 6 of the rejoinder cannot be comprehended on facts logic and law in fact the assertions that the petitioner was unaware of the new address of the company is false it is apparent that the petitioner had duly received information from the respondents and other sources in consonance with the order dated 23052007 by the honble board copy of the envelope containing the notice dated 506 2007 sent by advocates for the petitioner is marked and annexed hereto annexure r1 i 6 the respondents vehemently deny the contents of 4 whereunder mr rakesh manchanda attorney for the petitioner has alleged that he received threatening call not to come to the respondents office this bland assertion without any proof has meaning in law it is denied that the petitioner repeatedly tried to serve the respondents in fact his admission about receiving the letter dated 8062007 sent by the advocate for the respondents is enough proof about the bonafide of the respondent the advocate for the respondent had clearly welcomed the petitioner for an inspection between 930 am and 530 pm on any working day without notice 7 it would be pertinent to mention that the petitioner in his original application dated 90507 for production inspection and discovery of documents had mentioned seven documents while the subsequent notice of the counsel for the petitioner demanded an eighth document without permission of the honble board the respondent has also been informed that during the course of the arguments on 230507 the honble board had refused permission for the original passports to be given counsel for respondents had clearly submitted that many original documents of the company had been taken away by mr rakesh manchanda the gpa of the petitioner while two documents required for inspection had already been taken by mr rakesh manchanda gpa of the petitioner from the centurion bank calangute branch goa in october 2006 copy of the banks letter is annexed hereto as annexure r1 j 8 it is denied that the respondents made an allegation for the first time that mr rakesh manchanda gpa of the petitioner had taken away large number of original documents from the registered office of the company as narrated by advocate for respondents in his letter of reply dated 8062007 in fact this submission has been made in the reply furnished by respondent 2 in 41 subpara xiv at page 168 of volume ii of the paper books additionally this fact had been put forth by the advocate for the respondents before the honble chairman of the board in the hearing dated 23052007 it is submitted that some of the documents before november 2006 were only photocopies of the originals as available in the company record it has been stated in the replies that due to the petitioners conduct including that of his gpa mr rakesh manchanda several original records of the company were forcibly and unlawfully taken away 9 that the respondent vehemently denies the contents of 6 of the rejoinder in as much as they are false and amount to perjury being committed on the facts of the case it has been stated that mr pramod walke is purported director of the respondent company who has categorically denied ever seeing minutes book or having attended any of the directors meetings this is false and mischievous statement made by the petitioner affidavit by mr pramod walke has been filed in this regard 10 it has been stated in 9 of reply on merits of the rejoinder to the companys reply that the certificate issued by ms prashant karekar co erstwhile chartered accountants of the company is false it is alleged that sum of usd 29997 vide annexure 20 was transferred by the brophy group and sum usd 4555 vide annexure 21 was transferred by sergey ivanov the petitioner herein it is alleged that the certification by the ca to the company that the said amounts were transferred by the respondent 2 are wrong it is most respectfully submitted that the respondent no1 wrote letter dated 29th june 2007 to ms prashant karekar co asking them to explain the above alleged discrepancy till the time of making this affidavit shri prashant karekar despite repeated telephone calls and reminders has refused to oblige copy of the letter dated 29th june 2007 sent to shri prashant is marked and annexed hereto as annexure r 1 k 11 realising the importance and urgency in the matter an inquiry was made into the original papers available in the companys registered office it has resulted in discovery that the original documents show that usd 4555 were not transferred by sergey ivanov the petitioner herein but by the brophy group this clearly demonstrates that the petitioner has manipulated and fabricated the document annexure 21 to show that he was the contributor of funds when in reality it was not him but some other legal person thus annexure 21 appears to be forgery notarised copy of the original foreign inward remittance certificate for this transaction issued by the centurion bank calangute branch goa is marked and annexed hereto as annexure r 1 l 12 it may be submitted that all facts clearly point to the position of respondent 2 being the sole major financial contributor to the company in contrast to unsubstantiated and vague allegations of the petitioner in this regard it is categorically denied that the petitioner was or is in any manner major contributor of funds to the company and the statement by centurion bank calangute branch goa is adequate evidence in support of the contention of the respondent 13 the petitioner has failed to discharge his burden of proving or substantiating the averments in his petition as well as rejoinder and is therefore not entitled to any relief whatsoever 14 in view of the above facts it is unambiguous and clear that despite all the repeated attempts by the petitioner to falsify facts the respondent 2 is actually and factually the major financial contributor to the paid up share capital of the company 15 that the rejoinder affidavit to the companys earlier reply has been filed with reference to facts or records available and the entire effort is to prejudice an effective adjudication in the matter 16 that the annexures filed along with this affidavit are true copies of their originals hence verified and signed on this the 16th day of july 2007 at goa deponent verification i the above named deponent do hereby verify that the contents of paras 1 to 16 above are true and correct to my knowledge and belief and as per the records available deponent
