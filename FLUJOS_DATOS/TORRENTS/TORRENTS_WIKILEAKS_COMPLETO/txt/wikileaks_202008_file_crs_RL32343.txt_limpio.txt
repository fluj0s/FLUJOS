issues updated december 23 2004 lawrence kumins and robert bamberger specialists in energy policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress gasoline price surge revisited crude oil and refinery issues summary since late 2002 gasoline prices have been extremely volatile with the national average spiking above 170 three times most recently the nationwide pump price for regular fuel set new record as momentum carried it over 200 per gallon prices in some states reaching high of 245 per gallon in california are much above the national average in addition to the market forces affecting pump prices in the united states the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec announced production cut effective in january 2005 at minimum this is likely to support crude prices crude prices have significant impact on prices at the pump apart from higher crude oil prices gasoline prices are strongly influenced by the supply and demand situation at the pump since 1999 the only growth in us oil consumption has been increased gasoline demand which has risen by 600000 barrels per day to current annual average of 90 million barrels per day while this might seem to be relatively small amount it has directly increased demand for imports of foreign gasoline since us refineries have not added capacity as gasoline demand has grown demand for imported gasoline now exceeds one million barrels per day in addition to the high demand for imported gasoline the quality of gasoline sought from foreign refiners has become factor as the specifications for environmentally acceptable fuel have become more stringent the complexity of manufacturing us spec gasoline has increased not all refiners can economically make fuel that meets domestic requirements us gasoline marketers seeking imports must shop world markets for scarce commodity accordingly prices are high these highpriced incremental supplies play an important role in determining prices at the pump because all gasoline tends to be priced by the market at the cost of the last units supplied other factors contributing to the pump price situation include the state of gasoline and crude oil inventories at us refineries both are recovering from low levels gasoline inventories available for consumption amount to less than two days of supply crude oil stocks from which gasoline consumed is replaced are still at low levels although rebounding somewhat from last winters record lows petroleum inventories are low because global oil supplies are tight in part due to strong demand especially in asia opec production policy is consideration as well as gasoline prices rise so does interest in finding some sort of public policy remedy that would return lower and more stable prices among the options generally discussed are release of crude from the strategic petroleum reserve and the relaxation of environmental protection agency rules regarding gasoline composition both are controversial with the wisdom and effectiveness of each challenged by some this report will be updated to reflect significant changes in the factors impacting gasoline markets and

figure 5 crude oil refiner inventories january 2003 to present 8 gasoline price surge revisited crude oil and refinery issues introduction gasoline prices have been extremely volatile for nearly two years with three significant price spikes focusing the attention of consumers and policy makers on the gas pump with 2004 national average gasoline prices setting record of 205 per gallon gal in midmay breaking the old summer 2003 record of 174gal gasoline market developments have been viewed with concern even with yearend decline to 180gal crude oil prices also rose sharply during 2004 briefly exceeding 55 per barrel on the spot market despite pullback crude prices for 2004 remained above levels last seen when kuwait was invaded during the 19901991 gulf crisis by midmay the crude oil price increase to almost 42 per barrel accounted for as much as 20 cents per gallon of total increase at the pump of 43 cents since the end of 2003 simply stated pump prices are essentially determined by the supply of and demand for gasoline although the cost of crude figures into the equation other supplyside factors leading to high prices relate to the ability of domestic refineries to meet growing gasoline demand with new domestic refinery built for quarter century the nation relies on imports for roughly 11 1 million barrels per day mbd of its 9 mbd gasoline needs as us gasoline specifications to meet clean air standards become tougher for all refiners to meet the supply of foreign fuel available to us importers is not always immediately available in addition to meeting us specifications foreign supply difficulties include long intransit time and the cost and availability of vessels suitable for refined product transport have become tight these factors have contributed to gasoline prices exceeding the observed increase in crude oil cost during much of 2004 as consequence while the increase in crude prices stands out increased gasoline prices have greater profile drawing attention to the nations energy situation gasoline prices according to the american automobile association aaa daily survey of retail gasoline prices around the country gasoline prices at the pump nationwide have exceeded previous records since the start of 2003 prices at the gas pump have fluctuated by as much as 55 cents per gallon and reached peaks above 170 three times figure 1 shows pump prices for the united states as whole and california where both price levels and peaks exceed the national averages result of various local conditions california pump prices peaked in october at

are crude oil prices for the benchmark nymex traded crude oil west texas intermediate wti for delivery at cushing ok this is often referred to as the spot market price the weighted average cost of different types of crude used by refiners tracks the nymex price although it generally averages less than this benchmark gasoline is manufactured from crude oil and this price series provides baseline comparison between retail prices wholesale prices excluding tax and raw material cost when gasoline prices peaked in may crude oil averaged more than 40 per barrel on the nymex the equivalent of 95 cents per gallon an increase of about 19 cents from the december 2003 average of 32 per barrel crude oil prices fluctuate markedly on daily basis posing difficulty in updating the figures cited here while an oversimplification every gallon of gasoline requires gallon of crude added to refinery input for much of the figure 1 time frame crude oil prices track national average pump prices reasonably closely but the peaks in gasoline prices spring late summer 2003 and more recently in may 2004 exceeded what could be attributed to increased crude costs while crude oil price increases are generally passed through to the gas pump on pennyforpenny basis and help explain much of the change in gasoline prices the divergence between gasoline at the pump and crude points toward changed gross margins in refining and marketing this is due to the fundamental supply and demand situation for gasoline relating specifically to an crs3 imbalance between the two that is resolved by change in price the most recent price spike seen in figure 1 taking place in fall 2004 appears to coincide with an increase in crude prices the coincidence here suggests that high gasoline prices seen in september and october 2004 may have been driven by crude cost push rather than demand pull at the pump rising gasoline prices often elicit questions about the federal governments ability to intervene in the market and roll back price hikes it must be kept in mind that gasoline prices are not currently regulated and there is statutory authority to do so period of price controls accompanied by supply allocation requirements was in effect from august 15 1971 until january 20 1981 those controls were often associated with shortages resulting in episodes of long lines at gas pumps in retrospect it is not clear that the price controls resulted in retail prices that were lower than they might otherwise have been as result the concept of government mandated price controls during periods of rapid price increases has seen little support as policy option since the 1970s gasoline inventory considerations figure 2 shows us gasoline inventories during the past two years the gray area highlights the normal operating range including seasonal fluctuations for gasoline stocks the horizontal line across the bottom of the figure shows the lower operational inventory which the department of energy doe places at 185 million barrels the equivalent of about 20 days of nominal supply that is the level at which sporadic physical shortages begin to appear around the nation the 185 million barrel figure can be thought of as the fill needed to keep the distribution system in normal operation it cannot be drawn upon to meet demand increment at the pump when there is virtually extra supply to act as price cushion price spikes spot shortages and localized runouts are possibility figure 2 us gasoline inventories january 2003 to present source eia weekly petroleum status report figure 4 crs4 the most recent peak gasoline demand recorded in midsummer 2003 was fourweek average of about 94 mbd gasoline demand consistently averaged about 90 mbd during 2004 the difference between stocks which have run between 200 and 215 million barrels during 2004 and does minimum operating level is between 15 and 30 million barrels the equivalent of roughly two or three days of supply available from refiners stocks gasoline inventories have bounced between the upper and lower ranges of normal during 2004 they were below the normal range when gasoline prices peaked in may and at the end of 2004 they were above the normal range for this time of year factor likely contributing to the yearend decline in pump prices generally when crude oil stocks were below the seasonal norm pump prices rose and when stocks were above the seasonal norm prices fell the ebb and flow of gasoline stocks during 2004 period of noteworthy gasoline price volatility reflects balance between gasoline inventories seasonal driving demand and the crude available to make more at us refineries as well as the supply of imports gasoline supply us production and imports us refineries cannot currently manufacture all the gasoline called for by the nations motorists1 about 11 is imported either as finished readytomarket gasoline or as blending components that can be mixed into the gasoline pool thus two sets of gasoline supply figures should be watched the products supplied series compiled by eia and new gasoline supply the combination of imports of finished gasoline gasoline blending components and net us refinery production of gasoline the products supplied data show gasoline flowing to consumers from inventory new supply data show the amount of newly available gasoline be it produced or imported that may flow into inventories or directly to the pump figure 3 shows gasoline supplied to us markets since the start of 2003 these data consist of domestic refinery production2 imports of finished gasoline that meets us specifications as well as significant amount between 300000 and 500000 barrels per day of blending components from refineries abroad 1 for discussion of the economics of the us refining sector see crs report rl32248 petroleum refining economic performance and challenges for the future by robert l pirog 2 defined as finished motor gasoline production at us refineries minus imports of blending components which are refined offshore crs5 figure 3 gasoline production and imports jan 2002 dec 2004 10 95 9 85 8 75 7 jan 02 apr jul oct jan 03 apr jul oct jan 04 apr july oct source finished imported gasoline eia petroleum supply monthly table 54 blend components eia weekly petroleum status report table 9 us net refinery production see text of report these imported blending components lend complexity to tabulating the data on gasoline production eia includes the blending components in its series on refinery production even though they are not produced in us refineries blending components are added to gasoline supplies at refineries and terminals they appear in the eia data collected from refiners and terminal operators as if they were the same as output from us refineries manufacturing process whereas they are actually imported eia does this in order to avoid counting the components twice as imports and as refinery output without these imports of blending components gasoline supplied by us refiners and terminal operators would be less on barrelforbarrel basis once they are blended into the pool of us refinery output and meet marketability standards they become part of us gasoline supply although they are not identified by eia as imports per imports of gasoline and components peaked at 11 mbd including 426000 barrels per day of components in april 2003 venezuela has historically been supplier of refined gasoline to the united states but petroleum sector labor unrest has hindered refining operations us gasoline supplies from venezuela have suffered since late 2002 when two month oil workers strike crippled production and refining reformulated gasoline rfg supplies in particular have suffered with crs6 the first poststrike cargo shipped to the united states in june 20033 subsequently supplies from venezuela whose refineries have operated as if they were part of the us supply system have been sporadic as operational and labor problems have limited the output of difficulttoproduce gasoline that meets us specifications4 us refineries maintained gasoline production of about 84 mbd through most of 2003 with total output of all products reflecting operating rates of between 92 and 96 of capacity but refiner utilization typically falls in the month of january as refiners turn around production to emphasize gasoline output instead of heating fuels and perform scheduled maintenance consistent with this pattern capacity utilization in february and march of 2004 ran in the 89 area april and may saw utilization rates as high as 96 figure which has historically represented maximum practical operating capability it is noteworthy that these early2004 months represented period of rising pump prices development likely linked to high refinery runs total gasoline production and imports made available to commercial inventories and end markets illustrated by the top line in figure 3 peaked in august 2003 and declined through the winter refinery production and imports increased as the 2004 driving season approached in early may over 91 mbd was made available gasoline supplied including inventory withdrawals peaked at 94 mbd in august 2003 as figure 4 shows this is significantly more than levels of 86 to 87 mbd in winter 20032004 and allowed inventories to stabilize above 200 million barrels exceeding minimum levels aboveminimum gasoline inventory levels and increased gasoline availability may well be price stabilizing factor having contributed to the decline of pump prices from their alltime highs during the last part of 2004 but to maintain such an inventory expansion domestic refiners would need to produce sufficient gasoline and imports which have not been robust would need to increase for the bulk of the driving season just ahead for us refiners to run more gasoline their own supplies of crude must exceed minimum operating levels so that they have enough crude for expanded operations depending on how events unfold the softening in retail gasoline prices seen during the final weeks of 2004 may be temporary 3 venezuela plans cut in rfg exports to us platts oilgram news august 29 2003 p 3 4 refiners must deal with several challenges including requirement effective at the start of 2004 calling for substantial reduction in gasoline sulfur content and the need to reduce volatility while meeting fuel performance standards crs7 figure 4 gasoline supplied jan 2003 dec 2004 10 95 9 85 8 75 7 jan 03 apr july oct jan 04 apr july oct dec source eia weekly petroleum status report table 10 crude oil inventory considerations crude oil in refiner inventories is shown of figure 5 note that crude stocks recently fell below the lower observed limit during early winter 20032004 but recovered reflecting lower refinery runs during january 2004 for gasoline supplies to maintain levels sufficient to avoid runouts and price spikes crude must be available at refineries with domestic crude production at its maximum imported crude oil will be called on to provide the needed incremental supply in the recent past crude oil imports peaked in september 2003 at 103 mbd and they fell to low of 93 mbd in early 2004 at the end of 2004 crude imports had peaked again at 103 mbd this supply of imports has permitted crude stocks to rise to about 300 million barrels in early may level equivalent to two days of refinery operations above minimum operating levels crude availability may ultimately become factor in meeting gasoline supply needs absent sufficient inventories and some assurance that they can be replaced at prices commensurate with selling prices for gasoline and other refined products refiners may be reluctant to run barrels of what might be viewed as scarce crude in other words refiner may be unwilling to refine highpriced crude and sell the resulting gasoline at an effective price below crude cost the current world crude situation is characterized by many crosscurrents notably opec production policy and growing demand chiefly from asia opec has pursued supply and price policy that has resulted in prices that exceeding 50 crs8 on the nymex briefly are well above its recently stated target band of 22 to 28 per barrel measured at the point of export this has resulted in much higher prices in the united states asian demand appears to be growing at much higher rate than previously expected the international energy agency iea reports that surging demand in china and other nonoecd asian economies has raised the assessment of global oil demand growth for 2004 to an average of 165 mbd over 20035 growing demand for the worlds oil even us demand grew by 500000 barrels per day between 2003 and 2004 25 increase has given opec some pricing power as it tries to manage markets figure 5 crude oil refiner inventories january 2003 to present source eia weekly petroleum status report figure 3 other factors contributing to high gasoline prices us gasoline quality and composition regulations have created unusual fuel requirements that are not easily met by foreign refiners in nation where refinery capacity can only meet about 90 of gasoline needs calling for significant supplies from abroad meeting us product specs for imports can present barrier to supplying market demand in addition to us requirements for reformulated gasoline low sulfur requirements began in 2004 further the ban on use of the additive mtbe now in effect in california new york and connecticut has resulted in increased need for lowvolatility gasoline because the mtbe ban necessitates the use of ethanol in the gasoline cocktail since ethanol increases the vapor pressure volatility measured by the reid vapor pressure index or rvpi of gasoline low cost high vapor pressure components such as butane and pentanes must be removed 5 iea oil market report march 11 2004 see highlights crs9 from the rfg pool the gasoline base stock suitable for blending with ethanol such that an acceptable rvp is achieved is relatively difficult and costly to refine and not available from every refiner there is also volumetric loss with ethanol blended gasoline because approximately two gallons of mtbe are being replaced by one gallon of ethanol the net volume loss must be replaced with some other highoctane blend component with low vapor pressure in addition to the need for more gallons of gasoline in the blend the availability of blending components of the needed quality such as alkylate and isooctane is limited in addition to manufacturing challenges at us refineries two purely economic factors have operated to raise the cost of importing gasoline there is shortage of smaller clean tankers in which gasoline cargoes are transported resulting in high tanker rates which are passed on to the pump6 if the incremental cost of imported product is high by virtue of this it tends to erect price umbrella supporting higher prices for all gasoline sold in the nation the other economic factor is the structure of gasoline price futures that took shape in 2003 and prevailed for much of 2004 situation traders call backwardation this refers to the hierarchy of prices for gasoline for delivery in future months in which near months have higher prices than outmonths purchaser of currentmarket gasoline knows that at the time it is scheduled to be shipped and delivered the market price at that future point in time is expected to be lower than the price paid when the deal was crafted if this event comes to pass the purchaser may not be able to sell the gasoline for what he paid for it this phenomenon tends to discourage the immediate purchase of gasoline for future sale keeping inventories from growing gasoline prices and the strategic petroleum reserve the recent increase in the prices of crude oil and gasoline have prompted calls for use of the strategic petroleum reserve spr while some have called for drawdown the first issue is whether to cease the current fill program which critics assert has aggravated tight oil supply situation and contributed to high gasoline prices on november 13 2001 the president ordered fill of the spr to its current capacity of roughly 700 million barrels principally through royaltyinkind rik acquisitions of the governments share of production from federal offshore leases historically the treasury has taken this royalty in the form of cash equivalent however an rik program was established for the purpose of adding crude to the spr continued deliveries of rik oil were scheduled through october 2004 and if left in place will average between roughly 65000 and 200000 barrels per day bd depending upon the month further deliveries will be scheduled with the 6 low imports pose risk to us gasoline supply platts oilgram news march 23 2004 p 1 crs10 intention of filling the spr to capacity sometime in 20057 the spr currently holds roughly 650 million barrels some have argued that these rik deliveries are contributing to currently high oil prices and should be suspended so that the rik oil can be offered in markets others have argued that the volumes involved are too small to have significant impact and that fill should continue in the interests of national security on march 11 2004 in its debate on the fy2005 budget resolution the senate called for suspension of deliveries and sale instead of 53 million barrels of rik oil proceeds pegged at 17 billion would be used for deficit reduction and increased homeland security funding for states some members of the house have also voiced support for deferring fill the administration has argued that the volumes of rik being added to the spr are too small to put significant pressure on crude oil prices and that it will continue its current fill policy if there is to be any use of the spr in the current situation the deferral of oil deliveries and allowing this oil to enter into markets might be logical first step however some supporters of using the spr are also urging president bush to also authorize swap or exchange of spr oil comparable to one held in september 2000 when the clinton administration made 30 million barrels available8 under the terms of swap interested parties are invited to bid to borrow crude from the spr to be returned at later date awards are made on the basis of how much oil bidder will return in exchange for barrel now in other words for every barrel taken in swap the refiner or bidder will return something more than one barrel at an agreedupon future date the bidding and award process was completed in two weeks in 2000 with oil picked up soon thereafter oil borrowed in the fall of 2000 was returned to the spr by early 2004 the swap had the effect of ultimately adding oil to the spr at time as is the case now when congress was not authorizing funds for outright purchase of oil for the reserve while historically the use of the spr or simply announcement of its intended use has resulted in some decline in crude prices nearly every occasion has been unique each situation has had other external circumstances surrounding the event such that it is difficult to isolate the extent of any price moves that can be attributed solely to the use of the spr9 7 doe posts the delivery schedule under current inventory at httpwwwfedoegov programsreserves 8 under the original statute pl94173 the spr was not supposed to be used to affect prices but to compensate for loss in physical supply that may express itself in higher prices an amendment in the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 broadened the drawdown authority further to include instances where reduction in supply appeared sufficiently severe to bring about an increase in the price of petroleum severe enough to likely cause major adverse impact on the national economy 9 for details on the historical use of the spr see crs issue brief ib87050 strategic petroleum reserve or see the detail provided by the department of energy at httpwwwfedoegovprogramsreservessprdrawdownshtml crs11 more to the point in this particular report is whether the availability of spr crude would have an effect on gasoline prices as noted elsewhere in this report gasoline supply in some regions is constrained by the refining capacity to produce fuel that meets local or seasonal requirements while release of spr oil may soften crude prices to some extent it may be little reflected in local gasoline prices if demand for fuel remains high where refining capacity is tight it may even be possible that release of spr crude to the extent that it benefitted supply in some regions of the country might widen the observed disparity between gasoline prices on the west coast and elsewhere moreover in the spring of 2004 prices appear especially sensitive to weekly reports on crude and product stocks while release of spr might benefit crude stock levels gasoline stocks will improve only if demand levels and refining capacity plus imports allow refiners to add to stocks as suggested this is likelier in some regions of the country than others in sum opinion appears divided on the effect that the administrations current fill policy is having on crude price and product supply as well as on the benefits that might be more than shortterm if rik oil is diverted to the markets or swapexchange of spr is held concluding observations the nation experienced its third gasoline price spike in little more than one year with new nationwide record for the average price for unleaded regular reaching 205 in midmay 2004 while prices have fallen as supplies have increased the supplydemandprice situation remains volatile several general gasoline supply issues have contributed to the recent episode shortage of refinery capacity resulting from lack of new construction has led to increasing reliance on imports of blending components and finished gasoline increasingly challenging fuel specifications including the mtbe ban in several states and the 2004 standards for reduced sulfur content have added to the complexities of refining and distribution steadily growing gasoline demand which has increased by 600000 barrels per day since 1999 has risen from 84 mbd to 90 mbd for the whole of 2004 this has accounted for virtually all the nations increase in oil consumption gasoline inventories were low in early april 2004 there was less than two days of available supply in the system crude oil stocks were below normal seasonal levels for much of 2004 only recently rebounding from below minimum operational levels there is little us refining capacity to make more gasoline while crude availability might not be an immediate concern this situation could easily change crs12 opec has gained power on crude supply and price members actually reduced oil exports by about 400000 barrels per day during april 2004 and that contributed to prices rising over 4110 this set the stage for crude prices surging over 50 despite what subsequently proved to be steady flow from opec during the last half of 2004 opec output for november was the highest since 197911 this may have led to crude declines to the 45 area and on december 10 opec announced 1 mbd production cut12 the recent gasoline price surge was especially severe in california where prices peaked at 245gal setting new state record californias situation is unique because of state requirements for especially clean gasoline and its ban on the use of mtbe fuel meeting california specifications is not readily available from all refineries especially those abroad additionally california has easttowest pipeline system through which gasoline can be shipped from gulf coast refineries even high prices which would under other circumstances attract extra supply cannot easily selfcorrect supply shortfall with insufficient west coast refinery capacity to meet regional needs and dependency on imports california has generally seen gasoline prices trending above national averages for the past several years and because the state cannot quickly get makeup supply from other domestic refineries small operational difficulties in the refining and transport system can lead to outsized price spikes an important energy policy aspect of the gasoline price situation involves the potential use of the spr various measures involving release of spr crude by whatever mechanism to stabilize the market have been proposed and it is likely that more will be forthcoming if prices remain volatile at elevated levels options for using spr oil must be evaluated in context of the complex nature of oil markets by statute the spr is intended to be used to offset demonstrable supply shortages that are contributing to high prices as has been noted factors other than crude supply have had significant role in fuel markets under some circumstances adding crude to markets in the absence of incremental refining capacity will not boost supply or reduce price in timely fashion 10 opec should delay oil cuts until june kuwaiti says bloomberg news march 25 2004 at bloombergcom 11 opec crude output climbs to 305 mil bd in november platts
