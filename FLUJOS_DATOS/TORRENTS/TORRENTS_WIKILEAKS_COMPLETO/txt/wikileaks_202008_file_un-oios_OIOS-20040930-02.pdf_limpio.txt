labourdepartment of social welf are rec01 world vision international 11 wvi did not effectively use their interna tional accounting software for analysing and summarising unhcr subproject expenditures as r esult of this and in the absence of proper summary of expenditure transactions oios wa s unable to reconcile the expenditures recorded in wvis books of account to the spmrs oi recommended that wvi implement an effective accounting system for the tracking of and reporting on unhcr subproject expenditures wvi has agreed to redesign their accounting syste m to be more suitable for unhcrs reporting requirements 12 oios found number of errors in wvis acc ounting records as well as ineligible charges such as household furniture for internation staff residences the expenditures reported in the 2002 and 2003 spmrs were overstated by some us 32000 mainly as proper cutoff between accounting periods had not b een established some us 22000 related to expenditure charged in the last quarter of the 2002 subproject as well as to the 2003 subproject and further us 9000 for expen ses charged twice to the 2002 subproject moreover 2002 expenditures of nearly us 16000 in curred during

the us 32000 referred to above as well as the other ineligible expenditures identified by oios for which wvi accep ted were erroneously charged moreover wvi has submitted revised 2003 spmr wh ich excludes the disbursements of almost us 16000 made under the 2002 subproject b southern alliance for indigenous resources 13 oios assessed that safire accounting system was adequate for unhcr re porting requirements however due to the use of frequentl changed almost daily exchange rates applied to each expenditure transaction the final spmrs expressed in us dollars could not be reconciled to safire books of accounts furthe r due to the application of incorrect exchange rates for certain expenditure unhcr was vercharged by some us 7000 oios recommended that the application of an average mont hly exchange rate would have been more appropriate in this case safire has recalculated the errors made and have ag reed to reimburse some us 4180 c department of social welfare 14 in 2002 dsw without prior approval from unhcr increased staff salaries the justification for this was on the basis of govern ments decision in august 2002 to revise salary scales for civil servants the increased sal ary costs resulted in further and unbudgeted cost to unhcr of some us 36000 oios noted that the salary scales for civil servants increased by about 20 per cent but dsw awarded inc reases of up to 95 per cent this meant that the relevant budget lines were overspent by so 50 percent other significant and unauthorized budgetary overruns were by incurred by dsw for the 2002 subproject however in order to hide these overexpenditures they were transferred to the 2003 sub project such practice is not acceptable as it does not reflect the true expenditure per sub project ocm has instructed dsw to seek approval from unhcr prior to incurring expenditure in excess of the approved budgets and r efrain from transferring charges to the subsequent year subproject b other programme issues 15 project financial monitoring of partners n eeded to be significantly improved the spmrs were certified by ocm without any independent verification of the partners financial books of account oios review found
