specialist in social policy domestic social policy division nonmarital childbearing trends reasons and public policy interventions summary in 2006 record 385 of all united states births were nonmarital births many of these children grow up in motheronly families although most children who grow up in motheronly families or stepparent families become welladjusted productive adults the bulk of empirical research indicates that children who grow up with only one biological parent in the home are more likely to be financially worse off and have worse socioeconomic outcomes even after income differences are taken into account compared to children who grow up with both biological parents in the home in recognition of the potential longterm economic and social consequences associated with nonmarital births the federal governments strategy with regard to nonmarital childbearing has been varied the federal government recognizes that an effective approach for teenagers may be inappropriate for older women federal policy toward teens has primarily focused on pregnancy prevention programs whereas federal policy toward older women has focused on healthy marriage programs federal income support programs are available to mothers of all age groups in the us nonmarital births are widespread touching families of varying income class race ethnicity and geographic area many analysts attribute this to changed attitudes about fertility and marriage they find that many adult women and teenage girls longer feel obliged to marry before or as consequence of having children with respect to men it appears that one result of the socalled sexual revolution is that many men now believe that women can and should control their fertility via contraception or abortion and have become less willing to marry the women they impregnate factors that are associated with the unprecedented level of nonmarital childbearing include an increase in the median age of first marriage ie marriage postponement decreased childbearing of married couples increased marital dissolution an increase in the number of cohabiting couples increased sexual activity outside of marriage

is more likely to lead to less favorable outcomes than is being born to married mother in the us births to unmarried women ie nonmarital births are widespread touching families of varying income class race ethnicity and geographic area many analysts attribute this to changed attitudes about fertility and marriage they find that many adult women and teenage girls longer feel obliged to marry before or as consequence of having children during the 66year period from 1940 to 2006 the percentage of births to unmarried women increased by multiple of nine from 38 in 1940 to 385 in 2006 this represented about 16 million children in 2006 nonmarital births can be first births second births or higherorder births they can precede marriage or occur to woman who has never married nonmarital births can occur to divorced or widowed women moreover woman with several children may have had one or more births within marriage and one or more births outside of marriage1 many of the children born outside of marriage are raised by single parent who may or may not have significant other2 parents and family life are the foundation that influences childs wellbeing throughout the childs development and into adulthood the family also is the economic unit that obtains and manages the resources that meet childs basic needs while also playing an instrumental role in stimulating the childs cognitive social and emotional development children born outside of marriage often are raised solely by their mothers but sometimes live in other types of family situations some are raised solely by their fathers some are raised by both biological parents who are not married to each other ie cohabiting others may be raised by mother who is living with male partner still others may be living with mother

available for children under age one by parents marital status in 2007 594 of the 1038 million children under age one were living with their biological mothers who had never married 34 were living with their biological fathers who had never married and 372 were living with both biological parents who were not married to each other source us census bureau americas families and living arrangements 2007 table c3 crs2 divorced from someone other than their father additionally some may be living with mother whose husband died ie the mother is widow but the child was not fathered by the deceased husband although most children who grow up in motheronly families fatheronly families stepparent families or families in which the mother is cohabiting with male partner become welladjusted productive adults large body of research indicates that children who grow up with only one biological parent in the home are more likely to be financially worse off and have worse socioeconomic outcomes even after income differences are taken into account compared to children who grow up with both biological parents in the home3 to emphasize this research indicates that all family situations in which both biological parents are not living together regardless of whether the mother is divorced separated widowed or was never married are more likely to result in less favorable outcomes for children than family situation in which the child is living in household with both biological parents it is also noteworthy that some researchers conclude that even among children living with both biological parents living with married parents generally results in better outcomes for children than living with cohabiting parents mainly because marriage is more stable and longer lasting situation than cohabitation4 the federal concern about nonmarital childbearing centers on its costs via claims on public assistance these federal costs primarily reflect the fact that many of these nonmarital children are raised in singleparent families that are financially disadvantaged federal concern also arises because of the aforementioned research indicating that children living in singleparent families are more likely to face negative outcomes financially socially and emotionally than children who grow up with both of their biological parents in the home as mentioned earlier many children born outside of marriage are raised in singleparent families5 this report analyzes the trends in nonmarital childbearing in the us discusses some of the characteristics of unwed mothers addresses some issues involving the fathers of children born outside of marriage covers many of the reasons for nonmarital childbearing examines the impact of nonmarital births on families and on the nation and presents the public policy interventions that have been used to prevent nonmarital births or alleviate some of the problems that are associated with nonmarital childbearing this report concludes with commentary on public policy interventions healthy marriage programs responsible fatherhood programs and teen pregnancy prevention strategies that may receive

nonmarital childbearing sometimes results in negative outcomes for children mainly because children born outside of marriage are generally not raised by both of their biological parents but rather by single mothers children living in household maintained by nevermarried mother are among the poorest population groups in the us even in cases in which cohabiting parents start off raising their children together it is often of short duration this section presents some of the major findings of the report after stabilizing in the 1990s nonmarital births are again increasing in 2006 385 of all births were nonmarital births this surpasses the percentage in 1960 that prompted some policymakers to claim that the black family was disintegrating because large share of nonmarital births were to black women in 2006 707 of african american births were nonmarital births compared with 646 of american indian births 499 of hispanic births 266 of white births and 163 of asian births6 nonmarital births can be first births second births or higherorder births they can precede marriage or occur to woman who has never married nonmarital births can occur to divorced or widowed women moreover woman with several children may have had one or more births within marriage and one or more births outside of marriage7 after declining for 14 straight years all teen births increased in 2006 contrary to public perception women in their early twenties not teens have the highest percentage of births outside of marriage in 2005 women ages 20 through 24 accounted for 38 of the 15 million nonmarital births the comparable statistic for females under age 208 was 23 however many women who have nonmarital births in their twenties were also teen moms9 6 the sources of data for this report are varied they primarily consist of 1 birth data from the national center for health statistics at the department of health and human services hhs 2 income and poverty data from the census bureau and 3 data on economic and demographic factors from the fragile families and child wellbeing study and the 2002 panel of the national survey of family growth 7 kristin moore nonmarital childbearing in the united

marriage perception vs reality research brief child trends april 2001 crs4 births to teenagers are an important component of nonmarital births because more than 80 of births to teenagers are nonmarital births although women have been postponing marriage women of all ages do not view marriage as requirement for sexual activity10 with the longer time span between the onset of sexual activity and marriage the trend of high numbers of nonmarital births maycould continue although nonmarital births are increasing many more children than in previous decades live with both biological parents in cohabiting situations for some period of time according to analysts marriage is considered better option for children than cohabitation because marriage is more stable ie lasts longer than cohabiting situations growing up in singleparent family is one of many factors that put children at risk of less favorable outcomes the economic social psychological and emotional costs associated with children with absent noncustodial parents are significant nevertheless most children who grow up in singleparent families become productive adults children living in singleparent home are more likely to do poorly in school have emotional and behavioral problems become teenage parents and have povertylevel income as children and adults compared to children living with married biological parents11 in 2007 678 of the 737 million us children under age 18 lived with both of their married parents 29 lived with both parents who were not married 179 lived with their mother and 26 lived with their father the advent of multiple relationships that produce children adds complexity to the problem these relationships often referred to as multiple partner fertility ie when mothers and fathers have had children with more than one partner generally complicate the family situation of children 10 sexual behavior of single adult american women by laura duberstein lindberg and susheela singh

likely to be economically disadvantaged13 demographically without nonmarital births the us would be far below population replacement levels having the birth rate reach the replacement rate is generally considered desirable by demographers and sociologists because it means country is producing enough young people to replace and support aging workers without population growth being so high that it taxes national resources nonmarital births are expected to increase over time because of projected population shift toward more minorities the census bureau projects that by 2050 54 of the us population will consist of minority groups ie hispanics blacks indians and asians minorities now roughly onethird of the us population are expected to become the majority in 2042 with the nation projected to be 54 minority in 2050 by 2023 minorities will represent more than half of all children the hispanic population is projected to nearly triple and its share of the nations total population is projected to double from 15 to 30 thus nearly one in three us residents will be hispanic14 in 2005 48 of hispanic births were nonmarital births 12 andrea kane and daniel t lichter reducing unwed

million to 162 million representing almost 4 of the population in 2050 crs6 trends in nonmarital births 19402006 in this report births to unmarried women are termed nonmarital births data on nonmarital births15 are usually expressed by three measures the number of nonmarital births the percent of births that are nonmarital and the rate of nonmarital births per 1000 unmarried women the number of nonmarital births provides the absolute count of babies who are born to women including adolescents who are not married the percent of all births that are nonmarital16 is the number of all nonmarital births divided by all births both nonmarital births and marital births the nonmarital birth rate is defined as the number of nonmarital births per 1000 unmarried women during the 66year period from 1940 through 2006 there was 17fold increase in the number of babies born to unmarried women living in the united states the number of babies born to unmarried women increased from 89500 in 1940 to 1641700 in 2006 in 2006 385 of all us births were to unmarried women up from 38 in 1940 ninefold increase numbers percentages and rates the number of nonmarital births reached record high in 2006 with 1641700 births to unmarried women as mentioned above the number of births to unmarried women has generally increased over the years with some downward fluctuations as shown in figure 1 nonmarital births rose 17fold from 19402006 also see the data table in appendix the average annual increase in nonmarital births has slowed substantially from earlier decades the average annual increase in nonmarital births was 49 from 19401949 56 from 19501959 61 from 19601969 50 from 19701979 64 from 19801989 12 from 19901999 and 36 for the seven years from 20002006 the 1990s showed marked slowing of nonmarital births dropping from an average increase of 64 year in the 1980s to an average of 12 year in the 1990s during the first six years of the 2000 to 2010 period the average annual increase in nonmarital births increased to 36 the percent of births to unmarried women increased substantially during the period from 19402006 see figure 2 and the appendix table however from 19942000 there was almost change in this measure in 1940 38 of all us births were to unmarried women by 2006 record 385 of all us births were to unmarried women 15 even though one of the underlying purposes of this report is to discern why women get pregnant outside of marriage this report solely uses birth data rather than pregnancy data the reason for this is that birth data are more current and reliable than pregnancy data because of the difficulty in gathering the abortion and miscarriage data needed to calculate pregnancy data pregnancy data lag about two to three years behind birth data reports 16 the proportion ie percent of births that occur to unmarried women is sometimes referred in the literature as the nonmarital birth ratio crs7 the nonmarital birth rate provides measure of the likelihood that an unmarried woman will give birth in given year the birth rate for unmarried women increased dramatically during the 19402006 period with many upward and downward fluctuations however during the years 19952002 the nonmarital birth rate remained virtually unchanged17 the nonmarital birth rate increased from 71 births per 1000 unmarried women ages 15 through 44 in 1940 to record high of 506 births per 1000 women ages 15 through 44 in 2006 sixfold increase see figure 3 and the appendix table a1 figure 1 number of births to unmarried women 19402006 1800000 1600000 1400000 number of

mothers this section discusses some of the characteristics of unmarried mothers it includes some of the demographic characteristics like race ethnicity and age as well as other features like whether the unwed mother has additional children her income status whether or not she marries and whether or not she is in cohabiting relationship some of the highlights include the following black women are more likely to have children outside of marriage than other racial or ethnic groups it is not teenagers but rather women in their early twenties who have the highest percentage of births outside of marriage single motherhood is more common among women with less education than among welleducated women substantial share of nonmarital births 44 were to women who had already given birth to one or more children significant number of unwed mothers are in cohabiting relationships and women who have nonmarital birth are less likely than other women to eventually marry race and ethnicity the rate at which unmarried women have children varies dramatically by race and ethnicity as mentioned earlier in 2005 the nonmarital birth rate for all us women was 475 births per 1000 unmarried women18 in 2005 hispanic women had the highest nonmarital birth rate at 1003 births per 1000 unmarried women the nonmarital birth rate in 2005 was 678 for black women 301 for nonhispanic white women and 249 for asian or pacific islander women although hispanic women had the highest nonmarital birth rate greater share percentage of black women had nonmarital births in 2005 369 of all us births were to unmarried women19 in 2005 699 of births to black women were nonmarital births the percentage of nonmarital births for american indians or alaska natives was 635 the nonmarital birth percentage was 480 for hispanic women 253 for nonhispanic white women and 162 for asian or pacific islander women20 see table 1 18 the nonmarital birth rate for all women in 2006 was 506 births per 1000 unmarried women the segmentation of the nonmarital birth rate by race and hispanic origin for 2006 has not yet been published 19 the percentage of all us births that were to unmarried women was 385 in 2006 the

nearly 70 was more than three times the 22 level of the early 1960s that so alarmed daniel patrick moynihan then president johnsons assistant secretary of labor moynihan addressed the issue in report called the negro family the case for national action21 one theory that attempts to explain the disproportionate share of nonmarital births to black women hypothesizes that the universe of males ages 15 and above who are unmarried is disproportionately lower for blacks for example in 2005 there were 74 black unmarried males for every 100 unmarried black females 87 white nonhispanic unmarried males for every 100 unmarried white nonhispanic females 98 asian unmarried males for every 100 asian unmarried females and 113 hispanic unmarried males for every 100 hispanic unmarried females22 supporters of this theory argue that if the universe of possible marriage partners is reduced to desirable marriage partners eg heterosexual men men with steady jobs men without criminal record and men with similar educational background the black male shortage is drastically increased23 age teen marriage and birth patterns have shifted from general trend of marrying before pregnancy to marrying as result of pregnancy to becoming pregnant and not marrying24 early nonmarital childbearing remains an important issue especially in the us because young firsttime mothers are more likely to have their births outside of marriage than within marriage and because women who have nonmarital first 21 moynihans 1965 report argued that black americans were being held back economically and socially primarily because their family structure was deteriorating the report was very controversial and sparked decades of debate it was not until the 1990s that there was widespread agreement that moynihans prognostications were generally true 22 with respect to these statistics unmarried is defined as being divorced widowed or nevermarried the figures were calculated on the basis of data from the census bureau americas families and living arrangements 2005 males ages 15 and above and females ages 15 and above by race and ethnicity table a1 23 some commentators contend that in order for black women to find desirable marriage partners they may have to consider men of other races or cultures eg african carribean 24 teenage motherhood and marriage child trends and the national campaign to prevent teen pregnancy crs12 birth are increasingly likely to have all subsequent births outside of marriage although often in cohabiting unions25 the proportion of births to unmarried women ie nonmarital births who are teenagers also has decreased over the last halfcentury in 1950 42 of the 141600 nonmarital births were to females under age twenty in 1970 50 of the 398700 nonmarital births were to females

contrast the percentage of all teen births that are nonmarital has increased dramatically in other words in recent years most teenagers who give birth are not married for example only 13 of the 419535 babies born to teens ages 15 to 19 in 1950 were born to females who were not married whereas in 2005 83 of the 414593 babies born to teens ages 15 to 19 were born to unwed teens there are two reasons for this phenomenon the first is that marriage in the teen years which was not uncommon in the 1950s has become quite rare as mentioned earlier the typical age of first marriage in the us has risen to 255 for women and 275 for men the second is that this general trend of marriage postponement has extended to pregnant teens as well in contrast to the days of the shotgun marriage very few teens who become pregnant nowadays marry before their baby is born26 contrary to public perception it is not teenagers but rather women in their early twenties who have the highest percentage of births outside

held view was that if childbearing was deferred until woman reaches her early or late twenties she would most likely be married given that nonmarital birth rates and percentages are at their highest recorded levels and that the number of babies born to teenagers has dramatically decreased in fourteen of the last fifteen years policymakers are faced with new paradigm of whether to address births outside of marriage for older women in these times of scarce resources it is debatable whether consensus can be garnered for using public funds to educate women in their midtwenties and thirties about the negative consequences associated with nonmarital births31 many observers hold the view that older women who have children outside of marriage should have known better or believe that these women have children for selfish reasons and should live with the consequences without government assistance or interference32 others argue that the motto in the best interest of the child should prevail33 and that if government aid is necessary and appropriate it should be given educational attainment single motherhood has always been more common among women with less education than among welleducated women but the gap has grown over time in 1960 14 of mothers in the bottom quarter of the education distribution were unmarried as compared to 45 of mothers in the top quarter difference of 95 percentage points by 2000 the corresponding figures were 43 for the less educated mothers and 7 for the more educated mothers gap of 36 percentage points34 income status an examination of nevermarried mothers shows that in 2007 411 of never married mother families with children under age 18 had income below the poverty level with respect to the various income categories 230 of nevermarried mother

tandem with the increase in births to parents who are living together but who are not married in cohabiting relationships according to one study the proportion of babies of unmarried women born into cohabiting families increased from 29 to 41 from 19801984 to 19901994 accounting for almost all of the increase in unmarried childbearing over that period45 according to census data in 2006

mothers are cohabiting with the father of their baby at least at the time of the babys birth49 according to the national survey of family growth about 9 of annual births to white women were to

agreement across measures about who is not cohabiting in the middle of the continuum however there is considerable ambiguity with as much as 15 of couples reporting parttime cohabitation how we classify this group will affect estimates of the prevalence of cohabitation especially among african americans and may impact the characteristics and outcomes of cohabitors52 subsequent marriage of mothers many women marry after having child according to the research about 40 of unwed mothers marry within five years after giving birth it is not known whether they marry the father of their child53 yet women who have nonmarital birth are less likely than other women ever to marry study based on retrospective life histories found that at age 17 girls who had nonmarital birth were 69 more likely to be never married at age 35 than 17year old girls who did not have nonmarital birth ie 24 vs 140 women ages 20 to 24 who had nonmarital birth were more than twice as likely 102 to not be married at age 35 than women ages 20 to 24 who did not have nonmarital birth ie 38 vs 190 the reported implications of these findings is that there probably is causal relationship between nonmarital

importance of establishing paternity for children born outside of marriage fathers of children born outside of marriage it has been pointed out that fathers are far too often left out of discussions about nonmarital childbearing it goes without saying that fathers are an integral factor in nonmarital childbearing it appears that one result of the socalled sexual revolution was that many men increasingly believed that women could and should control their fertility via contraception and abortion as result many men have become less willing to marry the women they impregnate57 there are myriad reasons why so many children live in homes without their fathers some reasons are related to choices people make about fertility marriage and cohabitation but others are the result of unexpected events such as illness or incarceration some noncustodial fathers are active in the lives of their children whereas others are either unable or unwilling to be involved in their childrens lives whatever the reason fathers absence from the home results in social psychological emotional and financial costs to children and economic costs to the nation 2008 report maintains that the

outside of marriage age of fathers and the importance of establishing paternity for children born outside of marriage one of the prominent but perhaps not unexpected findings related to fathers and nonmarital births is that when older men have sexual relationships with young women it often results in nonmarital births race and ethnicity according to the 2002 national survey of family growth 33 of unmarried hispanic men and 33 of unmarried nonhispanic black men have had biological child compared with 19 of unmarried nonhispanic white men nonhispanic black fathers were less likely to be married at the time their first child was born 37 compared with nonhispanic white fathers 77 and hispanic fathers 52 nonmarital first birth was more prevalent among younger fathers black and hispanic fathers and fathers with lower levels of income and men whose mothers had lower levels of education59 age in the united states it is not unusual for man to be several years older than his female partner some data indicate that the man is three or more years older than the woman in almost four in 10 relationships today therefore it is not unexpected that similar pattern exists for sexually active teenagers however such age differences often have adverse consequences for young women60 several studies have found that the unequal power dynamic that is often present in relationships between teenage girls and older men is more likely to lead to sexual contact not wanted by the female less frequent use of contraceptives and greater incidence of sexuallytransmitted diseases stds among the

to his wife in cases in which the child is born outside of marriage paternity can be voluntarily acknowledged or it can be contested it would be contested in cases in which 1 the mother does not want to establish paternity thereby forcing the father to take his case to court to assert his rights 2 the biological father does not want to pay child support and denies paternity to delay establishment of child support order or 3 the alleged father has genuine doubt about his paternity if paternity is contested it is generally resolved through either an administrative process or judicial proceeding child born outside of marriage has biological father but not necessarily legal father paternity establishment refers to the legal determination of fatherhood for child in 2006 385 of children born in

paternity establishment is not an end in itself but rather prerequisite to obtaining ongoing economic support ie child support from the other noncustodial parent67 once paternity is established legally through legal proceeding an administrative process or voluntary acknowledgment child gains legal rights and privileges among these may be rights to inheritance rights to the fathers medical and life insurance benefits and to social security and possibly veterans benefits it also may be important for the health of the child for doctors to have knowledge of the fathers medical history the child also may have chance to develop relationship with the father and to develop sense of identity and connection to the other half of his or her family the public policy interest in paternity establishment is based in part on the dramatic increase in nonmarital births over the last several decades and the economic status of single mothers and their children the poorest demographic group in the us consists of children in singleparent families paternity establishment generally is seen as means to promote the social goals of 1 providing for the basic financial support of all minor children regardless of the marital status of their parents 2 ensuring equity in assessing parental liability for the financial support of their children and 3 promoting responsibility for the consequences of ones actions68 many observers maintain that the social psychological emotional and financial benefits of having ones father legally identified are irrefutable they suggest that paternity should be established regardless of the ability of the father to pay child support they argue that the role of both parents is critical in building the self esteem of their children and helping the children become selfsufficient members of the community current literature and studies suggest that in most cases visitation with the noncustodial parent is important to the healthy emotional development of children children with regular contact with their noncustodial parent often adjust better than those denied such contact moreover generally it is in the best interest of the child to receive social psychological and financial benefits of relationship with both 66 office of child support enforcement hhs child support enforcement fy 2006 preliminary report march 2007 67 among custodial parents

is the primary means by which noncustodial parents carry out their parenting duty69 the following section discusses some of demographic factors that have contributed to the increase in nonmarital births as well as some of the reasons cited by women for nonmarital childbearing reasons for the increase in nonmarital childbearing declining marriage rates increased childbearing among unmarried women increased number of unmarried women in the childbearing ages ie 1544 and decreased childbearing among married women have contributed to the rising share of children being born to unwed women many social science analysts attribute the increase in nonmarital births to the decadeslong decline of shotgun marriages rather than to an increased incidence of nonmarital conceptions they contend that when the social pressure to get married once pregnancy became obvious ended the likelihood that women would marry between conception and birth decreased substantially70 the entry of more and more women into the paid labor force also made childbearing outside of marriage more economically feasible through the 1960s most americans believed that parents should stay in an unhappy marriage for the sake of the children by the 1970s this view was not as prominent divorce and not getting married to the father of child which were generally considered to not be in the best interest of the child were acceptable if it resulted in the happiness of the adult thus many observers and analysts agree that marriage is now more likely to be viewed through framework of adult fulfillment rather than through framework of childbearing and childrearing71 factors that have contributed to an unprecedented level of nonmarital childbearing include an increase in the median age of first marriage ie marriage postponement delays in childbearing of married couples increased marital dissolution an increase in the number of cohabiting couples increased sexual activity outside of marriage participation in risky behaviors that often lead to sex improper 69 for an array of information on the impact of father involvement in their childrens lives see the following website national child care information

for nonmarital births instead its purpose is to give the reader better understanding of the nonmarital birth phenomenon by synthesizing and simplifying the large body of research on the subject and presenting the views of analysts and other observers in way that helps to clarify the complexity of the topic demographic factors contributing to the increase in the number and percent of nonmarital births the combined factors of more unmarried women of childbearing age in the population and the increased birth percent of female rates of unmarried women resulted in dramatic increases in population the number of nonmarital births over the last several ages 1544 decades the text box shows that the percentage of women 1960 397 of childbearing age increased about 16 during the period 1970 407 from 1960 to 1990 from 397 to 460 table 3 shows that the percent of women who never married increased 1980 454 from 119 in 1960 to 220 in 2006 an 85 increase 1990 460 in addition the percent of all births to unmarried 2000 429 women rose substantially over the last several decades as 2006 410 well the reason for the increase was primarily due to three concurrent demographic factors first the number and proportion of unmarried women increased as more and more women from the baby boom generation postponed marriage postponement of marriage since the 1960s couples have postponed marriage table 2 shows that in 1950 and 1960 the median age at first marriage was 228 years for men and 203 years for women in 2006 for both men and women the median age at first marriage had increased by more than four years an increasing share of men and women also have never been married table 3 shows that in 1960 119 of females age 15 and older and 173 of males of the same age had not yet married compared to 220 of females and 286 of males in 2006 72 in general the use of contraceptives has increased substantially over the last twenty years and women have become more proficient in properly using contraceptives thus contraceptive misuse or nonuse is not discussed in this report as reason for increased nonmarital childbearing nonetheless it is important to note that shifts in the types of contraceptives used has had offsetting influences on the risk of unintended pregnancy the chances of contraceptive failure including method failure and incorrect or inconsistent use in the first 12 months of use are higher for the condom 14 than for oral contraceptives 8 and lowest for injectables 3 implants 2 and sterilization thus the mix of methods used by women included greater proportions

percent of all births that were to unmarried women rose because births to unmarried women increased while births to married women decreased73 attitude toward marriage during the last halfcentury the median age at first marriage has increased for both men and women by more than four years as seen in table 2 in 2006 the median age at first marriage was 275 years for men and 255 years for women marriage postponement has increased the number of unmarried women in the population in 2006 220 of all females ages 15 and older had not yet married the comparable figure in 1960 was 119 see table 374 attitudes towards marriage are varied and complex fifty years ago marriage was the central and defining feature of adult identity it was intertwined with moral rightness although some viewed marriage as form of social obligation and restriction on personal freedom it was considered the proper progression by most americans75 today most americans continue to view marriage as natural stage in life they also generally perceive marriage as way toward personal growth and deeper intimacy some view it as way to share ones life with someone in committed loving relationship76 others view it as safe haven that imbues sexual faithfulness emotional support mutual trust and lasting commitment77 others are more cynical and view it as relationship mainly designed for the sexual and emotional gratification of each adult78 although attitudes towards marriage have changed most people eventually marry and the desire to marry is widespread generally teens think that having good marriage is important and most say that it is likely they will get married but they are less than certain that their future marriages will last lifetime in addition marriage is facing stiff competition from

people79 moreover sex outside of marriage especially for adults is almost considered the norm and has virtually stigma attached to it there is much agreement that the link between marriage and parenthood has weakened considerably many policymakers contend that the link must be firmly reestablished for the wellbeing of children and the good of the nation80 lack of marriageable partners the socalled shortage of marriageable men both the number of unmarried men and the quality of unmarried men as viewed in terms of their ability to support family has been cited as one explanation for declining marriage rates and to lesser extent for why nonmarital childbearing has increased81 in effect although some women may have sexual relations with certain men it does not mean that they consider those men to be viable marriage partners national survey of unmarried adults under age 35 found that more than twothirds of the women surveyed and one third of the men said that they would be not at all willing to marry someone who was not likely to hold steady job this sentiment was shared across racial and ethnic groups82 nonetheless the shortage of marriageable men argument is primarily associated with black men and women in the truly disadvantaged william julius wilson argued that as rates of employment and rates of labor force participation dropped for young black men the number of desirable marriage partners for black women also decreased83 in other words many black women and women generally limit their marriage universe to men with steady jobs and other desirable attributes biological clock issues women may choose to have children outside of marriage because of concerns that they are older unmarrried and may longer have the opportunity to have children this is especially true among professional women who have pursued post secondary education and have been entrenched in timeconsuming careers in addition some women are not willing to sacrifice their independence or

have child without spouse cohabiting relationships in contrast to years past today many children born outside of marriage are born to cohabiting parents rather than to biological parents who live in separate households nonetheless it is generally agreed that cohabiting relationships are less stable than marriage in 1977 there were 11 million family households with children under age 18 that consisted of cohabiting couples in 2007 64 million family households with children under age 18 consisted of cohabiting couples thus in that 30year period cohabiting couples as share of all family households increased from 2 to 82 according to one report just as it has become more common for couples to have intercourse and to live together without marrying it has become more likely that couples who conceive outside marriage will remain unmarried85 growing up with two continuously cohabiting biological parents is rare the fragile families study indicates that about onefourth of cohabiting biological parents are longer living together one year after the childs birth86 another study of first births found that 31 of cohabiting couples had broken up after five years as compared to 16 of married couples study using the 1999 national survey of american families found that only 15 of all children lived with two cohabiting parents at the time of the survey similarly an analysis of the 1995 adolescent health study revealed that less than onehalf of 1 of adolescents ages 16 to 18 had spent their entire childhoods living with two continuously cohabiting biological parents87 divorce if

divorce rate 73 per 1000 population versus 36 per 1000 population although marriage and divorce data are usually displayed as rates researchers generally agree that comparison of marriage and divorce rates is misleading because the persons who are divorcing in any given year are typically not the same as those who are marrying in 2004 23 of us women who were once married had been divorced the median duration of marriages before divorce was about 8 years the median time between divorce and second marriage was about three and half years in 2004 12 of men and 13 of women had married twice and 3 of both men and women had married three or more times among adults 25 and older who had ever divorced 52 of men and 44 of women were currently married89 sexual activity outside of marriage sexual activity outside of marriage is associated with nonmarital births study that was based on data from several panels of the national survey of family growth found that by age 44 95 of those surveyed had engaged in sexual activity intercourse before marriage90 according to the survey 69 of women ages 15 through 44 who had never been married and who were not cohabiting had engaged in sexual

although 385 of all us births in 2006 were to women who were not married 233 of the 737 million us children under age 18 lived in motheronly families in 200697 the difference occurs because the proportion of births to unmarried women has increased over the past several decades and because some of these women married and some were in cohabiting relationships98 wide body of research indicates that children who grow up with only one biological parent in the home are more likely to be financially worse off and have worse socioeconomic outcomes even after income differences are taken into account compared to children who grow up with both biological parents in the home99 specifically children living in singleparent home are more likely to do poorly in school have emotional and behavioral problems become teenage parents and have povertylevel incomes as children and adults than children living with married biological parents100 further children in singleparent families are

science research is almost never conclusive there are always methodological difficulties and stones left unturned yet in three decades of work as social scientist i know of few other bodies of data in which the weight of evidence is so decisively on one side of the issue on the whole for children twoparent families are preferable to singleparent and stepfamilies103 others assert that although marriage of biological parents is associated with greater child wellbeing little is known about why or how much of the relationship is caused by marriage and how much by other factors in other words it could be that the effect of marriage on child wellbeing is derived not from marriage itself but rather from the distinctive characteristics of the individuals who marry and stay married sometimes referred to as the selection effect104 it is sometimes argued that some of the problems associated with nonintact families may be the effect of poverty rather than the fathers absence further most children who grow up in motheronly families or stepparent families become welladjusted productive adults for some children the absence of the father may result in freedom from an abusive or otherwise

births on the nation this section reviews assertions that it is not just the family that is negatively affected by nonmarital childbearing but the taxpayer as well it discusses some of the impacts of financial and demographic factors associated with nonmarital births on the population as whole potential financial costs although the three reports mentioned below do not categorically say that nonmarital births cost the federal government specific dollar amount they do provide context in which to consider the financial costs associated with nonmarital childbearing the first report examines nonmarital childbearing and divorce together to measure taxpayer costs of what the author calls family fragmentation but it does not separately attribute costs to nonmarital childbearing the second study examines how poverty in the us would be affected if more children were living in twoparent families the third report attributes specific dollar amount to the consequences of teens having children 2008 report105 examines the economic costs associated with the decline in marriage which the authors contend increases the number of children and adults eligible for and in need of government services the authors of the report maintain that the decline in marriage is product of both divorce and unmarried childbearing the report estimates that combined the high rates of divorce and nonmarital childbearing costs us taxpayers at least 112 billion per year in federal state and local costs 701 billion of which is federal costs106 the report states that these costs arise from increased taxpayer expenditures for antipoverty criminal justice and education programs and through lower levels of taxes paid by individuals who as adults earn less because of reduced opportunities as result of having been more likely to grow up in poverty107 another study examined the impact of nonmarital childbearing on poverty by using regression approach that was based on hypothetically matching single women and men in the population on the basis of factors such as age education and race it found that if the share of children living with two parents in 2000 was increased to what it had been in 1970 the child poverty rate in 2000 would have declined by 105 benjamin scafidi the taxpayer costs of divorce and unwed childbearing firstever estimates for the nation and for all fifty

37 million fewer children would be in poverty109 in addition 2006 report quantified the costs of adolescent childbearing110 as noted earlier births to teens represented 10 of all births and 23 of nonmarital births 2005 data the report estimated that in 2004 adolescent childbearing cost us taxpayers about 9 billion per year111 specific estimates cited were 23 billion in child welfare benefits 19 billion in health care expenses 21 billion in spending on incarceration for the sons of women who had children as adolescents and 63 billion in lost tax revenue because of lower earnings of the mothers fathers and children when they were adults added to these cost figures are 36 billion in savings that result from the declines in births to teens112 research indicates that teens who give birth are less likely to complete high school and go on to college thereby reducing their potential for economic selfsufficiency the research also indicates that the children of teens are more likely than children of older parents to experience problems in school and drop out of high school and as adults are more likely to repeat the cycle of teenage pregnancy and poverty the 2006 report contends that if the teen birth rate had not declined between 1991 and 2004 the annual costs associated with teen childbearing would have been almost 16 billion instead of 9 billion113 although these data are interesting it is important to remember that although 83 of births to teens are nonmarital births adolescent childbearing is only subset of nonmarital childbearing demographic impacts having the birth rate reach the replacement rate is generally considered desirable by demographers and sociologists because it means country is producing enough 108 paul r amato and rebecca maynard decreasing nonmarital births and strengthening marriage to reduce poverty the future of children vol 17 2 fall 2007 p 130 109 the 36 million figure was derived by applying the 29 reduction rate to the 128

high that it taxes national resources114 an examination of nonmarital births from demographic perspective is perhaps the only analysis that does not view nonmarital births as negative phenomenon the nations total fertility rate the number of children the average woman would be expected to bear in her lifetime has been below the replacement level since 1972115 the replacement rate is the rate at which given generation can exactly replace itself the fertility level required for natural replacement of the us population is about 21 births per woman ie 2100 births per 1000 women the replacement rate was reached in 2006 for the first time in many years116 given that the marital birth rate has been decreasing over time if the birth rate of unmarried women had begun to reverse itself the us population would cease growing if the immigration factor is excluded117 from geopolitical perspective this means that those who support policies to lower nonmarital fertility do so at the risk of lowering overall us fertility that has been hovering near replacement levels118 in the united states nonhispanic white women and asian women 40 to 44 years old had fertility levels below the replacement level 18 and 17 births per woman respectively the fertility level of black women ages 40 to 44 20 births per woman did not differ statistically from the natural replacement level119 hispanic women ages 40 to 44 had an average of 23 births and were the only group that exceeded the fertility level required for natural replacement of the us population120 nonmarital births are also influencing other demographic shifts on the basis of the fertility rate of women by racial and ethnic groups by 2050 54 of the us population will consist of minority groups ie hispanics blacks american indians and asians minorities now roughly onethird of the us population are expected to become the majority in 2042 with the nation projected to be 54 minority in 114 rob stein us fertility

potential longterm consequences of nonmarital births the federal governments strategy to nonmarital childbearing has been varied the federal government acknowledges that an effective approach for teenagers may be inappropriate for older women some observers criticize women much farther along the age spectrum who have nonmarital births as being selfish and not looking long range to what would be in the best interest of their offspring other observers counter pointing out that it is not the unmarried collegeeducated thirtysomething yearolds with wellpaying jobs who are worried that their time for having child is running out that should be concern rather it is the millions of women for whom single motherhood is the norm who entrench themselves and their children in less favorable economic lifestyle by having child outside of healthy marriage many of these women become mothers in their teenage years in order to address these two distinct groups of females federal policy toward teens has primarily focused on pregnancy prevention programs whereas federal policy toward older women has focused on healthy marriage programs income support programs such as the child support enforcement program and the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant program that attempt to reduce or ameliorate negative financial consequences that are sometimes associated with nonmarital childbearing are available to mothers of all age groups this section discusses the public policy interventions 1 directed at teens such as abstinence education programs comprehensive sex education programs and youth programs 2 focused on adults namely the healthy marriage programs and the responsible fatherhood programs that usually include several components dealing 121 us census

single unambiguous message that sex outside of marriage is wrong and harmful to their physical and emotional health these advocates contend that youth can and should be empowered to say to sex they argue that supporting both abstinence and birth control is hypocritical and undermines the strength of an abstinenceonly message they also cite research that indicates that teens who take virginity pledges to refrain from sex until marriage appear to delay having sex longer than those teens who do not make such commitment one study found that teens who publicly promise to postpone sex until marriage refrain from intercourse for about year and half longer than teens who did not make such pledge124 they further argue that abstinence is the most effective 100 means of preventing unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including hivaids125 three federal programs include funding that is exclusively for abstinence education adolescent family life afl program the title v

generally favor comprehensive sex education approach discussed later but also claim that abstinenceonly programs often use medically inaccurate information regarding stds condoms and other

1981 until 1996 the afl program was the only federal program that focused directly on the issues of adolescent sexuality pregnancy and parenting128 the afl program was designed to promote family involvement in the delivery of services adolescent premarital sexual abstinence adoption as an alternative to early parenting parenting and child development education and comprehensive health education and social services geared to help the mother have healthy baby and improve subsequent life prospects for both mother and child the afl program authorizes grants for three types of demonstrations 1 projects that provide care services only ie health education and social services to pregnant adolescents adolescent parents their infant families and male partners 2 projects that provide prevention services only ie services to promote abstinence from premarital sexual relations for preteens teens and their families and 3 projects that provide combination of care and prevention services any public or private nonprofit organization or agency is eligible to apply for demonstration grant afl projects can be funded for up to five years the title v abstinence education block grant to states was authorized under pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law the law provided 50 million per year for five years fy1998fy2002 in federal funds specifically for the abstinence education

by states when they solicit title v maternal and child health mch block grant funds and must be used exclusively for teaching abstinence to receive federal funds state must match every 4 in federal

based impact study on several abstinenceonly block grant programs the report focuses on four 128 the predecessor of the afl program was the adolescent pregnancy program which was enacted in 1978 pl 95626 the adolescent pregnancy program was designed to alleviate the negative consequences of pregnancy for the adolescent parent and her child the adolescent pregnancy program was consolidated into the maternal and child health block grant when the afl program was enacted 129 states use variety of methods to meet the federal matching requirement such as state funds private or foundation funds matching funds from communitybased grantees and in kind services eg volunteer staffing and public service announcements 130 the cbae program was known as the special projects for regional and national significance sprans until fy2005 crs39 selected title v abstinence education programs for elementary and middle school students on the basis of followup data collected from youth aged 10 to 14 four to six years after study enrollment the report among other things presents the estimated program impacts on sexual abstinence and risks of pregnancy and stds according to the report findings indicate that youth in the program group were more likely than control group youth to have abstained from sex and among those who reported having had sex they had similar numbers of sexual partners and had initiated sex at the same mean age program and control group youth did not differ in their rates of unprotected sex either at first intercourse or over the last 12 months overall the programs improved identification of stds but had overall impact on knowledge of unprotected sex risks and the consequences of stds both program and control group youth had good understanding of the risks of pregnancy but less clear understanding of stds and their health consequences131 in response to the report hhs has stated that the mathematica study showcased programs that were among the first funded by the 1996 welfare reform law it stated that its recent directives to states have encouraged states to focus abstinenceonly education programs on youth most likely to bear children outside of marriage that is high school students rather than elementary or middleschool students it also mentioned that programs need to extend the peer support for abstinence from the pre teen years through the high school years132 comprehensive sex education advocates of comprehensive approach to sex education argue that todays youth need information and decisionmaking skills to make realistic practical decisions about whether to engage in sexual activities they contend that such an approach allows young people to make informed decisions regarding abstinence gives them the information they need to set relationship limits and to resist peer pressure and also provides them with information on the use of contraceptives and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases133 they argue that about 50 of high school students have experienced sexual intercourse134 they maintain that 131 christopher trenholm barbara devaney ken fortson lisa quay justin wheeler and melissa clark impacts of four title v section 510

of pregnancy and disease for those who are sexually active they point out that according to one study teens who break their virginity pledges were less likely to use contraception the first time than teens who had never made such promise135 in addition the alarming number of females under age 25 with sexually transmitted diseases stds136 has reenergized efforts to persuade girls and young women to abstain from sexual activity or to use condoms along with other forms of contraceptives to prevent or reduce pregnancy as well as reduce their risk of getting stds137 earmarked federal funding currently exists for comprehensive sex education in schools in other words there is federal appropriation specifically for comprehensive sex education although there is not federal comprehensive sex education program per many federal programs provide information about contraceptives provide contraceptive services to teens and provide referral and counseling services related to reproductive health these programs include medicaid family planning title x family planning and adolescent family life care services also funds from the maternal and child health block grant the title xx social services block grant and the tanf block grant can be used to provide contraceptive services to teens138 evaluation of comprehensive sex education programs there have been numerous evaluations of teen pregnancy prevention programs but most of them did not use scientific approach with experimental and control groups an approach that most analysts agree provides more reliable valid and objective information

sexual activity improving contraceptive use among sexually active teenagers or preventing teen pregnancy many analysts and researchers agree that effective pregnancy prevention programs 1 convince teens that not having sex or that using contraception consistently and carefully is the right thing to do 2 last sufficient length of time 3 are operated by leaders who believe in their programs and who are adequately trained 4 actively engage participants and personalize the program information 5 address peer pressure 6 teach communication skills and 7 reflect the age sexual experience and culture of young persons in the programs141 youth programs youth programs generally include one or more of the following components to address teen sexual activity sex education mentoring and counseling health care academic support career counseling crisis intervention sports and arts activities and community volunteer experiences youth programs receive funding from wide array of sources including the federal government state and local governments community organizations private agencies nonprofit organizations and faithbased organizations the sex education component of many youth programs usually includes an abstinence message which enables teens to avoid pregnancy along with discussions about the correct and consistent use of contraception which reduces the risk of pregnancy for sexually active teens there is significant difference between abstinence as message and abstinenceonly interventions although the bush administration continues to support an abstinenceonly program intervention with some modifications others argue that an abstinence message integrated into comprehensive sex education program that includes information on the use of contraceptives and that enhances decisionmaking skills is more effective method to prevent teen pregnancy recent nationally representative survey found that 90 of adults and teens agree that young people should get strong message that they should not have sex until they are at least out of high school and that majority of adults 73 and teens 56 want teens to get more information about both abstinence and contraception142 the american public both adults and teens 140 the report only examined studies that had been published in 2000 or later 141 the national campaign to prevent teen pregnancy putting what works to work curriculumbased programs that prevent teen pregnancy 2007 note there also are many reasons why programs are not considered successful for example in some cases the evaluation studies are limited by methodological problems or constraints because the approach taken is so multilayered that researchers have had difficulty disentangling the effects of multiple components of program in other cases the approach may have worked for boys but not for girls or vice versa in some cases the programs are very small and thereby it is harder to obtain significant results in other cases different personnel may affect the outcomes of similar programs 142 bill albert with one voice 2007 americas adults and teens sound off about continued crs42 support encouraging teens to delay sexual activity and providing young people with information about contraception143 study that evaluated youth programs that sought to delay the first time teens have sex partly summarized the research by highlighting some characteristics or activities associated with teenagers who delayed sexual activity the study reported that 1 teens who do well in school and attend religious services are more likely to delay sexual initiation 2 girls who participate in sports also delay sex longer than those who do not and 3 teens whose friends have high educational aspirations who avoid such risky behavior as drinking or using drugs and who perform well in school are less likely to have sex at an early age than teens whose friends do not144 some youth programs have an underlying goal of trying to decipher the root reasons behind teen pregnancy and childbearing is it loneliness or trying to find love or sense of family is it carelessness not bothering with birth control or using it improperly or shame not wanting to go to the doctor to ask about birth control or not wanting to be seen in pharmacy purchasing birth control is it need to meet the sexual expectations of partner is it trying to find individual independence or is it defiance mentality of you cant boss or control im grown is it trying to validate or provide purpose to ones life is it realistically facing the probability that the entrylevel job she can get at the age of 18 is the same or similar to the one she will likely have when she is 30 thus why should she wait to have child in addition many youth programs also want to prevent second or additional births to teens and they realize that different approach may be needed to prevent secondary births as compared to first births research has indicated that youth programs that include mentoring components enhanced case management home visits by trained nurses or program personnel and parenting classes have been effective in reducing subsequent childbearing by teens145 142 continued teen pregnancyfebruary 2007 p 2 httpwwwteenpregnancyorgresourcesdatapdf wov2007_fulltextpdf 143 there appears to be significant public support for the

in fertility behavior in other words americans are not having more babies they are having fewer marriages146 the first finding of pl 104193 the 1996 welfare reform law is that marriage is the foundation of successful society the second finding is that marriage is an essential institution of successful society that promotes the interests of children the law sought to promote marriage through the new tanf program as authorized by pl 104193 the tanf program established as statutory goals to promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families and to reduce welfare dependence via job preparation work and marriage pursuant to the law states may spend tanf funds on wide range of activities services for cash welfare recipients and other families toward the achievement of these goals pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 established new categorical grants within tanf for healthy marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood initiatives147 the healthy marriage promotion initiative is funded at approximately 100 million per year fy2006fy2010 to be spent through grants awarded by hhs to support research and demonstration projects by public or private entities and technical assistance provided to states indian tribes and tribal organizations and other entities the activities supported by the healthy marriage promotion initiatives are programs to promote marriage to the general population such as public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and education in high schools on the value of marriage education on social skills eg marriage education marriage skills conflict resolution and relationship skills for engaged couples those interested in marriage or married couples and programs that reduce the financial disincentive to marry148 if combined with educational or other marriage promotion activities entities that apply for marriage promotion grants must ensure that participation in such activities is voluntary and that domestic

marriages and the shortterm and often unhappy nature of the so called shotgun marriage supporters of healthy marriage programs remark that many longlasting marriages were based on financial alliances eg to increase economic status family wealth status in the community etc they assert that policies or programs designed to promote healthy marriages are not intended to force anyone into unwanted unhealthy relationships trap women in abusive relationships or withdraw support from single mothers supporters maintain that relationship is not healthy if it is not safe nonetheless many observers are concerned about the impact of healthy marriage promotion programs on survivors of domestic violence or those still in abusive relationships they assert that all marriage promotion programs must identify and respond to domestic violence issues in manner that is effective for the individual program in question150 some observers contend that policymakers should focus healthy marriage programs on couples who want to get married couples who are free from substance abuse problems andor violent tendencies and couples who do not have any children by other partners151 evaluation of healthy marriage programs hhs is sponsoring three multiyear impact evaluations of the healthy marriage program two of the three studies use random assignment approach in which couples are assigned to either an experimental group group that receives the program services or control group group that does not receive program services one study called building strong families focuses on lowincome unmarried

reform we must find way to help children by providing them with more than working mother and sporadic child support she noted that many lowincome fathers have problems similar to those of mothers on welfare namely they are likely to have dropped out of high school to have little work experience and to have significant barriers that lessen their ability to find or keep job she also asserted that in many cases these men are dead broke rather than dead beats and that the federal government should help these noncustodial fathers meet both their financial and emotional obligations to their children153 in hopes of improving the longterm outlook for children in singleparent families federal state and local governments along with public and private organizations are supporting programs and activities that promote the financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial fathers to their children and increase the participation of fathers in the lives of their children these programs have come to be known as responsible fatherhood programs to help fathers and mothers meet their parental responsibilities many policy analysts and observers support broad based collaborative strategies that go beyond welfare and child support agencies and include schools work programs prison systems churches community organizations and the health care system most responsible fatherhood programs include media campaigns that emphasize the importance of emotional physical psychological and financial connections of fathers to their children most fatherhood programs include parenting education responsible decisionmaking mediation services for both parents providing an understanding of the cse program conflict resolution coping with stress and problemsolving skills peer support and jobtraining opportunities although responsible fatherhood programs have been debated in congress since the 106th congress 1999 and supported from the start by the bush administration 2001 it was not

fatherhood programs the contracts in aggregate amounted to 41 million per year155 evaluation of responsible fatherhood programs although congress only recently authorized federal funding specifically earmarked for responsible fatherhood programs via pl 109171 many states and localities private organizations and nonprofit agencies have been operating responsible fatherhood programs for several years some researchers have noted that although there is growing body of research on the impact of father absence in the lives of their children there is not enough research on the benefits of father presence in the lives of their children several rather large demonstration projects have focused on noncustodial fathers and this report highlights two of them156 the parents fair share pfs demonstration designed and evaluated by mdrc was national demonstration project that operated between 1994 and 1996 that combined job training and placement peer support groups and other services with the goal of increasing the earnings and child support payments of unemployed noncustodial parents generally fathers of children on welfare improving their parenting and communication skills and providing an opportunity for them to participate more fully and effectively in the lives of their children the final report on the pfs demonstration concluded that the program did not significantly increase employment or earnings among the full sample of pfs participants during the two years after they entered the program however the program reportedly increased earnings among subgroup of men who were characterized as less employable 154 crs report rl31025 fatherhood initiatives connecting fathers to their children by carmen solomonfears also see promoting responsible fatherhood home page

some analysts maintain that most of the fathers who participated in the pfs demonstration were estranged from their children when they entered the program and that some of them participated in lieu of serving time in jail they assert that new unwed fathers are generally very attached to their children around the time of the childs birth and probably are more motivated than fathers of older children to take advantage of the opportunities or services offered by responsible fatherhood programs158 the federal office of child support enforcement ocse provided 20 million to fund responsible fatherhood

wisconsin these projects attempted to improve the employment and earnings of under and unemployed noncustodial parents and to motivate them to become more financially and emotionally involved in the lives of their children although the projects shared common goals they varied with respect to service components and service delivery the outcome report found that employment rates and earnings increased significantly especially for noncustodial parents who were previously unemployed in addition child support compliance rates increased significantly especially for those who had not been paying previously the report found that 27 of the fathers reported seeing their children more often after completion of the program159 the outcome report on the ocse responsible fatherhood programs also found that 1 lowincome noncustodial fathers are difficult population to recruit and serve 2 many of the participants found jobs with the programs help but they were lowpaying jobs and relatively few of the participants were able to increase earnings enough to meet their financial needs and those of their children 3 child access problems were hard to define and resolve and mediation should be used more extensively 4 child support guidelines result in orders for lowincome noncustodial parents that are unrealistically high 5 cse agencies should collaborate with fatherhood programs and pursue

place their infant for adoption are more likely to finish school and less likely to live in poverty further mothers who choose to give up their infants for adoption are more likely to marry than those who parent their baby164 although adoption is not an intervention to negate nonmarital childbearing it does present an alternative living arrangement for children born to unmarried parents adoption is the legal process of adding person to an existing family adoption unlike foster care is meant to be permanent the goal of adoption is to provide lifelong security to the child according to some studies children placed in adoptive homes have better scores in school and engage in less delinquent behavior than children raised by single parent165 shotgun marriages and adoption were once viewed as the common remedies for nonmarital birth even so historically adoption has played very limited role as an alternative to motheronly families adoption has been and remains rare there were approximately 130000 adoptions in the us in 2002166 of these 130000 the number that are children born to unmarried women is not known167 some observers contend that adoption might be viewed as more viable option for an unwanted pregnancy if school systems included meaningful discussion of adoption in their sex education classes168 child support obligation as deterrent the child support enforcement cse program was enacted in 1975 as federalstate program title ivd of the social security act to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services over the years cse has evolved into multifaceted program although costrecovery still remains an important function of the program its other aspects include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility

and enforce child support obligations169 because strict child support enforcement is thought to deter nonmarital childbearing the child support provisions are seen by some in congress as another method of attempting to reduce nonmarital pregnancies child support enforcement measures include streamlined efforts to name the father in every case employer reporting of new hires to locate noncustodial parents quicker uniform interstate child support laws computerized statewide collections to expedite payment and stringent penalties such as the revocation of drivers license and the seizure of bank accounts in cases in which noncustodial parents owe pastdue child support according to social science research stronger child support enforcement may increase the cost of children for men and should make men more reluctant to have children outside of marriage in other words by raising the cost of fatherhood to unmarried men effective paternity establishment and child support enforcement deter nonmarital births170 in contrast stronger child support enforcement may reduce the cost of children for women making them more willing to have children outside of marriage171 however

school if they lack high school diploma 169 child support is paid until the child is age 18 the age limit is higher is some states pastdue child support ie child support arrearages are still owed even

reduce pregnancies birth data and not pregnancy data have become the indicator because birth data are more current and reliable crs51 states are using tanf funds to support activities that may prevent nonmarital pregnancies generally these activities focus on preventing teen pregnancy these activities are often classified as youth services includes afterschool programs for teens and subgrants to community organizations such as boys and girls clubs several states have reported that they conduct home visits to new parents in an effort to reduce subsequent pregnancies many states reported operating abstinence education programs which may be funded in whole or in part through tanf or other federal abstinence education programs in addition family planning services can be funded in part from tanf or other federal grant programs174 another one of the four tanf goals is to promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families states have separate funding via their tanf programs to operate responsible fatherhood programs and marriage promotion initiatives discussed below future prospects the language regarding births to unmarried women has changed in significant ways what once were referred to as bastard or illegitimate children are now termed outofwedlock outside of marriage or nonmarital births the stigma and shame that had once been attached to these children is longer recognized by the public175 further some commentators argue that the facts have been twisted in such way that mothers are justified in having nonmarital birth and that having baby without husband represents higher level of maternal devotion and sacrifice than having baby with husband176 they assert that it is often the case that adults pursue individual happiness in their private relationships which is in direct conflict with the needs of children for stability security and permanence in their family lives177 some observers contend that the problem is not the weakening of marriage about 75 of all women ages 15 and older eventually marry but rather the linking of marriage and having children and the abdication of the traditional view of marriage as lifelong commitment178 some researchers and policymakers argue that although couple relationships are private matter an overwhelming body of 174 us congress house committee on ways and means green book 2008

structures produce equal outcomes for children they maintain that there is widespread agreement that healthy stable ie low conflict family with two biological parents is the best environment for children179 finally some observers assert that we as society have not strayed too far and that it is not too late to return to the somewhat oldfashioned but not simplistic precept of falling in love getting married and having baby in that order180 although marriage and family life are generally considered private issues they have become part of the public arena primarily because of public policies that help families affected by negative outcomes associated with nonmarital births to maintain minimum level of economic sufficiency181 the abundance of research on the subject of the impact on children of various living environments also raises the stakes in that it is now almost unanimously agreed that children living with both biological parents fare better on host of measures economic social psychological and emotional than children living with single parent or in step parent or cohabiting situation182 one of the things that this report highlights is that although there has been rise in nonmarital births it does not mean that there has been subsequent rise in mother only families instead it reflects the rise in the number of couples who are in cohabiting relationships because the number of women living in cohabiting situation has increased substantially over the last several decades many children start off in households in which both of their biological parents reside nonetheless cohabiting family situations are disrupted or dissolved much more frequently than marriedcouple families as discussed in an earlier section the federal government funds number of programs that seek to 1 reduce or eliminate nonmarital childbearing or 2 ameliorate some of the negative outcomes often associated with children of unmarried parents the rest of this section highlights several interventions that may receive further attention and more debate in congress although this report does not base the analysis of increased nonmarital childbearing by segmenting teen births from other births it is important to note that more than half of first nonmarital births are to teens this means that policies that are successful in reducing births to teenagers would significantly lessen the problem of nonmarital childbearing 179 barbara dafoe whitehead dan quayle was right the atlantic april 1993 180 linda c mcclain love marriage and the baby carriage revisiting the channelling function

majority of adult women living without married spouse does not mean living without sex183nor in many cases does it mean living without having children in 2005 almost 20 of the women ages 40 and older who gave birth had child born outside of marriage for women ages 20 through 24 the percentage was almost 60 these figures reflect the new paradigm of women in all age groups not just teenagers having children outside of marriage some observers and analysts assert that new strategies that account for this new paradigm must be developed to significantly reduce nonmarital births others argue that the nation must decide whether to try to change the fertility behavior of women in their thirties and forties they contend that given the new economic framework and the scarcity of resources in most areas of public finance it may be wiser to pursue strategy that focuses primarily on adolescents and women in their early twenties given the patterns of swift transitions into and out of marriage and the high rate of single parenthood family policy that relies too heavily on marriage will not help the many children who will live in singleparent and cohabiting families many of them poor during most of their formative years184 moreover national data from the 2002 panel of the national survey of family growth indicate that 14 of white men 32 of black men and 15 of hispanic men had children with more than one woman185 thus children in the same family may potentially face different outcomes for example children with the same mother and different fathers may potentially face less desirable outcomes if their mother marries the biological father of their halfbrothers or halfsisters186 the advantages married couples and their children have over those in other living arrangements led the bush administration and congress to propose marriage promotion initiatives the knowledge that american society has changed in ways that will longer permit all children to live with their biological parents led the bush administration and congress to support responsible fatherhood programs both the healthy marriage programs and the responsible fatherhood programs were funded by the same legislation ie pl

although there was some animosity between proponents of healthy marriage programs and proponents of responsible fatherhood programs189 when they were debated during the period from 2001 through 2005 there is growing consensus that the two programs can be implemented in complementary manner to promote the best interest of children190 some of the impact analysis on the two programs based on scientifically designed evaluations with experimental and control groups is to be completed during the next congress this may help the 111th congress and the new administration to determine whether or not they need to shift priorities between the programs redistribute funding or make other changes that will improve the effectiveness of both programs similarly there is now some discussion about middle ground between abstinence education and comprehensive sex education191 some call this approach abstinenceplus under the abstinenceplus education approach participants are given hierarchy of safesex strategies at the top of the hierarchy is the promotion of sexual abstinence as the safest route to pregnancy prevention and hiv and std prevention recognizing that some participants will not be abstinent the abstinence plus approach encourages individuals to use condoms and to adopt other safersex strategies192 proponents of the abstinenceplus approach contend that it does not encourage teens or young adults to have more sex it just encourages them to do so safely if they do have sex some policymakers maintain that this middle ground approach accepts the reality that sexual activity among older teens and young adults is an entrenched byproduct of todays society they argue that it is not bad policy 187 the healthy marriage program and the responsible fatherhood program are designed to accommodate individuals of all ages although individual programs may cater to persons in specific age groups administrators of the programs point out that the message of the programs are applicable to persons of all ages from teens to middleaged couples 188 although several evaluations are underway to scientifically determine whether healthy marriage programs and responsible fatherhood programs work they are many years from impact findings most are still at the initial stage of providing information on the implementation of the programs 189 the animosity mainly centered around funding concerns in some of the early proposals marriage promotion initiatives were earmarked up to five times as much money as fatherhood initiatives supporters of responsible fatherhood programs argued that the promotion of marriage debate was overshadowing the precept that fathers should participate in the lives of their children regardless of the marital status of the parents 190 also it is interesting to note that many analysts contend that the many of the soft skills individuals learn in healthy marriage or responsible fatherhood programs are transferrable to the workplace they assert that skills such as being able to communicate effectively with others being consistent and being ontime are abilities that may help individuals gain entry into the workforce as well as help them advance in their jobs 191 both abstinenceonly education programs and comprehensive sex education programs are currently focused on middleschool and highschool aged children 192 shari l dworkin and john santelli do abstinenceplus interventions reduce sexual risk behavior among youth public library of science medicine september 18 2007 crs55 but rather good planning to educate persons who thought they would remain abstinent until marriage but do not with the appropriate information regarding contraceptive methods they contend that an abstinenceplus education approach is in the best interest of young people and in the best interest of the nation as mentioned earlier federal funding is specifically earmarked for comprehensive sex education some observers contend that the debate over abstinenceonly education versus comprehensive sex education will likely continue for several more years they surmise that the issue of which approach is more appropriate and more effective for adolescents and older teens may receive renewed attention by the 111th congress and the new administration they also note that the abstinenceplus approach may be further scrutinized within the context of the debate on abstinenceonly versus comprehensive sex education crs56 appendix data table table a1 number percent and rate of births to unmarried women and birth rate for married women 19402006
