role in us efforts to assist foreign populations militaries and governments the use of dod to provide foreign assistance stems in general from the perception that dod can contribute unique or vital capa bilities and resources because it possesses the manpower materiel and organizational assets to respond to international needs over the years congress has helped shape the dod role by providing dod with its mandate for such activities through wide variety of authorities the historical dod role in foreign assistance can be regarded as serving three purposes responding to humanitarian and basic needs building foreign military capacity and capabilities and strengthening foreign governments ability to deal with internal and international threats through statebuilding measures the united states and the us military benefit from dod foreign assistance activities in several ways us diplomacy benefits from the us militarys capacity to project itself rapidly into extreme situations such as disasters and other humanitarian emergencies enhancing the us image as humanita rian actor humanitarian assistance military training and other forms of assistance also provide opportunities to cultivate good relations with foreign populations militaries and governments us military personnel have long viewed such activities as opportunities to interact with foreign militaries as part of their professional development since the terrorist attacks on the united states of september 11 2001 dod training of military forces and provision of security assistance have been an important means to enable foreign militaries to conduct peacekeeping operations and to support coalition operations in iraq and afghanistan dods perception of the appropriate noncombat role for the us military has evolved over time within the past few years the perceptions of dod officials military officers and defense analysts have coalesced around post911 strategy that calls for the use of the us military in preventive deterrent and preemptive activities this strategy involves dod in the creation of extensive international and interagency partnersh ips as well as an expanded dod role in foreign assistance activities critics point to number of problems with an expanded dod role in many activities indeed key dod document acknowledges that statebuilding tasks may be best performed by indigenous foreign or us civilian professionals nevertheless although reluctant to divert personnel from combat functions dod officials believe that the us military must develop its own capacity to carry out such activities in the absence of appropriate civilian forces in the second session of the 110 th congress members have faced several choices regarding the dod role in foreign assistance the bush administration has proposed legislation to make permanent two controversial dod authorities it has also proposed legislation to enable us government civilian personnel to perform some of the tasks

resurfaced during the previous congress what is the appropriate role for the department of defense dod in foreign assistance dod has long played role in us efforts to assist foreign populations militaries and governments the use of dod to provide foreign assistance stems in general from the perception that dod can contribute unique or vital capabilities and resources because it possesses the manpower materiel and organizational assets to respond to international ne eds over the years congress has shaped the dod role through wide variety of authorities contained in the foreign relations and intercourse title 22 us code and armed services title 10 us code statutes and through annual legislation to some analysts the dod role has been in effect product of congresss willingness to fund defense rather than foreign affairs budgets in some instances the activities in which dod participat serve an institutional purpose for the us military providing us soldiers and sailors with opportunities for military training for cultivating militarytomilitary contacts and for gathering information on foreign countries where they may someday be called to operate the historical dod role in foreign assistance can be regarded roughly as serving three purposes responding to humanitarian and basic needs since at least the 19 th century us military forces have provided urgent assistance to foreign populations in time of disasters such as earthquakes and floods more recently us military forces have also provided aid in humanitarian crises such as famines and forced population movements dod aids foreign populations under authorities to conduct humanitarian assistance in variety of other circumstances including as an adjunct to military training and exercises with and as part of military operations building foreign military capacity and capabilities dod provides military equipment weapons training and other assistance to build up the military capacity and capabilities of friendly foreign countries such support is provided to augment military capacity to perform counternarcotics counterterrorism internal defense border defense and other missions and as part of postconflict statebuilding the origins of current programs date to the early years after world war ii when the united states sought to help rebuild europe strengthening foreign governments besides building foreign military capacity dod plays role in us efforts to help foreign governments secure their territories against internal and international threats with variety of nonmilitary tools these include statebuilding efforts such as strengthening police forces and bolstering the legitimacy of foreign governments by undertaking smallscale economic health and social projects and in the case of conflict zones political projects generally in areas outside capital cities although such efforts were carried out sporadically as early as the 19 th century the postworld war ii us occupations in germany and japan are regarded as statebuilding models more 1 the introduction and overview were prepared by nina m serafino specialist in international security affairs these sections draw on the appendices at the end of the report by several crs analysts from the foreign affairs defense and trade division

support for border protection and nuclear nonproliferation initiatives strengthens foreign governments by curbing international threats during the past few years congress has provided dod with new noncombat authorities to prosecute the wars in afghanistan and iraq and to conduct counterterrorism2 activities elsewhere congress granted these authorities in response not only to the immediate needs of us military operations in conflict zones but also to the bush administrations efforts in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the united states of september 11 2001 911 to redirect and reshape us government capabilities in new strategic environment as result some analysts believe that dod is playing too large role in assisting foreign populations militaries and governments critics view this role as potentially detrimental to us foreign policy citing perceived lack of strategic coordination between dod and the state department and other agencies where applicable failure to ensure that dod programs are sustainable and militarization of the united states image abroad these analysts call for greater clarity and reforms in defining dods foreign assistance role and responsibilities 3 this report provides congress with historical context and current information and perspectives regarding dods role and responsibilities in range of foreign assistance activities in an overview and appendices this report provides background information on and discusses issues related to the dods role in providing us foreign assistance and undertaking foreign assistancetype activities topics include the types of assistance dod provides the authorities under which dod conducts its programs and coordination and cooperation mechanisms between dod and other agencies the report begins with brief introduction to the three areas in which dod plays role in foreign assistance and to congresss part in authorizing that role next the report briefly discusses the general evolution of dods role and the department of states current perception of that role based on current national security needs the report then provides an overview of the evolution of the dod role and current activities in the three areas cited above with snapshot of the varying perspectives on the dod roles in these areas finally the report discusses issues that congress may wish to consider the appendices provide more detailed information on the current and most significant foreign assistance programs in which dod plays role this report refers to department of defense role in foreign assistance rather than us military role because dod may use ei ther military troops or civilian contractors or both to implement 2 the term counterterrorism in this report refers to offensive measures ta ken to prevent deter and respond to terrorism 3 several recent reports reflect these perceptions two of these are congressional reports us congress senate committee on foreign relations embassies as command posts in the antiterror campaign washington dc december 2006 hereafter referred to as 2006 sfrc report and us congress house conference report on the national defense authorization act for fy2008 to accompany hr

primary national security threats were posed by other states there were differing perspectives within dod on the use of the military in noncombat roles with the fall of the soviet union these differences sharpened within the past few years the perceptions of dod officials military officers and defense analysts have coalesced around post911 strategy that calls for the use of the us military in preventive deterrent and preemptive activities this strategy involves dod in the creation of extensive international and interagency partnerships as well as an expanded dod role in foreign assistance activities the february 2006 quadrennial defense review report qdr is the first key document that reflects the evolution of dod thinking as it grapples with the implications of 911 for us national security and us defense policy 4 the assertion of top us defense officials and military leaders that dod needs new and more flexible authorities to operate in the current strategic environment forms the rationale for dods request for new authorities 5 especially to advance new partnership strategy6 as outlined in the 2006 qdr the partnership strategy is one of dods key tools for the united states long war against new threatthat is the decentralized networks of violent extremists who use terrorism as their weapon of choice who will likely attempt to use weapons of mass destruction in their conflict with free people everywhere 7 countering such networks as well as the rogue powers that may sponsor them will require longduration complex operations involving the us military other government agencies and international partners which are waged simultaneously in multiple countries8 to do so will also require that the united states 4 us department of defense quadrennial defense review report february 6 2006 hereafter referred to as 2006 qdr the qdr is congressionally mandated report title 10 usc section 118 produced every four years that delineates national defense strategy consistent with the presidents most recent national security strategy based on the perceived threats to us interests and defines the necessary force structure modernization plans infrastructure budget and other elements to carry out that defense strategy the 2002 national security strategy the most recent before the 2006 qdr sets forth eight tasks for the us government among them four which directly involve dod 1 strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends 2 work with others to defuse regional conflicts 3 prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction and 4 transform americas national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of

developing the wherewithal to protect their own populations and police their own territories as well as to project and sustain forces to promote collective security9 in the 2006 qdr as elsewhere dod maintains that developing the foreign wherewithal to enhance domestic and collective security requires whole of government approach through the november 2005 dod directive 300005 entitled the directive on military support for stability security transition and reconstruction sstr operations defense leaders mandated that dod be prepared to conduct and support civilian agencies in conducting sstr operations but also indicated doubt that civilian agencies will create the needed capabilities to carry out statebuilding tasks thus while dod acknowledges that statebuilding tasks may be best performed by indigenous foreign or us civilian professionals it also sees need to develop its own capability to perform all tasks necessary to establish or maintain order when civilians cannot do so 10 as reflected in the 2006 qdr dod is placing new emphasis on the utility of noncombat foreign assistance activities and expects to continue to play an important if not proportionately expanding role in us foreign assistance in the developing world dod subsequently reiterated these points in october 2007 defense secretary robert gates referred to this new perception of the dod role and until our government decides to plus up our civilian agencies like the agency for intern ational development usaid army soldiers can expect to be tasked with reviving public services rebuilding infrastructure and promoting good governance all these socalled nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategywhere they must stay 11 this theme was once again repeated in the june 2008 national defense strategy which found that us forces had stepped up to the task of longterm reconstruction development and governance and that the us armed forces will need to institutionalize and retain these capabilities while noting that this is replacement for civilian involvement and expertise 12 in report to congress in mid2007 the state department had argued in favor of new permanent dod authorities it viewed such authorities including several mentioned below as means to provide flexible timely and effective wholeofgovernment approach to todays security environment that is well coordinated in the interagency coordination process both in washington at the policy level and in the field at the operational level and with appropriate relevant oversight by

disaster relief and humanitarian assistance activities is longstanding with us military forces playing an important role in us disaster assistance since at least the 19 th century14 dod also plays role in other humanitarian emergency situations such as providing aid and protection for relief workers in cases of famine or forced population movements more routine humanitarian assistance activities and civic action programs abroad date back at least to the turn of the 20th century these usually take place in the context of us training exercises or military operations

g343g351g350g342g156g561 beginning in the mid1980s congress provided sp ecific dod authorities fo r humanitarian aid as the reagan administrations civilian leadership sought means to support its allies in conflicts in central america and afghanistan during that period congress provided specific authority to dod to 1 provide nonlethal excess property and supplies from the dod stocks when requested by the state department and for distribution by the state department 2 provide spaceavailable military transportation for private donors to send supplies and food to needy foreign populations and 3 carry out civic assistance programs that involve smallscale construction reconstruction and maintenance projects and provide limited medical attention to rural populations see appendix and appendix c since then congress has somewhat modified and expanded dod disaster response and humanitarian programs incorporating aid to mitigate environmental disasters and demining training and has introduced separate health programs see appendix appendix b and appendix c thus dod disaster and humanitarian ai d now encompasses broader range of potential assistance than the basic humanitarian relief of food and emergency supplies provided by nongovernmental organizations in 1994 congress established the overseas humanitarian disaster and civic aid ohdaca dod budget account to

the dod role in providing disaster relief to foreign populations when natural and manmade disasters strike serves both foreign affairs and military needs the lead authority for disaster response is the us agency for international development usaid and dod participation is conducted on the direction of the president or at the request of the state department through the appropriate us ambassador nevertheless dod is often the first us agency to respond to foreign disasters and other humanitarian crises because of its readily deployable resources dod international emergency responses allow the united states to contribute effectively in alleviating suffering abroad and enhancing the countrys international image as well as the us domestic and foreign image of the us military see appendix such activities are also undertaken for strategic or foreign policy reasons famous postworld war ii example of such motivation was the 19481949 berlin airlift when us air force and british royal air force flights of relief supplies to sovietblockaded west berlin demonstrated us and uk commitment to strategically important area

g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 humanitarian and civic assistance programs as currently conducted usually take place in the context of training exercises and military operations in that context they are carried out as much for the us military to gain situational awaren ess and the support of local populations as to alleviate suffering when provided under title 10 us code 10 usc 401 the primary purpose of the program must be to train us arme d forces in addition the assistance must not duplicate any other assistance and it must meet the security interests of both the united states and the host country section 401 authority has been often used for training exercises for the national guard and for military reserve personnel and active duty personnel in certain specialties especially medical personnel us special operations forces also conduct humanitarian assistance activities as an adjunct to military training exercises with foreign militaries and as an integral part of stability and counterinsurgency operations the joint combined exchange training jcet exercises with friendly foreign militaries are conducted under 10 usc 2011 primarily for the benefit of training the special operations forces but humanitarian assistance programs such as medical and veterinary visits may be added to cultivate goodwill among local populations and as part of the training for foreign troops us humanitarian and civic assistance activities also can be an integral part of military operations during the korean and vietnam conflict eras military civic action programs that included medical assistance were an integral part of military efforts now in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations teams of us special operations forces work together with foreign militaries on smallscale humanitarian and civic action projects the primary purposes of humanitarian and civic assistance in such operations are to extend the reach of the national government enhance its legitimacy among local populations and cultivate relationships and trust that may lead to information sharing on rrorists locations and planned activities 16 16 authors interview with dod

promoting specific operational readiness skills of us military personnel25 the 2006 qdr places humanitarian assistance and disa ster relief operations under the rubric of humanitarian and early preventive measures and claims that the use of such measures can prevent disorder from spiraling into wider conflict or crisis26 state department officials welcome the us militarys ability to deliver disaster and humanitarian relief assistance in timely fashion they also tend to favor routine humanitarian assistance and civic action projects albeit as matter of necessity because such projects allow the us government to provide supplies and medical services to needy populations and to construct schools and clinics in underserved areas where funds are not otherwise available these projects can create goodwill and personal contact for the united states often in areas where us diplomats would othe rwise not venture dod and us m ilitary personnel attitudes toward disaster response and humanitarian relief vary attitudes tend to be favorable for immediate disaster response and for training exercises particularly for national guard and reserve troops attitudes become ambivalent when us military personnel are used for prolonged periods for humanitarian assistance in conventional operations over the years observers have raised variety of concerns regarding humanitarian and civic assistance in nonemergency situations analysts have long faulted such assistance for sometimes being shortsighted and producing ill will when projects are not well selected 27 in the 1990s congress scrutinized us humanitarian and civic action activities in central america28 critics continue to view some projects as illconceived and at odds with sound development policy for instance schools built in areas where there are teachers to staff them undermine the credibility of the united states and the host nation government or assistance that albeit inadvertently benefits one ethnic group over another exacerbates ongoing conflicts 29 see appendix the bush administration has recently created new coordination mechanisms that may address such concerns see the section on dod interaction with

goes beyond help to foreign milit ary forces in many situations and currently in afghanistan and iraq dod has played significant if not leading role in tasks related to nationbuilding or statebuilding such tasks include helping establish or strengthen rule of law capabilities police judicial and prison institutions and facilities reinforcing the administrative capacity of central governments strengthening local governments in rural areas and bolstering national economies such statebuilding support is now widely perceived as means to deter or control internal and international threats although us military personnel carry out this role most often in combat situations where the pres ence of untrained unarmed civilians may be liability they may also carry out this role because of shortage of trained civilian personnel because the circumstances have varied greatly such assistance has usually been carried out under mix of authorities and programs

of us military invo lvement in statebuilding occurred in the post world war ii military occupations of germany and japan although there are earlier examples such as the us military occupation of the philippines around the turn of the 20th century in the 1990s dod personnel provided such assistance in peacekeeping and postconflict operations as part of military operations in somalia haiti and bosnia sometimes dod provides such assistance to foreign governments as part of military counterterrorism internal defense and counterinsurgency efforts special operations forces teams carry out variety of statebuilding activities to strengthen local leaders and defuse ethnic and other rivalries as part of their civic assistance projects congress also provides dod with authority to train and

were tapped to manage early economic assistance programs in iraq dod was called on in 2004 to carry out the largest infrastructure projects nevertheless dods own army corps of engineers ace also was ini tially found insufficient to manage the task and dod contracted the job directly with private companies ace was subsequently tapped for management role although the state department assumed

statebuilding activities have thus far been carried out within the context of military operations for many year s dod and us mili tary leaders rejected nationbuilding role arguing that it was not appropriate for us military forces and detracted from combat readiness as defense analysts and military personnel began to perceive statebuilding as essential to the success of peacekeeping and related operations attitudes began to shift about the desirability of the us military role in statebuilding in 2005 dod directive 300005 identified statebuilding as key to the success of stability operations and stated that us military forces shall be prepared to perform all tasks necessary to establish or maintain order when civilians cannot do so 56 critics find dod statebuilding activities marred by lack of both strategic planning and application of economic development best practices by the absence of civilian input and integration with civilian efforts and by insufficient oversight

objectives and lack of civilian expertise and note that dod has made efforts to improve soldiers ability to carry out such tasks57 concerns focus on the extension of state building activities to nonconflict situations for example extending cerp authority worldwide as requested by the administration without more state department control or activities of combatant commands especially africom might lead to perceptions that the united states is militarizing its foreign policy defense experts implicitly acknowledged factual basis for at least some criticisms of its state building role by expressly stating in 2005 dod directive 300005 that civilians would be better suited to accomplish political social and economic tasks in many circumstances nevertheless dod officials regard the united states as faced with strategic imperative to undertake such activities in the new global environment and th us military as charged with performing them where civilians cannot dod officials are currently grappling with the many issues and tradeoffs involved in better preparing military forces to carry out wide variety of political social and economic tasks for stabilization and reconstruction as well as other activities alone or in conjunction with civilian personnel in the absence of civilian personnel58 an important part of this task for dod the state department usaid and other civilian agencies is to determine and prioritize an appropriate civilmilitary division of labor in noncombat areas with dods renewed request in 2008 to expand section 1206 to allow training of foreign police and related security forces including gendarmerie constabulary internal defense and infrastructure in addition to military forces congress is faced with sensitive issue since at least the 1970s congress has been concerned with the possible human rights implications of us assistance to foreign police forces in general and dod assistance in particular59 nevertheless many analysts argue that many more foreign police personnel are needed especially gendarmes trained in both police and military skills for postconflict operations 60 and some might prefer that dod provide personnel to fill that training gap especially in major postconflict zones 57 for example see 2006 csis task force report op cit pp 1220 58 may 2006 dod memo on implementing the 2006 qdr strategy states that dod must be prepared to grow new team of leaders and operators who are comfortable working in remote regions of the world dealing with local and tribal communities adapting to foreign languages and culture s working with local networks operating alongside or within united nations organizations and working alongside nongovernmental organizations to further us and partner interests through

assistance that us government agencies can provide to foreign police forces since the 1970s when such assistance was provided to police forces that were perceived of as violating human rights over the years congress has loosened restrictions by adding statutory exceptions to the codified prohibition on police training section 660 of the 1961 faa 22 usc 2420 for certain situations and providing exceptions for assistance to certain countries and situations elsewhere in law currently the us government provides assistance through the state department and the justice department to foreign police

nongovernmental organizations the implications for foreign policy objectives including counterterrorism economic development and statebuilding and democracy promotion and the relative effectiveness of civilian versus military personnel nongovernmental organizations ngos that carry out humanitarian missions hold mixed views on dod humanitarian assistance activities they generally do not criticize the use of the us military in first response disaster relief operations some are critical however of the use of us military forces in broad range of humanitarian and basic needs activities in conflict areas although military forces can provide needed security in unstable environments in some situations military involvement in humanitarian ssistance can be problematic especially when military personnel are directly involved in providing humanitarian assistance and other humanitarian acts military assistance can be viewed as jeopardizing the lives and work of ngo personnel by stigmatizing them as participants in military effort these criticisms were provoked by the us militarys humanitarian role in afghanistan where nongovernmental humanitarian aid workers felt their neutrality was compromised by soldiers in civilian dress who distributed humanitarian aid as part of military operations since then dod has made an effort to engage nongovernmental aid workers and to develop means to work together while some humanitarian relief ngos now welcome the security that military forces can provide in hostile areas others still feel that their lives are endangered by the proximity of soldiers engaged in humanitarian activities in areas without us military involvement local populations may also take the use of military personnel for such activities as prelude to military action or intervention 63 the use of military forces may also impede the advancement of foreign policy goals for instance the december 2006 senate foreign relations committee report embassies as command posts in the antiterror campaign viewed the use of dod personnel for counterterrorism programs as an obstacle in latin america especially military and intelligence efforts are viewed with suspicion making it difficult to pursue meaningful cooperation on counterterrorism agenda64 as pointed out in appendix f on counternarcotics cooperation mexico has resisted counternarcotics assistance that would

economic development some analysts question whether the us military objectives in carrying out smallscale infrastructure projects in conjunction with exercises and operations respond to shortterm exigencies rather than abiding by development best practices to accomplish longterm structural reforms66 in the cases of iraq and afghanistan some analysts point out that some normal development practices will inevitably take back seat to operational realities67 in the case of humanitarian and civic action activities in nonconflict areas however lack of integration with longterm development plans can raise expectations of economic growth and development that cannot be fulfilled with the limited resources available the use of us military personnel in statebuilding activities may convey mixed signals in activities where the objective is to promote democracy and enhance civilian control while the use of us military forces is seen as appropriate in statebuilding efforts that involve the training of foreign militaries some analysts believe that it may undermine that objective when used in other statebuilding activities by reinforcing stereotypes in underdeveloped nationssuch as that military forces are more competent than civiliansor legitimize the use of military forces for civilian governmental responsibilities further some analysts believe that dod has failed to strengthen institutional mechanisms for civilian control in its dealings with foreign militaries 68 the lack of expertise within the military to carry out coherent plans for economic and political development in foreign nations is also considered problematic while the placement of usaid officers within combatant commands may alleviate some of the worst problems some analysts believe that their presence may not be sufficient to ensure that best practices are routinely applied 69 civilians are cited as enjoying an overall advantage in many humanitarian and statebuilding tasks military forces are however recognized as possessing decided advantage in some humanitarian mission tasks such as providing security and air support particularly in hostile situations despite that military advantage however one study judged civilian personnel more effective in carrying out wide range of humanitarian tasks in conflict situations these tasks are acquiring the supplies necessary for humanitarian assistance operations assessing and utilizing local resources interacting w ith the local population providing the most suitable medical response managing refugee camps and providing water and sanitation 70 another study judged that although most multinational military personnel assisting with the rwanda crisis in 1994 were skilled in their own areas they had unique competence in such

g20g142g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 there is widespread presumption that using military forces for many humanitarian missions military support and statebuilding activities costs more than using civilian personnel for the same tasks but analysts note the absence of reliable studies on relative costs one 1998 study on the use of international military forces for humanitarian assistance in conflict situations judged that the use of the military is generally more costly than civilian means and will far exceed the costs of providing the aid itself the study attributed the greater costs to the military emphasis on making its activities failsafe rather than costeffective building into its procedures safeguards redundancies and limitations that often do not exist with civilian means civilian and commercial means are in general leaner and less redundant 72 the study cautioned however that its general conclusions were presented as hypotheses73 relative costs can vary according to the circumstances for instance according to the 1998 study cited above when military assets are already deployed either for humanitarian assistance or for peacekeeping the marginal cost of using these personnel and resources will be low in these areas then the military can be costeffective means of delivering and supporting humanitarian assistance 74 variety of other factors can influence relative costs the militarys economies of scale and shared costs may reduce the price tag on the use of military forces on the other hand the degree of force protection in the field and the amount of equipment with which the military deploys can raise costs for some analysts cost considerations are beside the point as there are certain situations where military forces are indispensable

in approving legislation governing the dod role in foreign assistance congress can mandate the type and degree of interaction between dod and civilian agencies it can maintain or strengthen the leadership role that the state department has traditionally had in foreign assistance activities or it can respond to the concerns of some defense officials and analysts that dod lacks appropriate authority and flexibility to carry out foreign assistance activities expeditiously and enhance the dod role since at least the early 1960s congress has made the secretary of state the lead us government official regarding oversight of foreign assistance including military assistance and assigned us ambassadors or other officials carrying out the responsibilities of chief of united states diplomatic mission lead role in coordinating military assistance with foreign policy section 622 of the 1961 faa 22 usc 2382 entitled coordination with foreign policy contains these provisions section 622c of the original version of the 1961 faa provided that the secretary of state shall be responsible for the continuous supervision and general direction of the assistance programs authorized by this act including but not limited to determining whether there shall be military assistance program for country and the value thereof to the end that such programs are effectively integrated both at home and abroad and the foreign policy of the united states is best served thereby section 622c in 1976 congress amended that provision 76 deleting the limitation that made it applicable solely to programs in the 1961 faa as amended section 622c now charges the secretary of state with responsibility for the continuous supervision and general direction of economic assistance military assistance and military education and training programs including but not limited to determining whether there shall be military assistance including civic action or military education and training program for country and the value thereof to the end that such programs are effectively integrated both at home and abroad and the foreign policy of the united states is best served thereby the 1961 faa as amended does not define military assistance or civic action it does however define military education and training 77 the chief of missions responsibility was contained in section 622b under that provision the ambassador or other responsible official exercises leadership under procedures prescribed by the president over ensuring coordination regarding foreign assistance programs among us government representatives in each country section 622b specifically ties this role to military assistance the original language reads the chief of the diplomatic mission shall make sure that recommendations of such representatives pertaining to military assistance are coordinated with political and economic considerations and that his comments shall accompany such 75 this section was

secretary of defense with several responsibilities regarding the provision of military equipment as well as the supervision of the training of foreign military and related civilian personnel through legislation congress often has required that the department of state approve an activity some of the temporary authorities for iraq and afghanistan for instance require the concurrence ie the approval of the secretary of state under pre911 legislation dod needs to secure the concurrence of the secretary of state for programs regarding the educational programs capacity building and logistic support for allies other title 10 us code programs under dod authority require the secretary of defense to secure the approval of the secretary of state for military to military contacts and the approval of both the secretary of state and the attorney general for certain counternarcotics and counterterrorism activities ie support for law enforcement officials outside the united states in other cases however congress had mandated that dod coordinate or consult with the state department and other relevant agencies dod must develop certain counternarcotics and counterterrorism activities in

coordination on dod foreign assistance activities some analysts are concerned that the state department lead has eroded and that the new dod mechanisms provide an inappropriate subordinate role for the state department 84 this can be disadvantage in planning for implementing and overseeing these activities even when the state departments approval is required the answer for some is to increase the dod role in such activities in general while others argue for increasing the state department and usaid ability to plan oversee and coordinate activities one oftenmentioned factor impeding the latter option is the lack of adequate numbers of state department and usaid personnel at us embassies and in washington dc recent csis report details recommendations to increase civilian staff for counterterrorism postconflict and humanitarian operations 85 an mit study recommends establishing permanent interagency group under the national security council cochaired by the office of management and budget to oversee security assistance program integration86 third option would be for congress to reinforce the role of us ambassadors as the top us government official in all countries by requiring that us ambassadors approve all foreign assistancetype activities of all us military personnel or dod contractors operating in their countries rega rdless of the statutory authorities under which they operate fourth possibility for enhancing state department control in the view of some analysts would be to create new regional mech anisms for state department coordination both among embassies and with the us military one of dods primary advantages in planning and carrying out foreign assistance activities is its regional organization with four geographic combatant commands some analysts believe that this regional focus combined with regional field presence allows for better foreign assistance planning compared with the state departments traditional bilateral focus with foreign assistance planning in each country initiated and overseen by us ambassadors reporting to the departments washington dcbased regional bureaus the dod regional arrangement may also place some dod foreign assistance activities beyond the purview of us ambassadors as regional dod activities may not necessarily be cleared with ambassadors and ambassadors lack sufficient civilian staff to

assistance area because of the greater number of personnel and its large budget this resource advantage sometimes has cr eated friction between state department and dod officials over the use of dod

these civilian agencies it has become clear he said that americas civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and underfunded for far too longrelative to what

greater planning and execution capabilities and substantially greater budgetary resources dod can muster more manpower than any other agency while us mili tary personnel may be stretched in wartime there still exist substantial reserves of personnel that can be tapped to plan and carry out activities the combatant commands enjoy considerably more personnel than do individual embassies and their personnel are oriented toward planning activities whereas state department personnel are oriented toward collecting information and furthering us policy through diplomacy such as persontoperson contact despite waging war in iraq centcom created new joint task force in the horn of africa cjthoa of roughly 2000 us military personnel the number fluctuates regularly to plan and carry out efforts in the horn of africa that include much foreign assistance activity in iraq dod temporarily provided military personnel to fill about 100 state department prt posts until the state department could contract persons with the needed expertise to fill them congress also grants considerable funding to dod to carry out foreign assistancetype activities for example congress funded dods ohdaca appropriation at roughly 60 million year for fy2005fy2007 and provided for fy2008 total of 1033 million of which part is multiple year money these sums represent more funding than the state department provides annually to many individual countries receiving us foreign assistance in addition these amounts are but small part of the actual cost of the acti vities undertaken under ohdaca authorities ohdaca funding does not cover the total cost of an activity but only its incremental cost ie the amount above the normal peacetime cost of soldier in terms of historical spending congresss fy2009 ohdaca authorization for 833 million in is about the same in nominal terms as the 86 million current dollars that congress authorized fo r ohdaca when th account was created in 1994 however in constant term s ohdaca funding has sh runk as the initial ohdaca authorization would be 131 million in fy2009 dollars some analysts believe that congress has given dod an advantage by increasing dod allocations for foreign assistancetype activities because such funds are more easily included in the defense budget than in the foreign assistance budget 92 in particular these funds include the cerp for afghanistan and iraq and an increase in discretionary money in the ccif which can be used for variety of purposes in addition to humanitarian relief 91 us department of defense speech by secretary of defense robert m gates to the us global leadership campaign washington dc july 15 2008 accessed through httpwwwdefenselinkmilspeeches last accessed july 22 2008 secretary gates also stated that while he could not pretend to know the right dollar amounti know its good deal more than the one percent of the federal budget than it is right now and given that the budgets we are talking about are relatively small compared to the rest of government steep increase of these capabilities is well within reachas long as there is the political will and wisdom to do it 92 the csis task force final

necessarily provide dod with the needed competence and expertise to carry out foreign assistance activities for instance for many years some defense analysts have stated that the us military civil affairs speciality does not have an adequate number of personnel to carry out the wide variety of statebuilding tasks needed with recent increase in the number of civil affairs personnel one analysts concern now focuses on whether civil affairs personnel are properly organized trained educated and provided the resources to fulfill their mission 93 in some us embassies us civilian personnel interviewed criticized some military personnel as poorly trained in information gathering and rarely possessing regional or linguistic expertise94 dod directive 300005 points to need to develop personnel qualified to engage in statebuilding and economic reconstruction activities dod is still deliberating whether to devote funding and time to develop cadre with the necessary range of expertise to plan and carry out such activities on its own 95 dod directive 300005 points out that civilians are often better suited to carry out such tasks

dod officials join many other analysts in urging congress to augment the ability of civilian federal agencies to carry out the statebuilding and economic measures that will prevent and deter conflicts stabilize nations in transitions from conflict and foster economic recovery and democratic institutions during the postconflict period 96 for many analysts one indication of the urgency of increasing the number of federal civilian personnel to perform such tasks was the state departments inability to supply when needed more than 100 specialized skilled personnel to staff the prts in iraq which dod had to staff temporarily until the state department could locate contractors many analysts also cite need for significant number of usaid permanent staff they note that usaid permanent staf f now number approximately 2000 down from some 15000 during the vietnam war and that most usaid work is currently carried out by contractors 93 colonel christopher holshek the scroll and the sw ord

office of the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs to plan and coordinate such preventive transitional and postconflict activities97 under authority provided by congress dod has transferred funds during fy2006 and fy2007 to scrs for such activities nevertheless some analysts have criticized scrs for failing to fully perform its assigned functions some fault lack of toplevel state department commitment to its mission and bureaucratic infighting within the state department others judge that congress has not provided the state department with the level of funding necessary to adequately staff and otherwise provide for this offices operations 98 in february 2008 the bush administration presented congress with 2486 million request to fund civilian stabilization initiative that would strengthen us civilian capabilities to respond to unanticipated conflict in foreign countries the initiatives centerpiece would be civilian response corps consisting of civilian federal government employees from several departments 250 members of an active response corps and 2000 members of standby response corps and reserve component of 2000 citizens from outside the federal government this corps would include people with wide variety of statebuilding and economic reconstruction capabilities congress appropriated 50 million in seed money for the corps in supplemental

civilian management an area of particular interest to dod is an increase in us government capacity to train and equip foreign military and police forces some argue that dod needs to increase its own

humanitarian programs often in the context of military civic action mca programs that also involve construction and reconstruction projects experts trace the armys experience with mca to 18th and 19thcentury engineering and medical activities in the united states and abroad by the time of world war ii propensity toward military civic action was already part of the fabric of the us soldier according to one study which then identifies the mca program in korea after the korean war as the first sustained and concerted us military civic action plan 114 this program set forth dominant model in military civic action aimed at smallscale construction and reconstruction projects in which us military forces assist but host nation troops do most of the work mca gained prestige as part of the us military occupation of the philippines at the turn of the 20th century and was later endorsed by president john f kennedy who viewed it as an appropriate nationbuilding tool115 although military assistance had been carried out as part of security assistance programs prior to the 1960s in 1965 congress responded to concerns about its role in international development by placing the first

that would involve usaid116 mca became controversial during the 1960s when because of its linkage with counterinsurgency in vietnam congress became reluctant to fund it117 nevertheless congress did fund some mca projects abroad after vietnam that were not linked to counterinsurgency campaigns in particular an africa program in the 1980s that program was funded at almost 5 million in fy1985 but funding dropped to just under 2 million by fy1989118 during the 1980s controversy over mca in central america where the united states was supporting the salvadoran governments counterinsurgency campaign led congress to authorize specific activities through new statute when congress added section 401 to title 10 us code in 1986 it set parameters for humanitarian and civic assistance activities in foreign nations by specifying activities and establishing conditions but it also provided dod with greater flexibility by granting title 10 authority for such assistance previously at least some mca in particular the africa program was carried out under authoritie s that put the state department in the lead according to one source119 the number of countries in which these activities have occurred has remained fairly constant while the regional balance has shifted somewhat comparison of fy1995 and fy2006 two years where humanitarian and civic action activities took place in 43 countries under section 401 authority shows that the number of western hemisphere middle eastarab and asiapacific recipient countries decreased while the number of countries in africa and

draws praise wh provided in emergency relief situations such as natural and manmade disasters as it is the most flexible operational and policy tool that can be quickly brought to bear to relieve human suffering controversy has arisen however when us military troops provide humanitarian and civic assistance for the longer term ie in non emergency or conflict recovery situations such longerterm assistance occurs in the course of military operations and deployments or when training exercises are conducted extensively in an area over prolonged period of time then humanitarian and civic assistance is often used for political purposes including maintaining contact with country region or local population mitigating tensions cultivating lies and promoting democracy in the case of humanitarian infrastructure projects and other civic assistance there are longstanding concerns about suitability and costs that date back to the 1960s 120 critics and even some proponents of such assistance have found that projects do not always meet the most urgent needs of the host country or longterm developmen t goals and are not sustainable and thus may represent poor use of us funds nevertheless to some analysts civic action projects fill gap where other us assistance is available the use of us military forces to carry out largescale humanitarian interventions in somalia and the balkans in the 1990s aroused concern both within the military and among civilian humanitarian aid workers many in both camps also were troubled when the military as the major presence on the ground became involved in humanitarian and statebuilding projects and questioned the suitability and desirability of using us military personnel for such activities many asserted that humanitarian and statebuilding tasks could have been better performed by experienced civilians with subject area expertise and knowledge about local culture military leaders themselves questioned whether military personnel were the most appropriate personnel to carry out such activities particularly as many believed that such activities diverted time and personnel from the militarys primary functions another concern was lack of effective coordination military culture clashed with the ethos and modes of operations of the civilian personnel involved from multitude of agenciesthe united nations and other international organizations national governments and from nongovernmental humanitarian groupsand the resulting distrust and disagreement impeded cooperation the concerns raised during the interventions of the 1990s have resurfaced in the context of iraq and afghanistan along with new issues regarding the effect of the use of military forces on the work and safety of civilian humanitarian workers in the field the use of military personnel for humanitarian and civic assistance projects in iraq and afghanistan particularly in the context of the provincial reconstruction teams in afghanistan has led to fears that the perception of humanitarian assistance as an impartial neutral tool has been jeopardized and that the lives and safety of civilian humanitarian workers is threatened because they may be perceived as associated with military efforts in that context however attempts to incorporate civilians into prts have 120 see for instance edward bernard glick peaceful

by the lack of civilian personnel for such tasks see the discussion on prts in appendix k at the same time concerns again arise as to whether dod activities are effective and properly coordinated with civilian agencies to ensure consistency with us foreign policy objectives the recent placement of usaid personnel in us regional combatant commands to scrutinize and help develop proposed humanitarian and civic assistance projects is intended among other things to synchronize usaid and dod planning efforts and to produce joint policy documents dealing with linkages between defense and development 121 previous concern which has not surfaced in the current debate is that the involvement of military forces in humanitarian aid and smallscale economic projects weakens civilian control over the military in developing countries by perpetuating stereotypes that military forces are most effective at meeting basic needs and perhaps by encouraging the use of military forces to perform functions that more properly performed by civilians on the other hand some argue that the use of us military forces in such activities provides democratic role model for local military forces and an opportunity

is the principal vehicle through which the us government makes sales of weapons and associated equipment and training to friendly foreign nations144 most of these sales are made on cash basisthat is the purchasing country enters into contract specifying the price to be paid for specific items of military equipment being obtained the us government then procures the defense items from the us manufacturer if not provided from defense department stocks receives the payment from the foreign buyer and passes it to the manufacturer in accordance with the terms and deadlines specified in the contract the us government monitors the procurement process from the signing of the contract until the items purchased are all delivered purchases through the fms program can be provided to individual purchasers with funds requested and appropriated in the annual foreign operations appropriations legislation this element of the fms program is termed foreign military financing fmf 145 it permits loans or forgiven payments to countries that may have difficulty paying for needed weapons military equipment and related items the annual budget justification for foreign oper ations is formulated primarily by the state department with input on specific country accounts or prospective arms sales provided by dod from its inception dod has handled the implementation of the fms cash and credit and an earlier grant military assistance program map used essentially before 1976 determining which nations are to receive military assistance from either program as matter of national policy has been primarily the responsibility of the state department the arms export control act aeca specifies which conditions must be met before country can purchase defense articles from the united states in essence country must be eligible to purchase under existing us law ie if statute forbids sales to specific country that country is ineligible to make purchase146 the president also determines countrys eligibility taking into consideration us security interests if country is eligible in the contract for sale of the items that it may purchase the country must give binding commitments to use the articles purchased only for such things as legitimate selfdefense and internal security and not to retransfer items sold to it to thirdparties without prior us government consent the responsibility for implementing fms programs rests with the defense security cooperation agency dsca the dsca security assistance officers saos who manage the programs on the ground are located in us embassies 143

countries in europe build up their military defenses and thus support the new north atlantic treaty organizations natos ability to help contain soviet communist expansion in that region the mutual defense assistance act of 1949 pl 81329 authorized the fms program and grant military assistance progra m map as means to provide needed military equipment and training to us allies in need of such military support and aid much of the equipment transferred under this original authority was excess stocks of world war ii vintage equipment which was less expensive but still valuable for helping restore the military capabilities of key us allies the core rationales for military assistance at the inception of the cold war can be summarized as follows to enhance the ability of allied and friendly countries to defend themselves against external aggression or internal subversion by communist or unfriendly forces to enhance bilateral security relationships to deter aggression against allied and friendly nations to express tangible us support for political actions of allied and friendly nations that the united states sought to encourage the first rationale was essentially military one the other two were both political and military in nature over time the focus and nature of military assistance was modified somewhat as their economies grew industrialized nations allied to the united states gradually stopped receiving grant military aid and began to pay cash for major weapons systems purchased from the united states under the fms program and by the 1970s the grant map program was phased out nevertheless using the fms cash program as well the fmf financing program to support the security interests of american friends and allies overseas has remained constant theme in justifying this form of military aid the nature of the threat to us allies and friendly states around the globe may have changed but the goal of using arms sales as an instrument to further us interests through enhancing the military capabilities and security such countries has not initially only the more industrialized allies of the united states participated in the fms program while the grant map program provided military aid to much larger number of less developed and less affluent countries friendly to the united states throughout the world the original nations eligible for military assistance under the 1949 ndaa were nato members turkey greece south korea iran the philippines and taiwan to day most of these same nations excluding iran which is ineligible for the program generally pay cash for military purchases under the fms program the principal goals of fms remain the same except the number of nations making purchases has increased with middle eastern na tions in particular major oilproducing states becoming significant buyers from the late 1970s to the present as noted above states such as israel and egypt which reached usbacked pe ace agreement in 1979 have been and continue to be leading recipients of fms sales and fmf credits 147 147 in 1954 pursuant to the mutual security act pl 83665 the united states established the authority for the foreign military sales program to provide loans and credits to facilitate the purchase of us military equipment by allied and friendly nations previous to that time sales were made on cash basis only in 1961 with the enactment of the foreign assistance act of 1961 pl 87195 consol idation of all previous military and economic foreign aid programs and authorities was achieved and the original map program

implications of narcotics trafficking first emerged in the late 1960s in 1971 press conference president richard nixon famously coined the term war on drugs and identified illicit drugs as public

the us military in antidrug efforts in the 1970s 156 pressure for us military involvement increased throughout the 1980s as us officials grew concerned that law enforcement personnel were unprepared and illequipped to effectively combat wellarmed drug cartels and operate in conflict situations in drug source countries such calls and pressure for dod involvement in cn activities raised particular concern among several top dod officials in the 1980s including former secretaries of defense caspar weinberger and frank carlucci who strongly objected to the us militarys continued and increasing

critique dods role in cn assistance proponents of dods expanded role generally argue that narcotics trafficking poses national security threat to the united states and that the military is especially equipped with the resources and skills to help foreign governments counter powerful drug trafficking organizations many analysts also acknowledge that although dod and civilian agencies have seemingly overlapping and redundant authorities the absence of dods participation in cn assistance would be detrimental to the effectiveness of us programs opponents by contrast insist that cn foreign assistance is not military mission and that the training of military elements in foreign countries may have serious political and diplomatic repercussions abroad critics of dods role in cn assistance also fear that the balance between military and civilian participation in cn may disproportionately favor the military for example longstanding concerns over the perceived reliance on the military to provide cn assistance have resurfaced with new plans to remodel by 2018 the us southern command southcom dods regional combatant command for central and south america southcom has long played key role in dod cn assistance planning in the andes region and in dods new vision southcoms participation in nontraditional military activity including cn assistance will likely expand dod planners envision broader interagency role for southcom akin to the new us africa command africom which includes building foreign governments security capacity and improving accountable governance as part of its core mission 168 supporters of the 2018 plan perceive this change as an opportunity to enhance interagency coordination of international programs among military and civilian agencies rather than zero sum game other analysts however are wary th at southcoms new strategic direction will further militarize us foreign policy in the regi on in addition an expanded role for dod in cn assistance may antagonize us foreign partners this has already been the case with the government of mexico which reportedly resisted us efforts to place the country under southcoms or any other combatant command st ructure area of responsibility aor in order to make the point that it does not want the us military involved in what it considers to be its internal affairs169 only in 2002 was mexico incorporated into the newly created northcom which also includes the continental united states alaska canada and surrounding waters even today mexicos military cn cooperation under northcom remains limited as noted above the highly publicized mérida initiative does not include role for direct dod support in addition to concerns about the balance between military and civilian roles in cn assistance some analysts have voiced concern over the difficulty in reconciling dod and state department 168 southcom command strategy 2018 accessible at httpwwwsouthcommilappsscfiles 0ui0i1177092386pdf last accessed

planning some observers claim that dods cn planning processes differ from the state departments and may make crossagency policy coordination and evaluation of assistance programs difficult for example unlike the state department dod programming strategies are not developed on countrybycountry basis instead planning is based on capabilities because most of dods cn programs eg rothrs cbrns and aerial and surface platforms cover geographic regions that span several countries this difference in planning strategies is also reflected in the way cn funds are disbursed dod funds are allocated by function rather than by country the state department annually provides congress with cn assistance program summaries by country and function in contrast equivalent dod document is regularly published

2002 dod established the regional defense counterterrorism fellowship program ctfp with 179 million appropriated by congress the initial program was to fund foreign military officers attendance at us military education institutions and selected regional centers for nonlethal training 183 in 2003 an authorization for ctfp was codified 10 usc 2249c expanding the program to civilians and other venues and setting an annual authorization limit of 20 million this authorization permitted dod to pay costs associ ated with the attendance of foreign military officers foreign ministry of defense officials and foreign security officials at us military educational institutions regional centers conferences seminars and other training programs184 there is stipulation in the title 10 us code statute that such education and training be non lethal an amendment to that statute in 2006 raised the authorized limit to 25 million and extended the range of permitted venues to foreign and civilian institutions centers and events185 the program has four objectives educating foreign military and civilian personnel who are directly involved in the war on terrorism creating and maintaining human counterterrorism network with shared values and common languag providing countries with the intellectual means to create sustain and grow counterterrorism capabilities and capacities and influencing countries to cooperate more full in us and coalition efforts to combat terrorism 186 through this program dod supports the tsctp program and regional strategic initiatives the changes in the program over time have raised some concerns some question whether enhanced program activities may duplicate other us counterterrorism efforts although some argue that the expansion of the program is result of the maturation of the mission some security analysts question the lack of specific langua ge regarding nonlethal training in the ctfp permanent authority if lethal training activities are now part of ctfp objectives some security observers question how this new focus differs from that of the international military education and training program see appendix g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 an issue of concern is whether the dod and the state department and other agencies adequately coordinate their programs dod and civilian agencies have over the past few years developed new means such as the rsi to coordinate programs within the state department 182 email correspondence with the state department office of the coordinator for counterterrorism april 11 2008 183 department of defense and

cooperation on counterterrorism as model for dodstate department cooperation187 others believe that there is still considerable room for improvement regarding the tsctp recent csis report acknowledges progress in interagency cooperation particularly in the field but finds that such cooperation is strongly dependent on individual personalities188 impediments to improved coordination and execution of counterterrorism programs include the separate policy development and implementation by relevant agencies combatant commands us embassies and usaid missions differences in institutional culture among dod the state department and usaid and the differences in pers pectives created by the regional focus of the dod combatant commands and the bilateral focus of the state department and us country teams according to that report 189 concerns are also raised that dod and the state department share an overarching strategic framework and strategic priorities the csis report finds lack of coherent strategic vision and authoritative planning on counterterrorism ma tters across dod the state department and usaid190 another report faults the tsctp for failing to fulfill its rhetorical commitment to holistic integrated response addressing the economic social and political sources of instability although us government players agree that ct strategy should focus eighty percent on development and governance activities and only twenty percent on military effort actual budgets have been closer to the reverse making it difficult for the program to address underlying chronic sources of underdevelopment and poor governance 191 if the counterterrorism assistance programs are not coordinated with respect to the overarching strategy of the united states the departments providing services and advice may inadvertently negatively influence foreign countrys efforts to support us national security policies other interagency concerns that may have us policy implications include the commonalities in procedures and training offered by dod and state department training personnel the sharing of useful national security information gleaned from host country training activities and how us foreign policy goals are conveyed to host country representatives the training and services offered have significant impact on foreign countrys tactical and strategic approach to addressing terrorism within its borders and in the surrounding region if us federal government counterterrorism organizations are not coordinating with the ta s counterterrorism activities conflicting us policy signals may be given to the host country and resources may be used in an inefficient manner lack of transparency for such interagency programs that draw on multiple authorities and multiple budget accounts may also be concern reporting requirements for each of the component programs vary and there may be reporting requirement for some components thus one source presents to congress comprehensive account of multiple counterterrorism programs 187 email correspondence with the state department office of the coordinator for counterterrorism april 11 2008 also see appendix h 188 csis

g349g342g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 section 1206 funding has been one of the most controversial dod foreign assistancetype programs the december 2006 senate foreign relations committee sfrc report embassies as the command post in the antiterror campaign rejected this grant of special authority to dod and recommended that the secretary of state insist that all security assistance including section 1206 funding be included under hisher authority200 based on visits to embassies in 2006 sfrc staff found that plans for section 1206 programs were not receiving the same embassy input as bilateral programs and that in some cases the embassies were not even being informed of plans for section 1206 activities until well into or after the selection process in addition the report stated that for the most part except in the cases of lebanon and pakistan section 1206 activities do not address emergency situations and could be handled as are other security assistance programs through the normal budget process 201 some sources indicate that there have been some improvements in planning and coordination since the sfrc report was issued 2007 gao repo rt echoed the sfrc finding of lack of coordination in formulating fy2006 proposals the gao stated however that the combatant commands and embassies we contacted reported better coordination in the formulation of fiscal year 2007 proposals which they attributed to having more time to develop proposals and more explicit guidance from state and dod202 2008 dod document describes dod and state department coordination on section 1206 programs as rapidly becoming the gold standard for interagency cooperation to meet emerging threats and opportunities because of the revolutionary way it is managed203 some analysts have questioned the utility of placing section 1206 programs under dod when the program relies heavily on private contractors the new interagency process has expedited the project selection process which may increase the possibilities for using us military personnel for some section 1206 training fy2006 and fy2007 section 1206 activities were selected toward the very end of the fiscal years leaving just enough time to obligate the funds through contracts with private companies these compan ies could then implement the project in the following fiscal year scheduling assignments for us military troops requires that activities be approved well before the end of the fiscal ear according to one dod official as military personnel must complete activities in the fiscal year or years for which funds are allocated 204 the fy2008 selection process is well underway provisions in the house and senate versions of the fy2009 ndaa which would permit the use of approp riated funds over multiples years would also facilitate section 1206 training by us military personnel the question of whether state department leadership on foreign policy is challenged by dod section 1206 authority remains open for some analysts according to december 2007 report by the center for strategic and international studies csis the decision to provide the department 200 2006 sfrc report op cit p 3 201 rather it

department played the lead role in negotiating the umbrella agreements between the united states and former soviet states that were needed before the united states could fund programs in these states further after passage of the freedom support act in 1992 pl 102 511 the state department coordinator for assistance to the former soviet union was supposed to help coordinate planning for ctr projects across the several agencies for several years deputies committee consisting of participants from dod doe the state department and the national security council nsc met periodically sometimes as often as once month to discuss priorities for us threat reduction assistance to identify possible projects that might receive funding from the program and to coordinate efforts by the agencies to support these programs the frequency of these meetings declined however by the middle of the decade as the process became more routine and many ongoing projects were wellestablished within the budget process 214 the organizational structure and funding profile for us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance changed in fy1996 when financial and administrative responsibility for some of the programs and projects moved to doe and the state department specifically the state department took over responsibility for the science and technology centers in moscow and kiev which provided research grants to former soviet scientists and engineers in an effort to keep them from selling their knowledge to other nations doe took over responsibility for the materials protection control and accounting mpca program which was developing projects to improve accounting and security at research facilities that housed nuclear materials this division of labor allowed each agency to take responsibility for those programs that best reflected its expertise dod maintained control of programs that sought to secure and eliminate weapons doe took control of those that sought to secure nuclear materials that were not in weapons and state took over those that worked directly with nuclear specialists in the fsu dod and doe both supported this change in funding and administration for dod the change reduced tensions in both congress and dod about the use of dod funds for foreign aid or foreign assistance programs leaving dod with responsibility for the core ctr weapons elimination efforts for doe the change allowed the agency to expand the contacts it had established between its own labs and scientists and those in the former soviet union and to move quickly on its priorities without the need to go through cumbersome dod contracting procedures on the other hand some in state and the nsc argued against this division some in the state department questioned whether funding for the sc ience centers would come at the expense of other state department priorities some in the nsc argued that the division would undermine efforts to maintain central control over the priorities and funding the division of programs proved to be financial boon to the whole threat reduction and nonproliferation effort with funding increasing to around 1 billion per year across the three agencies by the end of the decade much of this increase was due to the expansion of does programs both at materials facilities and at storage facilities for nuclear warheads

weak and press accounts reported that nuclear materials from russia were appearing on the black market in western europe consequently many began to view ctr as part of longterm threat redu ction and nonproliferation effort former secretary of defense william perry referred to ctr as defense by other means215 as the program helped eliminate soviet weapons that had threatened the united states and contain weapons and materials that could pose new threats in the hands of other nations in response to this relatively narrow mission the initial nunnlugar legislation was tightly focused on the transport storage and destruction of weapons of mass destruction for example the united states has provided extensive assistance with destruction and dismantlement projects these were designed to help with the elimination of nuclear chemical and other weapons and their delivery vehicles these projects helped russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan remove warheads deactivate missiles and eliminate launch facilities for nuclear weapons covered by the start i treaty chain of custody projects were designed to enhance the safety security and control over nuclear weapons and fissile materials these projects provided russia with bullet proof kevlar blankets secure canisters and safer rail cars to transport warheads from ukraine belarus and kazakhstan to storage and dismantlement facilities in russia the ctr program also funded several projects at storage facilities for nuclear weapons and materials to improve security and accounting systems and to provide storage space at new facility at mayak for plutonium removed from nuclear warheads when they are dismantled demilitarization projects encouraged russia kazakhstan and ukraine to convert military efforts to peaceful purposes the focus of ctr funding has changed over the years much of the work on strategic offensive arms reductions has been completed and the united states has allocated growing proportion of the funding to projects that focus on securing and eliminating chemical and biological weapons and securing storage sites that house nuclear warheads removed from deployed weapons systems the doe programs that seek to improve security and accounting for nuclear materials and some nuclear warheads have also expanded and accelerated further russia has received most of the funding in recent years as the participants have completed most projects in the other nations in recent years the united states has also increased funding for projects that seek to secure borders and track materials in an effort to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists this has included some border security and export control programs funded through the state department this shift in funding has occurred in part because many observers began to view us assistance to the former soviet states as part of the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists in 1996 experts testified to congress that russian nuclear and chemical facilities with their crumbling security and lack of accounting procedures could provide source for terrorists seeking nuclear or chemical materials in response congress expanded the programs that provided security at facilities with nuclear materials and suggested that more attention be paid to security at facilities with materials that could be used in chemical or biological weapons since september 11 2001 virtually all analysts who foll ow us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance have made the link between the possible quest for weapons of mass destruction by terrorists and the potential for thwarting them by helping russia protect its weapons materials 215 see us department of defense cooperative threat reduction april 1995 washington dc p 1

knowledge216 in early 2003 the administration stated that it had expanded the strategic focus of the ctr program to support the war on terrorism217 in its budgets presented from fy2004 through fy2007 it increased funding for several export and border control programs in dod state and doe for the state department programs designed to stem the leaking of knowledge out of the former soviet union and for dod effort to find and recover radiological sourcesa type of military device that could provide terrorists with nuclear materials for use in dirty bomb all of these initiatives focus more on stemming proliferation than on eliminating nuclear weapons in the former soviet states however the bush administration has not completely altered the focus of ctr in february 2005 at summit meeting in bratislava slovakia presidents bush and putin agreed to accelerate some of the efforts to secure sovietera nuclear weapons 218 this agreement has led to increased funding for both dod and doe efforts to secure nuclear warheads g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 many analysts who follow the nonproliferation pr ograms continue to express concerns about the lack of coordination among dod doe and the state department in setting priorities and allocating funding many have suggested that the white house create position of nonproliferation czar so that there would be single individual in the government with the responsibility for setting priorities and coordinating implementation of all threat reduction and nonproliferation programs congress has addressed number of issues over the years as it has reviewed ctr projects and authorized funding for continuing programs some of these have focused on specific programs such as the development of chemical weapons destruction facility at shchuchye russia one of that countrys seven chemical weapons storage sites questions about the goals of this effort and russias contribution to it led congress to withhold funding in fy2000 and to restrict it in other years congress has also addressed questions about the role that ctr plays in advancing us national security objectives some have argued that the united states should increase funding to secure weapons and materials in russia at more rapid pace while others have argued that this funding can actually undermine us security if it frees up funds for russia to add to its defense budget and weapons acquisition efforts there have also been some disputes over the years about whether certain programs should be funded thr ough doe or through dod although those disputes have waned as the two agencies have worked together to share lessons learned and best practices some members of congress particularly in the house have questioned whether funds should be allocated to the ctr program from the dod budget as the programs shift away from efforts to eliminate sovietera nuclear weapons and toward efforts to secure borders and prevent the loss of 216 senator sam nunn has stated that

and knowledge this controversy has been evident in recent years as both the president and the senate have supported efforts to allow the ctr program to allocate portion of its funds to programs outside the former soviet union for example in 2003 the bush administration requested the authorization to spend up to 50 million in ctr funds outside the former soviet union in the fy2004 defense authorization bill the senate offered its unqualified support for this measure the house in contrast argued that these types of programs would be better managed by the state department than the defense department it authorized the transfer of up to 78 million in ctr funds to the state department nonproliferation and disarmament fund for use in threat reduction efforts outside the former soviet union the conference committee in its report on the fy2004 defense authorization bill pl 108136 approved the presidents request however in deference to the house concerns the committee language indicates that this funding should be used only for shortterm projects it also states that the president should determine whether dod is the agency that is most capable of implementing the planned project the conferees stated that they would expect the president to assign the project to the most appropriate agency the united states has exercised the option of spending ctr funding outside the former soviet union only once in mid2004 when dod provided assistance to albania for the imination of chemical weapons but dod has in subsequent years retained the authority to obligate funds outside of the former soviet union httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34639g22g145g142g561g6g142g153g138g155g157g150g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g6g142g143g142g151g156g142g561g20g152

afghanistan and iraq the basic premise for all is the integration of civilian and military organization personnel in order to meet stability objectives in defined region the military in both cases provides protection to civilian officials allowing civilian specialists degree of outreach to the provincial and local governments and local nongovernmental organizations and afghans that otherwise would be impossible civilian employees provide expertise on reconstruction and facilitate political solutions to local problems that the military is less able to do well usrun prts in general and most

on political as well as military role g11g155g138g154g561g18g20g22g156g561 there are currently 14 prts 3 of which are led by other coalition countries and 13 eprts embedded prts in iraq 229 the usled prts are made up of between 35 and 100 members including representatives from the embassy the project contract office army corps of engineers usaid military and other agency staff prts have been colocated on existing us military bases the eprts in which civilian teams are embedded in brigade combat teams are smaller most are concentrated in baghdad or anbar province where significant military action is taking place although the prts appear to focus efforts on expanding us assistance outreach to the provinces and strengthening local government the eprts envision that as us and iraqi military forces secure an area eprt staff will work with local iraqis to further stabilize the area by drawing on all available spigots of us and ir aqi government funding to create jobs and meet other basic needs 230 dods role in the prts therefore is chiefly to provide security and logistical support dod however was originally reluctant to divert the necessary manpower from other responsibilities prts in iraq were authorized by cable 4045 october 2005 issued jointly by the us embassyiraq and by the usled military coalition multinational force in iraq mnfi under which the us embassy was called upon to support the establishment of prts at state department sites and mnf1 was called upon to support them at military sites 231 as the prts were being established the division of responsibilities and obligations between dos and dod were not well defined as result according to the sigir lines of authority and coordination between the us embassy and military components were never spelled out and agreed upon and the operational support mechanisms the prts are dependent upon at military basesie facilities life support communications management services and supplieswere not settled upon 232 dod agreed to provide protection to the prts in memorandum of agreement moa that took effect in february 2007 and finalized operational requirements and responsibilities233 key determinant of prt success in the first year was the presence of brigade commander who supported the prt mission such was the case in mosul according to the sigir whereas in anbar lack of support signaled civilian diffic ulty obtaining transportation and other resources and civilian exclusion from meetings with governme nt officials according to the sigir in some prts there was occasionally difference in views regarding the use of reconstruction assistance 229 there are also four provincial support teams psts much smaller in size than prts and aimed at providing advice to provincial

expressing frustration over prt failure to create employment by funding stateowned enterprises see above the february 2007 moa helped resolve number of coordination concerns but the role of dod in providing assistance has continued to be greater than intended in part because of shortfalls in civilian staffing at the prts until civilians with specialist skills in local governance and agriculture for example could be provided by the department of state over 100 dodsupplied personnel were made available on temporary basis234 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 many refer to the prts in iraq and afghanis tan as model for dodciv ilian cooperation in foreign aid and us government officials and others have pointed to successes in stabilizing some areas as at least in part the result of prt activity nonetheless some have faulted prts for lack of an overarching concept of operations common range of services and unified chain of command and for failing at times to coordinate with each other and exchange information on best practices in addition it appears that dod maintains preponderant weight in prt decision making as the sole supplier of security which allows civilians to undertake project site visits and meetings with local leaders and as significant supplier of assistance through the wellfunded cerp program the interagency assessment found that in afghanistan subordination of prts to combat units threatened to dilute core focu s of the prtto strengthen the government of afghanistans capacity to address issues underlying instability and support for the insurgency in iraq according to the sigir there are reports that cerp use undermines civilian efforts to strengthen local government absent clear set of objectives and performance measures fashioned for each individual prt as the sigir has repeatedly proposed the coordinated efforts of disparate agencies composing the prts in iraq are likely to be dependent on the personalities of team members and the level of teamwork they are able to cobble together 234 pentagon agrees to help fill state department s iraq reconstruc tion jobs on temporary basis new york times february 20 2007

authorities granted by congress dod plays the lead us government role in providing training assistance to iraqi and afghan security forces including police and other civilian forces as well as military forces both the extent of dods role and funding appr opriated for these purposes have grown over time congress has also provided dod with several categories of funding and authorities to allow international partners to contribute to the coalition efforts in iraq and afghanistanincluding both providing some partners with resources directly to enable their participation and reimbursing other partners for support provided dod takes the lead in implementing these activities g17g155g146g144g146g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g7g159g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g561 g22g155g138g146g151g561g138g151g141g561g7g154g158g146g153g561 several key foreign security assistance programs including foreign military financing and international military education and training managed by the department of state and implemented by dod provided some forms of train and equip assistance to foreign partners the driving reasons for assigning dod the lead role in training and equipping iraqi and afghan security forces were apparently the sheer size and scope of the tasks at hand the presence of capable if not specialized dod personnel onsite and the urgency that left time to deliberately develop capabilities in other us government agencies dod did not seek expanded train and equip authority until the administration judged that other approaches were not working 236 the legislation authorizing dod to provide train and equip support and appropriating funds for that purpose is both specific and limited the legislation is enacted on an annual basis and it refers strictly to iraq and afghanistan specific requests for resources and authorities were initiated by the executive branch based on input from practitioners in the field the legislation requires the concurrence of the secretary of state237 that language is generally understood by staff at both agencies to mean that initiatives cannot proceed without state 235 prepared by catherine marie dale specialist in interna tional security this appendix remains the same as in the original edition of this report information is current as of august 25 2008 236 similar dynamic characterizes the development of the cerp discussed in separate section proposed by the military command in iraq only after the magnitude of requirements on the ground and inability of civilian us government agencies to address them in timely fashion became apparent 237 see fy2004 emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 108106 section 1107 and subsequent legislation

approval coordination mechanisms fo r seeking that approvalfrom the secretary or her designated representativeare reportedly in place and actively utilized238 initially train and equip authority was granted for support to the new iraqi army and the afghan national army239 subsequent legislation expanded the focus to include the military and security forces of iraq and afghanistan which could include police and other civilian services240 the scope of the assistance initially included assistance including equipment supplies services training and funding241 later the scope was broadened to also include facility and infrastructure repair renovation and construction242 funds appropriated for train and equip missions in iraq and afghanistan have grown substantially over time from 150 million in the fy2004 emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 108106 of november 6 2003 to 97 billion 59 billion for afghanistan and 38 billion for iraq in the fy2007 us troop readiness recovery

military command in iraq during the formal occupation the combined joint task force7 cjtf7 reported to its own higher headquarters us central command centcom but served in direct support to cpa the scope of the challenge has been extensive because none of iraqs prewar security forces or structures were left intact or available for duty after major combat operations ceased iraq prewar planning erroneously assumed that at the end of major combat iraqi police would be available as needed to help provide security for the iraqi people 243 instead in the immediate aftermath of major combat coalition forces found that civilian law enforcement bodies had disappeared meanwhile us military prewar planning had also assumed that iraqi military units would be available for recall and reassignment after the war as needed military plans counted on the capitulation of iraqi forces and included options for using some of those forces to guard borders or perform other tasks244 instead on may 23 2003 the cpa issued order number 2 dissolving all iraqi military services including the army that decision foreclosed the option of unit recall to 238 interviews with state department

who reported to th cpa administrator he was supported by skeleton staff in baghdad and by resources from the state departments bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs inl that arrangement quickly proved insufficient to the task at hand in early september 2003 at the recommendation of military commanders and with strong support from dod cpa launched the iraqi civil defense corps icdc security and emergency service agency for iraq for which the cpa administrator delegated responsibility to the senior military commander on the ground 247 the icdc was essentially military initiative designed to leverage the coalitions most copious resource the boots on the ground of cjtf7to recruit and train iraqi units to temporarily fill the security vacuum by early 2004 it was apparent to senior us civilian and military leaders on the ground in iraq that the sheer magnitude of the task demanded significantly greater resources moreover under the system of divided responsibilities there was lack of consistency across iraq in the creation of each force and in strategiclevel coordination among the forces accordingly on may 11 2004 president bush issued national security presidential directive nspd 36 which among other matters assigned the mission of organizing training and equipping all iraqi security forces isf to centcom 248 this mission included both

categories of funding and authorities in order to enable international partners to contribute in various ways to the coalition efforts in iraq and afghanistan the primary impetus for seeking these authorities has been military exigency to support coalition operations the need for the unique access that some states by virtue of geography can provide the desire for additional troop strength to support the efforts in iraq and afghanistan and the need for some unique capabilities such as language skills and cultural familiarity and other niche capabilities such as estonias specialization in explosive ordnance disposal some observers stress that policy imperativeto build coalition forces with as many participants as possible in order to shore up the legitimacy of coalition effortshas also played key role 258 this section addresses two categories commonly known as coalition support and lift and sustain coalition support provides funds to dod to reimburse international partners for their support lift and sustain allows dod to provide resources to international partners without which they would be unable to participate in the coalition effort the legislation supporting these efforts is enacted annually since late 2003 coalition support legislation has required the concurrence of the secretary of state259 as it is for train and equip this requirement is understood to mean formal agreement and interagency mechanisms are in place to support coordination260 lift and sustain legislation does not include such requirement substantively the earliest coalition support legisl ation designated as recipients only pakistan and jordan but more recent legislation has added and other key cooperating nations261 all of the legislation provides for reimbursing those states for logistical and military support to us 257 the mandate of the combined security transition commandafghanistan is to plan program and implement structural organizational institutional and management reforms of the

operations262 the lift and sustain legislation allows dod to provide supplies services transportation including airlift and sealift and other logistical support to coalition forces supporting military and stability operations in iraq263 congress has appropriated over 1 billion annually for coalition support efforts264 congress supports lift and sustain in turn by providing that dod may use funds available for operation and maintenance for lift and sustain efforts265 in practice coalition support has directly supported major border operations by the government of pakistan along the pakistanafghanistan border as well as jordanian efforts along the jordaniraq border266 the assistance has also reportedly supported some states in the region that do not wish their involvement in the coalition efforts to be known lift and sustain in turn has allowed poland to bring its forces to iraq sustain them throughout their deployment and lead the multinational division center south267 lift and sustain has also supported georgias deployment to iraq of full brigade of 2000 soldiers who are currently manning checkpoints between kut and the iraqiran border g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 dods role in coalition partner assistance in iraq and afghanistan has been relatively uncontroversial it is possible that dods coordina tion role with international partners in these cases could set precedents for future security partnerships more broadly it may be more likely however that dods coalition partner assistance role in these two cases will serve as precedent only for possible future coalition military operationsnot for the routine conduct of security assistance or security cooperation dods role in train and equip assistance in iraq and afghanistan has sparked much more debatewithin dod among us government agencies and in the broader policy community most observers expect that in the future us efforts to help build the capacity and improve the capabilities of the security forces of various partner states are likely to grow even if nation buildingstyle missions on the scale of iraq are not very likely 268 there is much less agreement among agencies and observers about who oug ht to bear what share of the burden some argue that the department of state and in particular inl should be much better resourced in terms of personnel and funding to meet possible future demands current resources simply do 262 see emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 2003 pl 10811 section 1310 and subsequent legislation 263 see fy2004 emergency

to tackle training missions on the scale of the recent iraq or afghanistan experiences building up greater capacity in the state department would allow it to assume greater share of the responsibility in similar future contingency others argue that dod needs to increase its own training capaci tyeven if dod w ill remain in supporting role for future training missions secretary of defense robert gates identified the standing up and mentoring of indigenous army and police as key mission for the military as whole269 some dod officials and outside defense expe rts have argued that the training mission is so important that dod should establish and maintain dedicated training units to capitalize on recent operational experiences270 these two approaches ie increasing training capacity at the department of state and at dod are not mutually exclusive both might be considered appropriate by analysts who expect larger overall future requirement for us train and equip assistance
