either program two bills passed by the house but not considered by the senate would expand the list of federal payments subject to c ontinuous levy under the fplp in february 2008 the house passed hr 4848 one of its provisions would direct the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to participate in the fplp it would also require cms to take all necessary steps to ensure that all payments to health care providers under medicare parts and b are processed through the program by the end of september 2011 the fms and intern revenue service would be required to provide all needed assistance to enable cms to meet that deadline in addition in late june 2008 the hous passed measure hr 6275 to raise the exemption amounts for individual taxp ayers under the alternative minimum tax in 2008

levy programs the financial management service fms is bureau within the treasury department that serves four main purposes it offers payment services to other federal agencies operates the federal governments systems for collecting and depositing funds provides g overnmentwide accounting nd reporting services and manages the collection of linquent debt owed to va riety of state and federal government agencies in managing the collection of this debt the fms relies on two programs it operates with assistance from several federal agencies one is known as the treasury offset program top which is designed to collect various delinquent nontax debts including overdue child support payments by offsetting certain federal payments disbursed by fms to individuals holding th debt the second program the federal payment levy program fplp employs procedure known as continuous levy to collect overdue federal taxes from taxpayers who receive certain federal payments also disbursed by the fms this report briefly describes the origins and current status of both programs and discusses legislation bein g considered in the 110th congress to expand their scope it will be updated to reflect recent velopments affectin g either program origins and current status of the federal payment levy program the fplp grew out of provision of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 tra97 pl 10534 which became section 6331h of the internal revenue code irc in establishing the legal foundation for th program congress was hoping to improve the collection of delinquent taxes irc section 6331h promotes this aim in two ways first it allows the internal revenue service irs to share with the fms the confidential tax information needed to t up and operate tinuous levy program second irc section 6331h gives the irs the exclusive authority to activate continuous levy on taxpayer s with overdue tax debt1 since july 2000 the fms andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34660crs2 1 continued payments the other provision changed the levy so that it could reduce eligible federal payments to taxpayer by as much as 15 2 us general accounting office tax administration irs levy of federal payments could generate millions of dollars ggd0065 washington april 2000 p 3 3 provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 raised the share of payments to federal contractors that can be levied from 15 to 100 4 in an effort to avoid imposing levy on taxpayers who are not subject to one or levying payments for more than taxpayer owes the irs updates the tax files in the fms database once week except when maintenance work is being done on irss master tax fileirs have jointly managed the fplp befo re the passage of tra97 the irs lacked the authority to create an automated proce ss for identifying taxpayers with delinquent tax debt who receive federal payments and levying those payments2 the fplp facilitates the collection of overdue federal taxes by imposing continuous levy on designated federal paym ents disbursed by the fms to business and individual taxpayers holding delinquent tax debt such levy remains in effect until the overdue federal taxes are paid in full current tax law allows the following payments to be levied or reduced federal employee retirement annuities federal payments to federal contractors federal employee travel dvances or reimbursements certain social security benefits and some federal salaries except for payments to federal contractors the fms is authorized to reduce those payments up to 15 to satisfy delinquent ta x debt by contrast payments to federal contractors can be reduced by 100 or th amount of the overdue tax whichever is lower3 critical component of both the fplp and top is database of individuals and companies with delinquent fe deral and state tax and nonta x debts that is maintained by the fms federal and state agencies that collect debts on behalf of other agencies or are owed debts provide and update the information st ored in this database the process of initiating continuous levy mimics the process of initiating an offset through the top to begin the levy process the irs sends an electronic file containing tax debt information to the fms which adds it to the top database4 the fms then searches for matches between the names and taxpayer identification numbers tins in its data base on pending fede ral payments and the names and tins in its database on linquent tax accounts if matc h is found the fms notifies the irs which in turn notifies the taxpayer in question of its intent to levy certain federal payments to that individual or company until the tax debt is paid in full if 30 days pass with reply from the taxpayer the irs authorizes the fms to levy all eligible federal payments to that individual or company the levy remains in effect until the tax debt is paid in full or until the taxpayer makes other arrangements with the irshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34660crs3 5 based on data obtained from lisa laparan of the irs in an email sent on june 9 2008 6 financial management service office of legislative and public affairs fact sheet us department of the treasury delinquent debt collection fiscal year 2007 available at httpwwwfmstreasgovnewsindexto pay off the debt whenever payment is levied the fms sends letter to the taxpayer explaining which payment was re duced and by how much and advising the taxpayer to contact the irs to resolve the matter some federal tax debt cannot be collected through the fplp as matter of law or policy more specifically the agency cannot levy the assets of individuals who have filed for bankruptcy have applied for tax relief as an innocent or injured spouse have made alternative payment arrangem ents with the irs eg an offerin compromise or are suffering from certain hardships eg residing in federally declared disaster area to recover overdue taxes in january 2007 the irs withheld 57 of the individual and business tax debt in its master file database from collection through the fplp down from share of 60 in january 20065 the irs activated for continuous levy 63 billion in delinquent tax accounts in fy2007 up from 53 billion in fy2006 but activating such an account for levy does not necessarily mean the overdue tax will be collected immediately there is typically huge gap between the total va lue of tax accounts subjected to the levy process and the total amount of delinquent taxes collected through that process in the same year collection of overdue taxes through th fplp totaled 345 million in fy2007 up from 303 million in fy2006 and 89 million in fy20036 origins and current status of the treasury offset program the top arose from several provisions of the debt collection improvement act of 1996 which authorized the treasury depa rtment to establish mechanism for withholding or reducing certa in federal payments to pa off delinquent federal and state nontax debt held by individuals th internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 enlarged the scope of the top when it authorized the collection of state tax debt through the offset of federal income tax refunds under the current program the fms offs ets or lowers variety of federal payments to satisfy an individuals linquent federal nonta x debt child support obligations or state income tax debt to be eligible for offset the debt must be delinquent for minimum of 180 days the agency began offsetting payments to collect overdue federal nonta x debt in january 1999 and ove rdue state income taxes in january 2000 irc section 6402e and re levant state statutes allow the fms to undertake this effort at the present 39 states and the district of columbia participate in the offset process the following federal payments can be continuously offsethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34660crs4 7 in its latest baseline forecast for the fe deral budget the congressional budget office estimated that the budget will have deficit of 357 billion in fy2008 and cumulative deficit of 339 billion from fy2009 through fy2013 see congressional budget office an analysis of the presidents b udgetary proposals for fiscal year 2009 washington march 2008 table 11 p 2 the federal tax gap is the difference between the amount taxpayers should have paid and the amount they actually paid on timely basis there are two measures of this gap the gross tax gap and the net tax gap the latter reflects the amount of unpaid taxes in given year eventually collected by the irs through enforcement activities according to the latest estimate by the irs the gross tax gap was 345 billion continuedretirement payments from the ffice of personnel management irs tax refunds up to 100 some vendor payments up to 100 federal employee travel payments some federal salary paym ents up to 15 and social security benefit payments see below social security benefit paym ents began to be offset in may 2001 the amount of the offset is the lesser of an individuals tota l debt 15 of his or her monthly benefit payment or the amount by which the monthly payment exceeds 750 the fms offsets these payments on the ba sis of data on elig ible delinquent debt it receives from federal and state agencies that either collect debt on behalf of other government agencies or are owed debts before the fms issues payment eligible for offset it compares the information in its database on payment recipients with the information in its database on delinquent debt if there is match between the name and tin of recipient and the name and tin of debtor the payment is offset to the extent allowed by law before federal agency refers debt to the fms for collection through the top it sends the responsible individual thr ee letters over period of few months informing him or her of its intent to offset future payments until the debt is paid in full the final two letters are sent 60 days and 30 days before the initial offset is to take place each letter provides the name of the agency receiving the offset payment along with the name and telephone number of an agency employee who can answer any questions about the overdue debt the fms also sends offset notices with the same information to the debtor 60 days and 30 days before the initial offset debt collections through the top totaled 36 billion in fy2007 and 308 billion from the programs inception in fy1999 through fy2007 legislation in the 110th congress to modify the scope of top and fplp spurred by heightened concern over the si ze of the federal budg et deficit and the federal tax gap the 110th congress is considering veral proposals that would expand the scope of the fplp7 none would affect the operation of the tophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34660crs5 7 continued and the net tax gap 290 billion in 2001

gao07587t washington mar 20 2007 p 5 10 ibid p 5at the center of congressi onal debate on the issue is the medicare provider accountability act which has been introdu ced in the house hr 4287 and the senate s 1307 the act would require the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to make its payments to health care providers and vendors under medicare parts and b available for scr eening for delinquent tax debt under the fplp over two years 50 of payments would be screened the first year and 100 of payments the following year8 in addition the proposal would subject these cms payments to screening under top in bi d to recover more nontax debt such as unpaid child s upport and student loans finally it would implement recommendation by an interagency federal ta sk force the federal contractor tax compliance task force or fctc to sp eed up the process for recovering unpaid taxes through the fplp under current law the irs has to send four tax bills and special levy notice to taxpayer before the agency can impose levy on any property held by that individual or company hr 4287s 1307 would streamline the process by enabling the irs to initiate levy of eligible federal payments to tax debtor after what is known as notice and demand fo r payment has been sent but before any levy notice and appeal proceedings have begun congressional interest in the systematic offset of medicare payments to providers under parts and b has grown in response to report issued by the government accountability office gao at hearing held by the senate homeland security and governmental affairs permanent subcommittee on investigations on march 20 20 07 the report found that the cms had mechanism to prevent physicians health professionals and suppliers who have tax debts from enrolling in or receiving payments from medicare9 though the fplp had been in operation since 1997 the cms had not participated in it or an interagency task force formed to improve the programs eff ectiveness in the view of gao researchers this lack of involvement has entailed significant loss of federal revenue over time in their estimate if cms payments to healthcare providers and vendors for part b alone had been subject to levy through the fplp th federal government might have collected between 50 million and 140 million in delinquent taxes in the first nine months of 200510 as of september 30 2005 according to the report more than 21000 physicians health care providers and suppliers who received medicare part b payments owed over 1 billion in unpaid federal income payroll excisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34660crs6 11 gao researchers say th at these taxpayers probably owed more in unpaid federal taxes on that date but it cannot be determined how much more the irs tax database used to derive the estimate of over 1 billion does not account fo r taxes owed by firms and individuals that have not filed tax returns or that failed to report all their income see ibid pp 910 12 government accountability office medicaid thousands of medicaid providers abuse the federal tax system gao0817 washington nov 2007 p 8 13 the fctc was established in 2004 to address some of the key tax compliance issues continuedunemployment and other taxes11 most of these taxpayers were organized for tax purposes as either sole proprietors or limited liability companies the house passed bill hr 4848 in february 2008 that included provision directing cms to participate in the fplp under the provision which would amend title xvii of the social security act the cms would be required to do whatever is necessary to ensure that at least 50 of payments under parts and b are processed through the program within one year after th passage of the act at least 75 of such payments are processed through the program within two years and all such payments are processed through the program by september 30 2011 in addition the bill would require the fms and irs to assist the cms in meeting those deadlines what is more in late june 2008 th house passed measure hr 6275 to raise the exemption amounts for individual taxpayers unde r the alternative minimum tax in 2008 among the offsets included in the bill is proposed amendment of irc section 6331h2 that would allow the irs to apply continuous levy to federal payments to vendors that sell or rent pr operty as opposed to goods and services to the federal government and are delinquent in the paymen t of their federal taxes in its budget request for fy2009 the bu sh administration expressed support for using the fplp to screen cms pa yments to vendors and providers under medicare parts and b for ove rdue federal and state taxes the administration also proposed eliminating the current 10year limitation on the collection of delinquent federal nontax debt throug h administrative offset in related development the senate homeland security and governmental affairs permanent subcommittee on investiga tions held hearing in november 2007 on the delinquent federal ta xes owed by healthcare providers receiving payments under medicaid and the possibility of collec ting those taxes through the fplp the hearing was the fifth in series exploring federal contractors w ith federal tax debts it was intended to discuss the main findings of 2007 report by the gao that focused on medicaid providers accordin g to the study more than 30000 medicaid providers from seven states owed total of over 1 billion in overdue federal taxes in fy200612 significant barrier to subjecting federal medicaid payments to the fplp has been their legal status in consultation with the irs office of chief counsel the federal contractor tax compliance task force fctc has concluded that such payments do not qualify as federal pa yments under irc section 6331h2a and thus cannot be continuously levied to collect delinque nt federal taxes13 insteadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34660crs7 13 continued raised in 2004 report by the government accountability office on the unpaid tax liabilities of defense contractors central objective of the task force is to improve the operation of the fplp the task force is composed of re presentatives from the department of defense irs fms defense finance and accounting service cms general services administration office of management nd budget and department of justice 14 see testimony of linda stiff then the actin g irs commissioner at hearing held by the senate homeland security and governmental affairs permanent subcommittee on investigations on nov 14 2007according to these officials federal paymen ts to state medicaid agencies are more in the nature of state entitlement than federal payment includable in the fplp14 in reaching this conclusion the task force took into consideration the actual flow of medicaid funds the relationship between the federal agency that disburses the funds cms and the state agencies receiving them and the legal responsibility of cms and the state medicaid agencies in the case of failure to pay providers for their services companion bills introduced in the h ouse hr 5764 and the senate s 2843 would remove this barrier by authorizing the irs to subject any federal payment to any medicaid provider or supplier under state plan under title xix of the social security act to continuous levy under the fplp in order to pa delinquent federal taxes the bills do not specify that pa rticular method be used for implementing such levy nor do they provide funds to cover the cost of doing so
