this report is divided into four sections in questionandanswer format trade concepts us trade performance formulation of us trade policy and trade and investment issues additional suggested readings are provided in an appendix the first section on trade concepts deals with why countries trade the consequences of trade expansion and the relationship between globalization and trade key questions address the benefits of specialization in production and trade efforts by governments to influence countrys comparative advantage how trade expansion can be costly and disruptive to workers in particular industries and skill categories and some unique characteristics of trade between developed countries the second section on trade performance focuses on the us trade deficit and its impact on industries several questions address the causes of trade deficits the role of foreign trade barriers and how the trade deficit can be reduced in terms of business impacts the questions focus on which us industries appear to be the most and least competitive and on the relative size of the manufacturing sector the third section deals with the roles played by the executive branch congress the private sector and the judiciary in the formulation of us trade policy information on how trade policy functions are organized in congress and the executive branch as well as the respective roles of individual members and the president is provided the formal and informal roles of the private sector and the involvement of the judiciary are also covered the fourth section on us trade and investment policy asks questions related to trade negotiations and agreements and to imports exports and investments the justification types and consequences of trade liberalization agreements along with the role of the world trade organization are treated in this section the costs and benefits of imports exports and investments are also discussed including how the government deals with disruption and injury to workers and companies caused by imports and its efforts to both restrict and promote exports the motivations and consequences of foreign direct investment flows are also discussed this

because it is mutually enriching it has positive economic effect like that caused by technological change whereby economic efficiency is increased allowing greater output from the same amount of scarce productive resources by allowing each participant to specialize in producing what it is more efficient at and trading for what it is less efficient at trade can increase economic wellbeing above what would be possible without trade there is broad consensus among economists that trade expansion has favorable effect on overall economic wellbeing but the gains will not necessarily be distributed equitably moreover although most economists hold that the benefits to the overall economy exceed the costs incurred by workers who lose their jobs some economists argue that the benefits are often overestimated and the costs are often underestimated 2 what is comparative advantage the idea of comparative advantage was developed by david ricardo early in the 19 th century and its insight remains relevant today ricardo argued that specialization and trade are mutually beneficial even if country finds it is more efficient at producing everything than its trading partners if one country produces given good at lower resource cost than another country it has an absolute advantage in its production the other country of course has an absolute disadvantage in its production if all productive resources were highly mobile between countries absolute advantage would be the criterion governing what country produces and the pattern of any trade between countries but ricardo demonstrated that because resources particularly labor and the skills and knowledge it embodies are highly immobile comparison of goods absolute cost of production in each country is not relevant for determining whether specialization and trade should occur rather the critical comparison within each country is the opportunity cost of producing any good how much output of good must be forgone to produce one more unit of good x if the opportunity costs of producing x and are different in each economy then each country has comparative advantage in the production of one of the goods in this circumstance ricardo predicts that each country can realize gains from trade by specializing in producing what it does relatively well and in which it has comparative advantage and trading for what it does relatively less well and in which it has comparative disadvantage 3 what determines comparative advantage most often differences in comparative advantage between countries occur because of differences in the relative abundance of the factors of production land labor physical capital plant and equipment human capital skills and knowledge including entrepreneurial talent and technology standard economic theory predicts that comparative advantage will be in activities that make intensive use of the countrys relatively abundant factors of production for example the united states has relative abundance of highskilled labor and relative scarcity of low 1 this section was prepared by craig k elwell specialist in macroeconomics government and finance division crs

will be in goods produced using highskilled labor intensively such as aircraft and comparative disadvantage will be in goods produced using lowskilled labor intensively such as apparel in addition to differences in factor endowments differences in productive technology among countries create differences in relative efficiency and may be basis for comparative advantage nevertheless some high skilled services jobs such as computer programming and graphic design can today be easily done in country such as india because of the revolution in telecommunications 4 can governments shape or distort comparative advantage government actions to influence comparative advantage can be grouped in two broad categories policies that indirectly nurture comparative advantage most often by compensating for some form of market failure but not targeted at any specific industry or activity and policies that aim to directly create and nurture comparative advantage in particular industries indirect influence on comparative advantage can emanate from government policies that eliminate corruption enforce property rights remove unnecessary impediments to market transactions assure macroeconomic stability build transport and communication infrastructure support mass education and assist technological advance policies that try to exert direct influence on comparative advantage may include infant industry policies industrial policies or strategic trade policies they all have the essential goal of identifying and nurturing particular industries that are thought to have extraordinary economic potential in this view realizing that potential requires initial government support including protection from foreign competition the efficacy of direct government efforts to shape comparative advantage is likely to vary significantly according to stages of economic development china and india for example have used industrial policies to restructure their economies and enable them better to take advantage of world markets 5 what is the terms of trade nations terms of trade the ratio of an index of export prices to an index of import pricesis measure of the export cost of acquiring desired imports increases and decreases in its terms of trade indicate whether nations gains from trade are rising or falling sustained improvement in the terms of trade expands what our income will buy on the world market and can make significant contribution to the longterm growth of economic welfare similarly falling terms of trade raises the export cost of acquiring imports which reduces real income and the domestic living standard although trade is considered process of mutual benefit each trading partners share of those benefits can change over time and movement of the terms of trade is an indicator of that changing share 6 what are the costs of trade expansion like technological change and other market forces international trade creates wealth by inducing reallocation of the economys scarce resources capital and labor into relatively more efficient exporting industries that have comparative advantage and away from less efficient activities that have comparative disadvantage this reallocation of economic resources is often characterized as process of creative destruction generating net economic gain to the overall economy but also being disruptive and costly to workers in adversely affected industries that compete with imports many of these displaced workers bear significant adjustment costs and many may find work only at lower wage although economic an alysis almost always indicates that the economywide gains from trade exceed the costs the perennially tough policy issue is how or whether to secure those gains for the wider co mmunity while dealing equitably with those who

facilitating the adjustment and compensating for the losses of those harmed by market forces including trade is economically less costly than policies to protect workers and industries from the negative impacts of trade while it is debatable how well existing worker assistance policies have worked funding is also longstanding issue the peterson institute for international economics for example estimates the lifetime costs of worker displacement to be roughly 50 billion year but calculates that the united states spends about 2 billion per year to address the costs connected to displacement 7 does trade destroy jobs trade creates and destroys jobs in the economy just as other market forces do economywide trade creates jobs in industries that have growing comparative advantage and destroys jobs in industries that have growing comparative disadvantage in the process the economys composition of employment changes but there may not be net loss of jobs due to trade consider that over the course of the last economic expansion from 1992 to 2000 us imports increased nearly 240 but total employment grew by 22 million jobs and the unemployment rate fell from 75 to 40 the lowest unemployment rate in more than 30 years 8 does trade reduce the wages of us workers international trade can have strong effects good and bad on the wages of american workers concurrent with the large expansion of trade over the past 25 years real wages ie inflation adjusted wages of american workers grew more slowly than in the earlier postwar period and inequality of wages between the skilled and less skilled worker rose sharply trade based on comparative advantage tends to increase the return to the abundant factors of productioncapital and highskilled workers in the united statesand decrease the return to the lessabundant factorlowskilled labor in the united states 2 therefore it is reasonable to expect that other factors constant the large increase in trade over this period particularly increased trade with economies with vast supplies of lowskilled labor could harm the wages of lowskilled us workers however other economic factors such as technological change and the shifting structure of production among emerging economies may have mitigated the potential adverse effect of trade on wages while there may be strong evidence that expanding trade has depressed the average wages of us workers some evidence suggests that increased trade may have caused 10 to 20 of the increase in wage inequality 3 many observers believe the larger share of increased inequality of us wages was likely caused by advancing technologys tendency to pull up the wages of highskilled workers and increased immigrations tendency to push down the wages of lowskilled workers 9 what is intraindustry trade sizable portion of world trade sees countries exporting and importing to each other goods from the same industry this phenomenon is called intraindustry trade this type of trade is particularly characteristic of the large flows of products between advanced economies which have very similar resource endowments this sugge sts that there is another basis for trade than

of economies of scale economies of scale exist when production process is more efficient ie has lower unit cost the larger the scale at which it takes place this scale economy becomes basis for trade because while the united states and germany for example could be equally proficient at producing any of wide array of goods such as automobiles and pharmaceuticals that consumers want neither has the productive capacity to produce the full range of goods at the optimal scale therefore pattern of specialization tends to occur with countries producing and trading some subset of these goods at the optimal scale 10 why is intraindustry trade important significant attribute of intraindustry trade is that it tends not to generate the strong effects on the distribution of income that can occur with trade based on comparative advantage this attribute may explain why the large trade expa nsion that took place in the 19501980 period was less politically contentious than has been true for trade expansion since 1980 the earlier period was dominated by rising trade between adva nced economies with similar endowments of productive resources and similar levels of technology therefore trade at that time was largely an expansion of intraindustry trade that had rela tively abundant factor of production to exploit as consequence it had little adverse affect on the return to the factors of production including the wages of us workers in contrast much larger portion of the trade expansion since 1980 has been with lessdeveloped economies with their relative abundance of lowskilled and priced labora likely source of downward pressure on wages in the developed economies 11 what is globalization globalization has come to represent many things but economic globalization refers specifically to the increasing integration of national economies into world wide trading system globalization involves trade in goods and services and trade in assets ie currency stocks bonds and real property as well as the transfer of technology and the international flows migration of labor since 1950 world trade in merchandise has consistently grown faster then world production in the recent period of 19902005 world trade in merchandise grew at about 60 per year as compared to about 20 for world output 4 as result world exports as percent of world gdp rose from about 12 to about 32 in the united states global integration has advanced quickly with imports as share of gdp rising from about 10 in the 1950s to about 17 today more recent but far more dramatic has been the growth of international trade in assets in the 1990s gross capital flows leaped by 300 as compared to 63 advance of trade in goods the rising economic integration of the world economy has been facilitated by two types of events the myriad of technical advances in tr ansport and communication that have reduced the natural barriers of time and space that separate national economies and national and multi national policy actions that have steadily lowered various manmade barriers ie tariffs quotas subsidies and capital controls to international exchange 12 what is the global supply chain and how does it relate to globalization supply chain is the interrelated organizations resources and processes that create and deliver product to the final consumer global supply chain organized mostly by multinational corporations mncs means that products that were once produced in one country may now be 4 see international monetary fund world economic outlook june 2006

this supply chain has meant that as much as 30 of the recent growth of wo rld trade has been through trade in intermediate products not only does such geographically fragmented production raise the level of trade associated with particular final product it also tends to raise the level of trade with both developing countries and developed countries this growth of the global supply chain has been facilitated by technological advances that have increased the speed and lowered the cost of international transport and perhaps most importantly accelerated the international flow of information that allows mncs to coordinate geographically fragmented production with relative ease in addition government action has achieved substantial reduction of various manmade trade barriers and promoted movement toward market based economy 13 how does globalization affect job security greater degree of international economic integration can add to disruptive forces in the marketplace including concerns that an estimated 30 to 40 million highwage and highskilled us service sector jobs may now be vulnerable to outsourcing over time although this increased integration is unlikely to have negative effect on overall employment rate or the average worker wage greater volatility of worker incomes and employment is possible effect while the precise causes remain unclear some evidence for the united states indicates steady rise in wage and employment volatility since the 1980s 5 in response to this rise some argue that because increased volatility raises the economic risk attached to

deficit the us trade deficit is the difference between the value of us exports and us imports the deficit on trade in goods merchandise that reached record 836 billion in 2006 is what the media generally calls the trade deficit the united states however usually runs surplus in trade in services with the world by adding net exports of services to the calculation the trade deficit on goods and services was 764 billion in 2006 adding in net transfers of investment income and remittances by individuals to foreign countries gives the broader measure of the trade deficit that is called the current account in 2006 the current account deficit was 857 billion 15 why are different numbers reported for the trade deficit the data on imports and exports are reported in two ways that give similar but different numbers when goods or services pass through us borders the customs service compiles the figures from shipping manifests and other documents and reports it to the us census bureau

the record trade deficits the fundamental cause of the us trade deficit is excess spending by us consumers business and government in essence americans consume more than they produce this allows other countries to sell more to the united states than they buy from the united states economists characterize this as lack of savings by us consumers business and government households buy much on credit businesses invest much with borrowed funds and the government runs budget deficits as long as foreigners both gove rnments and private entities are willing to loan the united states the funds to finance the lack of savings in the us economy the trade deficit can continue the united states however accumulates more and more debt 17 what role do foreign trade barriers play in causing trade deficits trade barriers tend to affect bilateral trade in specific products and with particular countries but they do not necessarily affect the size of the overall us trade deficit for example trade with burma or north korea is nonexistent or small because of usimposed export barriers foreign countries also impose barriers to imports and limit foreign access to their markets by variety of measures some barriers are overt such as high tariffs or import quotas others are less visible such as income tax audits by tax authorities of persons buying foreign automobiles or controls over foreign exchange that prevent citizens wishing to purchase imports from obtaining the foreign currency necessary if for example government requires exporters to sell their dollars to the government at fixed exchange rate and that government invests the dollars in us securities rather than allowing businesses and consumers to use the dollars to buy american exports then this combination of government intervention in currency markets plus exchange controls can increase the size of the us trade deficit foreign trade barriers also can affect the profitability of us exporters and thereby influence the size of the overall us trade deficit if us exporters are able to sell more to country that has

profits hire more american workers and possibly increase the overall us saving rate this can occur only if the economy is operating at less than full employment 18 how does the trade deficit affect the exchange value of the dollar without sufficient inflows of capital trade deficit causes other parts of the economy to adjust particularly the countrys exchange ratefor the united states this is the value of the dollar relative to that of the chinese yuan japanese yen canadian dollar british pound or european euro the way the adjustment mechanism works is that the excess of us imports causes surplus of us dollars to flow abroad if th dollars are then converted to other national currencies their excess supply tends to lower their price exchange rate relative to other currencies and the value of the dollar depreciates this causes imports to be more expensive for american consumers and us exports to be cheaper for foreign buyers this process gradually causes us imports to decrease and exports to increase and for the trade deficit to be diminished the dollar however may not be exchanged for foreign currencies because of its special status in global financial markets and because the us economy is viewed both as safe haven for storing wealth and as an attractive destination for investments in some countries the dollar is used as medium of exchange and in most countries it is used as reserve currency by central banks foreign governments can intervene to keep the value of their currency from appreciating relative to the dollar by buying excess dollars and sending them back to the united states by buying treasury securities or other us assets this is what china has been doing in japans case the government has not intervened since the spring of 2004 to keep the value of the yen low but private japanese investors are causing the same result by investing their savings overseas where interest rates are higher financiers also are borrowing in japan and lending the funds abroad 7 the surplus of dollars therefore may not cause the dollar to depreciate and for the trade deficit to decrease 19 how is the trade deficit financed the us trade deficit is financed by borrowing from abroad this takes the form of net financial inflows into the united states in 2006 us net financial inflows amounted to 719 billion foreigners acquired 1765 billion in assets in the united states while americans acquired 1046 in assets abroad foreigners purchased an additional 29 billion in treasury securities and 621 billion in other securities while increasing their deposits at us banks by 441 billion and acquiring 13 billion in us currency foreigners also invested 184 billion in their companies located in the united states 20 is the trade deficit problem for the us economy the us trade deficit is dual problem for the economy in the long term it generates debt that must be repaid by future generations meanwhile the current generation must pay interest on that debt whether the current borrowing to finance imports is worthwhile for americans depends on whether those funds are used for investment that raises future standards of living or whether they are used for current consumption if american consumers business and government are borrowing to finance new technology equipment or other productivity enhancing products the 7 see nakamae tadashi weak yen

consumer purchases of clothes household electronics or luxury items it pushes the repayment of funds for current consumption on to future generations without investments to raise their ability to finance those repayments in the short term the trade deficit could lead to large and sudden fall in the value of the dollar and financial turmoil both in the united states and abroad the current account deficit now exceeds 6 of gdp and is placing downward pressure on the dollar if foreign investors stop offsetting the deficit by buying dollardenominated assets us interest rates would have to rise to attract more foreign investment rising interest rates can cause havoc in financial markets and also may raise inflationary pressures global financial markets are now so closely intertwined that turmoil in one market can quickly spread to other markets in the world 21 how long can the united states keep running trade deficits us deficits in trade can continue for as long as foreign investors are willing to buy and hold us assets particularly government securities and other financial assets 8 their willingness depends on complicated array of factors including the perception of the united states as safe haven for capital relative rates of return on investments interest rates on us financial assets actions by foreign central banks and the savings and investment decisions of businesses governments and households the policy levers that influence these factors that affect the trade deficit are held by the federal reserve interest rates as well as both congress and the administration government budget deficits and trade policy and their counterpart institutions abroad 22 how can the trade deficit be reduced in reducing the us trade deficit the policy tool kit includes direct measures trade policy that are aimed at imports exports and the exchange rate and indirect measures monetary and fiscal policies aimed at us interest rates saving rates budget deficits and capital flows monetary and fiscal policy however usually address conditions in the us macroeconomy and generally consider the trade deficit only as secondary target it is ironic that the most effective method of reducing the trade deficit is through monetary and fiscal policy yet monetary and fiscal policy is rarely determined by the trade deficit 23 what is the role for trade poli cy in reducing the trade deficit trade policy consists of the strategies goals and initiatives by governments to change the laws regulations and agreements that provide the framework for international trade and to take action to remedy distortions in the movement of goods services and capital flows across national borders us trade policy operates along three paths 1 in opening markets abroad for us exporters 2 in protecting us industries from imports that are unfairly traded sold at prices lower than those in the exporting country or from im port surges that cause or threaten to cause substantial harm and 3 trying to ensure that exchange rates are not manipulated by other nations to hinder the process by which trade is brought into balance or to gain competitive advantage currently us trade policy to open markets abroad is conducted at three levels through bilateral negotiations and tradeinvestment agreements through establishing freetrade agreements and 8 see mann catherine l

proactive role in leveling the playing ground for us business remedial role in correcting distortions in trade caused by foreign government intervention and reactive role in addressing specific problems raised by us businesses the specifics of us trade policy are discussed in the section on us trade and investment policy below trade policy aims at reducing the us trade deficit by increasing us exports or decreasing us imports us trade policy however operates under multiple constraints trade policy for example can affect specific trade flows but the overall trade deficit tends to be determined by macroeconomic conditions savings and invest ment flows the us government moreover faces legal obligations political resistance and other constraints on policy aimed at decreasing imports or increasing exports free market principles and us law for example preclude the government from moving against big box retailers that sell lowcost imports from china us obligations under the world trade organization preclude arbitrary increases in import tariffs or large direct subsidies for us exporters and only under special circumstances usually related to national security or severe offenses to international humanitarian values eg genocide does the united states block trade with specific country eg cuba or burma 24 who are the leading us trade partners as shown in the following

resourcesmining even with reduced employment production by the manufacturing sector as whole continues to rise although production in some sectors has been stagnant or declining what appears to be happening depends on the industry but studies of deindustrialization generally conclude that it is being caused primarily by developments internal to the economy and not by trade these include technological change the shift in consumer demand from manufactured products toward services as incomes rise and the declining relative price of manufactured items import competition has played role in certain industries one study concludes that import competition has contributed less than onefifth to the relative decline of manufacturing in the advanced economies and has had little effect on the

negotiated in the world trade organization wto involve many countries from virtually all regions 45 who benefits from trade liberalizing agreements who loses economic theory suggests and empirical studies have generally concluded that economies as whole benefit when trade barriers are removed because economic resources land labor and capital are employed more efficiently however economic theory and studies also point out that the benefits of trade liberalization are not distributed evenly within an economy and not even among economies some industries firms and workers lose if they cannot adjust to the increased foreign competition resulting from the trade agreement or if particular provisions of the trade agreement disadvantages their interests other industries firms and workers win if they can take advantage of new market opening opportunities presented by the trade agreement or if particular provisions of the trade agreement favors or promotes their interests 46 what is the wto

intellectual property rights trips 47 how are disputes resolved under wto agreements if wto member believes that another member has adopted law regulation or practice that violates wto agreement the member may initiate dispute settlement proceedings under the wto dispute settlement understanding the process begins with consultations and if these fail to resolve the dispute the member may request that the wto establish dispute panel panel report may be appealed to the wto appellate body by either disputing party if the defending member is found to have violated wto obligation the member will be expected to remove the challenged measure if this is not done by the end of the established compliance period the prevailing member may request authorization from the wto to take temporary retaliatory action in most cases retaliation consists of tariff increases on selected products from the defending member to date over 350 complaints have been filed since the wto agreements entered into force with the majority of disputes resolved through consultations and negotiations rather than the panel process

why do countries import goods and services from other countries some goods that are imported into the united states such as bananas or crude oil cannot be produced at home or produced in sufficient quantities to satisfy domestic demand many other goods and services are imported because they can be produced less expensively or more efficiently by other countries 53 what are other benefits of imports consumers can benefit through access to wider variety of goods at lower costs producers can benefit through access to lower priced components or inputs that can be utilized in the production process longer term imports can also provide pressures for companies to reduce costs through innovation and research and development ther eby serving as spur to economic growth 54 what are the costs of imports by providing increased competition to companies producing similar or competing products imports can contribute to job losses and business failures if these job losses and company failures are concentrated in region imports can also be cause of considerable economic distress in community 55 how does the government deal with disruption and injury to producers and workers the government tries to help producers and workers who are adversely affected by trade though application of various trade remedy laws these laws include responses to unfair trade practices and to increased levels of injurious imports as well as the trade adjustment assistance program 56 what are the main trade remedy laws two primary trade remedy laws aimed at unfair trade practices are the antidumping ad and countervailing duty cvd laws other trade remedy laws include section 201 see below section 301 focuses on violations of trade agreements or other foreign practices that are unjustifiable and restrict us commerce and section 337 focuses on unfair practices in import trade such as patent and copyright infringement 57 what is the purpose of the countervailing duty law the purpose of the cvd law is to offset any unfair competitive advantage that foreign manufacturers or exporters might enjoy over us producers as result of receiving subsidy as defined by the wto subsidy is financial contribution such as loan grant or tax credit 18 this section was prepared by vivian c jones and mary jane bolle specialists in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division

on manufacturers or exporters of product countervailing duties if imposed are designed to equal the net amount of the foreign subsidy and are levied upon importation of the subsidized goods into the united states 58 what is the purpose of the antidumping law dumping generally refers to situation where goods are sold in one export market at prices lower than the prices at which comparable goods are sold in the home market of the exporter or in its other export markets it is thought that companies dump products to gain market share or to deter competition us law provides for the assessment and collection of antidumping duties when an administrative determination is made that foreign goods are being dumped or sold at less than fair value in the united states and that such imports are materially injuring us industry 59 what is the import relief safeguards law us trade law chapters 1 and 2 of the trade act of 1974 as amended provides the president with the authority to provide domestic industry with temporary import relief which could include tariffs and quotas if it is found to be seriously injured from surges of imports that do not necessarily involve unfairly traded products this provision is based on the recognition that liberalization of trade barriers could cause i ndividual sectors of the us economy economic adjustment problems and that domestic industries should provide period of relief to allow them to adjust to changed competitive conditions the us international trade commission investigates and recommends on import relief cases and the president takes final action 60 what is the trade adjustment assistance program the first trade adjustment assistance program was adopted as part of the trade expansion act of 1962 in proposing the program the kennedy administration argued that those injured by trade competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact rather the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the federal government because there is an obligation to render assistance to those who suffer as result of national trade policy 19 the current trade adjustment assistance program has three parts part for workers part b for firms and part c for farmers under part certified workers may be eligible for remedial education wage reimbursement job search and relocation allowances and tax credits for health insurance costs under part b firms may be eligible for technical assistance to help them develop strategies to remain competitive in the changing international economy under part c farmers impacted by competing imports may be eligible for cash benefits 20 19 trade adjustment assistance the more we change the more it stays the same by howard rosen in c fred bergsten and the world economy

adjustment assistance taa to all dislocated workers some observers have suggested extending taa to all dislocated workersroughly defined as workers who lose their job involuntarily for reasons not related to job performance21 supporters point to an inequity in eligibility among traderelated job losers many who lose their jobs directly or indirectly to trade are not eligible for benefits under the current taa program these include 1 virtually all service sector job losers 2 certain manufacturing sector job losers depending on the country to which the job is outsourced whether the united states has trade agreement with it and whether or not imports of likeor directly competitive articles are expected to increase 3 some job losers in upstream supply operations and downstream user operations 4 those who lose their jobs to decline in us exports and 5 those who lose their jobs to automation designed to increase exports or improve competitiveness against imports supporters also argue for an expanded and simplified program of eligibility in order to eliminate the difficulties of administering program with such complex set of eligibility criteria opponents question why traderelated job losses should be treated any differently than nontrade related job losses some oppose any adjustment programs because they imply that there is something wrong with the operation of the free market the national association of manufacturers reportedly has warned business enterprises and their employees are continuously affected for better or for worse by all sorts of events beyond their control all experience warns that programs of this type inevitably expand and proliferate 22 others my be concerned with definitions administering such complex program and its fiscal impact

runs and reduce costs companies may also be able to sell goods and services at higher prices than they can obtain at home from the perspective of individual workers jobs in exportoriented industries often provide higher than average wages 63 what are some costs of exporting from an economic perspective that views higher levels of consumption as being the goal of economic activity countries export goods and services in order to earn the foreign currency with which they can buy imports exports according to this view are foregone production that could have been consumed domestically 64 what factors most determine us export levels economists maintain that the overall level of us exports is determined primarily by the same macroeconomic conditions that generate the us trade deficit these include the level of savings 21 rosen op cit p 101 footnote 32 22 rosen op cit p 8081 23 prepared by angeles villarreal analyst in international trade and finance and dick k nanto specialist in

foreigners to invest in us assets us exports also depend on economic growth rates in major markets the higher the rate of economic growth in asia particularly japan and china europe particularly germany the uk and france canada and latin america the more people in those markets are likely to buy us exports other things being equal 65 what factors determine the exporting success of specific sectors the level of american exports in specific sectors depends both on the overall level of exports and on an interplay of factors such as the relative competitiveness of the american industry trade barriers abroad and sometimes the degree of us export promotion the higher the overall level of exports the more individual sectors are likely to sell abroad but given the impact of macroeconomic factors export surges by particular sector often are offset by decline in exports by other sectors in world of floating exchange rates large export surge will cause foreigners to buy more dollars to pay for those exports this raises the demand for dollars and increases its price relative to other currencies since the united states does not intervene in currency markets to fix its exchange rate the higher value of the dollar makes us exports more expensive and may reduce their sales 66 how does the us government promote exports for many years the us government has promoted exports by providing credit finance and insurance programs that are administered by the exportimport bank the department of agriculture and the overseas private investme nt corporation in addition the department of commerce through the foreign commercial service in the international trade administration of the department of commerce acts to promote us exports of goods and services particularly by small and mediumsized companies nearly every country promotes its exports as well 67 what does the us government do to restrict exports congress has authorized the president to control the export of various items for national security foreign policy and economic reasons separate pr ograms and statutes for controlling different types of exports exist for nuclear materials and technology defense articles and services and dualuse goods and technology under each program licenses of various types are required before an export can be undertaken the departments of commerce state and defense administer these programs g11g151g159g142g156g157g150g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g344g346g561 68 what are the main kinds of capital flows generally the two main kinds of capital flows are foreign direct investments and foreign portfolio investments foreign direct investments involve the acquisition of real assets such as real estate manufacturing plant or controlling interest in an ongoing enterprise by person or entity from another country foreign portfolio investments involve purchase of foreign equities or bonds loans to foreign residents or the opening of foreign bank

advantages for the host country while portfolio investments are extremely liquid and can be withdrawn often times at the click of computer mouse in addition there ar official capital flows generated by governments for various purposes such as humanitarian assistance and other foreign aid 69 which is largertrade or capital flows it depends recent data indicate that from 1985 to 2005 global trade in goods and services as measured by exports doubled from 6 trillion year to 12 trillion year during the same twentyyear period capital flows as measured in the balance of payments accounts direct portfolio and other official investments more than quadrupled from 11 trillion year to 52 trillion year but during this time period there also has been an explosion in growth in other types of capital flows known as foreign exchan ge and overthecounter derivatives markets these markets facilitate trade in foreign exchange and other types of assets while the capital flows associated with these markets do not directly relate to transactions in the balance of payments they do affect the international exchange value of the dollar which in turn affects the prices of goods and services and the cost of securities survey in 2004 by the worlds leading central banks indicated that the daily trading of foreign currencies totals more than 19 trillion 70 why do companies invest abroad for the most part firms invest abroad to increase their profits economists and other experts generally conclude however that broad range of factors influence firms decision to invest abroad the major determinants of foreign direct investment are the presence of ownership specific competitive advantages in transnational corporation the presence of locational advantages such as resource endowments or lowco st labor in host country and the presence of superior commercial benefits in an intrafirm relationship as opposed to an armslength relationship between investor and host country multinational firms apparently are motivated by more than single factor and likely invest abro ad not only to gain access to lowcost resource but to improve their efficiency or to improve their market share 71 why has foreign investment increased so dramatically in recent decades from 1990 to 2005 the stock or the cumulative amount of foreign direct investment in the world grew from 18 trillion to 107 trillion or by nearly 600 percent this rapid growth arises from number of factors one of the most important factors has been change in public policies toward foreign direct investment among most countries foreign direct investment has come to be viewed favorably not only by the economically advanced countries but also by developing economies which now often compete to bring in muchneeded capital technology and technical expertise currently about threefourths of all direct inve stment is placed among the highly developed economies where consumer tastes and workers wages are comparable 72 what are some of the benefits of direct foreign investment generally economists argue in favor of unimpeded international flows of capital such as direct investment because they estimate that such flows positively affect both the domestic home and foreign host economies for the home country direct investment benefits the individual firms that invest abroad because they are better able to exploit their existing competitive advantages and to acquire additional skills and advantages direct investment also seems to be associated with strengthened competitive position higher level of skills of the employees and

inward direct investment because the investment adds permanently to the capital stock and often to the skill set of the nation direct investment also brings technological advances since firms that invest abroad generally possess advanced technology processes and other advantages such investment also boosts capital formation and contributes to growth in competitive business environment and productivity in addition direct investment contributes to international trade and integration into the global trading community since most firms that invest abroad are established multinational firms 73 what are some of the costs of direct foreign investment concerned observers argue that us direct investment abroad supplants us exports thereby reducing employment and wages in the us economy while it appears unlikely that the overall us employment level is affected by direct investment flows jobs in particular companies and sectors can be eliminated when company decides to produce similar products abroad for example if us auto company closed an assembly line in the united states and opened one in mexico assembling the same product line us auto assembly jobs are lost similarly while inward flows of foreign direct investment tend to create new jobs there sometimes is concern that the new foreign owners may not serve as stable and dependable community partners as the previous nationallybased ownership 74 what are bits bilateral investment treaties bits are agreements between two countries for the reciprocal encouragement promotion and protection of investments in each
