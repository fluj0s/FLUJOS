epws 2 pene tration to depth of 3 meters captures most effects of epws on buried targets d eeper penetration puts the weapon at greater risk 3 epws cannot penetrate deeply enough to contain nuclear weapon effects fully 4 casualties from nuclear weapon bur st at shallow depth or on the surface are essentially the same 5 detonating nuclear weapon at shallow depth increases the energy transmitted to buried target permitting reduction in yield by factor of 15 to 25 6 attacks using nuclear epws near urban areas could produce thousands to over million casualties or hundreds to several hundred thousand for attacks in rural areas 7 nuclear epw could reduce civilian casualties in an urban area by factor of 2 to 10 compared to surfaceburst weapon with 25 times the yield 8 nuclear weapon would have to detonate within chamber where chemical or biological agents were stored to dest roy the agents the same is true of nonnuclear thermobaric bombs which generate high heat and pressure and 9 in

responsible for the pr ogram stated that if outyear funds were not included in the fy2005 budget nns would have faced two choices that it deemed unsatisfactory 1 by the time the budget for one fiscal year is submitted the budget for the next fiscal year is larg ely fixed without the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could not have been implemented until the second fiscal year 2 alternatively without the placeholder decision to proceed with rnep could have been implemented promptly only by taking the needed funds out of other programs the budget projection reflects cost s that might be expected if rnep were to proceed to phases 63 and 64 the manager emphasized that decision had been made on whether or not to proceed with those phases pending completion of the phase 6262a study9 the rnep study was initially projected to cost 45 million 15 million year for fy2003fy2005 the numbers however have changed for each year for fy2003 delay in submission of dod study required by the fy2003 national defense authorization act pl 107314 s ection 3146 delayed the start of nnsas rnep study so 61 million was spent of the 150 million appropriated for fy2004 congress cut the appropriation to 75 million for fy2005 the request was 276 million and the appr opriation zero vs 150 milli on originally planned and for fy2006 the appropriation was zero for rnep but 40 million for related conventional pene trator study criticisms questions and responses critics reacted to the rnep budget projection and plan presented with the fy2005 request representative tauscher in letter to nnsa administrator linton brooks stated that this is the first notic that we have received of significantly ramped up activity and that the planning and budgeting for further steps in the 6x process in the next five years speaks to clear intent to develop these modified nuclear weapons at time when the feasib ility study has not been completed and the department of defense has not submitted request for this weapon10 steven aftergood of the federation of american scientists argued that there are not fiveyear budgets for every research program that might lead to development he reportedly said if they had placeholders for every f unding scenario theyd have to request an infinite amount of money this is an ex pression of intent to move ahead with an expanded program11 another

same time it denounces any kind of effort by others to do the same12 programmatic questions the following paragraphs present questions from representative tauschers letter responses from administrator brooks13 and additional information base d on discussions with staff from nnsa alamos national laboratory and lawrence livermor national laboratory representative tauscher wrote for fy2005 the budget request describes the rnep activities as including subsystems tests and full system test of the proposed design such activities appear to go beyond research activities and may be interpreted to fall into 63 activities in your view why are such activities consistent with legislation passed by congress last year what specific activities would be associated with the initial year of 63 work on the rnep in fy2007 administrator brooks responded the subsystem and full system tests of the proposed design refer to impact tests to be performed on surrogate penetrator bodies at sandia national laboratories sled track facility these tests are consistent with the definition and requirements for phase 62 feasibility study we need to understand whether the penetrator bodies are survivable to ground penetration in the required geologies before feasibility can be assessed the context of this question is that the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 section 3117 requires speci fic congressional authorization before starting phase 63 or subseque nt phases of rnep nnsa i ndicated that one type of physical test as distinct from computer simulation is planne d as part of the 6262a study series of sled track test s at sandia national laboratories some would be done as full system tests in which the various components of an rnep would be assembled in pe netrator body strong heavy pointed metal case without guidance system or fissile materials14 this assembly would be mounted on sled that is sent down track at hi gh speed and slammed into large concrete block to test how well the components with stand the deceleration required of an earth penetrator weapon this type of test is included in the 6262a study because nnsa deems it essential to assess feasibility in turn successful demonstration of feasibility is necessary condition for the weapon to proceed to phase 63 in preparation for the full system tests number of subsystem sled tests will be conducted in which ca ndidate rnep components are sl ammed into water target these were to have started in the third qua rter of fy2005 and to be held at sandias sled track located at kirtland ai r force base in albuquerque nmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32347crs7 more advanced tests woul d be conducted in phase 63 in one type vibration flyaround tests mockup of the wea pon would be mounted on an aircraft and flown to validate that the weapon would not be damaged by the vibration of the aircraft and to determine th weapons aerodynamic stability in this test the device would not be released another type of test which would occur later in the development process once the guidance system was developed would involve dropping mockup of the w eapon from an aircraft both types of test would use surrogate material heavy metal instead of fissile materials other tests would probably be c onducted as well representative tauscher also asked with regard to the annual performance results and targets what technical military and other criteria would the nns consider and what decisions would be made before it requests legislative authorization to begin 63 work who is involved in the determination to begin 63 work and why does the budget indicate that this might happen in fy 2007 sim ilarly what criteria would the nnsa use to base its decision to go from phase 63 to 64 in fy 2009 administrator brooks replied the national nuclear security admini stration nnsa does not make the decision to proceed to phase 63 or subs equent phases if nnsa and the air force agree that the phase 6262a study results support proceeding to phase 63 engineering development the nuclea r weapons council nwc could consider whether to proceed further if the nwc recommends going forward nnsa would move beyond the study stage only if the president approves and funds are authorized and appropriated by the congress he further stated that the criteria nwc would use in this decision include the feasibility and military utility of the design definition and the projected cost and schedule established in the phase 6262a study and that if rnep does proceed to 63 the president and congress will ma ke separate decision on whether to proceed to phase 64 production engineering to support decision to move rnep to phase 63 nnsa would address cost schedule and feasibility while the air force would address military requirements as hypothetical example nnsa might say that an rnep would have specified cost could be ready by certain date nd would have certain characteristics weight accuracy depth of penetration etc the air force might decide not to proceed if the penetration ability was too low or if nonnuclear alte rnative existed or it might recommend proceeding if the proposed rnep was the only way to accomplish what it considered critical military mission the decision to request congressional approval would be worked through the nuclear weapons counc il and ultimately be made by the president the decision on whether or not to proceed with phase 63 was projected to occur in fy2007 because the phase 6262a study was expected to conclude late in fy2006 with elimination of rnep funds for fy2005 and fy2006 these decisions would be set back th ey would be rendered moot if the administration chooses not to proceed with the program which might be revealed in the fy2007

opinion that the position of the administration is there is specific military requirement for the rnep not for device to counter deeply buried targets but for the rnep is that your position secretary abraham the position of the administration is that we should inquire bout or that we s hould make inquiries and investigate variety of approaches to dealing with the hard d eeply buried target whether or not this approach is feasible is the first questi on and the second is whether or not its preferable to other approaches that would involve conventional weapons and we have not completed the first phase of that inquiry let alone the second19 nnsa has stated that requirement has been used in two senses20 before dod or nnsa start concept study there is perceived need for capability this type of

the management direction for fiscal year 2004 sent to the directors of the weapons design labor atories left little doubt that the objective of the program was to advance the most extreme new nuclear weapon goals irrespective of any reservations expressed by congress the committees priorities are maintaining our nations nuclear deterrent in safe and secure condition and maintaining our nations

projection nnsa recognizing that separate decision would be needed to go beyond the study phase projected cost for the study only ending in fy2007 and reduced the scope of the study from the b83 and b61 to the b83 only as result the cost was much lower 40 million for fy2006 and 140 million for fy200732 as ambassador brooks explained the reason the level is so much less is we have cut back on what it is that we propose to do originally we proposed to examine two different warheads fundamentally what were doing is taking warhead putting very hard case on it controlling its attitude very precisely so that it can penetrate few meters into rock and still stay intact and go off that way the energy goes into the ground weve concluded that we can monstrate whether or not the concept is feasible by looking at only one wa rhead we selected the b83 which is one of the two bombs we were looking at be cause that was where we were when the program was stopped33 further nnsa stated the

reviewed that and at his direct persona l request we have included the money in the budget for this year he did this not because hes particularly interested in developing new weapon but because th ere are adversaries who are building deeply buried facilities and it is unwise for there to be anything thats beyond the reach of us power40 according to press report secretary of defense donald rumsfeld wrote memo in january 2005 to thensecretary of energy spencer abraham that stated i think we should request funds in fy06 and fy07 to complete the rnep study you can count on my support for your effo rts to revitalize the nuclear weapons infrastructure and to complete the rnep study41 there was also suggestion that dods request was crucial to does decision to include rnep in the fy2006 budget ccording to press report the reason the money was put in the budget was the resu lt of direct request from the defense department to finish the study said anson franklin spokesman for the energy

the dod appropriations subcommittee the house armed services committee recommended providing the dod rnep funds as requested but transfe rring the 40 million in nnsa funds to separate program in dod in explaining the transfer the committees report stated based on the applicability of the sled test results to various options for hdbt hard and deeply buried target defeat the committee believes that

colloquy occurred at hearing in february representative terry everett could you please tell directly if theres military need for this for robust earth nuclear earth penetrator secretary of defense donald rumsfeld it is question thats difficult to answer because sometimes they say military requirement and thats formal process there was military requirement for military aircraft for example there was military requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles until they came along and so what i believe there is need for the study which is what were talking about here and not weapon were talking about taking existing weapons and doing study to see if they can be reduced in their power their lethality to level thats lower th an the current weapons are so that they might have the ability to penetrate the eart h in way that could help protect the united states of america i think that it is clearly in our countrys interest to do the study has it speaking to general richard myers chairman joint chiefs of staff you want to comment on whether theres quote military requirement specifically general myers you bet our combatant commander that is charged by this nation to worry about countering the kind of targets deeply buried targets certainly thinks theres need for this study and general cartwright has said such i think that i think the joint chie fs think that and so the study is that its not commitment to go forward with system its just to see if its feasible60 this colloquy occurred at hearing in march representative ellen tauscher i just want to know is there any way an rnep of any size that we would drop will not pr oduce huge amount of radioactive debris nnsa administrator linton br ooks there is not representative tauscher secretary rumsfeld last week confused the debate over the rnep when he told our committee that the rnep study is taking existing weapons and doing study to see if they can be reduced in their power lethality to level that is lower than current weapons my understanding was that the rnep study was not going to change the physicshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32347crs20 61 testimony of ambassador linton brooks house committee on armed services mar 2 2005 pp

simply look at ways to repackage the device so it can penetrate hard geologies am i right or are you also looking at lowering the yield of say the b83 to perhaps under five kilotons administrator brooks we are not l ooking at changing the yield of the physics package ambassador brooks i really must apol ogize for my lack of precision if we in the administration have suggested that it was possible to have bomb that penetrated far enough to trap all fallout i dont believe that i dont believe the laws of physics will ever let that be true this is nuclear weapon this is nuclear weapon that is going to be hugely destructive and destructive over large area sane person would use weapon like that lightly and i regret any impression that anybody including has given that would suggest that this is going to be any easier decision i mean if this weapon were in the arsenal today it would still be hugely difficult decision for any president to even contemplate it so i the administration believes and i personally believe that this study should continue but it i want to i do want to make it clear that any thought of sort of nuclear weapons that arent really destructive is just nuts61 to summarize the foregoing passages by clarifying several points that were at issue in earlier debates on rnep ma help focus any future debate there is formal military requirement for rnep there is considerable interest by dod and the armed services in learning through the proposed rnep study whether rnep is feasible the possible conversion of b83 bomb to an rnep would not involve changing the yield of the weapon rnep and probably any other nuc lear earth penetrator would not penetrate the ground deeply nough to contain fallout use of rnep would therefore cause huge amount of fallout and destruction because rnep if it is deploye d would be nuclear weapon presidential decision to use it would be very difficult developments in the fy2007 budget cycle nnsa requested funds for
