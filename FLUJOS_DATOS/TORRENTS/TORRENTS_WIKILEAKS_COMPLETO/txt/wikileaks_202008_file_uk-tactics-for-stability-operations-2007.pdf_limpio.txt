stability operations all three may be conducted concurr ently stability operations are defined as military operations which contri bute to order security and control to set the conditions to allow the primacy of nonm ilitary and indigenous organisations to develop accountab institutions and mechanisms of government 2 stability operations have only recent ly been recognised as having parity with offensive and defensive operations as land tactical activity because all three land tactical activities may occur concurrently and because they are likely to be conducted with the same resources and by the same comm ander knowledge of afm vol 1 part 1 formation tactics is prerequisite for understanding the broader context of which stability operations are constituent part 3 the purpose of this publ ication is to provide the latest detailed guidance for conducting stability operations part sets the strategicoperati onal scene part b provides the ttps and advice on the training nec essary to acquire proficiency in them these ttps have been developed by capturing bes t practice from both past experience and contemporary operations they provide first pr inciples and the start point from which to plan and conduct pre deployment tr aining pdt activity and to develop ttps specific to particular environment or situat ion encountered on operations the contemporary operat ing environment coe1 4 the current operating environment is deter mined by blend of in terrelated complex and dynamic factors the consequent realit ies for the military are best described by general krulacks three block war concept which sees military forces handing out humanitarian supplies on one city block separating warring facti ons or maintaining stability in an adjacent block and fighti ng adversaries in

hearts and minds of indigenous populat ions and range of global audiences 5 in addition to delivering the kinetic effect traditionally ssociated with military activity there is requirement to influence the percept ions and attitudes of range of audiences through influence or nonkinetic activity ev ery action taken by the military will have an effect on the perceptions and attitudes of the indigenous population the adversary and wider audiences presence po sture and profile the use of force or restraint and how troops interact with locals will have an in fluencing effect and should be targeted accordingly doctrine concerning info ops and influence activity is being developed and can be found on the lwc web site or the army electronic battleb ox 6 ambiguity and uncertainty are constants of the coe3 and all soldiers regardless of capbadge must be trained to deal wit h this there is need to develop all of our soldiers physical and mental robustne ss ensure that they are c apable of applying the basics in order to be able to fight for their lives in close combat and to dev elop their powers of judgment knowing when and how to act is essential to mission success at all levels coin 7 operations in afghanist an and iraq are essentially coin operations that are bein g conducted in an expeditionary m anner within multinational c ontext the principles of coin developed primarily from extensive uk ex perience hold true british military coin doctrine afm vol 1 part 10 is in the process of being updated to reflect contemporary conditions the web based version of the coin afm reflects the most current iteration and should thus be used as key reference document when preparing f or and conducting operations application through leadership 8 although doctrine and ttps provide practi cal guidance on the cond uct of operations their publication alone will not sufficiently add to operational success unless soldiers understand doctrine are well trained in ttps and are suffi ciently motivated to carry out their tasks to the best of their ability their effe ctiveness on the battlefield as individuals or as part of team will be limited it is leadership which ensures t hat training is effective and that drills are learned and follow ed correctly it is leadership which drives effective action and motivates soldiers to give their utmost to achieve the common purpos it is leadership which turns the bald stat ements of fact in this publication into life saving or battle winning action and moreover it is strong leaders w ho recognise that doctri ne writers do not have

operations part context restricted issue 20 oct 07 1 1 restricted chapter 1 introduction the effects based approachhas required us to think afresh about how we intervene in and subsequently exit from conflict situations in particular it requires us to view stabilisation and restoration not as the final act at the end of conflict but rather to see the conflict as the first someti mes unavoidable opening ac t that precedes the main task of restoration and stabilisation1 1 stability operations are planned continuously and conducted concurrently with offensive and defensive operations they are defined as military operations which contribute to order curity and control to set the conditions to allow the primacy of non military and indigenous organisat ions to develop accountable institutions and mechanisms of government 2 military intervention in state will be undertaken in co ncert with the other elements of national power diplomatic and economic as part of comprehensive approach in order to achieve national political and strategic objectives2 stability operations conducted by military forces will be central to achieving wider national aims they are at least in part conducted concurrently with ffensive and defensive operati ons and are likely to be an enduring theme on all operations the timely cr eation of conditions for international and host nation hn organisations to operate will be primary concern and particularly in post conflict situation military activity will provide the foundations for longer term development stability and wider reform 3 the contemporary operating environment3 will require stability operations to be planned and coordinated with range of civil actors4 in the face of variety of threats in complex terrain and amongst the local population the nee d for military involvement could range from conflict prevention meas ures in failed or failing stat to providing early support to nation building the existing security situation will affect t he ability of certain actors to engage until their security is guaranteed in such case the military may have to take rapid initial responsibility for the prov ision of the rule of law basic utilitie s and governance until handover of responsibility can be ac hieved in asymmetric operati ons the military will need to be able to take back the lead in these areas if the security situation deteriorates so that relevant other actors cannot complete their role 4 there are four interrelated groups of tactical activities associated with stability operations they are conducted in framework of information

comprehensive approach1 the comprehensive appr oach ca is the uk governments approach to cross departmen t comprehensive planning the greater coherence in planning resultin g from the ca and participatio n of other governmental departments ogd and interagencies ia at st rategic operational and tactical levels offers number of advantages these in clude thorough effective analysis and shared understanding of situati on access to broad range of inte lligence and analytical assets and expertise and better focussed use of milit ary resources to achieve long term national objectives significant operational and tactical ffect can result from the judicious use of ogd and ia during stability operations in mipermissive and permissive environments hq elements should be expanded to include cr oss governmental and ia personnel the ca is best demonstrated at the tact ical level by provisional rec onstruction teams prt it should however be underst ood that where ogd and ia ar either unavailable or insufficiently experienced it may be necessary for their functions to be performed by the military 2 supported and supporting departments depending on the nature of crisis the military may not constitute the main effo rt and may be required to conduct supporting activity to create the conditions for ogd or other organisations to deliver the required outcome the relationship between supported and supporti ng departments may change with time according to the agreed main effort or the situation command and control responsibilities and funding will need to be clarified and the necessary means of communications between department s and agencies established 3 the post conflict reconstruction unit pcru the pcru is accountable to board drawn from the mod dfid and fco it comprises personnel from the ministry of defence mod and the department for inter national development dfid and also has seconded staff from the police rvice of northern ireland gchq and hm treasury it has been established to provide framework for the coordination of the uk governments response to crisis it provides the technical expertise to assist with strategic planning in the form of an integrated and common asse ssment and has limit ed deployable elements that can provide planning advice to commander and his staff at the operational level critically it provides the m ilitary with advice on wider comp lementary set of competences covering government security and justice public services infrastructu re and economic issues understanding and situational awareness 4 in order to achieve success military activity has to be based on thorough understanding of the oper ating environment it is essential to develop good understanding of the cons tituent parts of the relevant

awareness sa is also essential knowing when and how to act to achieve the desired effect is cr itical to enable comprehensive planning and coordinated activities with ogd and ia requires in telligence within stability operations the istar effort is subtly different from other operations ther is greater need to develop trend and link analysis with focus on wider r ange of actors whilst the need for in depth understanding of each actor is obvious the reality is that this is unachievable except over long period of time and thus commanders should expect the intelligence picture that they need will develop slowly forma tion commanders should expect to have to provide much more focussed istar support to units that will have broader range of responsibilities than in warfighting operation it is often incorrectly assu med that humint is the key requirement in stability operat ions the prevailing circum stances and the environment rather than the type of operati on determine the most effectiv collection method as with any type of operation detailed istar estimate regularly u pdated will form the basis of determining what istar assets3 are required legal considerations 6 military force will

factions leading to political activity planning considerations 2 variables success in establishing secure environment depends upon number of variables some of which are outside the contro l of an external military force all these factors should have been considered by the strategic comprehensive estimate social ethnic and political factors the social and ethnic mix of society and its propensity to violence as result of its history polit ical divisions or criminality will impact on the security environment the nature of the political settlement comprehensive peace settlement

protagonists d regional stability the influence of neighbouring states can exacerbate or improve situation the size posture command and skills of the military force the military force providing

ed the challenges to establishing secure environment can be grouped into four categories expressive violence perpetrators of expressive violence are unlikely to have realistic political aims but their violence goes beyond t hat of criminality such violence is conducted by two broad groups former regime diehards and score settlers b instrumental violence instrumental violence is used by groups within state or by neighbouring states to promote their political territo rial or strategic interests violence between religious or et hnic groups can fall into this category if orchestrated for political ends c threats to coalition forces and new regimes where threats to coalition forces and new regimes exist they should be rapidly countered d disorder social chaos results in diso rder

agencies are in capable of delivering the required effect due to the security situation but milit ary restoration must compliment the longer term plans of ogds and avoid creating dependence on military support b in order to improve security 1 directly by fixing populations for example by the provision of clean water in given area improving rout permitting armoured vehiclesqrf access improving st reet lighting etc 2 indirectly by removing cause for discontent amongst the civil population and denying shado w government the opportunity to occupy vacuum c to promote campaign authority d to support the logistic and infrastruc ture requirements of military force to act as catalyst for governance economic and social activity for example by repairing strategic infrastruc ture and improving transport links f legal obligations placed upon occupy ing powers by inte rnational law to provide and care for civilian populations 2 the restoration of essential services and facilities for civilian population linked to an info ops campaign and other lines of activi ty is an early measure that can be taken to increase the chances of mission success restoration work must be li nked to the io messages in order to capitalise on the good will from the local population and deny criminal groupings from taking unwarranted credit restoration activity is likely to be conducted primarily by military engineers or contractors with cimic staff playing coordinating role the military medical services may also be invo lved where there is re quirement to restore medical facilities for the civilian population and to provide advice on environmental health issues 3 the nature and size of the m ilitary contribution will vary in some circumstances it may be appropriate to focus

comprehensive planning process in the absence of appropriate civilian agencies an overall assessment of the hns infrastructure should be made and used to focus military and civil resources to best effect in support of the campaign plan short term quickwin solutions should be aligned with long term objectives and resources identified and allocated to conduct both provision shou ld also be made for the milita ry to hand over responsibility for restoration tasks to appropriate civil actors or hn institutions as soon as is practicable while having contingency plans to retake the lead in periods or in areas where the security situation deteriorates and prevent s other actors from carrying out their role the hn should be involved as early as possible in the planning of work and the allocation of priorities with hn personnel employed wherever possible 5 targeting the restoration of essential serv ices can contribute directly to improvements in the security situation re storation

such tasks may range from cimic liaison to the establishment of an interim military governmen t and are likely to include some degree of responsibility for the provision of essential services the military should seek to hand responsibility for governance tasks to an appropriate indigenous or international civil organisation at the earliest appropriate opportunity its primary role will be in

by which effective security structures are developed in order to allow the citizens of state to live in safety2 ssr is likely to be core task in countries emerging from conflict but may also make significant contribution to conflict prevention in fragile or failing stat in all cases it is seen as critical activity that provides the basis for longer term stabi lity and will address two broad areas the quality of gover nance in the state in terms of the relationships between security sector institutions wider government apparatus and the general public and the technical competence and professionalism of those in the security sector3 2 the security sector the composition of the security sector differs from country to country so there is univer sally applicable definit ion of it however there are four generally accepted categories that comprise the security sector security actors armed forces police and gendarmeries paramilitary forces presidential guards intelligence an d security services military and civilian coast guards border guards custom s authorities reserve or local security units civil defence forces national guards government backed militias and veterans

the uk government has established two interdepartmental conflict prevention pools these fund activities including ssr bringing toget her the diplomatic defence and development interests of the fco mod

security interests of the state s hould not conflict with the security interests of its citizens b the state is ultimately responsible fo r providing the security conditions for the well being of its population in developing countries that security is not provided exclusively by western style statutory bodies but also comes from traditional and nonstatutory systems the conditions are not limited to law and order issues but include all political economic an d social issues that ensure life is as free from risk as possible c ideally the security sector will be controlled and guided by national security strategy if one does not exist its developm ent could be an early element of the ssr programme ssr principles 5 the following generic principles apply to t he militarys involvement in the reform of isf6 local ownership overcoming the tendency to use an outsiders frame of reference is important and t herefore the initiative must rest with the indigenous leaders selected during any capa

rea listic goals and aspirations are therefore required spite the likelihood that milit ary involvement in an ssr programme is relatively short term planning s hould be for the long term the temptation to adopt short term quick win solutions that do not contribute to longer term goal s should be avoided 10 risk risk will need to be taken in ssr programme particularl when it is conducted

not usually the responsibility of mnf in some circumst ances however the military may be required to take the lead in restructuring ps policing is not an activi ty intuitive to the military and even military policing activities differ from the capabilities procedures and processes of civil force 2 development of the ps shou ld occur in parallel with legisl ative reform reform in the penal and judicial systems within which the police operate and in other related civil service and government branches it should also be s upported by the appropria expertise which must include comprehensive

often overlap in states where an ssr programme is required there are marked differences in understanding the function role and organisational structures of various units which straddle the policemilitary boundary even in some democra cies there is trend towards paramilitary police units the general consensus is that police and military powers s hould be clearly distinguished and separated the followi ng principles apply the ps should be regarded as civilian rather than military b military personnel should not conduct policing activity c systematic and conceptual separation from the military is required the ps should have its own distinct and specia lised education and training programmes d police and military powers s hould complement each other 5 strategic planning

of current and aspirant officers and the removal or retraining of t hose found to be unsatisfactory officers found responsible for past abuse and poor practice should also be removed the process is often hampered by lack of trustworthy records12 and there is often perception that the process is influenced by favouritism and political or ethnic affilia tion 10 principles the following principles apply to the recruitment process the aim is to produce an effective c apable institution t he process therefore needs to be open and grounded in national laws b an objective assessment of co mpetency and performance should be the criteria for promotion and reward the long term goal is to produce culture that punishes abuse and corruption c continual process of performanc assessment should be established to remove or retrain officers who fail to meet the required standar ds and to identify individuals for further training and promotion d remedial training should be offer ed to make up for shortfalls in skills the ps should reflect the demographic balan ce of the society it serves this should be achieved without diminishing t he standards required of officers and may mirror regional

reconcilia tion with communities and former enem ies as before long term commitment financial and expertise will be required alo ng with coordination of all actors the return of former combatants to

this should be developed as an operation progresses reform in these areas is usually the domain of ogd ios etc and comprehensive planning1 to coordinate military activities with them should be condu cted the conditions should be designed and owned by the hn government with advice fr om the mnf and lead nation states the decision to conduct tsr should be made by the hn government wi th support from international partners military and civilian2 2 the ability to conduct tsr depends on the collective capac ity of hn institutions to take responsibility for their own areas of authority with diminishing external advice and assistance the precise way in which the process is handled w ill be significantly influenced by the security situation in the hn an effective means to asse ss the conditions both subjective and objective should be estab lished from the outset of the campaign aim 3 the aim of this annex is to provide operational and tactic level guidance and information to assist those involved to prepare for plan and conduct the process of transferring responsibility for security responsibility to hn and its security forces3 planning considerations background 4 the operational transition process allows mnf to under write isf self reliance as the former disengages signific ant degree of risk is attached to this process if the mnf withdraws too quickly the isf may fail in its role and suffer loss of self esteem and public confidence conversely too slow withdraw could lead to dependency and loss of public consent or tolerance for the presence of the mnf the lines of operation for the campaign are interlinked and military planning cannot be ducted in isolation throughout planning must consider the need to keep coalition partners involved and engaged in the process and to coordinate the plan ning and execution of activity with the host of other civilian actors ogd io etc involved in an ssr programme 1 see jdn 405 the comprehensive approach 2 the dynamics of coalition strategic interests hn gendas and the need to shape local and international perceptions to set the condi tions for tsr will make this an extremel complicated process this issue

achieving the required degree of command and control css coordination between isf elements and their respective hn government agencies in the early stages therefore there should be continual reduction in the numbers of mnf troops conducting independent patrolling activity the need to pr ovide planning support will extend further into the process4 and it is likely that tts and possibly teams opera

conduct ccessful operational transitio n and tsr depends as much upon the ability and capacity of hn government institutions to operate without support from the mnf and other internationa l government departments as it does on capable and credible isf self reliance in these areas is central to t he withdrawal of mnf and to the maintenance of longer term security within t he hn it may therefore be necessary to focus on supporting and facilitating fledgling elec ted bodies and governance while developing crossministry cooperation this should be conducted as comprehensive approach in conjunction with civil actors such as the fco dfid and the who in turn should be supported to improve their effectiveness in order to replace military assistance 11 at provincial level the c apacity for

operations other than war the main body of the chapter covers the aims and principles of patrolling annex provides guidance on patrol preparations prior to deployment from the security force base nnex b provides guidanc on the conduct of patrols including foot and mobi patrols annex c provi des guidance on the activities conducted by the patrol on return to the securi ty force base annex d provides the format for patrol related reports the guidance is not prescriptive and should be supplemente d by individual experience and unit sops aims of patrolling 2 the aims of patrolling in other operations are gathering information b reassuringgaining the trust of the population c prevent public disorder d dominating the ground by 1 deterring and disrupting enemy activity 2 protecting security force bases 3 protecting key infrastructure and civilian authorities support other operations in the area f providing security to deployed troops 3 patrol structure the concept of employing mult iples of three 4man teams is common feature in other operations the decis ion to adopt multiple patrolling as opposed to maintaining platoon structur will depend upon the situation and the threat in some circumstances framework patrols may even be up to subunit strength flexible effects driven taskorg is critical principles of patrolling 4 mutual support mutual support during patrolling is achieved by coordinating the movement and actions of teams whilst taki ng into account weaponecmcommunication capabilities and ranges the loos triangle formation allows at least two teams to react to an incident involving the thir d team mutual support during contact is generally provided by the out of contact teams attempting to move 100150 metres into depth of the firing restricted issue 20 oct

achi eved within each team by allocating arcs of responsibilit to each team member within patrol teams can be allocated arcs of responsibility to provide all round defence 6 depth maintenance of depth is vital it give s troops the ability to react to incidents and also keeps the enemy guessing as to the locati on of all teams within team depth is achieved by adopting loose box formation withi n the ecm umbrella at multiple level depth is achieved by adopting loos triangular formation dept h is also achieved by using other deployed or static security forces includi ng police sangar sentries vehicles such as wr snatch wmik etc and ai r support rotary fixed wing and uavs the distance between each team on patrol should be influenced by the extent of the patrols ecm cover and the nature of the terrain consideration should be given to increasing the size of patrols to achieve greater depth 7 deception deception should be employed to introduce doubt into the mind of the enemy as to the purpose r oute and actions of the patrol the enemy will look to predict the actions of the patrol in or der that it can be tar geted or to limit the effectiveness of the patrol the enemy will l ook to establish patrol patterns in order that they can mount an attack at time and place of their own choos ing they will be det erred from mounting an attack if the actions of the patrol are unpredictabl as there is higher risk of capture or discovery some methods of achievi ng deception on patrol are as follows change exit and entry dr ills including utilising mobile pick up and drop off b change patrol formations and numbers incl uding changing t he structure of multiple for example varying multiples between two teams of six soldiers and three teams of four soldiers or by deploying additional multiples c varying patrol routes honesty traces must be completed and their information managed by ops rooms d avoidance of pattern setting doubling back hard targeting mobile lift and drop 8

high risk activity due to the way troops are channelled through limited num ber of entry or exit points the enemy is known to monitor patrols leaving and entering base locations in order to identify patterns and areas of weakness that they can exploi t patrols leaving and enteri ng security force base can reduce the risks of attack by conducting the following drills vary the points used to exit and enter the base and th routes used to transit the immediate area around the base b vary the method of deployment when on foot always hard target when in the vicinity of the base location and vary t he distance that hard targeting is conducted over in order to avoid pattern setting distances at which top cover sentries are established should be varied when entering and leaving base locations in vehicles vehicles may be used to dropoff and pickup foot patrols the qrf may be used to provide depth to deploying and returning patrols c minimise the use of patrol holding areas close to the base if the patrol is within hard targeting distance of the base it should move into the base location if holding areas are to be utilised during the pa trol they should be included in the patrol brief d exit and entry drills should be reh earsed and should be conducted at speed avoidance of uninhabited buildings 2 derelict partially destroyed and uninhabit ed buildings are the ideal killing ground for the enemy as they allow devices to be hidden easily and with minimum risk of discovery patrols should pass uninhabited and derelict buildings quickly nd should not stop loiter take up fire positions or conduct patrol tasks in the immediate vicinity of such buildings some partially destroyed buildings may be inhabited by people and livestock but should be treated with caution and avoided incidents of minor aggression 3 incidents of minor aggre ssion arise anywhere anytime for any number of reasons and can develop rapidly into violent public diso rder patrols must always be on the look out for the telltale signs of discontent that may gi ve rise to such incidents patrol and team commanders must constantly evaluate the options open to them du ring such incidents patrols may wish to consider the

enable the t eam to see any missiles that may be thrown and may enable evasive action to be taken the commander should extract the team from the ar ea of the threat it should be noted that the threat is often multidirectional thereby making it difficult to face up to the threat c bunching teams should avoid bunching when reacting to an incident f minor aggression but may need to close in to ease control the team commander should direct his baton gunner as required whilst extracting the team from the area of the incident d controlled move back to achieve controlled move back the team commander should attempt to gain buffe r zone of about 20 metres between the team and the aggressors this area of paration should be maintained to provide the team the space in which to manoeuvre away from the area of the incident use of the baton gun nd nonlethal weapons the baton gun is an ideal weapon for achieving buffer zone between the crowd and the team and for initiating break clean the baton gunner must be controlled by the commander and operate within the roe other nonle thal weapons may have been issued such as stingball grenades which could be used to achieve bu ffer zone f mutual support the patrol teams that are not directly involved in the incident should monitor the radio and move par allel with the crowd maintaining position from which they can move in and ssist the extraction of the team involved in the incident if required closing in on the team involv ed in the incident will present larger target for the aggressors and can complicate command and control g use of vehicles using vehicleborne qrfs and mobile patrols at the scene of minor aggression situat ion can present problems in command and control this is especially the case when drivers hav not been practiced in manoeuvring their vehicles at speed in confined spaces vehicle commanders should ve communications with the patrol before leaving the base location in order to gain situational awareness rout in and

or snco patrols of less than thr ee teams compromise t he principle of depth and should be avoided the size of teams and the number of teams in patrol can vary according to the mission and threat but should not be so large as to become unwieldy as they become difficult to command and control patrols can be augmented by specialist personnel as required 2 team members must assist their commander by applying basic patrolling techniques this gives the team commander more scope and time to concentrate on assisting the commander in the conduct of the patrol team members should concentrate on maintaining spacing formation alertne ss conducting 5m and 20m checks and taking up effective fire positions without supervision 5 and 20 metre checks 3 five metre checks must be conducted ev ery time

urban and ru ral environments as they provide platform from which to mount operations this appen dix covers the advantages disadvantages and specific considerati ons relating to mobile patrols advantages 2 the advantages that can be gained by c onducting mobile patrols are as follows speed the speed with which mobile patro l can react reduces response times during and after incidents b protection whilst limited the arm our of the vehicle affo rds some protection to the patrol against small arms fire rp g and ied attacks depending on type of vehicle and armour protection c mobility use of vehicles allows greater distances to be covered during patrol and enables greater r ange and quantity of equipment to be carried vehicles enable foot patrols to be moved around the patrol area thereby assisting the deception plan mobile patr ols working in support of f oot patrols provide greater depth and additional mutual support d depth use of vehicles in support of dismounted troops enables great er depth to be achieved firepower some vehicles are fitted with crewserved weapons systems that provide the patrol with greater firepower disadvantages 3 there are number of disadvantages wh conducting mobile patro ls that must be considered during the plann ing of the patrol matrix target size vehicles present larger ta rgets with potentially greater casualties if an enemy attack is successful mobile patrols present an easy target for stone throwing youths as there are less op tions available with which to respond to such incidents b humint mobile patrols are less

restricted mobile support to foot patrols b vehicle check point operations c quick reaction force d escort duties for administrative tasks convoys military escorts normally minimum of two military vehicles working in conjunction with the local pol ice forceescorted vehicle f commanding officers rover groups specific considerations 7 limitations mobile patrols are constrained both physically when inside the vehicles and in their ability to react to some minor aggression si tuations this can be exploited by sections of the local population who understand that reacti ons of the patrol are restricted by roe and the laws of armed conflict 8 situational awareness the vehicle commander may find it difficult to achieve good situational awareness due to the constraints to all round vision top cover sentries provide information essential to the patrol and vehicle commander maintaining situational awareness and must update the co mmander on activity to the flanks rear and above the vehicle 9 halts static or halted mobile patrols bec ome vulnerable and unplanned halts should be avoided where hal ts are required they should be preplanned and should take place well outside built up areas vehicle crew s and transported soldiers should dismount and carry out 5m and 20m checks during halts at least 13 of the patrol should adopt fire positions to cover the remainder whilst 20m c hecks or other patrol ta sks are conducted all vehicle doors should be closed and vehicles left out of gear with the hand break off unless parked on slope some soldiers may re main mounted during halts including driver of b vehicles during short halts b drivers of vehicles c soldiers operating crew served weapons 10 breakdowns when vehicle on mobile patrol breaks down the patrol should bus and secure the immediate area including 20m check in order to provide security to the driver whilst an attempt is made to repair the vehicle the commander must consider the risks and implications associ ated with selfrecovery by another patrol vehicle waiting for recovery and destroying the vehicle in situ to deny its use to the enemy if the decision is taken to self recover or await recovery co nsideration should be given to tasking other patrols to satellite the broken down vehicle deception operation should be considered to conceal the breakdown eg vcp restricted issue 20 oct 07 8 b2 4

driver is responsible for the vehicle load and must ensure that all equipment is stowed securely and correctly and t hat the weight of the load does not exceed the vehicles prescribed design limits the vehicle commander is responsible for his crew he is to ensure that when fitted the crew wear seatbel ts and wear the appropriate protective clothing appropriate to the threat and task addi tionally the commander is to ensure that he has reliable communications with any top cover sentries and that there is sufficient internal space for the top cover sent ries to get inside the vehicle quickly should there be need to do so 13 dynamic top cover sentries top cover sentries tcs must be deployed tactically they must be given specific arcs they should be trained in the jack in the box

readily accessible 10 deception deception tactics should be impl emented where possible to introduce an element of doubt in the mind of the enem and his dicking system deception depends on the imagination of t he individual but due to the stat ic nature of most guard tasks alertness and the ability to react are key guard personnel should constantly imagine themselves in the enemys position and then attempt to introduce factors which are unfavourable from his viewpoint in short t hink enemy an example would be changing the changeover times for sangar sentries in order to avoid setting patterns 11 loading bay drills there should only be one team at the loading bay at any time the remainder of the multiple should be behind some form of cover do not mix weapon systems and use white light at night all drills at the loading bay are supervised matter what the rank of the loader team should leave the base until every man is loaded and one should unload until the last man is in base security tasks 12 sangar duties characteristics sangars are uniformly constructed as armoured cubes forming either part of the perimeter defences of base or raised on tower to provide an observation platform they are usually sited to dominate an entrance to base sangars can be both defensive and offensive in nature and usually accommodate single sentry access to the sangar is normally covered from view although the sangar itself tends not to be camouflaged above observation windows may be panoramic photographs gridded and marked with refe rence points andor rangecard b sangar equipment most sangars have ecm equipment and radio or intercom communications with the operati ons room each should also have logbook written orders and an actionson aidememoire not all contain attack alarm buttons c duties sangar sentries are the eyes and ea rs of base whose alertness is paramount to the safety of all within the ba their primary task is to react quickly and correctly in raising the alarm and reporting challenging suspicious activity it is essential that they are given proper orders specifying arcs of observation secondary tasks such as logging and report ing orders for opening fire and other actionson and are re hearsed in their duties all sa ngar sentries should be posted by an nco who controls length of stags and is responsibl for monitoring alertness coordination of reports and investigation of alarms restricted issue 20 oct 07 9 4 restricted 13 gate duties characteristics gates to bases are areas of weakness within the perimeter necessary to allow access to t he base either to pe destrians or more usually vehicles up to hgv in size access to the gate is usually controlled by traffic measures such as large concrete bollards ucb to form chicane ramps and barriers there may be waiting bays and arch areas adjacent to the main access point the whole area should be covered by observation from sangar and if necessary well lit b duties gate sentries are vital components of base security as they control approaches to and ultimately access to the bas they are often the first point of contact with the bases occupants and therefor have an important image to portray both alertness to deter the d icker and professionalism to reassure the visitor the gate sentrys primary task is to control access by identifying and if necessary challenging anyone approaching he is responsible for quick assessment of visitors credentials and for facilitating the visitor in gaining access to the base if entitled all the while he must observe approaches to the base to protect both himself and visitors from attack in t he event of proxy dev ice being delivered the gate sentry will be the first to grasp t he situation raise the alarm and conduct immediate action drills to release the driver he is the first line of defence at the perimeters weakest point and as such bears significant responsibility he should be thoroughly conversant with hi s orders and wellrehearsed in reaction drills c searching of vehicles and personnel all bases require specific search capability at their main access points in order to check people and vehicles before entering details on the co nduct of personnel and vehicle searches can be found in chapter 4 reaction to incidents 14 general any reaction to an incident must be conducted within the bounds of the extant rules of engagement roe combat indicators most incidents are preceded or accompanied by signs or combat indicators which if spotted can indicate an impending attack guards can then take immediate action by raising t he alarm implementing reaction drills and attempting to seize the init iative from the insurgent b patterns bases are static and subject to r outine patterns of activity both within and around them the enemy will re ly on predictable reaction to any circumstance and will repeat successful attacks he will use hoax devices to study our reaction and then set secondary attacks against

and appropriate detection techniques 3 levels of search response search is conducted at th ree levels basic intermediate and advanced the type of response is determined by taking in to account the assessment of risk and sophistication of equipment technology r equired for the task s ee figure 11 below 1 basic search basic search is the lowest level of capability it is provided by search aware soldiers and patrol search soldiers pss is for overall force protection and requires an understanding of the threat methods of attack and general knowledge of person vehicle and simple rummage search procedures all personnel should be search aware 2 intermediate search intermediate search is the capability to conduct operations in situation where ther is low threat from explosive ordnance eo relatively low level of assurance is accept able or there is minimal threat from hazardous environment it is normally used for deliberate preplanned offensive search operat ions aimed at denying resources gaining intelligence and ev idence for prosecut ion within the low threat environment and invariably requi re cordon to provide security 3 advanced search advanced search is the capability to conduct operations in situation where there is high threat from eo only the highest level of assurance is acceptable or hazardous environment exists it is used for all deliberate and rapi d

of view of casual observers therefore it is necessary for mo d personnel employed on searchguard duties to use systematic search procedures to detect such items 2 the main objective of vehicle search is to detect improvis ed explosive devices ied or their components w eapons ammunition offence weapons knives etc or any other weapon which terroristcrimi nals may attempt to conceal vehicle searches are to be performed in accordance with jsp 440 and cal standard operating instructions soi guidelines covering the authority to sear ch are also outlined earlier this document basic rules 3 where possible searches should search in pairs vehicles re generally manufactured symmetrically with the bodywork fixtures and fittings the same on both sides of the vehicle searchers s hould therefore pay particular ttention to any abnormalities on the vehicle the basic rules for searching vehicle are as follows most concealment areas ar easily and quickly access ible to the terrorist use your senses at all times sight touch smell b establish what you look at on one side the back of what you see on the other eg car floor to underside bulkhead to engine bay engine bay and interior to wings back of boot to back of rear seat c as any part of the vehicle been tamper ed with or has it been moved recently d use correct tool for the job eg do not use pliers on nuts and bolts every part of car has function ensur that it carries out that function f be quick thorough effici ent know exactly what u have to do this will reduce the possibility of complaint g if in doubt seek advice types of search 4 there are two types of basic vehicle search these are initial check lasting approximately 2 minutes b initial search lasting approximately 10 minutes restricted issue 20 oct 07 10 b 2 restricted initial check 5 an initial check is very important tool in assisting mod personnel employed on guard duties or when involved in other duties such as op wid eawake an initial check of persons can reveal great deal about persons reason for being on mod property the response can assist in making dec ision on if further investigation is required or if an initial search should be performed the following points should be used as guideline to performing an initial ch eck of person stop the person and identify yourself b check the persons id documents c check reason for entry d observe the person looking for any signs of unusual behaviour which may raise your suspicions have quick look inside the vehi cle is there anything suspicious f smell inside the vehicle are there any suspicious smells g quick look inside the boot or load spac of vehicle can reveal great deal h if in doubt do not allow access and report i perform primary vehicle arch if it is deemed appropriate 6 sequence the sequence of the check is as follows commander 1 commands and controls the search 2 runs plate check on the vehicle if such system exists in theatre 3 decides if primary search is required b chat up man speaks to the driver and pass engers through an interpreter to obtain the following information restricted issue 20 oct 07 10 b 3 restricted 1 the identities of vehicle occupants 2 confirm the ownership of the vehicle ask mileage etc 3 any other specific information requ ired by g2 and covered in the patrol brief b searcher the searcher looks for known co mbat indicators eg new tyres on old vehicles overloading of rear of vehicle and damaged locks and observes the reaction of the occupants the following checks are then made 1 the outside of the vehicle is inspected 2 by looking through the windows the in side of the vehicle is inspected 3 the underside of the v ehicle is inspected 4 the engine and boot compartment are both inspected c cover man the cover man 1 provides protection 2 witnesses the operation d documentation psr is only required if 1 anything more than visual check has been made eg an item in the car is moved by the searcher 2 damage has been caused in the initial check 3 documents have been examined or removed guide to initial vehicle search 7 search is science it therefore follows that vehicle search should be carried out using systematic procedures in order to search vehicle effe ctively the searcher should divide the vehicle into five distinct areas 8 sequence the sequence for the initial search is as follows the occupants are asked to get out of the car and are searched b the searchers depending on the situation and existing sops remove helmets and weapons and give them to t he cover man who provides security c the vehicle is searched systematically concentrating on the five main areas 1 exterior restricted issue 20 oct 07 10 b 4 restricted 2 underside 3 interior 4 luggage compartment 5 engine compartment search techniques for the

deceptive area often used for double bulkheads especially if t here is large parcel shelf above 11 the basic guideline is t hat you are looking for recent disturbance of the paint underseal or mechanical fittings any new welding mastic or added fitments have to be checked spare wheel 12 the spare wheel is often stored within compar tment in the boot space examine the spare wheel com pare with running wheels for size and design roll the wheel across level ground watch for an irregular motion petrol tank 13 several vehicle designs incl ude the fuel tank in the boot area sometimes part

involving house takeover hostages 2 unoccupiedderelict buildings 3 vehicles 4 openrural terrain c other factors the enemy will primarily consider his escape route either on foot or vehicle based on the risk of captur the timescale of attack will often be quite short in duration and may be part of secondary attack or may be designed to lure troops into other areas 2 phases there are two distinct phases when reacting to contact shoot these are the contact period b the reorganisation and consider ation of courses of action 3 the contact period the contact period lasts from the initial contact until the enemy has either been killedcapt ured or has extracted all actions in the contact period are aimed at capturing or killing the enemy the success of this phase will depend n rapid and aggressive action by all mem bers of the patrol in order to seize the initiative from the insurgent initial reactions can be summed up using the fear acronym find and fire locate the enemy and engage wit hin the roe troops must be prepared to use their own initiative and be well practi sed in target indication use of force must always be pr oportional and mindful of both civilian casualties and

assess and act the commander must make rapid plan to task flanking callsigns into depth of the firing point and send an initial contact report the aim remains to kill or capture the enemy d report and react the commander should th send more detailed contact report requesting any additional suppor t that he requires such as aviation indirect fire etc he is then in position to react to any changes in the situation the movement of the enemy etc contac t reports should contain the following information 1 what happened 2 where did it happen 3 when did it happen 4 what are you doing about it 5 what agencies do you require 6 where do you want them to arrive 4 reorganisation and considerat ion of courses of action in the contact period all actions were aimed at kill ing or capturing the enemy and preventing further loss of life the whole tempo of your reaction now changes and becomes more deliberate and methodical reorganisation always be aware of the risk of secondary attacks in all their forms the following points should serve as gui 1 all troops to conduct thorough 5m and 20m checks 2 conduct first aid of casualti whilst awaiting casevac 3 account for all troops 4 check ammo states 5 deal with any detainees 6 prevent access to the scene by civi lians this may require cordon to be established whilst the commander consi ders his future course of action b consideration of courses of action there will be three predominant courses of action 1 cordon if the tactical situation pe rmits cordon may be established to enable agencies such as ato wis resa to exploit any forensic evidence

response from other gencies eg qrf irt etc 6 deterrence as the insurgents main concer n is making an unhindered escape he will target patrols which he c onsiders to provide him the best opportunity to escape with the risk of being killed or captured reduced therefore from indi vidual to command level every effort must be taken to apply sound tactic decisions and appear confident and professional when patrolling by applying the basic principles of patrolling we can minimise the threat to ourselves and create uncerta inty in the mind of the insurgent 7 combat indicators if you identify combat

b command operated ieds c victim operated ieds d projected weapons time operated ieds 2 general time operated ieds are designed to function after preset delay allowing the enemy to make his escape before the explosion occurs they are commonly used in indirect fire attacks and the anti property role but may be used in the antipersonnel role if the insurgent can pred ict that the target will be present at known time time operated ieds may vary in size from small incendiaries to large vehicle borne ieds lvbieds the delay offered from time operated ieds may be from few seconds to several months depending on the device ma keup and the insurgents aims 3 types of time operated ieds there are four types of time operated ied igniferous very simple time ieds may inco rporate slow burning fuze onto plain detonator or in the case of an filled ied directly to the main charge joss sticks cigarettes and other it ems with controlled burning rate can also be used b chemical very simple ieds have been manufactured using chemical reaction these typically include condom or balloon containing small amount of sulphuric acid inserted into chloratesugar main charge the acid eats through the rubber and the chloratesugar mix spontaneously ignites on contact with the acid the time delay can be altered by varying the number of condoms r balloons c mechanical mechanical timers are the mo st common form of timer criminal and less sophisticated insurgent ieds often use modified watch or clock these can give up to 12 hour delay but are often inaccurate and unreliable more common are one or two hour mechanical or electromechanical timers designed as parking reminders or for use in domestic appli ances the actual time delays set on ieds are frequently much less than the one or two hours availabl d electronic electronic timers offer the insu rgent longer and more accurate delays they may be modified production timers taken from digital watches cookers and video cassette reco rders or custom timers made up from series of microprocessor chips restricted issue 20 oct 07 12 2 restricted command operated ieds 4 general command initiated devices allow t he insurgent to choose the

command incident s must be treated with extreme caution as previously unseen device types may be encountered 5 types of command operated ieds command systems can be broken down into two main groups command linked linked systems have some form of continuous physical link between the firing point fp and the contact point cp the link may be visible or very well hidden but its exist ence means that it ma be detected and used to identify the fp and cp it may also be exploited to gain co ntrol of the device linked systems include 1 command wire cw 2 command pull 3 explosive link 4 fibre optic fo b command separated separated systems have physical link between the fp and cp separated systems offer t he insurgent the advantages of being easier to deploy and conceal the lack of physical link also

to create fear and vulnerabili ty selective attacks against high profile and symbolic ta rgets can demonstrate the enemys ab ility to strike reinforce his profile within the local community and attract media attention the threat of suicide bombers might influence the prof ile and conduct of security forces to the point that the mitigation measures necessary could undermine their ability to interact with the local population 2 suicide attack is technique which r equires the initiation of device that causes the death of the attacker the suicide attacker should be co nsidered as weapon system that can identify sele ct and engage target of choice it is therefore precise smart and guided suicide tactics are designed to achiev maximum effect for the sacrifice of the individual bomber

consider the severity of the threat and plan count ermeasures in order to reduce the likelihood of mine encounter or be prepared to react in manner that minimises the risk of further casualties general information 2 definition of mine an explosive munition designed to be placed under on or near the ground or other surface area and to be actuated by the presence proximity or contact of person land vehicle aircra ft or boat including landing craft 3 definition of uxo explosive ordnance which has been primed fused armed or otherwise prepared for use or used it could have been fir ed dropped launched or projected yet remains unexpl oded either through malfunction or design or for any other cause 4 definition of booby trap device designed constructed or adapted to kill or injure that functions when person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act 5 awareness mines uxo and booby traps are all designed to kill or injure and will not

and should be used as valuable information source where possible former com batants and medical personnel may be particularly useful they may have empl aced mines in the first instance or treated mine victims 8 patrol conduct prior to deployment it is essential that decision is tak as to whether or not the area of operations is min free or mine contam inated where ground is suspected as being mine contaminated but it is not possible to confirm planning must continue as though mines are present mine free despite ipb declaring an area mine free remember that mines can be localised it is therefore important continually to reassess the ground threat assessment must become rout ine throughout the entire duration of patrol to counter any recent use of mines b mine contaminated is it essential to

to emplace booby traps in buildings 10 minefield marking military most armies mark conventionally laid mines in areas likely to be entered by their own troops this is primar ily to prevent casualties to their own troops so marking on the home side may be more obvious peri meter marking will normally consist of fencing with itable warning signs attached b civilian there is clear difference bet ween military mine marking practices and those employed during humanitarian demini ng operations as general rule mine fence or tape should be crossed or stepped over c local marking local populations at risk in mine affected areas may use the following methods to mark known minefields 1 cairns of rockrubble 2 circles of rocks with the hazard lying centrally 3 lines of rocks may be painted often red and white red denoting the dangerous side and white denoting safe 4 crossed sticks 5 bottles and cans on top of sticks 6 animal bones placed in prominent places 11 combat indicators if markings are immediately visible in an area suspected to be mined it is important that basic tracki ng skills are used with extra vigilance and common sense signs to look out for include local behaviour locals avoiding certain r outes buildings fields and areas are good indication if appropriate they s hould be questioned about their actions b ground sign to place an object in the ground without leaving an

threat of mines they cann ot always be applied due to the operational situation but as far as is practic ably possible personnel should remember do not leave the hard standing where applicable hard standing or made surface offers protection as it is harder for mines to be deployed without detection b do not park or drive on verges the verges can conc eal hidden dangers such as the start of mine field discarded mines and unexploded ordnance so vehicle halts etc should be conducted on the safety of the hard standing only c do not become military tourist remember that where previous conflict has taken place the chances of mines uxo and boobytraps being present will be high stepping into the area to have phot taken could initiate unseen ordnance d do not pick up souvenirs by entering an area to collect attractive items you significantly increase the risk of init iating victimoperated device any items which are attractive and are in an unusua l place should be r egarded with extreme caution do not enter uncleared buildings entering buildings wh ich have not been cleared increase the risk of initiating devices by not ent ering them you significantly reduce the risk of triggering mine or booby trap f do not use uncleared routes any uncleared routes could be hazardous and must be treated with caution even if safe passage has b een made previously plan routes in advance and

following aims to maintain broad check on road move ment in order to provide reassurance to the local population b to frustrate the movement of arms ammunition and explosives c to assist in the enforcement of controls of movement of both people and materiel d to gather information and data on suspected persons and vehicles threat profile 2 the exact deployment of any vcp will depend on th threat when there is high threat from suicide vbieds di fferent procedures will need to be in place in particular the vcp will need to have standoff area where drivers must be forced to stop prior to entering the vcp location drivers can then be instructed to get out of the vehicles and show that they are not suicide bombers prior to being brought into the vcp area legal issues 3 in addition to the extant roe troops manning vcp must be well acquainted with their powers of search rrest and use of force types of vcp 4 permanent permanent vcps are in effect sm all bases or outstations set up to monitor traffic on daily and permanent basis they will typically be t up on main road coming into or out of city or on the edge of controlled area by their nature these installations are the quivalent of any other sf base or permanent op and the procedures for their manning occupation and protection are similar 5 deliberate deliberate vcps are typically us ed in support of another operation such as

in anot her area it may be ground or helicopter deployed and is positioned to interdic t hostile activity fo llowing the incident deliberate vcps 9 the tactical guidelines for setti ng up deliberate vcp are as follows concealment where the ground permits t he vcp should be sited where it cannot be seen from more t han short distance away s harp bends or dips in the road provide good positions prov ided that the requirements of road safety are met ideally there should be room for an approachi ng vehicle to take avoiding action by turning leaving the road or reversing b security there must

20 oct 07 16 1 restricted chapter 16 cordon operations introduction 1 cordon operations are us ually mounted against point or small area target they involve isolating the ta rget with troops and physical barrier s to ensure that there can be outside interference and that pers ons and objects inside are cont ained this provides sanitised area within which other agencies can operat resources permitting it is usual to mount two cordons around the target the outer cordon to pre vent interference from outside and an inner cordon to seal off the target and prevent movement out of the area aim 2 cordon operations may be mounted to support the following activities in response to an incident such as shooting explosion r find b ied clearances c searches area and route d engineer tasks such as demolitions and building work public events such as public meetings funerals and demonstrati ons f arrest confiscation and seizure operations g reactive operations cordon components 3 cordons normally compri the following elements the inner cordon usua lly static with arcs normally facing inwards to prevent any escape by suspect persons b the outer cordon us ually mobile in depth with arcs normally facing outwards to prevent any attack on the inner cordon locations c the incident control point icp the icp commands all cordon troops principles 4 general the principles of cordon operations are identical to the principles of defence mutual support restricted issue 20 oct 07 16 2 restricted b all round defence c depth d reserves offensive spirit f deception and concealment g communication 5 depth adequate depth is achiev ed by the use of ring of static inner cordon positions and satellite patrols of the outer cordon the i nner cordon provides intimate protection to the agencies working within it and provides t he fram ework against which satellite patrols can operate the satellite patr ols of the outer cordon provide early warning and protection to the static positions additional depth can be ac hieved by the use of mobile andor static vcps wit hin the area of the cordon operat ion but outside the range of the satellite patrols 6 mutual support individual positions mu st never be isolated they must have an appropriate level of combat power to combat the threat b coordination between the inner cordon positions and the satellite patrols must be rigorously tied down c the incident control point icp must be protected it s hould be within the ring of static inner cordon positions d all static elements of the cordon s hould have overlapping and interlocking arcs of observation and fire they must also all have communications with each other 7 all round defence the cordon must extend co mpletely around the target and prevent any movement into or out of the target area ever element of the cordon but particularly the static ements must maintain 360o situational awareness both visually and through maintaining listening watch to the communications means 8 offensive spirit the maintenance of an offensive spirit forces the enemy to keep low profile adds significant level of protection to the cordon operation and is good f or the morale of the troops involved in the cordon d epending on the resour ces available the duration and size of the cordon the fo llowing activities should be considered surge activity by patrols at different times throughout the operation as well as being conducted randomly the surge ma also be coordinated with specific activities by other agencies operating in t he cordon eg the arrival of helicopter b use of armed or attack helicopters to provide top cover during the operation or for specific phases restricted issue 20 oct 07 16 3 restricted c vcp operations either by satellite patrols in the area of the cordon andor by other troops operating in the general vicinity d standing patrols at night deployment of specialist teams such as snipers if available f active patrolling by satellites to blur the edges of

the cordon consi deration should also be given to holding larger reserveqrf away from the cordon ie at the nearest sf base which has been spec ifically briefed in support of the cordon operation ie they know the cordon t up location frequencies callsigns etc 10 deception and concealment concealment once cordon has been put in place there is little that can be achieved in terms of concealment in rural areas best use can s till be made of the ground to provide cover from fire and si ght in urban areas there should be maximum use of rooftops buildings and elev ated positions in order to give cordon troops greater protection and to deny the enemy the ability to dominate the ground b deception it is difficult to disguise the nat ure of the cordon once it has been established but steps can be taken to deceive observers as to the area of the cordon and its overall strength by using satellite patr ols and surge patrol activity to blur the edge of the cordon 11 communications all elements of the cordon must have reliable means of communicating with the icp i deally all should be equipped wit h radio to also allow for direct communication with any satellite patrols operating in their area on an all informed net limitations in the urban environment 12 the conduct of cordon operations in the urban environment will be extremely difficult and will limit the ability to fully adhere to all principles middle and far eastern countries i n particular are characterised by densely po pulated urban areas with many alleyways that will make it extremely difficult to seal off an area the ability of cordon locations to sup port each other mutually will be espe cially difficult and maximum use of satellite patrols will be required to provide depth protec tion cordons must be particu

16 deployment 1 order of insertion the order of insertion will often depend upon the terrain the threat the nature of the tar get the method of insertion and many other factors for example vehicles particularly armour should not move too close to the target location if surprise is to be achieved with the excepti on of the overwatch op ideally all elements of the cordon should deploy as simultaneously as possible so th at the cordon is effective before the target or any other hostile forces are able to react the normal method is to deploy the outer elements first and the inner elements last the most suitable order for insertion is generally as follows overwatch op deploys this provides information on any activity at the target and in the immediate vi cinity it may be deployed spec ifically in support of the cordon operation or may have been deployed previously and has ce been used to cue the cordon operation the op might even be from different unit to that deploying the cordon b outer cordon satellite patrols deploy satellite patrols will deploy to dominate the ground around the target area by conducting vcps standing patrols and route checks they may be used to cl ear and secure an hl s andor routes for the deployment of cordon troop s and other agencies they also help blur the edge of the cordon thus contri bute to the deception plan c inner cordon troops deploy the troops in the stat ic cordon should deploy as simultaneously and swiftly as possible so that the cordon is created quickly the icp party will usually deploy with the main body of the cordon d reserve deploys if the reserve has not been ab to deploy with the main body of the cordon they will ploy next and typically establish at or close to the icp other agencies deploy once the cordon is est ablished other agencies eg resa and ato can deploy to operate within the sanitised area 2 method of insertion insertion may be by foot vehi cle helicopter boat or any combination the exact method will be dictated by the na ture of the ground eg limited access by vehicle whether time is factor eg the target ma only be present for short time whether covert approach is required eg covert infiltration at night on foot in order to surprise the target preserving forensic evi dence and minimising the chances of hostile interference from outside t he cordon and the threat 3 aviation

any attack will have been given in the convoy orders and will depend upon the nature of the attack and the make up of the convoy in all cases though personnel withi n vehicles must maintain an offensive mindset and be prepared to supp ress any enemy using all weapons at their disposal within their allocated arcs if an escort force is deployed it will be the escort that takes substantive

the convoy the convoy comd must remember that driv ers will not be trained or armed may speak little or english and may well have cultural differences civilian vehicles are unlikely to have the same terrain capabilities as militar vehicles military vehicles will usually need to be spread throughout the convoy in order to afford civilian vehicles the necessary protection manpower will be required to control and protect the drivers in the event of an incident and the pr ocedures and personnel responsible should be nominated during the group drivers must be fully brief ed on breakdown procedure and the likelihood that if their vehicle cannot be fixed or hook ed up for towing within the allotted period then it will be abandon ed and may be destroyed conv oy comds must bear opsec in mind at

halt areas during the conv oy planning phase and specify them in orders halt areas must be secured prior to use by either the escort force or internal fp assets if possi ble escorts and fp vehicles should provide overwatch from depth locations whilst the site is in use i rrespective of whether the site has been secured all personnel must conduct 5 20m checks on dismounting 2 defiles in several theatres insurgents make good use of defiles as killing areas and convoys are therefore vulnerabl within them defiles can be defined as either short or long short defile is one wh ere the end can be seen from the start long defile is one where the end cannot be from the start defiles can be cleared either dismounted or mounted this being command decision bas ed upon time the threat and resources available without an escort force it is unlikely that suffici ent troops will be available to conduct dismounted clearance it is worth noting that defiles can be created using obstacles such as parked vehicles etc to channel convoys into killing areas the following techniques should be used for mounted clearance short defile fp vehicles or escort should recce the area prior to the defile once satisfied that the area is secure t hey should move through the defile tactically conducting vp va checks as required they should then advance one tactical bound forward or move into overwatch and wait for the convoy t pass through b long defile traversing long defiles should be done as quickly as possible the convoy is vulnerable if halted and must be stationary for the shortest possible time 1 escort forces or internal fp vehi cles should recce t he area short of the defile once satisfied that the area is cure they should move into the defile up to point where they c an see the next leg but still maintain line of sight with the start of the defile 2 fp vehicles with the main body s hould by this time have moved into the start of the defile these vehicles should then move up to the escort forces securing that part of the defile which will then move forward further tactical bound 3 this procedure is then repeated unt il all forces are through the defile 4 whilst the defile is being cleared any static convoys should adopt 50 standto posture with dismounted fo rces always conducting 5 and 20m checks 5 if sufficient escort forces are av ailable consideration should be given

suspect and the convoy should be halted well short of the approaches any small village that may be considered suspici ous should be entered and exited with extreme caution fp vehicles should conduct recce to see if anything is out of place b fp assets should then move thr ough the village tactically in bounds c maximum use of depth satellite callsi gns is to be encouraged in order to sow doubt in the mind of potential attackers d the village should be treated as def ile with fp callsigns establishing overwatch and providing security as the main body moves through 4 towns and built up areas if there is threat towns and built up areas should b bypassed if possible the close proximity of buildings to t he road and lack of clear escape routes coupled with possible rge numbers of civilians and heavy traffic makes any reaction to attack extremely difficult if to wn cannot be avoided additional forces may well be required in order to allow the convoy to move through it without interference from traffic whilst enabling the convoy to remain alert to the threat the use of an escort force in addition to internal fp assets shoul d normally be considered as obligatory the escort force should deploy we ll before the arrival of the convoy b the escort force should conduct rout check of the proposed route carrying out vp and va drills as required c the escort force should consider pic

commanders must respond in mely robust and effective manner escorts and vehicle crews must re main vigilant and aware at all times 2 immediate action the mnemonic fear remains as pertinent to convoys as it is to other forms of contact in essence it is as follows find and fire identify the enemy and retu rn fire within the roe b extract get out of the killing area as qui ckly as possible this may mean the convoy moving forwards r earwards or to the flanks c assess and act the commander needs to conduct quick estimate identify his plan communicate it through th convoy and initiate action as

outcomes of an ambush progress not held up any vehicle which comes under harassing fire possibly from lone gunman in areas w here the road is more open should keep going and accelerate the vehicle crew should attempt to ascertain where the fire is coming from and return fire in accordanc with the roe if communications are available in the vehicle which there shoul d be contact report should be sent to the convoy comd thus alerting the remain der of the convoy the convoy comd should then direct any fp or escort assets to engage the enemy if possible whilst the remainder of the convoy gets

contact zone b progress held up if any vehicles are dis abled or the route ahead is blocked in any way swift ac tion is crucial the compos ition of the convoy and the availability of firepower wil l dictate the response and commanders must be prepared to act quickly in general the following action should be taken 1 vehicles crews in the contact zone return fire and send co ntact report 2 if the

demanding and extremely difficult to control responses to incidents of public disorder vary from tolerance escalating through riot control to the use of lethal force aim of po operations 5 the aim of any po operation must be to achieve designated mission whilst preserving the peace minor br eaches of law and order may have to be tolerated in order to prevent an escalation of disorder 6 where crowd violence occurs commander s should adopt riot control posture and use riot control tactics in or der to restore the situation to point where the mission can be completed the use of riot c ontrol tactics provides opportunities for the security forces to be photographed and seen in an aggressive posture that can lead to negative propaganda riot control techniques should therefore only be adopted when necessary and only once other attempts to deescalate violent situation have failed principles of po operations 7 the principles of po operations are preventative approach deescalatory

the roe and legal constraints on t he application of force by soldiers will be broadly similar to t hose for the police force b in the absence of effective policing the deployment of military forces on po operations in the absence of an effective police force may arise when the civil police have lost control of disorder or when operating in state where law enforcement institutions do not exist ar discredited or have collapsed such deployments carry with them the following implications 1 military forces are likely to be responsible for relationships w ith the local community its representativ and for crowd management this requirement is likely to have to be met against background of poor intelligence and language difficulties 2 military forces will be constrained by international law and the need to apply reasonable and propor tionate force restricted issue 20 oct 07 18 3 restricted 3 military forces may be able to reso rt to equipment and tactics that would be considered polit ically

deescalation below the violence threshold which may enable the restoration of order 2 intelligence understanding the local area its geography and demographic make up and the wider political situation will assist commanders in identifying potential flashpoints for public disorder local intelligence includ ing combat indicators from patrols can often provide early warning of crowd events commanders must be prepared to listen to community concerns and should establish liaison with community and tribal leaders whenever possible the following process can be used to assist in identifying who will be of most use in influencing the community identify stakeholders identify those who may have stake in forthcoming crowd event stakeholders may include 1 religious leaders 2 tribal leaders 3 civic leaders 4 local police service 5 shopkeepers 6 business representatives 7 street vendors b identify suitable representatives once stakeholders have been identified filtering process must be conducted to identify those stakeholders that are appropriate to act as intermediaries between the security forces and the crowd 3 facilitation security forces must consider whet her gathering is legal or illegal as it will influence the force posture and met hod of interaction with the crowd illegal crowd events security forces should refrain from adopting black or white approach to an illegal crowd event as to do so will often result in confrontation the riot that follows robust attempt t uphold law and order by the security forces will cause damage and distru st that may far outweigh and outlast the often transient impact of the wbreaking activity in some circumstances it may be better to allow illegal crowd activity parti cularly noisy but non violent demonstrations or protests to continue unchecked in anticipation of the crowd dispersing restricted issue 20 oct 07 18 c 2 restricted commanders will have to weigh up the risks i nherent with the deployment of public order troops against allowing minor criminal acti vities such as loot ing to continue looting may not be as damaging as the wholesale destruction of the street during riot credibility of the curity force must also be considered and illegal activity can not be allowed to escalate unchecked commanders must use common sense when responding to illegal crowd activity b legal crowd events where crowd events are legal the security forces must do all they can to assist the mbers of the crowd and their nominated representatives the communi ty and thus the crowd must assume responsibility for its own policing whenever it can be achi eved where relationships have been established with effective community repres entatives prior to the event steps should be taken to ensure the appoint ment of stewards or ma rshals from within the community in the absence of estab lished relationships with community representatives it may be necessary to enlis t the assistance of those as they are identified who have influence over the crowd throughout legal crowd events the security forces should adopt the softest po ssible posture towards the crowd the attitude of the security forces should be one of facilitation rather than confrontation 4 communication poor communication and ssociated misunderstandings can enflame grievances and result in confrontat ion interaction with the crowd and with community representatives will i dentify issues that need clarification commanders must try to identify and manage false expectations and fa cilitate the passage of information to the crowd via its representatives 5 legitimacy the security forces will gain legiti macy in the eyes of the crowd if they can be seen to be acting reasonably as far as possible people in the crowd must be treated and addressed as individuals if securi ty force actions are not lawful proportionate and disciplined then credi bility will be lost along with any ab ility to influence it other than through the threat of force 6 balance hostile elements may have vested in terest in provoking riot crowd violence may be inevitable regardless of the security force postu re adopted commanders must retain tactical balance throughout crowd event specific considerations include preventing the isolation or separation of elements of the security forces by the crowd b having robust extraction plan for the security force elemen ts in soft posture whose task was interaction with the crowd c having public order trained and equipped reserves poised to st abilise violent situation and enable the extraction of troops insufficiently robustly

18 c 3 restricted crowd management techniques 7 some crowd management chniques which can be used by the security forces include reducing the size of the crowd crowd will be easier to manage and is less likely to become violent if it is sma ller and does not perceive that it carries substantial numerical advantage over the security forces the crowd around specific point event should be minimised two techniques can assist with this process 1 timing where the timing and structur of an event is within the control of the security forces consi deration should be gi ven to staging number of small events c onsecutively over time rather than one mass event that may draw large crow d examples include the distribution of food to specific areas over week rather than r unning single district food point in such cases it is vital that the prospec t of later distributi on is credible and liaison with community represent atives will be critical to maintaining credibility 2 filtering and screening the crowd should not be allowed access or view of the focal point of crowd ev ent where possible filtering and the careful positioning of screens will assist with this process the filtering process must be seen to be fair and impartial credible community representatives can assist with this proc ess in addition to denying the crowd the opportunity to rush the focal poi nt filtering and scr eening will serve to discourage the viewer groups who make up the majority of any crowd the crowd will thus be substantially smaller b queuing and waiting crowd will naturally wa it around if they perceive that there is benefit in doing so organising the wa iting crowd into queue can be challenge and is an activity that shou ld be conducted with the minimum of confrontation of critical importance to the members of any waiting crowd is an understanding that by conforming ie queuing their turn wi ll come tensions will rise quickly and understandably if the re ward is denied to those who have waited several hours in anticipation techni ques associated with queuing and waiting are as follows 1 communication members of waiti ngqueuing crowd must be regularly updated on progress convergers arriving at the back of the queue should be given realistic appraisa l of the chances of success and the waiting time involved 2 anticipation the security forces must be alert to individuals in queue who appear to become agitated and move quickly to seek an explanation it may be that there is genuine gr ievance that can be addressed community r epresentatives and appointed marshals from within that community should be instrumental in any rectifying action particularly if the issue causing concern is contentious restricted issue 20 oct 07 18 c 4 restricted 3 routeing the route of the queue and t he use of lightweight barriers will provide those in t he queue with perception of progress winding queue pattern as used in most airports will reduce the perception of distance to the filter point and will give th perception of in creased progress 4 exploitation people waiting in crowd may present captive audience for the distribution of info rmation operations lit erature good humoured interaction by individuals moving amongst members of the crowd can also decrease tension c negotiation commanders must be prepared to negotiate with identified community representatives the start of crowd violence should not bring negotiation to halt negotiation is best conduc ted on one to one basis and commanders should not negotiate with group of people cu ltural issues will di ctate the approach to be taken but adherence to some key principles has proved to work 1 appearance eye contact is vital for successful negotiation commanders should not negotiate w earing sunglasses or other headgear which hides the face and eyes negotia tors should adopt as soft posture as possible and wear the minimum of protec tive equipment as the threat allows during negotiations 2 deescalatory the aim of robust negotiation is to deescalate the situation and to keep or restore the peace negot iations must therefore be deescalatory in nature commanders must continue to stress their objective as peacemaker and stress that progress cannot be made until peace is restored this should be portrayed as common goal for both parties authority should not be negot iated concessions may be made as part of the negotiation process but commanders must be clear on what can be conceded and what can not the right of the security forces to be present and engaged in public order operations shou ld not be negotiated d clarity commanders should make clear what they want the crowd to do in particular stipulating the bounda ries and limits for forward movement of the crowd commanders should make clear the consequenc and security force responses to cooperation and noncompliance with securi ty force requests commanders should avoid pleading with community representatives and issue delib erate direct warnings of impending retaliatory action to community representatives in situations where unacceptable crowd behaviour exists relevance the local commander can only influence the immediate and local situation local commander s should not engage in discussions about operational and strategic issues and associ ated grievances as they can lead to inappropriate expressions of em pathy by security forces f retain the initiative commanders may find themse lves taking tactical risks in order to deescalate situation and retain the initiative junior

professional and reasonable throughout negotiations they must listen to the grievances of the community and attempt to fi nd solution that deescalates the situation in accordance with the commanders intent and without compromising the position of the security forces negotiations can often be frustrating and commanders must remain calm and focused commanders s hould not make promises but can give

detailed lessons being learned selection of which are reproduc ed here landrovers and other light vehicles can be pushed over onto their sides by as few as six men care should be taken not to present the si of light vehicle to violent crowd without second vehicle being positioned closely alongside to prevent tipping over when moving through crowd v ehicles should creep forward so that the crowd has difficulty getti ng purchase on the vehicle care should be taken to nudge individuals away from the front of the vehicle without running them over b the last soldier to dismount from vehicle should ensure the doors and top cover hatch are locked to prevent the crow d gaining access to the inside of the vehicle drivers should ens ure the driver and passenger doors are locked if the vehicle is not fitted with dead locks the driver should consider using the seat belt wrapped around the door handle to stop the door from being opened c security forces must be well rehearsed in embussing and debussing drills for all vehicle types used in the oper ation all soldiers should be familiar with the vehicle stowage plan which should be included in unit sops d prior to deploying drivers should ali gn the vehicle wheels to point forward and mark the top of the steeri ng wheel with tape the direction in which the driving wheels are pointing will thus be easily ascertainable even when the

conduct ed too late the crowd may have reached the vehicles b exposure rapid advance into an open area by dismounted troops can lead to the baseline having to fight on three fronts as their flanks are unprotected the time that dismounted troops spend in front of vehicles should be minimised when vehicles are in the hard line formation c support baton gunners and firemen must deploy forward to provide support to the baseline d protection troops positioned in front of vehicles are vulnerable to missile attack when in front of vehicles tr oops should be moving to present moving target that is more diffic ult to hit troops should then withdraw behind the vehicles as soon as possible aggression cqrs must be sufficiently aggressive to turn the crowd and force the crowd to withdraw they must go far enough forward to enable vehicles to move forward prior to the troops withdrawin g if cqrs are poorly executed they will have little effect on the crowd warrior in public order operations 9 warrior wr equipped platoons like other vehicle equipped platoons are vulnerable to encirclement and care must be exercised so that platoons are not overextended which may lead to vehicles being surrounded the lack of numbers of vehicles and limited reaction options available to wr commanders may encourage the crowd to escalate the level of violence unl ess wr afvs are integrated with dismounted troops the deployment of wr will place ph ysical barrier between the troops and the crowd and may have psychological effect on insurgents and crowds wr provides useful platform from which po comander can observe the crowd and make changes to his tactics snipers should be deployed to po sitions of overwatch to cover the dismounting of troops from wr and the est ablishment of baseline 10 wr is likely to be deployed into po situations where th ere is high risk of attack by small arms grenades or heavy weapons in such situations wr should be pushed forward of dismounted troops wherever possible and should lead advances in line abreast where the terrain allows drivers need to be well rehearsed in the drills associated with manoeuvring in close proximity to dismount ed troops and civilians commanders may decide to use wr to disperse crowd without support from di smounted troops where such an action has not been successful wr s hould either push on th rough the crowd or withdraw to safe area where troops can be dismounted troops should not be dismounted in close proximity to the crowd 11 where wr is used in conj unction with shield teams the wr shoul d be pushed to

better to be cautions than ca reless avoid thinking about the past focus on the present doing so will allow successf ul identification of subtle clues 5 action after identifying something out of the ordinary it is important to decide what to do about it eg look for cover concealment or escape routes it is crucial that an initial reaction is appropriate and timely and that in taking it troops do t forget what triggered it in the first place 6 training and briefing only through consistent and t horough application of skills and tools training coupled with comp rehensive understanding of the

general and systematic exami nation of specific area of interest to detect any unusual dist urbance or interference scanning is as visual search and should not at this st age progress to physical search the scan area is broken down into 1 foreground 2 middle distance 3 far distance the optimal technique is to scan each area horizontally starting with the foreground maximum efficiency is gained by moving the head in short overl apping movements in figure of eight motion move the head rat her than the eyes to reduce eye fatigue the speed at which the scanning process is carried out will

the most reliable method of ageing person is to bracket them allow three year bracket around the age you believe them to be for example man aged 27 would be bracketed 26 to 28 another thod is to place the subject in general category eg late teens or early 20s whichever method is adopted it wi ll only give an approximate age remember that women in particular can be difficult to age correctly 4 build build refers to the size and shape of the individual this should be kept simple for example slimthin pot bellied stout sto cky fat or plump avoid using the terms smallmediumlarge build wh ich people interpret from their own perspective 5 clothing clothing can be used to disgui an individuals bui ld when describing clothes work from the top to bottom and include anything that the subject may be carrying the sun can affect the perceived colour when using viewing devices use dark or light coloured if in doubt avoid brand names be accurate and only record what you can see remember clothing is an unreliable recogniti on feature as it can be changed easily 6 distinguishing marks when describing dist inguishing marks it can be useful to ask the question what make s the subject stand out from others examples of distinguishing marks can be scars burns tattoos acne or moles the greater the accuracy and detail included in the description of t he distinguishing mark the more helpful the description is to others tr to add details of the type co lour and exact location of the distinguishing mark 7 elevation judging elevation or height is made more difficult when looking down on subject

photographic evidence of an inci dent has been captured it is important that the frames used should be correlated with the sightings entered in the log the digital memory should be handled as evidence c video video evidence can be extremely useful provid ed that the tape has been correctly accounted for there are number of considerations which should be taken into account 1 the dtg display on the vcr ca mcorder must be correctly set and visible on any tape recording the time on the video monitor is the time to be used on all log entries the vcr tape position counter should be zeroed at this time and also used as referenc in the log these procedures ensure that any video evidence is coo rdinated with written evidence 2 for full continuity of evidence an sequence of video footage should be supported by complete coverage of t hat day up to and including the event this may be achieved by using 24 hr time lapse vcrs so that complete 24 hr period is recorded onto one tape op s should ensure that when recording an event of interest the vcr is switc hed to three hr mode to improve the quality of the recording 3 these continuity tapes should be continuously recording whilst the op is operational they should be changed ov er at midnight logged and stored the time period of storage and method of handling will be dire cted by bn hq 2 treatment of evidence if potential evidence is

control and communications c3 will be exercised either through the commander on the ground the operat ions roomcentre or combination of both this chapter deals with procedures to be followed by all staff working in an ops room 2 the main business of the ops room staff is to control forces placed under command the commander is likely to spend much of his time on the ground giving orders and direction it is the role of the ops room staff to convert that direction into tangible effects on the ground an effective ops room gives sold iers on the ground confidenc that they will be looked after in the event of an incident an ine ffective ops room can result in lives being put at risk principles for ops room procedures 4 those working in an ops room should adhere to five key prin ciples situational awareness ops room staff must be awar of all activity in their area of operations ao in detail as we ll as being aware of the operations of flanking forces they should also have good understanding of th wider context in which they are operating ie t heir higher commanders intent b support to deployed forces ops room staff are there to support deployed troops the threat faced by those deployed troops and the risk to soldiers lives must be foremost in the mind of all ops room staff the staff sho uld deploy whenever possible in order to underst and the operating environment c anticipation good ops room will anticipate it will cue assets be fore they are requested and will take pressure off deployed troops d accuracy ops room staff must be accurate in their work they should also always check information for accuracy since it will often be sent to them by troops in contact who are under great pressure coordination good ops room will coordinat troops effectively in order to achieve the relevant intent all troops s hould be made aware of other operations in the vicinity in order to ensure that ll activity is coordinated effectively liaison 5 liaison is defined as the communication and contact between groups it has to be both horizontal internal within the unit and external to ot her unitsorganisations and vertical up and down the chain of command as well as being able to pass current information frequent liaison so engenders sense of trust confidence and understanding in other organisations the tendency fo r organisations and departments to become introspective must be avoided restricted issue 20 oct 07 20 2 restricted horizontal liaison 1 internal passage of information between ops moom and int cells so that both develop an accurate pictur of what is happening on the ground 2 external links to the local polic and other agencies must be encouraged and nurtured links to flanking military units shou ld also be encouraged particularly in multinational setting b vertical liaison feedback to and from sub units is essential to maintain situational awareness and to ensure that information is reported analysed and acted on in timely manner reporting to s uperior hq must be clear and factual ensuring that opinion is not reported and that the mean ing of messages does not change during transmission 6 information in order to be effective an ops room must hold and evaluate information background information 1 maps covering variety of scales typical examples are own ao in detail master ops map this should be prominently displayed and in positi on where it can be written on it must be kept up to date and location of all troops should be shown b next level up ao map this should also be visible and should have flanking units boundaries other operations etc all marked up c tribal religious demographic maps other maps may show tribal areas religious zones etc d detailed town village maps there may be large scale maps of prominent towns or villages base security map there should be map or aerial photograph showing the lay out of the sf base in which the ops room is located this may be gridded or split into zones to enable effective clearance in case of base attack 2 photographs both aerial and ground based showing key route junctions incident black spots k nown flashpoints sf bases etc 3 contact details as well as the contact details of key personalities including details of their off duty locati on it is useful to have the number of other agencies civic personal ities etc the int ce ll may also keep wider records

agencies from media reports local knowledge and considered speculation it forms part of the ops room lore and may be considered when planning or reacting to an incident 7 practical considerations an efficient ops room will preempt the requirements of commanders on the ground and aim off for agency task ing thus reducing reaction time balance must be struck between coaxing informa tion from deployed troops and interfering in their operation informal action in the event of an incident callsigns not involved can b minimised superior hqs and key agencies can be given preliminary warning of

their availability ai rcraft in transit could be diverted to provide top cover deception or troop movement 2 reinforcement troops can be considered and ntm reduced accordingly 3 agencies can be given

accommodation restricted issue 20 oct 07 20 4 restricted 8 tasking procedure tasking procedures are well est ablished in theatre giving the agency involved sufficient information to prepare fo r the forthcoming task the exact nature of tasking procedures may be modified by super ior hqs in order better to meet the prevailing situation and attempt is made to reproduce them in this chapter all troops or agencies who are deploying in reaction to an incident must be given thorough brief and defined mission this is especially true of th qrf who are often tasked without specific purpose 9

restricted chapter 21 use of interpreters introduction 1 language difficulties can arise at any stage in the conduct of operations in theatre where english is not widely spok this can also be pr oblem on combined operations exacerbated by differences in doctrine traini ng military culture and capability such problems can be overcome by employing interpre ters who may be uk military or civilian personnel or locally employed civilians lecs the latter may be employed direct or provided as part of the host nation support hns military interpreters 2 military interpreters will be required from the earliest stages of military planning through any deployment into and eventual withdrawal from t heatre of operations the scale of provision will depend on the requi rement to interpret between the military force and other parties on whether the environment is fr iendly or hostile on the language of allied and coalition partners and on the nature of the operational theatre 3 the extent to which local nationals ca n be used will depend upo n the nature of the operations but it does not remove the require ment for some servicemen to speak the languages concerned the deployed force shoul d have number of military interpreters on strength who can assess the abilities employ deploy nd monitor the performance of any local interpreters b replace local staff when security milit ary or political cons iderations require interpretation of sensitive information c deal with military vocabulary beyond the scope of the loca l interpreters 4 in certain situations and environments the rank of the military interpreter may be important if he or she is to hav credibility in the eyes of t he local politicalmilitary leaders use of local interpreters 5 before employing lecs as interpreters i t w i l l b n c s s r t s s s s t h i r capabilities and possibly their politic affiliation employing cal people as interpreters has security implications both for information and for the physical security of the persons involved the use of lecs in policy making st aff areas will generally be inappropriate in any operation knowledge of the politicalculturalreligious ffiliation of individual local interpreters could be of vital im portance in certain situations 6 consideration has to be given to the basis on which interpreters will be employed as it will be rare for their services to be requ ired on permanent basis they may also have to be employed in other secondary ro which will require them to demonstrate wider military skills and possibly some flexibility restricted issue 20 oct 07 21 2 restricted guidelines on the use of lec interpreters 7 these guidelines1 provide commanders and others using or managing lec interpreters with guidance to assi st them in getting the best serv ice from their interpreters the guidelines focus on how interpreters should be used in practical work situations and some related administrative issues 8 the function of the interpreter is to facilitate communication and understanding heshe is the filter th rough which much if not most of t he local information you receive will pass how you use this filter is mainly up to you as the user you will achieve better communication and understanding through interpreters if you are aware of their strengths and limitations 9 interpreters are either allocated to s upport an individual or small group of personnel or are placed in pool from which all ca n demand support the assumption in these guidelines is that you will dev elop some familiarity with the interpreter you use even if heshe is drawn from the pool 10 the three main tasks performed by interpre ters are assisting in speaking to groups such as trainees or crowds informal cont act with locals such as on patrol and planned meetings often with single indi viduals at their request the guidance here is most relevant to interpreting for planned meeti ngs but can be easily adapted to the other circumstances 11 some useful terms in deal ing with interpreters are linguists are those who have comm and of two or more languages some linguists are required to act as interpreters although it is recognised that interpreting is specialist skill that requires training note that such training is not yet available to most linguists both uk and lec who are tasked to perform as int erpreters b translating rendering the wr itten word in another language c written translation written translation of written document d sight translation verbal translation of written document interpreting rendering the spoken word in another lang uage 1 simultaneous interpreting listen ing in one language and speaking in the other at the same time probably sentence or so behind used when speech cannot be interrupted in formal conferences where the interpreter is in booth and you hear our language through headphones or when listening to speeches or announcements where the interpreter can whisper to you as the speech progresses simultaneous in terpreting is very demanding and is unlikely to be either availabl or much needed on operations 1 these guidelines are not rules it is expected that t hose using lec interpreters will find some parts of these guidelines more useful and informative than others in order to develop and improve these guidelines it would be helpful if any feedback is passed to so2 langua ges hq detsa trenchard lines upavon wiltshire sn9 6bp restricted issue 20 oct 07 21 3 restricted 2 consecutive interpreting you speak in english then your i nterpreter renders this in the foreign language your interlocutor replies the interpreter renders this into english and so on this is less demanding skill and far more appropriate to most operational si tuations these guidelines will focus on consecutive interpreting 12 properly used lec interpreters can be the best means to understand the local population improperly used th least bad thing that coul d happen is that valuable potential resource is squandered some comm anders will have natural flair for working with lec interpreters and will quickly estab lish an excellent re lationship with them2 f r such fortunates these guidelines will probably be most useful at the star t of the tour and then as an occasional referenc others will find it difficult for whatever reason to establish good relationship with their interpreters3 the least that must be expected in these circumstances is that the relationshi p is professional and functional based on the advice in these guidelines 13 many of the lec interpre ters will be members of the local elite often respected professionals who in local co mparative terms believe themselves to be better educated and of higher social status t han many of the uk military per sonnel they encounter this can be source of great interest but is also potentially problem do not expect such interpreters to understand the entir range of their own society they will know their social strata well but may be less familiar with other s this may be particularly marked when dealing with rural or tribal leaders they w ill certainly have great difficulty understanding many of the uk military personnel with whom they work 14 they may have military experience of so sort some may be exsoldiers and will view our restraint and concern for the rule of law as sign of weakness this subject is best dealt with openly in discussion and the outcome reported if appropriate and necessary 15 interpreters change as they become more experienced and comforta ble in their role from an initial position of wary uncertainty and diffidence often approac hing fear by their third or fourth rotation of tr oops they will often understand the mission and sops as well as many incoming troops care must be exercised in exploiting this experi ence but without in any way becoming subordinate to it or too depen dent the risks are greatest in specialist areas where the interpreter is dealing with the same group of local interlocutors on regular basis the options are to either rotate the interprete r to other tasks or seek to employ him in different capacity that rec ognises and controls his role as an lec staff officer or civil servant equivalent 16 interpreters will be viewed differently because of the ir employment by the uk military there will be some envy some contempt some suspicion but they will always be regarded as knowledgeable so urce of information about british troops sops etc 2 all will be aware of the range of potenti risks if the relationship becomes too close while this i s subject in its own right two risks of over reliance on singl source are worth noting here those of distortion and dependency 3 in small minority of cases the problem will be prejudi ce while it is impossible to legislate against attitudes commanders should be in doubt that bigoted behaviour will not be acceptable however in most cases the problem will be clash of per sonalities in these cases there sh ould be difficulty arranging the reassignment of lec interpreters should such rea ssignment prove impossible the next best option is to move to pool system restricted issue 20 oct 07 21 4 restricted 17 interpreters live in the local community despite any vetting they may have received there is high risk that the det ail of your conversations will be passed on indeed since u cannot protect them and their family at home you should assume that they will pass everything on if under any pressu re to do so in establishi ng your relationship you may wish to tell them that the safety and security of their family must come first as it would for you in similar circumstances if this may cause problem do not use lec interpreter 18 it is impossible not to form some sort of human relationship with your interpreter since this is inevitable it might as well occur on your terms and in manner that is comfortable to you some will be happy to exchange life stories and develop friendships others will prefer more reserved relationship learn to do the small talk appropriate to the level of relationship you seek it is always worthwhile chatting about what is being covered on the local and international media local problems and issues and the general reaction of the local community to t he british military pr esence and activity 19 if you cannot discuss religion with knowledge sensitivit and genuine interest avoid talking about it at all differenc of faith create ample opportunity for misunderstanding and unintentional slights greatly ex acerbated by any hist oric tensions therefore particularly if you are secular or atheistagnostic you will need to be exceptionally careful about discussing religion 20 finally be aware that lec interpreters will almost certainly not be trained professional interpreter but local who has reaso nable english their effectiveness is therefore critically dep endent on the guidance and support received from you 21 working with lec interpreters general points 1 there is substitute for experi ence you should expect to get better at using interpreters and should theref ore start with modest expectations try and avoid the trap of seeking consistenc from the start at the price of learning and adapting 2 pick the right interpreter for the meeti ng if you are not sure if heshe is the right person for the task ask if nece ssary by outlining the task in general terms for example your interprete r will normally be male there may be cases where female interpreter w ould be more appropriate rape investigation for example or hous search where the only occupants are female if in doubt seek advice from trusted local 3 have clear idea of what it is you wish to achieve from the meeting but develop healthy unease if you achieve your aim too easily always seek corroboration 4 plan how you are going to achieve your aim direct question is unlikely to elicit the answer you need in all but the most exceptional circumstances it is best to have two or more planned approache s from which to chose depending on the early exchanges restricted issue 20 oct 07 21 5 restricted 5 be alert to the possibility of gathering useful information beyond the immediate requirementsinterests b before meetings 1 as far as possible get to know your interpreter and hisher ab ilities 2 give the interpreter as much advanc warning as possible if possible give an outline of the subject matter so that heshe can pr epare any specific terminology this applies to milit ary language concepts and abbreviations how much would your british civilian friends understand of typical military conversation 3 brief the interpreter to repeat what is being said during the meeting not to give you summary or evaluation 4 brief the interpreter not to analyse judge or edit what is being said4 5 an interpreter will not understand ever ything you say in english but will probably not want to say so in front of others potentia l loss of face make sure heshe knows that he should ask if he is not sure you will be far more irritated if heshe guesses and gets it wrong 6 if possible and appropriate let him her know that you will make overt use of audio recording not only will this encourage interpre ters to be more accurate in their work it will also prov ide you with record of the interaction that could be translated into written re cord mp3 players now allow cheap reliable and extended digital recording 7 take part in interpreter training if possible this will help you to understand the interpreters task better and practise your own skills in using an interpreter if formal tr aining is not available ther is nothing to stop you arranging role playing scenarios with two interpreters and yourself c during meetings 1 complete appropriate formalities our status will be ei ther that of host or guest it is necessary for you to understand the differe nce between these roles and the implications it s hould have on your behaviour in some circumstances you will wish to dispense with all formalities to make point but this should be done deliberately and knowle dgeably not out of ignorance as the interpreters boss it is for you to do this 2 at your direction and if appropriate the interpreter should introduce himselfherself and explain hisher role to give an impa rtial and complete rendition of all that is said 4 what the interpreter can do is to explain the culture or context to you but as an aside and by making clear distinction between interpretation and the wider explanat ion restricted issue 20 oct 07 21 6 restricted 3 if you consider it necessary you s hould direct the interpreter to briefly explain that he will only intervene in the following types of situation to ask for clarification b if one party may not have fully understood something c if there has been missed cultur inference knowledge of piece of information has been wrongly assumed d if the speech is too quiet or too fast 4 establish how your interlocutors name should be recorded an d how heshe wishes to be addressed 5 if appropriate ask the interlocutor if heshe is content to use your interpreter or would prefer to provide one of hisher own if your interpreter is to be used make point of ordering hi m politely but firmly to the position you prefer where possible set the meeting up in quiet room where you are facing your interlocutor for exampl you could face each other across table with the interpreter at the end of the table so t hat heshe is not physically perceived as being on one side or the other 6 if this is follow up meeting with the same interlocutor much of the preliminary detail above can be dispensed with on the other hand you may wish to remind himher of your previous discussion and any ac tions that have followed in the interim 7 speak slowly 8 speak directly to your interloc utor and look at himher not the interpreter 9 use simple clear unambiguous language 10 if you make an error or use language clumsily do not hesita to tell the interpreter to ignore your last sentence try again 11 listen carefully and pay particular attention to body language with experience it is possible to gai n good understanding of what your interlocutor is saying even without under standing his words this gives you additional thinking time while the interpreter is confirming your initial impressions if the interpretation differs from your initial imp ression then either you are not very good at reading body language or your interpreter is not being accurate 12 expect misunderstandings remem ber you will probably be far more experienced in the use of interpreters than your interlocutor w hose struggle to communicate effectively may be even harder than yours additionally the interlocutor will probably have far more to gain or lose from the meeting than restricted issue 20 oct 07 21 7 restricted do you he will so be uncertain about the allegianc of the interpreter he is therefore likely to be under greater stress than you and you should expect him to make mistakes in expressing himself if aware of this i t will not take you long to learn how to exploit this to your advantage 13 stop for interpreting every sentence or two 1020 words complete sentence or thought before pausing so t hat the interpreter can understand the whole idea foreign language word order can differ from english word order this is another reason for completing your sentence first 14 be aware that so languages eg arabic can take 2030 more words to express the same idea this will increase if phr ase is needed to explain an unfamiliar word or concept 15 allow your interpreter to take notes especially for names numbers times dates etc so that these are correctly rendered 16 your interpreter should use the same person and tense as you do almost always you should speak in th first person and so should he for example speak directly to your interl ocutor as if he can understand what you are saying you should not say tell him that and the inte rpreter should not say back to you he said that 17 allow at least twice the norma l time for meetings obviously everything will need to be said twice and explanations may be needed to accommodate different cultural perceptions and backgrounds 18 if you are not sure about backgr ound information ask your interlocutor not the interpreter it is not your interpreters job to act as an adviser or negotiator if he adopts one of these roles he is controlling the meeting not you the interpreters pattern of speech will then change and your interlocutor will longer be clear about who is in charge 19 ensure that you have some basic cultural awareness so that you do not inadvertently give offence and can begin to sense your interlocutors meaning for example body language varies between cultures over 50 of communication is nonverbal what is m eant by gestures eye contact lack of eye contact or other body language 20 avoid private discussions with your interpreter unless you wish to do so for deliberate effect your inte rlocutor may feel uncomfortable marginalised excluded or offended 21 humour your idea of what is funny may not be the same as others avoid the risk of giving offence jokes may be impossible to interpret 22 at the end of meet ing it may be useful to summarise what has been discussed to ensure that there has been confusion and all parties are agreed on the key points and any agreements that may have been reached restricted issue 20 oct 07 21 8 restricted d after meetings 1 invite feedback from the interpreter offer feedback if appropriate the best time to do this is immediately fter the meeting t he emphasis must be on improving the working relationship bet ween you be candid and frank but avoid unnecessary or unhelpful criticism 2 the interpreter may be able to shed light on aspects of t he meeting by explaining cultural background or c ontext of which you were unaware 3 if you consider it appropriate get the interpreter to provide written summary of the key points of the meet ing especially if there were other parallel discussions going on in the ba ckground that were not interpreted for you at the time you may also ask t he interpreter to provide list of the people you met or who were present dur ing the meeting local sops will probably require you to complete meet ing report in standard format but at the very least you should record the ma in players involved dtg and location details summary of the discussi on and any agreed outcomes you must take care not to compromise your inte rpreter by exposing him to any sensitive information including overdirected question s that make your specific interest obvious 22 administration your interpreter works for you you have duty of care for himher as you would to any other subordinate specify clearly time date where to report and to whom if appropriate provide contact telephone number and make sure you have the

been graphically brought home in iraq and afghanistan but the lessons can be applied to any theatre of operations the sens itivity of the local population has the potential to esca late perhaps unintended slight or mistak into major incident often with strategic implications respect for the culture and nor ms of any theatre also assi sts in the battle for hearts and minds improves our ability to influence opinion and helps wi th the generation of humint it is therefore essentia l that those deploying to any theatre are aware of some of the basics of the local indigenous cultur and that of other nations and organisations with whom they may be operating multinational allies 2 many future operations will continue to involve working as part of coalition with and possibly under command of multinational mn allies as part of mn brigade or division an awareness of the culture and capabilities of mn alli is therefore an essential prerequisite to the successful conduct of mn operations which may necessitate combined training before deployment fco and non governmental organisations 3 the military aspect of national power will be employed in concert with economic and diplomatic means members of armed forces can therefore expect to have contact with number of different agencies including fco post conflict reconstruction unit pcru and the department for internationa

sites 1 background sacred sites be they of religiou s or cultural sign ificance are areas where inappropriate behaviour can cause bad f eeling or lead to outbreaks of violence they often have religious and political signi ficance and offer spoilers opportunities to escalate violence enemy forces may use t hem as firing points bases or depots in the belief that they will not be tar geted or in an attempt to prompt inappropriate action by security forces and provide opportunities for their own info ops campaign the dilemma posed in such circumstances is the need to av oid the alienation

with the right hand only the left hand is preferably used for cleaning neself in the toilet using water failure to shake hands when meeting someone or saying goodbye is considered rude when western

chapter 22 afghan cultural guidance general 1 afghanistan is made up of several ethnic gr oups each of which are tribal in nature fundamental to all afghans is desire to keep afghanistan free from foreign occupation they are generally accepting of foreigners who are giving t hem assistance and from which they can derive benefit but would not wish afghanistan to be governed or occupied by foreigners in the long term quam 2 quam is the term by which afghans u nderstand their loyalt ies allegiances and priorities it is crucial to understanding the afghan pe ople afghans will owe loyalty to the nation their tribe their clan or to isla m amongst other things two afghans from neighbouring tribes may fight agains t each other but in the face of foreigners they may feel that they have dut to protect one another 3 afghans care about power and influence and this will often be at odds with their ethnic grouping many afghans have fought for different sides in conflicts throughout their lives some may have been part of the taleban movement in the 1990s and then switched their allegiance to the current government when the taleban were ousted from power in 2001 the same may occur at local levels with farmers for example expressing support for the local governor until they perceive t he local taleban to be stronger and more effective troops can expect to be assured of tribes support only to discover that the tribes loyalty in fact rests elsewhere ethnicity 3 overview afghanistan is made up of five key ethnic groups although there are other smaller groups all of whom are muslim the have tr aditionally not fought against each other and have peacefully coexisted for the majority of the time all afghans however will believe that they must re main loyal to their ethnic groups 4 the pashtuns the pashtuns make up approximat ely 40 of the population they are officially the largest tribe in the world but in reality the pasht uns are made up of many hundreds of difference subtribes these subtr ibes can broadly be divided into durrani and gilzai they are predominatly from the south of the country the afghan president hamid karzai is pashtun their language is pa shtu an official language of afghanistan although some educated pashtuns will speak dari the other offici language whilst hamid karzai is pashtun the majority of the taleban are also pashtuns the majority of the helmand procince populati on are pashtun they have their own code of conduct known as the pashtunwali this broadly covers the following areas devotion and loyalty to families t he tribe and religious political leaders b an obligation to exact revenge for ac tual or perceived offences against the family tribe restricted issue 20 oct 07 22 d 2 restricted c hospitality is regarded as social obligation and must always be extended to visitors it is impolite to refuse such hospitality d loyalty to the homeland and willingne ss to defend their territory and family bravery is highly

tajiks come predominantly from the north east of the country they formed the backbone of the northern allianc which spent the late 1990s trying to defeat the taleban they have traditionally been politically marginalised by the pashtuns and relations with the pashtuns have traditionally been tense since the fall of the taleban they have increased their share of power 6 the uzbeks the uzbeks come from the north west of the country around mazare sharif they are generally isolationist and have little nat ionwide influence 7 the hazaras the hazaras come from the centra l highlands to the west of kabul historically they have often bee n sidelined and have per ception that this is intentional they tend to look chinese since many of them are descended from genghis khan and members of his army the hazara are primarily shia muslims 8 the baloch the baloch or baluchi are from the far south of the country on the southern border with pakistan religion 9 the vast majority of afghans are

save manpower and time and increase the effectiveness of search or follow up litary dogs fall into two broad categories protection and specialist dogs the primary f unction of the protection dog is to help improve the security of installations guar ded and to decrease the manpower required to provide an effective guard specialist dogs ar those trained for sing role and are used to detect people or inanimat objects proper understand ing of the capabilities and limitations of each type is essential if full value is to be obtained from them 2 the performance of dog depends to great extent on the ability and enthusiasm of its handler who must ther efore be chosen with care specia list dogs who may work in very dangerous conditions and carry burden of li fe and death require particularly diligent handlers who should be sele cted accordingly 3 the characteristics and capabilities of t he various types of dog are described in outline in the following paragraphs commanders can judge the type of dog which may be useful to them but not all of them will usually be instantly av ailable protection dogs can generally be supplied on demand but speciali st dogs must be acquired and trained and consequently their need must be anticipated well in advance protection dogs 4 characteristics protection dogs rely on their sense of smell of air scent acut hearing and visual detection of movement and aggression 5 employment the dog patrols on lead with t he handler it can detect at distance and when released and given the word of command will attack and bite it will also protect the handler without word of co mmand the dog can be used as static sentry and therefore can be taken on overt or covert patrols to give early warning of hostile activity and to apprehend suspects as these dogs are likely to bark they must be carefully selected for operations where silence is required the main uses of protection dogs are patrolling of enclosed areas where t here is little movement of personnel or traffic b aggressivehigh visibility patrolling of open areas c prisoner escort d listening posts ops f ambushes restricted issue 20 oct 07 23 2 restricted g crowd control h vcps arms and

explosives and equipment they can be used to search in bot h urban and rural environments dog should be deployed to every in cident even if there is specific job for it as result of the incident it can be used to check cordon and icp locations 7 employment aes dogs and handlers may be held available on location or in central pool for tasking on request aes dogs should never be deployed to confirm some already existing suspicion however in the event of telephone warn ing being given that device has been planted consideration may be given to the deployment of aes dogs but due regard must be paid to soak times the relia bility of information etc the principal tasks for aes dogs are searching for munitions hi des and ancillary equipment in 1 buildings occupied unoccupi ed or derelicts unoccupied and derelicts after having been checked fo r booby traps before the dog enters 2 vehicles cars lorries bus trains ships and aircraft 3 open areas fields woods hedgerows and embankments 4 routes roads and railways b providing negative information by chec king buildings afte r completion of repairs or renovations or prior to vip visits etc clearing areas of operation such as vcps and helicopter landing sites 8 tasking and tactical considerations tasking is usually through the normal chain of command unless the dog has pr eviously been deployed to spec ific unit or search team except in conditions of high risk search the aes dog should have access to the area to be searched before the other sear chers move into it where ieds or booby traps are expected check for devices must be made before the dog moves in by searchers other than the dog handler 9 advantages dog is compact mobile and easily transported it can work in variety of conditions including confined spaces and difficult terrain it can search relatively quickly allowing either t he time for search to be reduced or larger area to be covered it can indicate the presence of many separate ex plosive substances far greater range of substances than any single machine can detect it is also an excellent overt deterrent in many circumstances dog is normally unaffected by cs gas air fresheners or other aerosols restricted issue 20 oct 07 23 3 restricted 10 limitations variations and limitations are to be expected when using aes dogs for instance they are of little use in detecting rms and explosives hidden on the person as dogs expect these to be carried by hum ans ie their handlers and other soldiers b reduced ability to detect objects mo re than 12 metres above working height c there is danger of aes dogs setting off booby traps d the dog should only work within t he rangecover of the ecm equipment available on the ground dogs suffer from tiredness and may only give of their best for limited time tracker dogs 11 characteristics tracker dogs also have high ly developed sense of smell but more especially for ground than air scent the dog is only trained for the task of tracking 12 employment the dog and its handler should be held in central pl ace and deployed to task on request they should have early access to line before the scent has been confused by other troops possible tasks are after incidents pursuit of suspects fleei ng on foot even if arrest is made intelligence can be obtained from the directi on of flight and from witnesses on or at the end of track also forensic evidence ca n often be obtained from footprints tyre marks items dropped or left behind etc b routine the rout ine usually adopted is 1 standby at planned arrests and road blocks in case of escape n foot 2 determining firing points sn iper posts observation positions 3 determining routes to and from subpara 2 above and freshly dumped hidden hides or any clandestine operation 13 the track track is made up of combination of scents human artificial soap toiletries polish etc and cr ushed vegetation and insects everywhere human goes he leaves track if he runs his track will be more pronounced than if he walks away from the scene as dog cannot differ entiate between friendly forces and enemy targets it is vital that at the start of tracking ta sk it is confirmed t hat the dog is following t he correct track ie the enemy once on the track the dog can fo llow it to successful conclusion despite diversionary tracks which may be intr oduced either by hum ans or animals 14 handler

possible time is majo r factor in its deployment b as with other dogs tiredness is factor infantry patrol dogs ip 16 characteristics infantry patrol ip dogs use t heir sense of smell and hearing to give silent warning by pointing the ip dog is used predo minantly in close country environment and is trained silently to indicate enemy presence either moving static or concealed as in an ambush 17 employment the following points should be noted if using patrol dogs patrol dog differs from tracker dog in t hat it does not follow track but it is alert to the scent and sound of human beings or animals conveyed to it on the air the patrol dog is useful for giving silent warning of ambushes and attempts at infiltration and will indicate any presence before it can be detected by human the distance at which warning is giv depends upon the following factors 1 wind direction and velocity 2 prevailing weather conditions 3 density of vegetation 4 individual ability restricted issue 20 oct

is likely to be requi red to provide to mnf and other isf hqs during the conduct of operations these should operate in parallel to from their associated isf unit to ensure t hat the necessary coordination takes place and that the capability of the isf to fulfil this function is developed h partnering partnering is defined relationship between isf and cf force elements facilitated by t he omlt which allows c oordinated and cooperative operational and training activity partnering despite the potential constraints it may place on the cf offers advantages to the isf the cf and the omlt for example restricted issue 20 oct 07 25 9 restricted it will offer legitimacy to cf operations aid the transition to isf primacy and through the cfs professional example provide role model to the isf thus developing their capability the cf partnering units responsibilities will include but are not limited to 1 the identification of operational tasks in co njunction with the omlt which will enable the development of isf capability whist simultaneously contributing to the operational plan 2 the planning execution and coordi nation of joint cfisf operations up to the point at which the isf can assume the lead 3 the provision of wider cf capabilit ies such as cas medical support communications air mobility and logistics 4 assistance to the omlt in the tr aining mentoring and enabling of all isf activity 20 influence activity the omlt should consider its ability to contribute to othe r campaign lines of oper ation for example where tr ained medical staff are available running clinics for families of isf soldiers and members of the local community could have significant impact on local perceptions and attitudes the omlt could also identify possible cimic tasks to provide benefit to loca l communities and assist with the delivery of food supplies to locals in say the winter whilst these may be short term activities that are not linked to longer term development progra mmes their likely short term impact on the security situation will assist in setting the conditions for other agencies to operate and for longer term projects to be implemented 21 equipment issue where the omlt is responsible for the issue of weapons and equipment to isf units normal g4 procedures for issue and accounting must be introduced and the isf given responsibility for these accountability should be enforced through the use of checks both by the omlt and the is f chain of command and disciplinary action again through the isf where appropriate where possible long term approach should be adopted to equipping the isf some fo rm of development programme should be developed and agreed in conjunction with them and the hn moddonors 22 measures of effectiveness the omlt will be required to report on the progress and capability of the isf unit it is working wit h usually this process will involve combination of judgment by omlt pers onnel and isf commanders and objective data numbers trained to certain st andards equipment issued etc the omlt should anticipate this requirement and be clear of the require ment the isf chain of command should be involved in this process throughout 23 omlt handovers and continuity in order to maintain continuity consideration should be given to rotating omlt personnel 50 at time where this is not possible time must be allocated for comprehensive handov er and for working relationships between the isf and the incoming omlt to be established restricted issue 20 oct 07 26 1 restricted chapter 26 liaison introduction 1 stability operations will see uk armed forces working alongside coalition partners other government departments ogd international organi sations io and indigenous security forces isf liaison activity will be essential to achieve coordination at all levels and it will require signific ant additional manpower liaison with coalition forces 2 the requirement for liaison with other fr iendly forces will be considerable it will normally take one of the following forms cross boundary liaison where units are ducting operations outside framework of established aos liaison with friendly forces will continue to be as conducted in general war setting howeve r most units involved in conducting operations will normally be allocated an ao as such there will be need for considerable cross boundary lia ison with neighbouring units th is liaison will aim to 1 achieve transparency of intentions and conduct 2 ensure deconfliction of patrols and other operations 3 encourage cross boundary s upport and medical assistance particularly where remote site in one area is adjacent to friendly location across the unit boundary in such case s movement of casevac will often be more effective via the bordering unit 4 assist commonality of force postu re and military activity military force has to have the ability to be effective and consistent in all areas of operations 5 ensure that cross boundary operations such as escorts or convoys can be conducted effectively b liaison across the chain of command the multinational and multilingual nature of military force will often give chain of command liaison greater significance than in general war setting this is particularly so if military contingent is not familiar with generic operat ing procedures used by the lead military force such as nato chain of command liaison will also assist with the two well known liaison difficulties 1 language barriers where contingent s peaks language not used by superior hq the benefit to comm ander who can brief or be briefed by an in person who then relays orders to the unit in its own language will be considerable restricted issue 20 oct 07 26 2 restricted 2 passage of information communication over the long distances will be challenge radio and satellite co mmunications will often be unworkable and long distance travel over poor routes will take time an will often be required at superior hq to brief assist with planning or just to relay likely future intentions c liaison with the civil authorities it is also essential where appropriate to effect good liaison with the civil authorities such as the cal police coastguards air traffic controllers and any fire services and hospitals in the t heatre of operations d liaison with isf aos may be shared with isf and uk armed forces are likely to be responsible for developing isf capability and cap acity as part of security sector reform ssr programme depending on the capability of the isf the liaison function may be achieved thr ough operational ment oring and liaison teams omlt or through the standard exchange of liaison officers liaison with civi lian organisations 3 feature of the coe is the plethora of ogd ios and n gos working in operational theatres the militar will usually find itself working alongside range of civi l actors working to disparate agendas military forc will often work in conjunction with organisations established for example to moni tor the police which might not be part of the same chain of command but working under the same mandate the military line of operation cannot be purs ued in isolation effort must therefore be made to understand where and how these organisation s are operating and attempt to coordinate activity there may be commitment under particular mandate for the military to provide security for io liaison with io such as the unhcr icrc who and civpol will generally allow military commander to advise on security military commander will often be responsible for the security situation namely the provision of secure environment there may therefore be requirement for daily security briefings to io and the need to develop contingency plans for their evacuation in the event of deterioration in the security situation information sharing may incl ude advice on mine threats ar eas of conflict ceasefires and other related activity b shared initiatives operations will often involve contributions from io for example an attempt to return refugees to their previous homes may well require the military force to ensure the situation is secure the hcr to oversee the refugees an organisation to oversee the civil police nd number of others to assist with the rebuild of destroyed houses such operations will require shared aim with coordinated planning and negot iation to ensure success liaison with warring factions 4 liaison with warring factions wfs and ot her host nation entities should normally be attempted by all levels of command within t he military force depending on the military structure there may well be div bde unit g9 and unmos all will attempt to meet and provide liaison with ke civil military and police commanders liaison plan has to be adopted to ensure deconfliction of respons ibilities between different restricted issue 20 oct 07 26 3 restricted and to ensure the timely and accurate passage of information up the chain of command in particular responsibilities fo r liaison with specific wf commandslevels of command have to be established for example unit may liaise with wf bdes bde may liaise with wf div hqs nd the div liaise with wf co rps hqs foot patrols if deployed can be used for liaison with the civi lian population and any local wf once confidence has improved liais on between individual staff branches can be established 5 where such framework is not establishe d then there is potent ial for different to have meetings with the same wf commander several times in short space of time it is probably not necessary in this case div w anting to verify information at lower level and in person should get the unit or whoever normally deals at that level to arrange the meeting accompany the div and introduce him to the wf commander thus retaining continuity probable liai tasks with wfs are as follows negotiations the need to negotiate will depend on the mandate the force structure and its level of dependency on host nation support or on wf goodwill b ceasefire violations the basing of at wf hq will assist in the resolution of any ceasefire violations t only will it allow rapid assessment of which party is the aggressor but it will ssist the military commander in preventing an escalation of the violation or reprisals coordina ted and timely negotiations can be conducted concurrently with opposing m ilitary commanders to bring about return to stability or ceasefire c protestsbriefs the requirement for briefings to host nationswf of future operations and the requirement to protes t breaches of any ceasefire or peace agreement will depend entirely on t he nature of the mandate
