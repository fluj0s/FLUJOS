from simon tett sfbtettmetogovuk to peter stott pastottmeadow gareth jones gsjonesmeadow myles allen allenwobbleagrlacuk phil jones pjonesueaacuk keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject tuesday meeting date wed 17 feb 1999 230145 0000 dear all thank you for the meeting on tuesday i think it went well here as promised and slightly late is summary of what we discussed myles can you forward the message to michael can you let know if you are all happy with this and once i have made any corrections you want id like to send it to john geoff and tim barnett anyone else you think should get it proxy climate forcing solar beer has be based proxy reconstruction of solar activity which can be converted to irradiance changes is it different from lbb or hs has the lbb dataset been updated has svensmark got better handle on his proposed physical mechanisms to amplify solar irradiance changes someone to check at rms meeting which i wont be able to attend want forcing back to 1600 though hc would find it hard to justify doing runs that early to see if johngeoff think useful or not to check with william the source of the rumour about problems with the hs dataset volcanoes volcanoes are an important climate forcings issue for ipcc do volcanic erruptions cluster myles to persuade student to look at philkeiths dataset and see if there is evidence for this are there other indices of volcanic activity is climate response to volcanoes sensitive to mean state ie in cooler climate get bigger response gareth could see from our model if krakota response significantly different from pinatubo proxy climate data comparision with obs and models keithphil have 400 sites of high quality tree ring density data which there are willing to let hc mat use to do crude modeldata comparision mat and tim to liase on what they are doing note that funny things are happening in the density data post 1950 also available may be some borehole data phil to talk to pollockwang about possibility which could use to compare with model should consider using lower soil temperature rather than 1 m temp there are few sites with data from 0a to 2000 as well as many sites with data for 1700 to 2000 should consider both there may be some other tree ring data which tells us something about sw usa precip and thus enso tim wants to compare patterns of temperature var from the proxy data and compare that with the models ie compare observed and modelled covariance structure rather than just the variability also tim wants to try and unpick manns stuff hc to provide solar forced run from 1700 to check if it goes from 1700 our approach will be to compare model data directly with proxy data rather than do interpolation gisst or mann et eu proposal not clear if in this years framework 5 call there will be room for detectionattribution proposals which is how wed like to frame modelproxy comparision other issue is that quarcc 2 and modelproxy comparision could involve similar institutions which could cause problems phil to check if room this year for proposal keith pointed out that we cant just recycle the nerc thematic proposal presient there is good news on that fron which suggests the proposal will go through with an 8 million pound budget ad hoc detn group not much said on that or at least i didnt note it phil you have some advice for on that clivarpages in the next 12 years there may be new reasonable quality ice core and sedimentation data available data availablity from the proxy and modelling groups is an issue another reason for an eu proposal phil pointed out that there is lot of instrumental data in funny units which could be digitised in europe keith is planning on writting call to arms paleo data paper i think i need to come up with list of actions anyone want to volunteer simon
