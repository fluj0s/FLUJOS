reason 14b d 1 c summary president chavez officially inaugurated banco bicentenario on december 21 thus effectively reopening three of the eight banks the venezuelan government gbrv has taken over or shut down since november 20 the national assembly also passed changes to the banking law to triple the amount of deposit insurance with the new limit applied retroactively to depositors in the two banks in the process of liquidation if the episode of interventions is indeed over the gbrv will have increased its share in the banking sector gained an important foothold in the insurance industry and taken over number of other companies particularly in the food processing and distribution sector while the exact origin of the episode remains unclear it appears to have resulted from combination of power struggle among gbrv officials and insiders and the precarious financial situation of the banks themselves major question mark remains banco federal mediumsized bank owned by opposition businessman nelson mezerhane chavez and mezerhane recently traded barbs with mezerhane claiming forces associated with the gbrv were conspiring to bring down his bank and chavez characterizing federal as having had grave problems end summary new steps in an ongoing saga 2 u president chavez launched new staterun bank banco bicentenario on december 21 bicentenario is essentially the union of banfoandes preexisting public bank with central bolivar and confederado three of the eight banks the gbrv has taken over or shut down since november 20 refs ad depositors in these four banks who have not had access to their money since november 30 for bolivar and confederado or december 4 for central can now transact business normally taking figures provided by the superintendency of banks sudeban for commercial and universal banks the banks composing bicentenario represented 53 percent of the banking sector by assets and 95 percent by deposits as of november 30 the latest statistics available the extent to which depositors have withdrawn or will withdraw their money remains to be seen although there were reports of long lines at bicentenario branches on december 21 3 u on december 15 the national assembly approved modifications to the banking law that among other things will increase the deposit guarantee offered by the fund for guarantee of deposits and banking protection fogade from 10000 bolivars bs usd 4650 at the official exchange rate to bs 30000 an amount requested by president chavez this increase will apply retroactively for limited period of time to depositors in canarias and and banpro the two banks in the process of liquidation banks contributions to fogade will also be raised from 05 to 15 percent of deposits as maintained at the close of each semester note for these changes to become law president chavez must sign the modified law and it must be published in the official gazette to the best of our knowledge it has not yet been published president chavez recently said he might seek further changes to the law end note is the episode of interventions over 4 c whether this episode of interventions is over remains question mark there are several other small banks and financial institutions which fit the pattern of the eight banks intervened in caracas 00001595 002 of 003 the sense of being weak financially and having been taken over recently by individuals allegedly close to the government two pending purchases that of inverunion by gonzalo tiraldo and banco federal by jose zambrano have reportedly been rejected by sudeban most but not all financial sector analysts and participants econoff has contacted continue to believe the episode poses systemic risk to the sector given the small sizes and weak reputations of the banks involved in comparison with the strong fundamentals of most of the larger banks one dissenting voice is that of xxxxxxxxxxxx reputation and an outspoken critic of gbrv policies xxxxxxxxxxxx called econoff december 17 to report that according to information he had received several mediumsized or large banks or their owners were putting dollardenominated assets into collateral accounts in florida in return for emergency loans in bolivars 5 c banco federal remains major question mark as reported previously ref federal mediumsized bank accounting for 3 percent of the sector by assets is considered weak by several experts has been subject to several runs and reportedly even received an emergency loan from the gbrv adding to the intrigue federals owner opposition businessman and minority owner of opposition tv station globovision nelson mezerhane recently traded barbs with president chavez in an interview published in local daily mundo december 17 mezerhane claimed active laboratories that included people with ties to the gbrv had disseminated rumors about federals health in an attempt to instigate runs chavez lashed back in december 19 broadcast characterizing federal as bank that has had grave problems ordering an investigation into what mezerhane said and cautioning that the time in which public institutions help private banks like federal is over in an interview published december 20 in local weekly razon opposition economist jose guerra claimed former vice president and gbrv insider jose vicente rangel was seeking to bring down federal partly out of bitterness at the fall of his business associate pedro torres who led the group that owned three of the intervened banks what initiated the episode in the first place 6 c with over month having passed since the initial interventions number of theories have sprung up to explain why the gbrv chose to act in the way it did and at the time it did many observers believe president chavez ordered the initial interventions as the culmination of power struggle taking place among gbrv officials and presumed insiders theories on the protagonists in this presumed power struggle abound however we have heard variations such as diosdado cabello vs ricardo fernandez and jesse chacon ali rodriguez and representatives of the traditional left vs ricardo fernandez and members of the military clique and president chavez vs selected inner circle members and insiders with their own political projects an intriguing tangent is that an alleged report by cubas intelligence service plays role in several of these explanations other observers believe the gbrvs hand was forced by the terrible financial situation at the intervened banks with president chavez preferring to take action before the problems worsened and well before parliamentary elections scheduled for september 2010 whatever the origins of the episode our contacts credit president chavez with seeing the interventions as an opportunity to trumpet anticorruption credentials by sending the message as one of our contacts put it of i put bankers in jail changes in the financial sector and business landscape caracas 00001595 003 of 003 7 c the intervention episode has to date led to several changes in the financial and business landscape that are worth noting first the gbrv has increased its share in the banking sector by at least five percentage points with the opening of banco bicentenario public banks will comprise roughly 20 percent of the sector by assets and 25 percent by deposits second the gbrv has acquired an important foothold in the insurance sector with the associated takeover of seguros previsora and intended formation of stateowned bolivariana seguros ref b note as of june 2009 previsora was the fourth largest insurance company in venezuela with market share of 83 percent end note many contacts including xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbelieve the gbrv will consolidate the insurance accounts position to exert greater control over private medical services providers finally gbrv takeover of ricardo fernandezs companies in the food and food distribution sectors will further the shift toward gbrv control in those sectors note it is still unclear from gbrv statements if the takeover of fernandezs companies will be temporary or permanent we would not be surprised if it were the latter end note comment 8 c as we suspected when it began on november 20 much about this episode remains obscure we are not surprised that there are conflicting explanations for how the episode started though it seems clear internal power struggles played key role what is still mystery to us is why the gbrv has not yet used this episode as an excuse to take over banco federal thus taking an important asset from nelson mezerhane while we would have expected the gbrv to have taken it over several weeks ago if it indeed it was going to the exchange of barbs between mezerhane and chavez certainly keeps the possibility alive perhaps the gbrv has not moved to take federal because it fears systemic implications in clear reference to federal respected economic consultancy sintesis financiera wrote in recent report that concerns will rise and markets will destabilize if interventions reach larger banks owned by individuals perceived to be at odds with the government there could certainly be other explanations however
