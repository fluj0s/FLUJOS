europes muslim communities estimates of the number of muslims in europe vary widely depending on the methodology and definitions used and th geographical limits imposed excluding turkey and the balkans researchers estimate that as many as 15 to 20 million muslims live on the european continent muslims are the largest religious minority in europe and islam is the continents fastest growing re

countries have smaller muslim communities europes muslim population is ethnically and linguistically diverse muslim immigrants hail from middle eastern african and asian countries as well as turkey many mus lim communities have their roots in western european labor shortages nd immigration policies of the 1950s and 1960s that attracted large numbers of north africans turks and pa kistanis

fferent policies with respect to managing their immigrant and nority populations however none has been completely successful disproportionately large number of muslims in europe are poor unemployed or imprisoned and many feel sense of cultural alienation and discrimination for decades c ountries such as germany austria and switzerland viewed muslim immigrants as temporary guest workers as result little effort was made at integration and paralle l societies developed britain and the netherlands embraced the notion of multiculturalism integration while maintaining identity but in practice this concept helped entrench discrete muslim communities functioning apart from the culture of the host country nor has frances assimilation policy prevented the segregation of its muslim communities as seen most vividly in the riots that erupted throughout france in the fall of 2005 in workin g class suburbs populated largely by north africans the protests in several european cities in early 2006 sparked by the publication in european newspapers of cartoons of the prophet muhammad also highlight the disaffection and alienation that many european muslims feel1 islamist extremists in europe and

march 11 2004 bombings of commuter trains in madrid spain that killed 191 people were carried out by an qaeda inspired group of north africans mostly moroccans resident in spain even before terrorists

mainstream society leaves some european muslims more vulnerable to extremist ideologies many experts say that some european muslim youth many of whom are second or third generation europeans feel disenfranchised in society that does not fully accept them they appear to turn to islam as badge of cultural identity and are then radicalized by extremist muslim clerics traditionally liberal asylum and immigration laws in western europe as well as strong free speech and privacy protections have attracted numerous such clerics and middle eastern dissidents2 some experts also believe that the rece nt wars in afghanistan and iraq have radicalized more european muslims and strengthened terrorist recruitment efforts3 many european muslims claim common cause with suffering brethren in the israelioccupied palestinian territories as well as in iraq chechnya and elsewhere they tend to view the war on terrorism as war on islam and perceive an unjust double standard at work in the foreign policies of many eu ropean governments especially those that supported the usled war in iraq before being captured in september 2005 qaeda training camp manager abu musab alsuri not ed in communique

extremists to recruit european youths for iraq in november 2005 belgia n woman and convert to islam blew herself up in an attempted suicide attack on us forces in iraq some analysts suggest that religious converts to islam ma be more susceptible to radicalization as result of mistaken desire to prove them selves in their new faith 4 others note that europes physical locati on within few days

ountries in the region have not attracted significant numbers of muslim immigrants ho wever concerns have been raised about several countries in southeas tern europe with large mus lim populations eg bosnia herzegovina one legacy of the 19921995 wa r in bosnia is the presence of islamist fighters from other countries who stayed behind and became bosnian citizens some islamic charities that proliferated during and after the war reportedly served as qaeda moneylaundering fronts terrorist groups have also operated from albania at the same time opposition to terrorism among indigenous muslims in the balkans has been strong most view themselves as part of europe nd are grateful for the us role in defending them against serbian aggression in the 1990s us officials say that efforts by islamist extremists to recruit local muslims have t with limited success and they praise these countries antiterrorism effo rts especially after sept ember 11 nevertheless some experts assert that central and southeastern europe may pose more significant threat than often acknowledged the regions weak governing institutions and problems with organized crime and corruption may make it vulnerable to inf iltration by terrorist groups observers caution that the balkans in particular may play role as transit point for terrorists target area for recruitment and potential source of weapons or explosives6 european responses the november 2004 murder of dutch filmma ker theo van gogh brought the issue of islamist extremism in europe to the forefront of european political debate van gogh an outspoken critic of the treatme nt of women in islam was killed by 27yearold dutch citizen of moroccan descent and follower of radical islam since the murder many european officials and social commentators have proclaimed that multiculturalism in europe has failed and called for greater integration of muslims and other immigrants into mainstream european society they believe that muslims and others must embrace the native cultures of their new c ountries including secularism7 s m u r p n governments have been pursuing initiatives aimed at fostering integration and promoting secularism for several years the fren ch government for example has banned conspicuous religious symbols in public schools including headscarves for muslim girls yarmulkes and large crucifixes moderate muslim groups in france supported the ban as means to reduce tensions in the sc hool system and in broader society the uk is introducing new citizenship classes to sure that immigrants can speak english and understand british history and culture other an alysts say that countries such as spain italy and germany need to do more to encourage muslim immigrants to become citizens some european governments

associated press july 13 2005are few muslim representatives in european parliaments in 2003 paris established an elected french council of the muslim faith an official advisory body that acts as the muslim communitys representative in dealings with the french government french and british officials are also looking at ways to foster homegrown imams to minister to the needs of their muslim communities rather than relying on foreign imams whom they claim are often unfamiliar with the west or beholden to foreign interests the netherlands has reportedly created an imam buddy system that links foreign imams with dutch volunteers to promote better understanding among these imams of dutch culture and society others argue that gr eater focus should be placed on addressing the lack of jobs and educationa l opportunities for muslims as well as racism they say that racial violence against muslims is on the rise in some european countries such as the netherlands but governments have failed to acknowledge the scale of the problem8 several analysts suggest that mainstreaming muslims into european society would not necessarily translate into an embrace of european ideals some even question whether islam itself is compatible with european political principles and values they point out for example that two british muslim suicide bombers in israel in april 2003 were from comfortable middleclass west ernized suburbs some mus lim groups in europe say that certain efforts toward integration such as the french headscarf ban are count erproductive and only serve to increase the sense of discrimination among muslims in the wake of the london bombings the uk government is cons ulting with british muslims on how to best tackle extremism some muslim leaders argue that muslim communities must be more vocal against extremism and actively counter rather than tolerate radical preachers9 european governments have also sought to contain islamist ex tremists and counter terrorists by tightening security measures and reforming immigration and asylum laws uk and french security services have reporte dly increased their monitoring of mosques germany has changed its laws to allow aut horities to investigate religious groups and france and italy have expelled some muslim clerics for hate crimes following the london attacks in 2005 the british government has sought to make it easier to exclude or deport foreign individuals who incite hatred also not able are european union eu efforts to boost police and judicial c ooperation enhance intelligencesharing
