division summary this report introduces the takings clause of the fifth amendment nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation the clause extensively explicated by the courts in r ecent decades seeks to strike balance between societal goals and the burdens imposed on pr operty owners to achieve those goals in filing taking action in court the pr operty owner first must surmount threshold hurdles such as ripeness and the statute of limitations if successful the court then will address whether taking occurred the criteria depending on whether the claim is of the regulatory taking physical taking or exaction taking variety if taking is found the constitutionally required remedy is usually compensation of the property owner rather than invalidation of the government action takings actions against the united states as opposed to state and local government s have some special procedural and substantivelaw features the fifth amendment of the us constitution closes with twelve simple words nor shall private property be taken fo r public use without just compensation long constitutional sleeper this takings clause has been thrust into the limelight in recent decades by increased government land use controls combined with more conservative supreme court inte rested in securing protec tions for property owners this report covers but the high points in the courtmade law c onstruing the takings clause full coverage would re quire volumes regrettably too this case law is not model of clarity nonetheless some broad principles have emerged so that in few situations one may predict how court will rule on taking action with some reasonable chance of proving right basics of the takings clause the takings clause is balancing act it seeks to strike an accommodation between the goals of the public as represented by government and the burdens imposed on private property owners to achieve those goal s when the private burden is sufficientlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20741crs2 severe or of certain kind the courts say that taking has occurred and that just compensation must be paid to the property ow ner in determining what is and is not taking the courts have veloped host of rules f actors defenses and policy considerations some of these takings indicators are amorphous balancing factors others are per rules rules that brand certain government actions as automatic takings without much sitespecific inquiry this report focuses on the takings clause in the us constitution which applies both to the federal government and thr ough the fourteenth amendment due process clause to states and localities takings clau ses in state constitutions are generally though not always construed the same as their federal counterpart threshold hurdles before court will address property owners taking claim several threshold hurdles must be surmounted among them is the property owner in the right court while takings suits against states and localities are filed in state or federal courts of ge neral jurisdiction takings suits against the united states usually must be filed in single specialized court the us court of federal claims cfc exceptions from the cfcs exclusive jurisdiction exist only for takings suits seeking 10000 or less or those filed under certain prog ram statutes which maymust be filed in federal district court the cf c is headquartered in washington dc but has nationwide jurisdiction and routinely holds trials around the country has the statute of limitations expired takings actions must be filed within the requisite number of years after the date of the alleged taking for takings actions against the united states the limitations period is six years in few circumstances court may be willing to toll stop the running of the limitations period eg when the facts giving rise to the alleged taking were not known to plaintiff until after the period due to the governments failure to disclose is the taking claim ripe while statutes of limitations seek to ensure that lawsuits are not filed too late ripeness doctrine seeks to ensure they are not filed too early the supreme court has developed two ri peness criteria for takings claims first the property owner must have obtai ned final decision from the landuse regulating authority as to the nature and extent of development permitted on the property final decision is legal term of art to get final decision it may be necessary for the property owner after hisher initial development proposal is rejected to reapply with scaleddown or reconfigured proposals th rationale reapplica tion may reveal some type of development sufficient to avert taking that the regulating authority will accept for the same reason opportunities for vari ances or other exceptions from generally applicable restrictions must be exhausted the property owner need not pursue reapp lications or exceptions when doing so would be futile successful invocation of this futility exception to the final decision ripeness criterion demands that the owner show more than long odds of getting the development approved or onerous procedur requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20741crs3 1 28 usc 1738an agencys mere designation of parcel as within its permitting jurisdiction cannot by itself be taking since it leaves open the possibility that the permit if applied for will be granted the second takingsripeness cr iterion applies only to takings actions against states and localities for such claim to be ripe in federal court it must initially be brought in state court as long as the states courts make compensation remedy available for takings many plaintiffs who go to stat court however find themselves barred from refiling in federal court owing to legal doctrines precluding the relitigation of claims and the federal full faith and credit act1 property and related considerations even if the economic impact of government action is severe th takings clause is not implicated unless that impact falls upon propert as that term is used in the takings clause almost all common interests in land fee simple absolutes leases easements water rights etc are indis putably property plus many intangible interests such as patents trademarks copyrights most contract rights and trade secrets even when property is adversely aff ected by government conduct takings law offers remedy only if the effect is direct thus the denial of permit to fill wetland may effect taking of that wetland however it cannot work taking of nearby commercially zoned parcel w hose value is reduced by th fact that residential subdivision hence potential customers will come to the wetland property the value loss in the commercial parcel is termed consequential damages which takings law holds noncompensable the three types of takings claims and the tests used for each there are three fairly distinct types of takings actions that property owners may bring each is evaluated under di fferent supreme c ourtcreated test the regulatory taking claim asserts that governme nt action has taken ones property merely by restricting its use regulatory takings claims break down into two subcategories involving government restrictions that cause 1 complete elimination of land parcels economic use or value ca lled total taking claim or 2 lessthan complete elimination of such use or value called partial taking claim complete elimination of use or value by the government is held to be per taking with big exception if the government re striction prompting for the taking claim is implicit in background principles of the stat law of property and nuisance existing when the property was acquired taking occurs total loss of usevalue notwithstanding the rationale for this excepti on is that the government has not taken any right that the property owner ever had finition of precisely what constitutes background principle is an ongoing issue in takings lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20741crs4 2 penn central transp co v new york city 438 us 104 124 1978complete elimination of use or value also is not per taking when imposed through regulatory measure known at the outset to be temporary for example moratorium on new building permits while landuse study is being done the anticipated resumption of use and value after the measure is lifted leads courts to view this situation as not involving complete ss see temporal parcel as whole rule page 5 thus prospectively tem porary restrictions generally are assessed under the balancing test for lessthantotal takings as follows lessthantotal eliminations of propertys use or economic value are evaluated quite differently than total takings here the courts apply the penn central balancing test under which the government action is assessed for its economic impact the degree to which it interferes with reasonable investmentbacked expectations and its character2 these three vague factors have been explicated only rarely by the supreme court leading many commentators to complain th at this test is muddled it certainly does not make for predictable court rulings beyond the fact that in the large majority of cases the required degree of economic impact is very substantial and the government action is held not to be taking typically takings pl aintiffs first seek to convince the court they have suffered total taking resulting in per compensability then argue as backup that if the court discerns only lessthantotal elimination of usevalue there is still taking under penn central an important issue in regulatory takings law is the role played in the takings determination by laws existing when the pr operty was acquired even when such laws do not amount to background principles the supreme court instru cts that the pre acquisition existence of the regulatory scheme at issue in takings case is not per bar against maintaining taking claim but is to be given some weight lower courts continue to give great weight to preacquisition sche mes arguing that they undercut the property owners reasonable expectati ons of development in the penn central analysis note too that the background principles concept first st ated in total taki ng case has been held to apply as well to partial regulatory takings claims thus if the preacquisition scheme constitutes background principle it also presents an absolute bar to the partial regulatory taking claim under either subcategory to tal or partial regulatory takings court must define the physical extent of the property it will eval uate this is known as the parcel as whole or relevant parcel issue its pertinence stems from the fact that takings law looks at the economic impact and interfere nce with investmentbacked expectations factors in relative rather than absolute sense for example person who suffers 100000 drop in property value due to government action may ve strong taking claim when the relevant parcel retains little value but only weak claim if the relevant parcel is still worth 200000 the property owners ss is evaluated relative to what heshe still has the supreme court says that the relevant parcel cannot be limited to the portion of the parcel subject to the challe nged use restriction at least not solely on that basis thus when one is denied permit to fill in we tland on tract the fact that significant portion of the tract is buildable nonwetland generally will defeat the taking claimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20741crs5 beyond this however the many issues that aris in defining the relevant parcel have been left to the lower courts for example s hould court include in its takings analysis acreage owned by the plaintiff that is noncontiguous with the regulated tract or subdivided as different lots in most cas contiguous acreage in common ownership is deemed the parcel as whole one principle is that developers intentions are key where it regarded project as single it for purposes of planning financing and development court likely will reject efforts to segment the project acreage in the regulatory taking analysis further relevantparcel issues arise with land sold off before the development approval was nied or before the regulato ry scheme in question was enacted the relevant parcel issue also has functional dimension under which the court must assess the loss of one right in propert relative to the bundle of remaining rights finally the relevant parcel doctrine has temporal dime nsion under which court must look not only at the period during which the re striction is in eff ect but less restricted periods of the plaintiffs ownership before and after the physical taking claim asserts that the governme nt has taken property by causing or authorizing physical encroach ment upon that property flooding caused by government dams and overflight s by government airplanes are the archetypal federal examples physical takings claims break down into two subcategories involving 1 permanent physical occupations and 2 mporary physical invasions permanent physical occupations are almost invariably held to be takings because they are seen to egregiously violate one of the most sacred of property rights the right to exclude others thus in assessing physical occupation claims the courts will not inquire into the extent of the occupation the magnitude of the ec onomic impact on the property owner or the importance of the underlying public purpose nor does the relevant parcel rule apply to permanent physical occupations the existence of permanent physical occupation caused by government without more establishes taking temporary physical invasions are regarded quite differently they are tested under the penn central balancing test and gene rally are held nontakings the exaction taking claim may be brought when property owner objects to an exaction demanded by land regulatory agency as condition of its approving proposed development such exactions are used routinel by local agencies to get developers to pay for the fire protection police school sewa ge disposal and other costs created by development they typically take two forms physical dedications setting aside land within the project area for roads schools et c or impact fees paid in lieu of physical dedications in order not to be taking the exaction cond ition must meet two criteria first there must be an essential nexus between th condition and an underlying purpose of the permit or other approva l to which it is attached second the burden imposed on the property owner by the exaction must be greater than roughly proportional to the impact that the owners proposed developmen t would have on the community moreover the burden of proving rough propor tionality is on the government one can readily see that the exactions takings standard places more demands on the governmentdefendant than that for regula tory takings thus it is referred to ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20741crs6 heightened scrutiny the supreme court s now clarified that the exactions takings test does not apply outside the exactions context eg to nonexaction conditions on permits and has suggested that it does not apply either to monetary assessments imposed in lieu of physical dedications constitutional remedy for taking the constitutional remedy for taking is generally monetary compensation usually in the amount of the fair market value of the property taken with limited exceptions it does not satisfy the constitution for the court to invalidate the offending government action or for the agency simply to back off the reason is that by that time the taking if any has already occurred invalidation or rescission merely converts permanent taking into temporary one invalidation remains the constitutional remedy in few instances these include takings based on government ppropriation of specific fund of money or on government actions interfering with th right to pass on property special characteristics of takings claims against the united states at the state and local level the large majority of takings cases arise in the context of land use restrictions zoning and subdivi sion cases are the staples in contrast takings claims against the united states invol ve land less than half the time because the federal government regulates nd use only in selected contexts such claims span the wide spectrum of federal activitie s such as the bailout of the savings and loan industry restrictions on the location of cigarette ve nding machines quarantines to prevent the spread of animal disease imposition of liability on employers for employee pension plans or retiree health benefits resolution of claims by us citizens against foreign governments retroactive taxes assessmen ts to fund cl eanup of government nuclear enrichment plants etc as noted above takings claims against the united states must be brought in almost all circumstances in the us court of fe deral claims court established in 1855 under congress article i legislative powers the cfc is highly specialized court hearing only money claims against the united states appeals from the cfc are to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the takings jurisprudence of the cfc and federal circuit does not always parallel that of other courts for example the cfc nd federal circuit assert that taking claim may be brought based on an unauthorized act of the government restriction not recognized by many other courts
