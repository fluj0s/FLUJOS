unfold as result of postwar insurgency and sectarian violence it is estimated that in total including those displaced prior to the war there may be as many as 2 million iraqi refugees who have fled to jordan syria and other neig hboring states and pproximately 27 million iraqis who have been displaced within iraq itself some experts think that the iraq situation now outpaces other refugee crises worldwide during 2004 2007 the violence and insecurity resulting from the ongoing sectarian strife terrorism and insurgency in iraq produced substantial civilian displacement in different parts of the count ry many of iraqs neighbors fear that they are being overwhelmed by refugees who have fled over iraqs borders there are heightened concerns about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries whether they can provide adequately for the popula tions that have moved across borders and the impact of refugee flows on stability in general while there is clear evidence of limited improvement in iraq decreasing vi olence reduced levels of displacement and handful of returns in few governor ates the situation in general remains precarious and requires sust ained attention unhcr est imates that

reconciliation the key to halting sectarian warfare and the displacement of iraqis from their homes while some experts agree that iraqs major communities remain sharply divided over their relative positions in the power structure the bush administra tion reportedly sees signs of movement on political reconciliation pa rtially attributed to the impact of the 2007 troop surge in reducing the level of violence the reduced violence has at the very least ensured that the displacement problem has not wo rsened any further in 2008 if movement toward political reconciliation takes hold this could creat conditions for decreasing the current rates of displacement and could increase the desire of the international community to address the refugee and displ aced persons issue most experts believe that reconciliation would also enhance capac ity in iraqs ministries responsible for security basic services and providing assistance to those displaced iraqis the insecurity resulting from ongoing violence in iraq continues to have marked impact on civilian displacement in va rious parts of the country this was particularly the case during the past two years when sectarian violence accelerated an already developing pattern of popul ation displacement and emigration the numbers of displaced iraqis are very fluid and vary by source for example the iraqi red crescent society estimates of refugees and internally displaced persons idps exceed those published in january 2008 report by the migration policy institute which states that there were close to 45 million displaced

countries whether they could provide adequately for the populations moving across borders and th potential impact of refugee flows on stability in the region the iraq situation has begun to outpace other population displacement crises worldwide as the figures grow higher food and fuel prices and decreasing subsidies are limiting the ability of aid agencies to provide assistance it is estimated that 12 million iraqis were displaced before 2006 15 million iraqis were displaced between 2006 and 2007 and less than 1 have been displaced in 2008 while there are some reports of limited

coalition military operations and fighting among militias and insurgents direct personal threats abductions assassinations and death th reats remain commonplace although less so than in 2007 religious belief political or tribal affiliation and associ ation with us forces or iraqi authorities can also make someone target for violence all of these activities continue to create an atmosphere of ge neralized fear for many ordinary iraqis within iraq the current conditions clearly bear the mark of sectarian polarization and cleansing in neighborhoods formerly of mix ed religious orientation that took place during 2006 and 2007 in recent studies the international organization for migration iom found that idps tende d to be from mixed neighborhoods and displaced to homogenous ones the m ovement occurred predominantly in and between urban areas with more than 70 fleeing baghdad7 at least 10 of the 18 iraqi provinces have now tried to place entry restrictions on their internal borders to iraqis displaced from else where in the country overall living standards within iraq ve declined sharply since 2003 human development indicators access to health care social services education employment have fractured under the cu rrent circumstances and affected wider social networks in iraqi society limited assistance activ ities and access by the international community have made implementation of tangible longterm policy objectives difficult within many areas in iraq conditions are deteriorating and for those already displaced ar becoming more permanent problems many who cannot secure protection or assistance could soon find themselves in the same situation according to some estimates iraqs popul ation is 268 million this means that nearly 13 of the population or one in eight iraqis may be displaced there are many patterns of displacement some that have their origins decades ago but have now evolved into new pha for example the approximately 300000 refugees who were in iran before th 2003 war then returned to iraq and now are believed to have been displaced again this time within iraq others were refugees from other countries in the region who fled to iraq and are now on the move again within its borders saddam hussein s brutal regime left legacy of displacement as his regime forcibly di splaced iraqi shiites and kurds in order to control territory terrorize the populati on and fight insurrection some experts estimate as many as 15 milli on may have been displaced over the three decades of his regimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33936crs4 8 ibid in

been concerns by iraqs neighbors the united states and other donor countries that the iraqi government is not doing enough to assist with its displaced citizens at conference in sweden in late may 2008 the maliki government apparently ma pledge of 195 million to assist the displaced14 the international compact with iraq annual re port states that in addition to 25 million transferred to syria

government of iraq to assess what policies and programs are in place to accommodate returns and what will be required once conditions permit voluntary returns to begin in the meantime some experts believe that the sectarian groups have tried not only to consolidate territory but also to fill the gap as protector and provider in the provision of services the government cannot fulfill for the displaced16 relatively few international humanitarian organizations are working in iraq because of the unstable security situation there are 32 humanitarian international ngos with programs in ir aq

refugee populations remain for prolonged period or if new waves of re fugees flood iraqs neighbors beyond the dire humanitarian consequences of scattering nearly 10 of iraqs prewar population into neighbor ing countries lie the longterm impact of this large scale displacement on the geopolitics of the middle east many iraqis have indicated that they will never return home raising questions over their future status in their new homes will iraqs neighbors move toward integrating refugees into the citizenry at large or will iraqis be treated as secondclass citizens and form permanent underclass similar to the situation of pa lestinian refugees will iraqis become politically active in their host countries and form diaspora organizations or will they be barred from politics altogether driving the most extreme elements to pursue radical causes will sectaria n violence spill over from iraq into neighboring states bringing an added element of instability into an already volatile region profile of the displaced of those who have fled iraq various reports indicate that many refugees were from iraqs now decimated middle class numerous interviews of iraqi refugees conducted out side iraq have revealed that iraqi professionals who fled the country were the least sectarian elemen ts in society and many fled to escape both the general threat of sectarian violence and the specific

the newer waves of iraqis who crossed the border are progre ssively poorer than their predecessors and prioritizing those most in need of assistance has become more critical aid workers note that because the iraqi refugee populati on has blended into urban areas they are harder to identify document and assist there are many challenges that face iraq i refugees living abroad aside from the social isolation that accompanies their paration from family and tribe iraqis may face discrimination and disdain from citizen s who view them as competition for jobs and access to strained social welfare services unemployment was already high in syria and jordan before the iraqis arriva l and both countries bar them from legally working during their stay access to affordable healthcare is difficult for most refugees without significant personal saving s forcing many new arrivals to turn to international aid agencies some estima that hundreds of thousands of iraqi children are not

about po litics and pressure felt by the iraqi government to demonstrate progress and sustain confidence in reduced violence and by the united states to show the critical and positive impact of the

living there or because the ethnic composition of the neighborhood made it unsaf some experts do not believe the iraqi modm has the resources and competency to be effective and that preparation and

resettlement programs capacity of the iraqi government some of iraqs neighbors have quietly expressed their displeasure over perceived lack of support from the iraqi government for its own citizens who have fled abroad some officials and aid workers have asserted that iraqs 25 million pledge in 2007 and delays in payment of th is pledge until mid 2008 to assist iraqi refugees in neighboring states was an indication of the maliki governments unwillingness to seriously assist its own people other experts believe that there may be sectarian dimension to the majority shiite iraqi governments behavior over 60 of iraqis in jordan and syria are sunni muslims48 in the june 2008 fy2008 and fy2009 emergency supplemental congre ss raised concerns about the level of resources the government of iraq has so fa r dedicated to assisting iraqi refugees and idps other experts have suggested that the modm lacks capacity on the ground and its ability to respond to the disp lacement crisis must be addressed increased international funding unhcr and other experts say that more international aid in the form of contributions and program development is required for host countries domestic ngos and for organizations providing assi stance such as unhcr it is often difficult for international ngos to regist er in these countri and greater access needs to be negotiated unhcr is short of funds and cannot provide adequate assistance or protection to iraqi refugees in its findings the iraq study group i sg refers specifically to the dramatic increase in population displ acement that could cause further destabilization both in iraq and the region and contribute to humanitarian crisis specifically the isg suggests that the united states should tak the lead in funding assistance requests from the unhcr and other humanitarian agencies recommendation 6649 some argue that bringing pressure to bear on other donors to participate in these relief efforts either by funding unhcrs current supplemental appeal for iraqi refugeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33936crs19 or by providing bilateral f unding to host countries with specific allocations to iraqi refugees could make measurable difference in the humanitarian situation developing on the ground us humanitarian response in iraq determining the immediate steps the united states can take with regard to iraqi idps in particular and in more general sense to the iraqi refugees and how other international partners could be involved may prove to be critical in the next phase of the us iraq strategy iraqs intern population displacement appears to have created humanitarian crisis that may be beyond the current capacity on the ground difficult decisions lie ahead including iden tifying who should be in charge of any comprehensive relief effort bringing to gether key players and working out coordination strategy whethe r or not the modm has the resources and competence to be effective remains to be seen in the long term but in the immediate circumstance it is reportedly overwhelmed it is not clear what role the us military might play in the humanitarian response on local level in iraq and whether the provincial reconstruction teams prts may be an immediate resource to consider competing aid and budget priorities amid efforts to tackle rising us budget deficits by among other measures slowing or reducing discretiona ry spending or finding the resources to sustain us aid pledges may be difficult when disasters require immediate emergency relief the administration may fund pledge s by depleting most worldw ide disaster contingency accounts in order to respond to future hum anitarian crises however these resources would need to be replenished if not re plenished us capacity to respond to other emergencies could be curtaile d donor fatigue is also an issue with some experts concerned about funding prio rities and the ongoing need for resources for other disaster areas in the case of iraq with humanitarian crisis at hand the question of whether sufficient funds have been requested by the administration for potential crisis remains some are also concerned bout whether the us government should continue to fund the humanitarian needs of displaced iraqis through supplemental appropriations with likely budgetary ga p at hand some believe the united states has greater responsibility to lead the way on committing funds to address the needs of iraqi refugees and idps they argue th at if the united states increased its funding and resettlement numbers this would encourage other countries in the region and more broadly in the international community to do the same for broader political reasons finding balance on burdensharing with the international community

clear whether there are policy implications for refugee resettlement at present and whether when viewed as temporary situation the obligation by the united states to resettle iraqi refugees b ecomes less pressing in add ition there is some concern that if among those determined to be most vulnerable and in need proportionally more christian iraqis are resettled in the united states than muslim iraqis this could contribute to the perception of preferen ce granted to groups of one religion over another the question of granting preference to vulnerable iraqis and iraqis who are at risk because they have worked for or been closely associated with the us government including the us military may also have unforseen consequences some have questioned whet her it may create resentment among iraqis seeking resettling who do not qualify for preferential treatment others have asked whether iraqis will see collaboration with the united states as means to resettle in the united states and
