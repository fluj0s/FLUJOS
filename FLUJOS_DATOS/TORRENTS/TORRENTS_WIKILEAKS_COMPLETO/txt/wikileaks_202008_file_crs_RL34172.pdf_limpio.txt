afghanistan the legislation that would reduce the number of us troops falls into two groups one set of proposals calls for withdr awal of us troops from iraq starting at specific point in time with some bills setting either binding deadline or nonbinding goal for completion of the draw down most of these bills exclude from the withdrawal requirement any us troops assigned to certain limited missions including the defense of us facilities and the conduct of targeted antiterrorist missions of limited duration second set of proposals would indirec tly compel reduction in the number of us troops in iraq by prohibiting the ployment of units that did not meet certain standards of combatreadiness by requiring that units be deployed for longer than the maximum length of time allowed by the policy of their parent service and by barring the return to iraq of units prev iously deployed there unless they had minimum period of time at their home station or dwell time before the second iraq deployment the army is unable to stain its current leve l of deployments in iraq unless units are deployed for longer pe riods andor are redeployed after shorter dwell times than army policy dictates moreover the tempo at which units have to return to iraq has reportedly inhibited most army brigades from meeting some of the established readiness criteria httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34172crs6 the first version of the emergency s upplemental appropriations bill hr 1591 included both types of troop reduction requirements it required withdrawal to proceed according to one of two alterna tive timetables depending on the extent to which the iraqi government met certain benchmarks of security and political reconciliation it also prohibite d the deployment of units th at did not meet readiness standards and the deployment of any unit fo r longer than was called for by its parent service 365 days in the case of army its and 210 days for marine corps units an amendment to hr 1591 introduced by senator cochran that would strike the language setting timetable for redeployment was defeated in the senate by vote of 8216 the bill narrowly passed both the house and the senate in
