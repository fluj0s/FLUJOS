develop reliable and affordable alternatives to oil and natural gas has led to the belief that the power to ensure access to international energy resources has shifted from energy consumers to energy producers1 since 2005 russia has several times drastically raised the price of its natural gas supplies to european countries as means to squeeze them economically and politically these actions also underscored the shift towards the ability of energy producers to exert pressure on countries dependent upon them for supplies 2 the united states and its european allies are discussing the appropriate institutions and policies for ensuring energy security the bush administration introduced discussion of energy security at nato in february 2006 with the support of key allies at the same time eu governments view energy security in broad manner and most believe that political and economic measures are the first steps to ensure access to energy resources most eu members are also members of nato and the two organizations may handle energy security in complementary manner

today eu countries as whole import 50 of their energy needs figure expected to rise to 70 by 2030 russia is key supplier of oil and natural gas germany imports 32 of its energy from russia poland imports twothirds of its natural gas needs from russia and 97 of its oil as whole eu countries import 25 of their energy needs from russia in one estimate by 2030 eu countries will import 40 of their gas needs from russia and 45 of their oil from the middle east 3 in addition oil in particular is found largely in unstable areas of the world such as the middle east factor in us and european concerns over energy security european governments view energy security primar ily in an economic and political context the eu floated proposal meant to build interdepen dence between eu members and russia to secure reliable energy supplies from russia the eu has discussed with russia structured arrangement in which russia would sell energy not only to its principal customers in central and eastern europe but to more distant customers in western europe in return the eu is asking moscow to allow european companies to develop russian energy reserves4 but russia has rejected key elements of this proposal moscow for the most part has not allowed foreign ownership of its pipelines and has squeezed out some foreign companies that were developing its energy reserves at the same time it has secured access to some european markets for example through agreements to sell gas to hungary and france5 1 paolo scaroni europeans must face the threat to energy s upplies financial times january 18

in december 2007 russia turkmenistan and kazakhstan signed an agreement to build new gas pipeline around the caspian sea the new pipeline would send central asian natural gas to the russian energy grid russia has repriced such gas from another pipeline twofold before selling it to european customers the united states and some eu governments have sought instead transcaspian sea pipeline that would bypass the russian grid and provide natural gas more cheaply to europe thereby diminishing as well greater potential russian leverage tied to the supply of energy 6 russia has also discussed linking its natural gas supply grid to that of algeria which also supplies gas to europe eu energy commissioner andris pi ebalgs has charged that the two governments may be planning to develop an energy cartel that would further weaken competitive pricing7 to prevent impediments to competition and to improve energy security the eu commission is urging new infrastructure including terminals to receive liquified natural gas construction of new pipelines from the caspian region and north africa and single european energy grids for continental electricity and natural gas markets to challenge the grip of national energy firms on their national markets8 the commission has also recommended that companies producing raw energy not be allowed to own distribution networks step intended to encourage competition some eu governments such as france have large public entities that own both the sources of energy and the distribution network and oppose this proposal should the eu eventually adopt the commissions proposal russian efforts to buy parts of the european energy grid might be set back few observers believe that moscows pricing agreements for its gas exports to its neighbors indicate that the market process is working successfully some eu officials contend that russia needs european and other firms good will and continued investment in its decaying energy infrastructure to maintain existing production and develop its oil and gas reserves to sell energy products abroad 9 some european and us officials believe that germany may become too reliant on russian energy supplies and move away from its eu partners and the united states east european states in particular once in moscows sphere believe that they could find themselves unable to ensure reliable and affordable energy supplies from gazprom the powerful statecontrolled russian energy company they point to the former schroeder governments deal with gazprom to involve german companies in the development of russiangerman gas pipeline under the baltic sea as special arrangement that appears to promise supply to germany that other states might not enjoy 10 some governments believe that russia has little interest in market forces in the energy sector in this view russia seeks high energy prices to maximize profits these governments note that the russian government has prevailing control over gazprom hardly model of capitalist continued and eni an italian company to codevelop the large shtokman gas field in eastern russia 6 putin signs deal tightening gas control international

ratcheting up the price of natural gas to its neighbors knowing that ukraine for example had reliable alternatives for gas supply gazprom raised prices threefold and threatened sixfold rise gazprom also controls the transit of nonrussian energy supplies to ukraine and threatened rapid rises in transit fees as well russia has temporarily followed similar policies towards georgia lithuania and belarus political motives seem apparent in such policies in 2003 putin himself said that gazprom is powerful political and economic lever of influence over the rest of the world 11 in december 2007 putin designated dimitri medvedev the president of gazprom as his successor as russian president move that could signal continuation of russias aggressive energy policy

event of deliberate disruption of energy flows natos military capability could be severely limited should russia or other suppliers cut european energy supplies in crisis to counter such move nato might coor dinate policies among member states and with nonmember partner governments to share resources and to bring an end to an energy disruption nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energyproducing states facing unrest iran has threatened to use its energy reserves to attain political objectives in response to possible sanctions due to its refusal to comply with requirements by the international atomic energy agency on its nuclear program iran has threatened to cut off or limit its energy supplies to buyers beyond deliberate policies affecting energy security there are many countries in central asia and the middle east that are unstable have need for new energy infrastructure investment and have insecure transportation systems due to political unrest some of these countries are in natos partnership for peace program or desire closer association with nato nato member states increasingly believe that the alliance must be global player with global partners this trend is evident in afghanistan for example where australia and new zealand are expending resources to bring stability through natos international security assistance force even though the two countries are not nato member s natos role in energy security could be complementary to the eus effort to strengthen market forces and interdependence in the international energy sector us officials agree with their eu counterparts that market forces can lead to greater energy security diversification of supply for example through building more pipelines that are secure is one course of action turkey could play major role as key pipelines under discussion originating in the caspian region may cross its territory thereby avoiding the russian energy grid 12 joint investment efforts to build such pipelines in and with energy producers such as kazakhstan and azerbaijan could be an important step in this direction both countries are members of natos partnership for peace program and are seeking closer relations with the united states and its allies development of more liquified natural gas lng transport and reception facilities from distant suppliers such as nigeria into europe could be another course of action coupled with the development of new oil and gas pipelines could be an offer from nato andor eu members to 11 jamestown eurasian daily monitor january 19 2006 putin cited in

military efforts to secure energy resources the first gulf war while not nato operation involved key member states such as the united states france br itain and italy that sought not only to liberate kuwait but also to ensure that iraq did not control kuwaiti oil and threaten saudi arabia and other gulf producers nato governments also took part in military operation in the 1980s explicitly designed to secure the supply of oil operation earnest will was an effort primarily by nato states to protect tanker traffic in the gulf during the iraniraq war 19801988 beginning in 1984 iran first and then iraq attacked neutral oil tankers to cut off the others means of financial support iran attacked kuwaiti and saudi tankers in those tw countries own waters to ensure that all gulf states understood that none was secure the soviet union followed shortly thereafter by the united states made offers to the kuwaitis who lost the most tankers to reflag their vessels under the ussr and the us flags an offer that was accepted after iraqi aircraft attacked the uss stark in 1987 killing 37 sailors the reagan administration formed coalition of likeminded states above all from nato to protect tanker traffic in the gulf britain france and the netherlands were important participants in operation earnest will the allies captured iranian vessels mining shipping lanes in the gulf and engaged in firefights with iranian troops using oil platforms to fire on ships in february 2006 nato governments discussed range of potential actions in the event of future disruption of oil supplies caused by military action some member states reportedly raised the possibility of protecting tanker traffic and oil platforms in periods of conflict and using satellites to monitor developments in areas where energy resources come under threat 14 g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 the 110th congress has shown strong interest in energy security

partners natos role in energy security remains uncertain however as some individual members may prefer greater role for the eu political role in energy security for na to seems most likely in the near future under natos istanbul cooperation initiative of 2004 the allies have begun discussions with bahrain qatar kuwait and the united arab emirates to build practical cooperation in the security field including the fight against terrorism some middle eastern governments are concerned about terrorist attacks on their oil facilities but it is not publicly known whether nato has discussed this issue with the four governments partnership for peace countries such as kazakhstan and azerbaijan that are important energy producers often seek ways to associate themselves more closely with nato in part to diminish russian influence on their soil in part to develop reliable partners in an unstable region it is possible that na to will seek ways to provide security for the energy infrastructure of such countries at the same time the eu may encourage its member states to invest more heavily in that infrastructure there is division in the eu over management of the unions growing dependence on russian oil and gas several states led by poland wish to engage nato more fully in ensuring energy security in this relationship while in the early stages of discussion poland is exploring role for nato and the united states perhaps only diplomatically in which us leverage on moscow could be an element for encouraging responsible russian behavior and deflecting any russian attempt to divide the europeans most eu governments clearly prefer that market forces secure access to energy wellstructured commercial partnership with russia might be one mark of such policy another would be the effort of the eu3 germany france and britain and the united states to curtail irans nuclear program the eu3 desire completion of that effort in the before there is any discussion of military organization like nato assuming responsibility for broader policy of energy security in addition some nato partner governments in central asia and the middle east might be reluctant to accept allied assistance in securing the resource that is central to their survival the belief is widespread in the middle east that the united states invaded iraq in part to secure access to its oil there might be popular opposition to any nato effort to secure energy infrastructure in some of these countries moreover the united states has been unable to provide full security to pipelines in iraq and na to might have similar difficulties in partnership countries russia is also factor turkmenistan and kazakhstan depend upon russia as transit country for their pipeline shipments to the west and could be subject to moscows pressure to spurn nato proposals of assistance g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 paul gallis specialist in european
