immediately upon enactment legislative steps were initiated to change and modify the tax treatment of capital gains and losses since 1913 at leas t twenty major legislative changes and countless minor changes have been enacted capital gains tax rates were last reduced in 2003 while the holding period to qualify for longterm capital gains treatment was reduced in 19981 in may 2003 the 108th congress passed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 unde r this act the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gains income was reduced to 5 0 for ta x years after 2007 for taxpayers in the

onciliation act of 2005 extended these lower rates through december 31 2010httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20250crs2 2 for more information see crs report 96769 capital gains taxes an overview by jane g gravelleunder current income tax law capital gain or loss is the result of sale or exchange of capital asset if the asset is sold for higher price than its acquisition price then the sale produces capital gain if the asset is sold for lower price than its acquisition price then the sale produces capital loss capital assets held longer than 12 months are considered longterm assets while assets held 12 months or less are considered shortterm assets capital gains on short term assets are taxed at regular income tax rates gains on longterm assets are taxed at maximum tax rate of 15 ideally tax consistent with theoretically correct measure of income would be assessed on real inflationadjusted income when that income accrues to the taxpayer conversely real losses would be deducted as they accrue to the taxpayer in addition under an ideal comprehensive income tax any untaxed real appreciation in the value of capital assets given as gifts or bequests would be subject to tax at the time of transfer2 obviously the current law tax treatment of capital gains income varies considerably from the ideal treatment under comprehens ive income tax one response to this deviation from comprehensive approach to the taxation of capital gains income has been call for further reductions in the tax rates applicable to capital gains income one argument for lowering capital gain s taxes has focused on the benefits of reducing lockin effects lockin occurs because the income tax liability on capital gains income can be deferred until the asset is sold tax deferral creates bias because individuals faced with large lumpsum tax are reluctant to sell their capital assets even though on pretax basis they could earn higher rate of retu rn on an alternative investment this lockin effect tends to retard the efficient allocation of resources in the economy with tax consider ations tending in some cases to dominate other market forces proponents of capital gains tax reductions argue th at cutting capital gains taxes will reduce lockin effects and free up resources increase savings and stimulate economic growth and make the tax code less complex cr itics are concerned about the distributional effects possibl tax shelter abuses and the revenue losses associated with reductions in capital gains taxes some commentators argue that reducing taxes on longterm capital gains will not reduce federal revenue but will in fact result in increased revenue it is argued that as taxes are reduced on capital gains lockin is reduced which increases realizations and investments in capital assets the net effect is to increase federal revenues although taxes on increased capital gains r ealizations would offset some of the initial cost of cutting capital gains taxes th ere is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the unlocking effects it appears that over the longrun the revenue generated from an increase in capital gains realizations accompanying tax cut would not be large enough to offset the static revenue loss from the tax cut itself net revenue gain is also less likely under current law than it was in the past in part because the increase in realizations would be taxed at lower rates than would have been the case in the past httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20250crs3 3 the effective marginal tax rate the tax rate that taxpayer actually faces on both ordinary income and longterm capital gains income can be higher than the statutory tax rate because of the interaction of various other provisions in the tax code the following two tables present backgr ound information that may prove helpful to policy makers as they debate the merits of further capital gains tax changes in the 110th congress table 1 shows the statutory maximum tax rates on both ordinary income and longterm capital gains income since the adoption of the federal individual income tax in 1913 this table also shows the holding peri od required for capital ssets to qualify for longterm capital gains tax treatment two major observations can be drawn from the data in table 1 the first item is that with the exception of the first nine years the maximum statutory tax rate on long term capital gains has been substantially lower than the maximum statutory tax rate on other forms of income3 the second observation is that the current maximum statutory tax rate on longterm capital gains income is lower than it has ever been in the post world war ii time frame table 2 shows realized capital gains and federal individual income taxes paid on realized capital gains for selected years 1955 through 2002 it also shows cbo estimates of realized capital gains and taxes pa id on capital gains for 2003 through 2016 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20250crs4 table 1 statutory
