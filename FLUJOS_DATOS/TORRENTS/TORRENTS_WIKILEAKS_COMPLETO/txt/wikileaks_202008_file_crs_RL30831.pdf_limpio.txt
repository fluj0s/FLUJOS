assistance and issues for congress summary since the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 there have been four wars in the balkans us humanitarian assistance programs have been key part of the overall multilateral effort to relieve human suffering and assist refugees and internally displaced persons idps during these conflicts and in their immediate aftermath with the emergency phase of the kosovo crisis winding down and political transformation well underway in serbia congress and the administration can be expected to assess the status of us humanitarian assistance in the balkans the balkans serve as leading example of new category of crisis the complex humanitarian emergency in which the united states played significant role in the provision of humanitarian assistance the very nature of humanitarian disastersthe need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provi reliefhas resulted in an unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of on both policy and operational level us humanitarian assistance in the region over the past decade including projected spending for fy2001 is over 2 billion however exact dollar amounts are difficult to determine with any accuracy as each agency has its own budget accounting detail and regional specificity nevertheless the us response can be captured in terms of spending and relief efforts in trends over time members of congress have expressed concern that the united states is carrying too much of the cost of the confl icts in the balkans particularly with regard to the war in kosovo the europeans are now paying much greater portion of the reconstruction costs in the region due to differences in purpose and scope comparisons in spending are not easily calculated for example the european community humanitarian office echo has spent over 2 billion in the region in the past decade but this does not include substantial bilateral assistance by member states ongoing challenges in the region remain particularly with regard to the 17 million refugees and idps and demonstrate the need for continued humanitarian assistance the us role as part of multilateral effort is one area of potential interest to congress another is the link between humanitarian assistance and broader foreign policy goals other issues include current levels of commitment determining which agencies and departments are the best providers and the overall effectiveness of emergency aid not only in the balkans but with application to future complex humanitarian emergencies

balkans may need to be reassessed in light of recent developments in yugoslaviathe ousting of slobodan milosevic political transformation underway in serbia and the deescalation of the emergency phase of the kosovo crisis while the longterm plan is to replace emergency relief with nonemergency aid1 to support reconstruction efforts us humanitarian assistance in the region is still viewed widely as integral to the overall multilateral effort to assist yugoslavia with its recovery the purpose of this report is to clarify the united states interest and role in humanitarian assistance examine its relevance to burden sharing and coordination with european partners and raise policy questions for congress and the new administration in the overall discussion of involvement in the balkans2 overview of the balkan humanitarian crisis the complex humanitarian emergency has emerged as new category of crisis which can be defined in different ways it can be viewed according to the situation on the ground scale and intensity of population dislocation destruction of social networkscommunity and infrastructure insecurity of civilians and noncombatants human rights abuses by the complexity of the response needed to address these problems or by the multicausal factors which may have contributed to the escalation of conflict in the first place during the 1990s crisis operations increased in wartorn countries and regions throughout the world along with the numbers of those providing relief primarily humanitarian organizatio ns and international actors multinational military forces also served greater peacekeeping role in these internal wars the media added new measure of influence to the response to such crises in the form of greater access andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs2 3 defined broadly as those seeking asylum outside their country of citizenship with protection provided under international law 4 direct result of internal wars the internally displaced are also seeking asylum but within their states borders idps do not have the same protection as refugees under international law the plight of this group has gained international recognition as problem that needs to be addressed 5 this report is not intended to give political or historical description of the events on the ground an analysis of the key chronological events can be found in other crs reports

francelive reporting in these situations the plight of the refugee3 was one critical element of population movement the internally displaced person idp4 became another conducting humanitarian operation under these circumstances in the balkans meant that access to populations in need and the distribution of emergency relief supplies was often hampered by security concerns not only for those needing assistance but for humanitarian personnel as well the sheer volume of players in the field included range of actors and interests creating much greater coordination challenge and often contributing to duplication of efforts or competition over the same sources of money and projects the balkans serve as an important case study of complex humanitarian emergency operation leading example of the challenges required in the provision of humanitarian assistance in the last decade5 according to united nations high commissioner for refugees the war in yugoslavia became the worst refugee crisis in europe since world war ii6 in bosniaherzegovina between 1992 and 1995 the humanitarian relief operation was massive undertaking which provided humanitarian supplies to over 27 million refugees and idps security risks logistical complexity and lack of cooperation from the parties to the conflict expanded the scope of the operation and increased the difficulties faced by agencies and humanitarian personnel which at times exceeded 3000 individuals from more than 250 organizations7 in 1998 the situation in kosovo which over the past decade had resulted in several hundred thousand albanians leaving the province dramatically changed course well before the rambouillet negotiations8 under increasing threat from yugoslav forces and paramilitar ies kosovar albanians had begun to flee creating over 170000 refugees from and 260000 idps within kosovo by the end of the nato campaign in june 1999 800000 kosovar albanians had fled or were expelled with majority seeking refuge in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom albania and montenegro negotiations to keep neighboring borders open resulted in the humanitarian evacuation program for the provision of temporary asylum in countries outside the region and the involvement of nato military forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs3 9 unhcr state of the worlds refugees p 219in camp construction and

population migration and refugees the us role in humanitarian assistance responding to the crisis in the balkans while there was and continues to be debate about the us involvement in the balkans in terms of its strategic geopolitical or vital interests humanitarian assistance was viewed as much less controver sial and was provided quickly congress has consistently supported humanitarian efforts during natural or manmade disasters as means of responding to crises in the short term taking the lead and promoting us presence humanitarian assistance may not reach the threshold of actual intervention but as limited response enjoys strong measure of bipartisan support and priority this was also the case in the balkans over the past decadehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs4 10 see

please refer to lois mchugh international disasters how the united states responds crs report rs20622 july 6 2000sanctions exemptions for humanitarian assistance sanctions imposed on serbia by the united states european union eu and united nations over several years specifically exempt humanitarian assistance10 through fy2000 specific us laws prohibit ed reconstruction aid in serbia but exempted humanitarian and democratization assistance in serbia and all aid to kosovo and montenegro the eu humanitarian aid office echo states that its humanitaria n assistance is not subject to political conditionality11 while the european sanction restrictions may differ from those of the united states in general humanitarian assistance is exempt from the regulations imposed by sanctions12 historically congress has consistently exempted humanitarian assistance from restrictions placed on foreign assistance the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended pl 87195 allows the president to provide disaster assistance not withstanding any other provision of this or any other actwhich means that humanitarian assistance is excluded from the potential restrictions of certain programs agencies involved in us humanitarian assistance within the us government there are three main sources of humanitarian assistance the us agency for international development usaid the state department and the department of defense dod each is guided by specific legislative authority including but not limited to the foreign assistance act 1961 the migration and refugee assistance act 1962 and the refugee act 1980 specific legislation includes title ii of pl 480 food for peace appropriated through the department of agriculture and administered by usaid section 416 b of the agricultural act department of state emergency refugee and migration account and title 10 section 2551 of the foreign assistance act and the current foreign operations appropriations bill13 while humanitarian assistance is assumed to be urgent food shelter and medical needs those agencies within the us government providing this support expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances funds may be used to deliver the service required or provided as grants to international organizations ios international governmental and nongovernmental agencies ngos and private or religious voluntary agencies pvoshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs5 14 other departments within usaid may provide some form of humanitarian assistance but it is unclear how much for example the aid program support for east european democracy act of 1989 seed allocates resources to address womens health child survival trauma counseling and social welfare and demining activities which may well be considered by some to be humanitarian 15 governed by pl 103326 the maximum amount is 100 million authorized in sections 2 and 3 or pl 87510 of the migration and refugee assistance act of 1962 16 when there is functional

authorizes donation of excess nonlethal supplies under the denton program19 funding of us humanitarian assistance to the balkans defining humanitarian assistance the very nature of humanitarian disastersthe need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide reliefhas resulted in an unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of on both policy and operational level although there are guidelines set out through legislation on foreign relations and specific laws governing humanitarian assistance in practice the president has the flexibility to decid what disaster assistance to provide and to set out its terms and conditions as stated in the foreign assistance act the president is authorized to furnish assist ance to any foreign country international organization or private voluntary organization on such terms and conditions as he may determine for international disaster relief and rehabilitation20 further the president is granted special authority to draw down military equipment of up to 100 million per year if an unforeseen emergency requires immediate military assistance to foreign country or international organization and it cannot be met under any other provision21 congress does not define what it considers to be humanitarian activities in an effort to keep it as broad as possible and flexible enough to adapt to human itarian needs the focus of humanitarian assistance may include basic needs child survival education refugees but in practice the provision of humanitarian assistance is typically case and time specific essentially all the legislation governing humanitarian or disaster assistance leaves the definition up to the presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs7 22 livelihood strategy considers the specific context and circumstances of the conflict in designing effective programs that work with local capacities and abilities to cope with emergencieswhat becomes evident is that the us role in humanitarian assistance is broad far reaching and covers many elements directly concerned with the provision of relief and strategies for strengthening how people survive over time22 what is less clear is when an activity might be described as humanitarian postconflict transition or reconstruction and to what degree this needs to remain flexible to adapt to changes in policy or operations on the ground explaining the numbers questions about authority definitions and categories of services make up part of the reason it is challenge to grasp the concept and function of humanitarian assistance another factor has to do with how the numbers are generated in budgets within the us government and the degree of accuracy they reflect each agency has its own budget with its own criteria accounting detail and regional specificity the fact that an urgent response to humanitarian crises is often required only compounds the problem budgets may reflect regional support ie the balkans certain area the former yugoslavia specific countries serbia or combination thereof over time and changing events for example since 1999 some budgets have separated kosovo from serbia while others have kept them together particularly in comparing assistance levels with other countries financial sources may be compared against other forms of assistance blankets etc or they may reflect commitments of support rather than overall obligations all of these variables make reading the numbers and drawing accurate conclusions nearly impossible as it is not possible to compare levels of participation accurately dollar for dollar the following column chart will instead demonstrate trends over the course of the conflict and overall assistance provided by the united states between fiscal years 1992 and 1999 it is also important to note that greater assistance levels may well indicate an overall increase in amounts provided but higher spending may also occur because it was more difficult and therefore expensive due to events on the ground to get aid through the information entered for this chart is based on estimates and may be incomplete overall spending by the united states on humanitarian assistance in the balkans between 19921999 is close to 2 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs8 figure 1 levels and sources of us humanitarian aid in the balkans table 2 us humanitarian assistance

for example contribu tions to the 1999 consolidated interagency appeal for the southeastern europe humanitarian operation reveal substantial donations from canada denmark germany the netherlands norway sweden and many otherseuropean burden sharing closely linked to the us humanitarian assistance efforts in the balkans is the question of burden sharing with the europeanswhat they have done and are doing members of congress have expressed concern that the united states is carrying too much of the cost of the conflicts in the balkans particularly with regard to the war in kosovo as it shouldered most of the military expenses associated with the bombing campaign adding fuel to the fire was the perception that the europeans are quick to pledge but slow to deliver on humanitarian and reconstruction aid congress demonstrated an interest in setting burden sharing goals with europe including for humanitaria n assistance as demonstrated in several legislative proposals23 what percentage of the humanitarian expenses the united states pays in terms of the overall conflict and by comparison with its european allies is very difficult to determine with any accuracy european community humanitarian office echo echo the humanitarian arm of the eu was created to aid people in emergency situations in noneu countries it funds and coordinates humanitarian activities through its partners ngos and specialized ios like unhcr wfp etc its work encompasses broad range of actionseme rgency relief disaster prevention and preparedness refugees short term rehabilitation and reconstruction work the boundaries between echos humanitarian and mediumterm development activities overlap and the distinction is far from explicit it views relief rehabilitation and development as linked along continuum whereby longterm development can reduce the need for emerg ency relief effective emergency relief can contribute to development and better rehabilitation can ease the transition between the two in order to save the lives of victims and rescue the suffering24 as within the us government comparing budgets and numbers is difficult due to the differences in purpose and scope while the exact amounts spent in each area may not be clear it is very evident in the overall picture that humanitarian assistance is being sent to the region from both sides of the atlantic in addition other donors like japan although not focus of this report also make substantial contributions25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs10 26 source european community humanitarian office us

or bilateral assistance by eu member states it is impossible to determine exactly what percent of the total humanitarian funding comes from europe and what percent from the united states for example echo has spent over 2 billion in the region in the past decade but this does not include substantial bilateral assistance by member states however it is clear that the europeans are now carrying much

idps and the elderly includes shelter food medicines water supply and sanitation basic humanitarian support to the populations in need energy assistance basic security measures transition assistance to refugees and idps although longer part of relief operations refugees and idps still need to return receive settlement assistance and services an overall strategy is needed to determine how many

the region plus 1427 million28 in other humanitarian assistance29 it is important to note that current projections may be lower than fy2000 and appear to represent decline in humanitarian assistance part of the planning and budgeting process results in funds being held back until needs are more fully identified thus additional monies are likely available for humanitarian assistance just not earmarked at this time for specific line item european humanitarian assistance 2001 based on rough estimates the eu has committed 200 million euros roughly 183 million now in humanitarian assistance and an additional 7692 million euros between roughly 699 million and 914 million this year30 links to broader foreign policy goals humanitarian assistance is the most flexible policy tool that can be quickly brought to bear in crisis when there is consensus on how or when to intervene it can buy time and keep options open as was the case in the balkans it may be an avenue to achieve minimal consensus and still demonstrate action according to unhcr in bosniaherzegovina in 1993 the international community was unable to agree on how to intervene and with what strategy but was able to reach consensus to support the humanitarian relief operation led by unhcr governments were willing to fund the relief operation with little agreement on anything else essentially unhcrs view is that the humanitarian operation increasingly became fig leaf and the only visible response of the international community to the war31 sometimes the easiest decision in terms of finding path of least resistance humanitarian assistance can expand beyond its immediate function it may provide the means to maintain some form of conta ct with countryregion or mitigate tensions over policy towards region within the us governmen t or between or among its allies humanitarian assistance means doing something to avert crisis to provide support to allies and to maintain presence in the region some of these factors may have been at play during the kosovo crisis the images of human suffering portrayed by the media only reinforced the need to do something unhcr says that donor governments responded to the publicity in much greater numbers thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs13 32 unhcr the state of the worlds refugees p 239 33 unhcr the state of the worlds refugees p 239for crises elsewhere such as africa32 political considerations play role in the way assistance is given and to whom unhcr officials have suggested that the direct correlation between the bombing and escalation of violence on the ground in kosovo and increase in the refugee crisis may have influenced further the degree to which the international community wante d to be seen caring for the refugees and that assistance was often provided directly to specific ngos and to the macedonian and albanian governments with little regard for the coordination requirements of multilateral initiative33 humanitarian assistance carries some weight as point of neutral intervention in crisis how it is used and whether it becomes more of strategic policy tool depends upon the situation what other governments are doing and the degree to which the united states has further interest in the region should the united states decide to reduce its humanitarian assistance support does it diminish its standing among its allies or affect its interests in other ways in the balkans issues involving burden sharing general stability in south eastern europe and the impact of refugee flows were additional interrelated causes of concern issues for congress the provision of humanitarian assistance in the balkans regio n has been priority for the united states although it remains to be seen how the new administration views humanitarian intervention in general and its policy towards the balkans in particular congress may consider some of the following issues what are the foreign policy ramifications of complex humanitarian emergencies it is worth considering whether the complex humanitarian emergency in the balkans is an exampl of something new or pattern that can be anticipated to repeat itself if it is new or perceived as such how does this affect the us response furthermore since the president has great deal of flexibility over us involvement once commitment to humanitarian effort takes place does this make the longterm participation in reconstruction and political solutions more likely is it possible to do the former without taking on the latter what commitment to humanitarian assistance is now required by the united states the europeans are making the case that they are carrying most of the humanitarian and reconstruction costs in the balkans still the united states remains vital part of the overall allied effort in the balkans critical point concerns unresolved questions within yugoslavia the impact of potential trouble spots in kosovo relations between serbia and montenegro and relations between serbia and kosovo despite the positive developments of the last few months many uncertainties remain which could have serious implications should the situation escalate again even if it does not result in largescale conflict the us presence inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30831crs14 34 document a55494the region in addition to its contribution to humanitarian assistance may be key stabilizing factor are the right agencies and departments providing us assistance many of the unresolved issues in yugoslavia are affected by the role played by agencies and departments within the united states some have argued that the military is overengaged by default just because dod is the only place where funds are readily available whether or not funds could be transferred to other agencies particularly for the tasks of reconstruction are important points of discussion in shifting from relief to development and in planning an overall exit strategy in keeping with its mandate oti plans to wrap up its work in kosovo by september 2001 but the large problem of refugees and idps throughout the region remains particularly in serbia whether humanitarian assistance should continue to support reintegration efforts or whether such aid should be phased out in favor of other kinds of aid yet to be determined is open to question as is the us role in these kinds of programs how can the united states contribute to the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance although the provision of relief in the kosovo conflict was reasonably effective this was not always the case in the balkans when assistance was delivered in areas of open conflict first it is important to examine whether humanitarian assistance is going to those for whom it is intended evaluating and tracking provision of supplies is difficult during conflict and impossible to completely control at the same time there is the role of the ngoincluding its mission and sources of fundingin what has become major independent enterprise in these kinds of conflicts there is the potential for misuse intended or unintended which may require closer analysis of the performance of providers the safety and protection of refugees and humanitari an workers is another important issue last year the secretary general reported to the general assembly on the safety and security of united nations personnel34 growing number of humanitarian workers in various parts of the world have been put at great risk or lost their lives in providing humanitarian assist ance the degree to which security force eg nato in the kosovo crisis protects humanitarian relief workers and parties to the conflict will have some bearing on who is in charge the security measures taken and provided and the perception of whether the humanitarian community has taken sides in the conflict some of the issues of us humanitarian assistance in the balkans may have relevance to the worldwide character of contemporary conflict and may be useful in an exami nation of the lessons learned in dealing with future complex humanitarian emergencies in any case as crises proliferate some problems similar to those faced in this region will probably arise and the level and sources of us humanitarian assistance will inevitably have an important impact as they have in the balkans
