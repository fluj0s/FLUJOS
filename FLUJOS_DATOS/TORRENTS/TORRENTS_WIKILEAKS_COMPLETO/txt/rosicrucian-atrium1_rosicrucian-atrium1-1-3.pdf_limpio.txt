master monograph rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 13 know thyself and thou shalt know the universe and the gods 2007 supreme grand lodge of the ancient mystical order rosæ crucis 008 published by the grand lodge of the english language jurisdiction amorc inc 0707first atrium 1 concurrence 2it is unfortunate that certain schools of philosoph deny the importance of the material world and refuse to acknowledge its function in the cosmic scheme although we should not make the mistake of glorifying matter we do need to admit that the material world has its us efulness to do otherwise would mean that our conception of life would be irr ational as rosicrucians we need to interest ourselves in the remarkable law s of nature manifesting in the material world and in our bodies we will then obtain better appreciation of the physical world and more intimate understan ding of the harmony that must prevail between the physical and the spiritual life will thus be revealed in its true sense the necessity for studying natur laws and the purpose of creation is beautifully expressed in the following quotation taken from work by the philosopher and theologian william ellery ch anning as you progress in the studies you will understand more fully the tru th of the thoughts expressed by this author matter was made for spirit body for mind the mind is the end of this living organization of flesh and bones of nerves nd muscles and the end of this vast system of sea and land and air and skies this unbounded creation of sun and moon and stars and clouds and seasons was not ordained merely to feed and clothe the body but first and supremel to awaken nourish and expand the soul to be the school of the intellect the nurse of thought and imagination the field for the active powers rev elation of the creator and bond of social union we are placed in the materi creation not to be its slaves but to master it and to make it minister to our highest powers it is interesting to observe how much the material world does for the mind most of the sciences arts professions and occupations of life grow out of our connection with matter the natural philosopher th physician the lawyer the artist and the legislator find the objects or occ asions of their researches in matter the poet borrows his beautiful imagery from matter the sculptor and painter express their noble conceptions through mat ter material wants rouse the world to activity the material organs of sense especially the eye wake up infinite thoughts in the mind to maintain then t hat the mass of men are and must be so immersed in matter that their souls can not rise is to contradict the great end of their connection with matter i ma intain that the philosophy continued on page 11 3rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 1 on this day of the rc path dear fratres and sorores the initiation you have just carried out in your sa nctum makes you neophyte of the ancient and mystical order rosae cr ucis as such you have passed through the great portal which gives you acc ess to the antechamber of the symbolic temple of our tradition this antec hamber is composed of three allegorical rooms each of which is known in our order as an atrium in the coming months you will pass through each of these three rooms and receive the knowledge connected with them if you p rove yourself worthy of this knowledge you will then be allowed to cross threshold which will give you access to the initiate section despite all appearances keep in mind that this adm ission is earned and is far from automatic many are the neophytes who l eave our order before completing the study of the preparatory degrees th students often think that it was their own free will which put an end to their affiliation on purely objective level this is quite accurate because eac h of us uses free will as we desire however on another level the path approac hed by these students did not correspond to the deepest aspects of their pers onalities for reasons which cannot be the object of any general explanation from now on it would be appropriate as neophyte of our order that you begin your sanctum periods by carrying out the ritual i will now describe to you ou will find this to be very simple its g oal is simply to perpetuate special aspect of the rosicrucian tradition while xpressing to the cosmic the desire to benefit from its inspiration when studyin g the monographs the ritual is as follows before entering your sanctum to study your monograp hs wash your hands as token of physical purification and dry them w ell then drink glass of cold water to symbolize your desire to be as pure as pos sible on the mental plane then enter your sanctum sit down and meditate f ew moments on the work you are about to undertake if you wish you m ay burn small amount of incense after meditating briefly stand up and make the ros icrucian sign while facing the east of your sanctum use the proc edure described in the booklet entitled neophyte guiderosicrucian initiation 4rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 1 then light the two candles on your sanctum altar b eginning with the one on the left immediately afterwards say the followi ng invocation either mentally or softly may this period of study and meditation place i n harmony with the cosmic and with all my fratres and sorores on the ntire surface of earth may it also make receptive to the lessons and inspir ations of the present hour so mote it be after reciting this invocation begin to study your monograph remembering to use your study notebook to write down all observ ations inspired by your period of study when you have finished your study meditate few m oments in your sanctum then stand up and extinguish the two candl beginning with the one on the left afterwards make the rosicrucian si gn while facing the east of your sanctum and mentally say the following invocat ion may the cosmic sanctify this period of study and m editation may peace reign over the entire surface of earth and within ach being so mote it be ou may now leave your sanctum and resume your norm activities if you should have the opportunity to seclude yours elf when studying your monographs and if you can benefit from the desired tranquility i would advise you to follow these instructions for all your sanct um periods with practice you will realize that this ritual makes it possible to create an inner harmonization with the rosicrucian égrégore and the masters who w atch over our order that is why beyond its simplicity it is very effective to approach your rosicrucian work under proper spiritual conditions this effect iveness of course also depends on the sincerity with which you will approa ch your period of study with all my heart and soul i wish that the study of the teachings of this first atrium may fulfill your fondest mystical expe ctations and that you may see beyond the great portal you have just passed t hrough the radiant beauty of the rose on the cross with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally christian bernard imperator5rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 1 dear fratres and sorores ou are now in your sanctum ready to devote yourse lf to new period of study and meditation as you read these few line s keep in mind that other fratres and sorores are doing likewise because eing how many rosicrucians are scattered all over the world not day goes by without many of them studying their monographs whatever their country f residence their religion or their race external conditions have influenc on their sincerity or on the interest they take in our teachings because all of them are motivated by the same desireto always have better understanding f the deep meaning of existence thus always remember that you are never alone in the pursuit of your spiritual quest and that rosicrucian mysticism constitutes fraternal bond which independent of time and space unites all mbers of amorc in the same égrégore before beginning the study of the first subject in this atrium we would like to draw your attention to an important matter d oubt you have asked yourself whether you are obliged to wait week between stud periods although we have desire to restrain your enthusiasm we woul d advise you to respect this delay we understand fully that you may be imp atient to find out about our teachings and you must remember that these lessons convey something other than mere intellectual knowledge as we previously explained they also serve as basis for spiritual alchemy slowly taking plac on all levels of your being ou will gradually realize that mental and psychi c evolution is being subtly achieved within you between each of your weekly san ctum periods this is why we recommend that you study more than one mo nograph per week unless you are behind in your work following these few preliminary remarks let us app roach todays study in the postulant section we showed you that huma n being is quite different from mass of matter kept alive by physicochemical processes moreover we explained to you that each person possesses certain phases of consciousness which completely transcend his or her purely object ive faculties as you progress in the monographs we will offer you cer tain number of experiments that will prove to you that our explanations concer ning this subject are well founded nonetheless we must not minimize the importance of the material world in our existence because it is the foundation from which the immaterial may evolve this is why rosicr ucians have 6rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 1 always paid attention to the study of matter as it expresses itself on the physical plane as it is impossible to understand the laws g overning the metaphysical world without mastering the basic principles govern ing the physical world that is why the greatest mystics of the past were lso eminent scholars because they knew that the quest for the invisible begins w ith observation of the visible we will therefore begin the study of this first atr ium with general survey of laws inherent to matter spirit for centuries rosicrucians have felt that all form s of matter living or nonliving owe their existence to universal ergy which we designate as spirit scientists are still poorly acquainted with the n ature of this energy because instead of directing their research to wha t spirit is in essence they analyze its various manifestations scientists dist inguish four great forces active in nature cohesion adhesion attraction and repu lsion yet from mystical point of view these four forces are only the diffe rent manifestations of single energy which in this case is spirit in this res pect the mistake of presentday scientists arises from the fact that they too often mistake effects for causes because they do not understand that the apparent mu ltiplicity of material things has its origin in an intangible invisible and inf inite cosmic unity they tend to attribute causal nature to physical phenomena arising from an unique metaphysical energy for physicists cohesion is the force which unites particles of same material substance to one another simple example of this force is provided to us by the billions of drops of water which when united form pond pool lake and even an ocean in our physical body it is cohesion which allows all our cells to maintain themselves in groups to form our organs muscles and generally speaking all the tissues of our body adhesion on the other hand corresponds to the for ce which unites two different bodies by means of an intermediate substa nce for example when we glue two pieces of wood together it is the adhe sive power of the glue that keeps them assembled attraction as you know designates the force attra cting material bodies to one another the most obvious manifestation being t he attraction produced between the opposed polarities of two magn ets as for repulsion it naturally involves the force c ausing two material bodies to repel each other once again th use of two 7rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 1 magnets constitutes good example of the power of repulsion which poles of the same nature can bring about between them ho wever beyond these few definitions that we encourage you to explore furthe r by consulting dictionary or an encyclopedia rosicrucians feel that these fo ur seemingly distinct forces act within matter solely under the impulse of spiri t ou are familiar with the word spirit because it is very often used by religions however as employed by our order it is not connected in any way with religious principle we do not give to this word the theological meaning ascribed to it by priests or spiritualists to be ven more precise we do not use it to designate the holy ghost soul or the spirit ual principle animating every human being from rosicrucian point of view spir it is the universal energy which gives to matter the tangible expression we kn ow it to have thus from the smallest grain of sand to the larges t planet everything constituting the material universe is imbued with s pirit the human body itself owes its existence to energy because it is this ergy in the form of cohesion adhesion attraction and repulsion which gives the body its organic structure as long as we are alive there exists perfect equ ilibrium between the forces of cohesion adhesion attraction and repulsion at wo rk in our body however at the time of death the forces of repulsion increase in intensity and finally cause the decomposition of material substances composing the body that is why the body disintegrates and slowly loses the organized f orm it once had we have just stated that rosicrucians make very c lear distinction between soul and spirit in future degrees we will make complete study of the spiritual dimension of humans however at this point we can say that the soul is cosmic energy independent of the material world which possesses functions and attributes not found in nonliving mat ter however soul is closely associated with another energy the vital l ife force which serves as support as long as the soul is incarnate in the body since spirit is the basis of the material world which by definition is limi ted and transitory we assign to it polarity of negative predominance by contr ast we attribute to soul predominantly positive polarity because it is of spiritual naturein other words unlimited and eternal that being said you must not consider that one of these two polarities is bad and the other one is good or tha t one is quite simply more important than the other they merely d esignate two 8rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 1 different poles in the expression of terrestrial li fe in other words they relate to two different and yet complementary energies whi ch when they are united express the duality we find among all living beings in human beings it is the fusion of these two energies at the time of bir th which makes possible the incarnation of the soul in the body soon we will s ee why and how this is so the composition of matter since spirit is the energy that is the basis for all forms of matter this means that ever ything existing on this earthly planewhether sand stone wood glass or any othe r material substance owes its existence to single universal essence i t follows that the difference we perceive between things lies only in their expressi onthat is in their external aspectsbecause they are infused by the same energy what makes one object differ from another is the way in which the element s composing them are combined and it is this variation of combinations which is responsible for the multitude of manifestations we can see hear touch smell and taste through our sensory faculties it should be noted that these elements have nothing to do with the meaning that is generally attributed to the word element in other words we are not referring here to earth air water and fire beca use these four principals are themselves only major effects of spirit when we us the word element in connection with the composition of matter it is us ed to define the particles composing all material substancesin this instance atoms we shall see precisely what those particles consist of in the fi rst temple degree since spirit is universal energy it therefore fo llows that it is constantly permeating space this means that energy is always ready in one form or another to serve matter it cannot be destroyed b ecause any energy whatever its type is indestructible naturally it is possi ble to act on spirit and modify the way that it manifests it is possible for exam ple to break vase however even in this case the energy composing it is not d estroyed by breaking the vase we simply modify the combination of elements which under the action of forces of cohesion adhesion attraction and re pulsion were giving it its external aspect the same principle applies to all material substanc constituting our body and our earthly surroundings because although we cannot deny that they can be modified i n appearance or made to disappear it is impossible to destroy t he essence 9rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 1 that infuses them from mystical point of view t his implies that the atoms composing matter are immortal indeed all of them are particles of spirit we shall continue the study of spirit in our next m onograph for now the explanations we have just provided concerning this subject will be sufficient before closing this sanctum period by following the ritual instructions you were given for that purpose we recommend that you read this lesson once more because it involves some extremely important principles with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class master note the symbol appearing in the lower corner of each pa ge of this monograph indicates that you have now passed through the port leading into the first atrium of the neophyte section in general way it design ates this atrium in fact it is itself composed of three symbols which are the following triangle square and dot these are very ancient geometric figures which were used for centuries by mystics philosophers and sages to symbolize certain natura l and universal lawslaws you will study in our teachings the triangle as you w ill soon learn designates perfection the square symbolizes stability and the dot repres ents the beginning or birth the small sign found at the apex of the tria ngle is the letter yod the tenth character of the hebrew alphabet for the hebrews it also symbolized the number 10 its equivalent in english is the letter ypractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 10we have explained in this monograph that rosicrucia ns make fundamental distinction between spirit and soul to help you better understand this difference we will compare human being to n electric clock clock as an object is the work of builderin other wor ds of human intelligence as humans we owe our existence to the creator who may be considered the divine intelligence that conceived everything that exists in the universe any electric clock owes its form and outer appearan ce to the particles of matter composing it yet matter how solid and be autiful the clock may be it cannot fulfill its functionthat is give the time unless it receives electricity this means that if for one reason or another an lectric current longer reaches the clock it ceases to function and become s an object of particular interest the same principle may be applied to humans our ph ysical body is combination of material elements which through the action of spirit forms cohesive and perfectly organized whole however it is the soul that provides the energy necessary for its metabolism when soul leaves us at the time of death this energy disappears at the same time and our physical body becomes mass of inert matter devoid of any vitality or wareness we then stop being living conscious individual the preceding analogy will help you to understand t hat the words spirit and soul as we use them in the teachings of our order are not synonymous the first designates the energy which is the basis of the material world whereas the second applies to the spiritual energy animating ea ch human being these two words are therefore associated with two different et complementary energies we will have the opportunity to return to this very important matter11summary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period for centuries rosicrucians have stated that all f orms of matter living or nonliving owe their existence to universal energ which we designate as spirit scientists distinguish four great forces active in matter cohesion adhesion attraction and repulsion from mystical point of view these four forces are only different manifestations of single energ ynamely spirit the word spirit as it is used in the rosicrucian tradition is t connected in any way with religious principle more precise ly we do not use it to designate the holy ghost soul or the spiritual pr inciple animating every human being rosicrucians make clear distinction between soul and spirit the soul is indeed cosmic energy independent of matter where as spirit is the energy permeating all material things the difference we perceive between material things lies solely in their expres sionthat is in their exterior aspectbecause the elements composing themin this instance atomsare infused with the s ame energy spirit is an indestructible energy this means tha t energy is always ready in one form or another to serve matter concurrence continued which does not see in the laws and phenomena of ou tward nature the means of awakening mind is lamentably shortsighted and that state of society which leaves the mass of men to be crushed and fami shed in soul by excessive toils on matter is at war with gods designs and t urns into means of bondage what was meant to free and expand the soul william ellery channing 17801842first atrium 2 concurrence 12in concurrence with todays study we propose that you read the following quotation taken from the work passage matière à vie the passage of matter to life by emmy guittes without going s far as to state that the author gives the word spirit the same meaning that we attribute to this word in the rosicrucian teachings you will see that we can make numerous parallels between what he says concerning the subject of spi rit units and what we explain in this monograph regarding spirit for the buddha the formation of inanimate substanc their motion and the mysterious passage of matter to the first manif estations of life is brought about by the attractive energy of innumerable invis ible entities which he named spirit units they are potentials of energy in motion their ability to condense particles which eventually form material s ubstances then to group the infinitely small parts of the first unicellular being originates in their speed of rotation these are the spirit units which by their force of attraction unconsciously built the first organisms which would reproduce by following the current of evolution all the way up to humanity the spirit units had at first only rudimentary co nsciousness the kind unicellular being can have however while organi sms live reproduce and die it is the same spirit unitsfor they do t die being energy and not matterwhich after death build other more perfec ted bodies they develop their consciousness and their faculties of percepti on through their numerous lives as they evolve their energy grows and group s together an increasing number of molecules to form the diverse parts of th eir physical structure which is improved in proportion to their strength since these spirit units are energy they are invisible and are everywhere and in everyt hing they collaborate in the birth and the development of all phenomena and all manifestations of life emmy guittes 20th century13rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 2 dear fratres and sorores in the preceding monograph we began the study of very important subject and we suggested that you consult diction ary or encyclopedia so as to investigate the meaning of the words cohesion adhesion attraction and repulsion as was explained to you these words relate to th four forces manifested in matter by spirit we presume that you did so because we advised you to do this and because we believe that you are interested in this subject thus when you read about these forces in various s cientific magazines you will have better understanding of the laws and pr inciples involved the vibrations of spirit having seen that spirit is the energy which is the basis of the material world we will n ow concern ourselves with the nature of this energy we will now consider the way in which spirit acts in our environment and the form in which it appears to us from earliest antiquity rosicrucians have maintained that spirit is propagated throughout the universe in the form of vibrations whose movem ent is similar to those of ripples resulting from stone being thrown into wa ter in this case the rhythm and height of the ripples vary according to the stones weight and size as well as the force with which it is thrown if the stone is heavy and large and if its impact upon the wate r is violent the ripples will be in the form of concentric circles that are relat ively high of great amplitude and close to one another of high vibratory frequen cy if the stone is small and light and if it is thrown gently into the water t he ripples will be small of low amplitude and far apart from one another less fre quent in the same way the vibrations of spirit are propa gated more or less rapidly in space and with more or less force this means th at vibratory waves of varying amplitudes and of weak or strong frequencie s continuously permeate the universe and keep it in motion from scientific point of view the vibratory freq uency of wave is determined by its number of vibrations per second thus certain waves are propagated in space at speed of few vibrati ons per second whereas others move at the rate of several thousand vibrati ons per second the expression of every material thing depends on t he rhythm by which spirit makes the elements composing it vib rate thus the difference between two forms of matter is only question of vibratory frequency depending solely on the number of vibrations 14rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 2 which propagate themselves through the particular f orm per second thus if it were possible to act on the vibrations of everythin g surrounding us and to make them vibrate at the same frequency we could lon ger differentiate between sand stone wood glass water air etc for example when you look at tree stump it seem s to you to be completely different from rock however this is only because the vibrations composing these two things are not of the same freq uency even though the energy infusing them is exactly the same in essence in this case spirit if you were able to act on their respective vibratory frequencies you could transform tree stump into rock or vice versa such possibility may seem unbelievable to you and yet strictly speaking it rests on fundamental truth we are convinced that science will one day p rove this cosmic law as rosicrucian you must have good understanding of this principle because it constitutes one of the keys to the composition of m atter in keeping with the preceding explanations the vib rations of spirit do not move at the same speed whether in space or in matt er itself this principle is particularly evident when you compare the vibration s of light to those of sound to understand this you need only consider what hap pens when you watch carpenter hit nail with hammer if you are abou t one hundred meters away from the carpenter you hear the blow sometime afte r having seen the hammer touch the wall if you are near the carpenter you will perceive the sound at the same time the farther away the carpenter is from ou the more time elapses between the sight of the blow and the resulting sou nd this is due to the fact that light vibrations are propagated more rapidly than t hose of sound to be more precise let us remember that sound vibrations move in air at approximately 3315 meters 1100 feet per second whereas light vibrations move at speed of about 300000 kilometers 186300 miles per sec ond thus returning to our example the fact that we ar one hundred meters from the carpenter is enough to create discrepanc between the perception of the hammer blow and that of the resulting sound fu rthermore the fact that we are close does not allow the light vibrations to re ach our sight before the sound vibrations reach our ears that is why we perceive the act and the sound simultaneously since we have just alluded to sound vibrations it will be interesting to consider the special example of musi c like 15rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 2 everything we interpret in terms of noise or sound music is nothing more than body of vibrations yet one can deny the great influence it exercises on our physical body as well as on our mind music profoundly affects us because our being is especially sensitive to the vi bratory effects it produces on our consciousness in this respect the impact t hat music can have on us is not limited to the sensory perception of the vib rations producing it music also exerts an influence on our soul which explain s why we feel particularly content when we listen to an inspiring musical work this is very important because it implies that beyond the purely cerebral interpretation of vibratory phenomenon we possess form of consciousness that is capable of perceiving what none of our physical senses can apprehend it also allows us to suppose that we can be sensitive to vibrations even more btle than those corresponding to music we will show you later that we can actual ly attune ourselves with vibratory frequencies extending far beyond the mani festations of the material world the vibrations of matter since all material substances are imbued with spirit and this energy is of vibrator nature it follows that all forms of matter vibrate to be more precise we say that they vibrate both inwardly and outwardly which presentday science r ecognizes the role of the inward vibrations is to maintain constant equilib rium between the forces of cohesion adhesion attraction and repulsion whic h combine to give objects the material structure we know them to have withou t these vibrations and without this equilibrium material things could not have the solid and tangible aspect they present to our objective senses as for the outward vibrations emanating from all objects they are responsible fo r our perception of the material world the outward vibrations are the ones that reach our sensory organs thus enabling us to see hear touch taste and smell everything that is part of our material surroundings to better understand these preceding remarks let u s take the example of rose according to what we have just explained rose is composed of different vibrations which have their source in spi rit some of these vibrations maintain the roses inward form and structure thus allowing the flower to form an organized whole others reach our eyes and allow us to discern its shape and color still others spread to our and produce an olfactory reaction which we can express in terms f perfume when we touch the rose the vibrations emanating fr om its 16rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 2 substance give us the sensation of velvet thus ev erything we can know about rose and in general about all material things comes from the vibrations emanating from them it may seem difficult to admit that all objects sur rounding us vibrate inwardly and outwardly yet it is so of course i t is impossible to see the vibrations being propagated through them or those that are being constantly emitted however this does not mean that such vibr ations are nonexistent by way of analogy you cannot observe the heat emanati ng from lit candle but all you need to do is bring your hand close to its flame and you will feel that heat likewise you cannot see the vibrations produ ced by the notes played on musical instrument yet we know perfectly well that they affect us if such were not the case we could not hear those notes everyt hing that we perceive in the material world whether this involves light colors sounds odors etc or the sensations of hot and cold hard and soft wet and dry etc is due to the fact that the world is constantly emitting vibrations which have their origin in spirit scientists know the vibratory frequency of chemical elements they have succeeded in isolating as well as that of sound lectromagnetic and light waves however this knowledge is limited mostly to material manifestations to phenomena observable and measurable by means of scientific instruments we shall teach you in future degrees that the spiri tual world is also governed by the law of vibrations and that it is possible to perceive its vibratory octaves by means of the faculties of the soul in the next monograph we will continue our study of spirit and see how its vibrations reach our objective senses before be ing interpreted by our consciousness ou will thus understand that matter exists for us only because of the interpretation we give to its vibratory natu re meanwhile meditate on the explanation we have just brought to your attent ion inevitably you will come to the conclusion that each human is body of vibrations immersed in vibratory ocean having its origin in the cosmic with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 17in connection with the study of spirit and the way in which this energy manifests in matter we think that you will be inte rested in reading the following text it is an excerpt from lecture that michael faraday 17911867 rosicrucian gave on the subject of attraction and repulsion explaining the laws and principles which are the source of those two op posing forces faradays explanation of these principles has the advantage f being simple and easy to understand as practical application of this mono graph we propose that you reflect on the experiments described below and here is bar of iron why it is only because the different parts of this iron are so wrought as to keep close together by th attraction between the particles that it is held together in one mass it is kept together in fact merely by the attraction of one particle to another and t hat is the point i want now to illustrate if i take piece of flint and strike it with mmer and break it thus breaking off piece of the flint i have done not hing more than separate the particles which compose these two pieces so far apa rt that their attraction is too weak to cause them to hold together and it is only for that reason that there are now two pieces in the place of one i wil l show you an experiment to prove that this attraction does still exist in t hose particles for here is piece of glass for what was true of the flint and the bar of iron is true of the piece of glass and is true of every other solidth ey are all held together in the lump by the attraction between their parts i can show you the attraction between its separate particles for if i take these portions of glass which i have reduced to very fine powder you see that i can act ually build them up into solid wall by pressure between two flat surfaces t he power which i thus have of building up this wall is due to the attraction f the particles forming as it were the cement which holds them together and so in this case where i have taken very great pains to bring the particles to gether you see perhaps couple of ounces of finely pounded glass standing s an upright wall is not this attraction most wonderful that bar of iron one inch square has such power of attraction in its particlesgiving to it such strengththat it will h old up twenty tons weight before the little set of particles in the small spa ce equal to one division across which it can be pulled apart will separate18summary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it

sensory perceptions and often make the mistake of believing that these perceptions are the exact reflection of material reality as we will explain in this monograph humans do not perceive what things are in themselves rath er they perceive only the mental image they produce in our consciousness dav id hume prominent philosopher and scientist of the 18th century wrot at length on this subject and accordingly we offer here passage from his wo rk it seems evident that men are carried by natura l instinct or prepossession to repose faith in their senses and that without any reasoning or even almost before the use of reason we always suppose an external universe which depends not on our perception but would exist though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated even the animal creation are governed by like opinion and preserve this b elief of external objects in all their thoughts designs and actions it seems also evident that when men follow this b lind and powerful instinct of nature they always suppose the very images pre sented by the senses to be the external objects and never entertain any spicion that the one are nothing but representations of the other this very table which we see white and which we feel hard is believed to exist indep endent of our perception and to be something external to our mind which per ceives it our presence bestows not being on it our absence does not annih ilate it it preserves its existence uniform and entire independent of the si tuation of intelligent beings who perceive or contemplate it da vid hume 1711177621rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 3 dear fratres and sorores today we shall continue our study of spirit vibrati ons and we shall examine how we interpret them in the last monograp h we learned that these vibrations are responsible for all the sensations w receive from the material world however we must go further and consider the processes by which our objective consciousness expresses them in terms of colors sounds odors etc in doing so we shall examine in particular the mec hanism of sight because what we say regarding this subject may likewise be applied to our senses of hearing touch taste and smell the perception of vibrations while watching movie you may have asked yourself about the nature of what co mes out of the projector travels through the air and creates images on the screen physicists state that it is simply beam of light they are correct however we may state more precisely that this beam is nothing other than vibrations which when focused by mechanical device reproduce the filme d images on screen in the same way the vision we have of objects is due to the projection toward us of light vibrations they receive from the sun or from any other source of natural or artificial light these light vibrations then traverse the cornea and by the action of the crystalline lens converge on the retina where they form an inverted image of those objects we can say therefore that the retina of the eye is like the screen of movie theater with the exception that it has curved an d not flat surface moreover the retinas surface is not smooth membrane but rough one composed of thousands of cones and small rods oriented towards the crystalline lens once the retinal image is formed it is transmitted imme diately via the optic nerve to that portion of the brain which specializes in the interpretation of visual impres sions within fraction of second this image is inverted and then interpreted by our subjective faculties thus becoming for us conscious reality before proceeding we must emphasize that human sig ht when compared to the vision of numerous other animals has very special characteristic because the two images formed on the retina of our eyes are not interpreted independently or separately by the brain before be ing submitted to analysis the images are merged into single ntal image by very complex physiological process and it is to th at unique mental image that our cerebral interpretation reacts this fusion is very 22rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 3 important because it enables us to perceive the th ree dimensions of space and the contour of our surroundings with so much precis ion moreover it is due to this that our vision of things is so sharp many an imals do not have this faculty because their brain interprets two different retina l imagesone for each eye most of the time each of these two images is flat and thus we can surmise that those animals cannot perceive perspective or c orrectly estimate distances separating things that is why they often call upon sense other than sight when moving about or observing their natural surrou ndings because they see two images at the same time their vision is blurre dor at least this is what experiments involving insects seem to indicate the preceding explanations are simplified as we ve deliberately avoided the terms used in physiology our primary goal is t give you clear idea of the principles involved if you have the opportunit we advise you to deepen your study of the optical functioning of the eye h owever you will find that science generally remains silent on the philosophic dimension of sight this dimension is very important for mystics that is wh we shall focus upon and demonstrate the laws and principles involved ou w ill thus find that sight and in general the entirety of our objective perceptio n are far from being limited to the sensory mechanisms that are the object of scien tific research from physiological point of view sight is proc ess whose goal is to transform retinal image into mental concept we have seen previously that the retinal image is of vibratory nature accordi ngly the interpretation of material things we see is not based upon those thin gs themselves it is based on the vibrations emanating from them thus it is impossible to know exactly what the world surrounding us is because we interp ret what it seems to be rather than what it truly is when you are looking at some object the idea you have of it is based on what your brain has given u however nothing proves that this object is truly what you perceive ou ca n of course call upon your sense of touch to confirm your visual impression et how can you be sure that you are not deceived by your tactile perceptio n or if something interferes with the vibrations emanating from this object the mental image you have of it undergoes modification whereas in itself the obj ect remains what it was for example if you put on eyeglasses with bluetin ted lenses the object may seem bluish to you even though it i s not truly this color when putting on these glasses the vibr ations reaching 23rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 3 your eyes were submitted to an alteration which is translated by retinal image to which your brain attributes blue predomi nance this very simple example demonstrates that when the vibrations of an object we are looking at are affected before reaching our eyes the mental i mage we have of it is itself modified however this object is not changed in it s own reality this proves that what we see depends on the way we perceive the vibrations of spirit and not on what that energy is independent of us the same principle applies to what we hear smell taste and touch because sounds odors flavors and forms likewise correspond to vibrations which after having reached our ears nose tongue and skin are transmitted to precise area of the brain which depending on the situation is specialized in the interpretation of sound smell taste or touch impressions if for whatever reason some interference occurs between the vibrat ory source of these impressions and the area of the brain involved in t heir interpretation then the realization we have of these vibrations is distorte d for example you know quite well that if we plug our ears even slightly the voices reaching us are not of the same tonality yet the voices in themselves remain what they were in another example the sensation that is experienced in contact with objects is very much modified when we wear gloves however on ce again it is not the things we touch that change but the interpretation given to us by our objective consciousness thus as is true of what we see wha t we hear smell taste and touch is body of vibratory stimuli emanating from source whose precise nature we cannot know because the totality of our sensory perceptions rests solely on the way in which we interpret the effects produced by the vibrations of spirit on our five objective senses and on our b rain the interpretation of vibrations the way in which we interpret material things also depends on our cultu re education belief and life experience thus when you see chair you ca nnot have any doubt that it is chair and that it is used for sitting howe ver from philosophical and psychological point of view the matter is not so s imple if you had been taught from earliest infancy that the object on which you sit is not called chair but table you would sit down on chair thinking tha t it is called table moreover the fact that what you call tab is actually chair does not change the chair into table or vic versa to take another example if you had been told as child th at cats bark and 24rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 3 dogs meow you would call barking what for others would be meowing and yet your misnomer would change in way the sounds produced by those animals the dog would continue to bark and the cat would meow this means that the way in which we interpret the things that we perceive does not affect in any way what they are in their own reality because the understanding we have of them does not change at all what they are on the vibratory level the understanding that we have of our material envi ronment is associated with the interpretation given to us by our objectiv consciousness however this interpretation does not affect the real nature of things we perceive let us consider the way in which blind people apprehend th eir surroundings when blind people look in the direction of tree they do not see it yet they would be wrong to think that this tree does not exist be cause other persons are able to see it they are simply incapable of interpretin g the vibrations emanating from this tree for two major reasonseither due to physiological deficiencies image is formed on the retina of their eyes or the image is indeed formed on the retina but cannot be transformed into ment image notably because the optic nerve has been affected or because the ce rebral region in charge of the interpretation of visual impressions has been d amaged the same is true of people who are deaf in that case they are unab to interpret in terms of sounds or noises the sound vibrations reaching thei r ears yet it does not mean that such vibrations do not exist daily life does prove that we are constantly subjected to various sounds and noises these two xamples show that it is possible due to functional anomaly not to see t hings or not to hear sounds that do exist it is important to understand that material things exist for us only because of our ability to perceive and interpret the vibrat ions constantly emanating from them and which as you now know have their so urce in spirit if for any reason whatsoever we lack this ability we bec ome incapable of having precise idea of our material environment that is why when we are sound asleep we lose consciousness of the world surround ing us indeed our five objective senses are then inactive and do not trans mit any vibratory stimuli to our brain thereby resulting in nearly total abse nce of sensory impressions however sleeping and being unconscio us of our immediate environment does not imply that it nger exists it simply means that we longer perceive it objectiv ely and thus we longer interpret its vibratory reality25rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 3 for example whether you are awake or sound asleep does not change the appearance of your room nor the vibrations tha t compose it this point is very important because it shows that our interp retation of terrestrial things depends on the way in which we perceive them and c onversely that the way we perceive them does not affect what they are inde pendent of us seen in this light the material world is both reality and an illusion for although it appears in concrete and tangible way to our objective sciousness we cannot know by means of our sensory faculties what it truly is in essence we emphasize the statement by means of our sensory faculties only because we will show you in future degree that it is possible to perce ive spirit and to act upon its vibrations by means of psychic faculties which bec ause of their nature are often called extrasensory in the next monograph we will complete what we want you to learn about spirit within the framework of this first atrium nd we will draw from it certain laws on this subject that you must absolute ly remember as we have instructed write in your study notebook those ques tions raised when studying our teachings do not hesitate to jot down the comm ents that are inspired in you or the impressions that come to you in this wa you will better assimilate the laws and principles involved moreover when u read your notes again in few years time you will find that your understa nding of the points discussed has evolved considerably with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterthere are some very simple experiments you can perf orm at home to demonstrate to yourself the existence of spirit vib rations as we explained these vibrations are propagated in spacein the app arent vacuum separating objectsand within the objects themselves as dem onstration take ruler made of wood steel or plastic and place the end of this ruler next to one of your ears then using finger scratch the other end of the ruler ou will then perceive sound which proves that the vibrations produced by scratching the ruler propagate themselves through it ou can do t he same experiment with tree place one ear against the tree and strike it with your hand on the opposite side ou will once again hear sound solid substances are not the only things that propa gate sound vibrations the next time you take bath immerse your head under water and strike the edge of the bathtub with your hand ou will hear perf ectly audible sound which in many cases will even seem to be amplified this simple experiment can be performed with the same success in swimming pool or at the sea dive all the way to the bottom of the water and hit the ground w ith your fist stir pebbles or just simply listen ou will perceive multitude f sound sensations for another experiment confirming that vibrations re propagated in space we suggest that you obtain two metal rods th at are approximately two millimeters oneeighth inch in diameter and thirt centimeters one foot in length hang them from string and place them bout twenty centimeters eight inches apart then strike one of them forci bly with hammer or some other metal object at the moment that the resultin g sound is at its peak gently place your hand on the other rod ou will feel tha t it vibrates and that it is affected by the vibrations emitted by the rod you h ave struck in the coming days carry out these experiments or even others that you create so as to prove to yourself that everything you perceive is only the result of surrounding vibrations remember that if we were incapable of perceiving and interpreting vibrationseither physically or ps ychicallywe could have knowledge of what surrounds uspractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 2627summary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period the vision we have of objects is due to the project ion toward us of the light vibrations that they receive from the sun or from some other source of natural or artificial light human sight when compared to the vision of numerou s other animals has very special characteristic because the two images formed on the retina of our eyes are not interpreted independentl of one another by the brain before being submitted to analysis the two images are merged into single mental image by highly complex physiolog ical process the interpretation of the material things we see is not based upon those things themselves it is based on the vibrations em anating from them accordingly it is impossible to know the exact cha racter of the world surrounding us because we interpret what our surro unding environment seems to be rather than what it truly is corresponding to what we see what we hear smell taste and touch is body of vibratory stimuli emanating from sou rce whose precise nature we cannot know because the totality of our sensory perceptions rests solely on the way in which we interpret the ffects produced by the vibrations of spirit on our five objective senses nd on our brain the way in which we interpret material things depen ds on our culture education beliefs and life experience the material world only exists for us because
