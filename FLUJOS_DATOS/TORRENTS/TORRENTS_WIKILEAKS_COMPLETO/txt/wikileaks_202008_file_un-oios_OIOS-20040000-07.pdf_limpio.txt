the individual stated that this person had expressed the possibility to h elp himher obtain the visa by means of producing false supporting documents the individual was asked to pay 600 for this assistance 3 10 according to the individual the attempt to obtain the visa was unsuccessful therefore the copies of the false documents were r eturned to the unknown person without any money being

police officer and explained his her version of the facts the individual added that staff member 1 had also been present at that meeting 12 the itf learned that after this meeting the in dividual was

happened b staff member 1 13 staff member 1 asked to meet with the itf in oc tober 2004 in order to provide information regarding this case heshe denied the allegations raised in the local press and stated that heshe had not signed any doc uments related to the matter and denied hisher involvement in any part of the fraud staff member 1 related similar story to that of the individual 14 review of the signatures on the photocopies f the false documents by the itf suggested that the signature purportedly that of staff member 1 was in fact different to hisher normal signature without fore nsic review this evaluation by itf is simply based on visual check of the signat ures 15 staff member 1 during hisher interview advis ed the itf that the false employment certificate used by the individual was according to the reference numbers originally issued on behalf of staff membe r 2 staff member 1 stated that heshe and the airport police officer had intervi ewed staff member 2 on the issue but had only obtained vague answers and different versions of th facts c staff member 2 17 during the interview of staff member 2 by staf f member 1 and the airport police officer staff member 2 admitted to have app lied for the visa at the member states office in pristina the visa was denied bu t the documents issued by the airport that heshe had used for the application we re displaced and subsequently allegedly lost 18 after being requested to search for the docume nts staff member 2 subsequently gave staff member 1 and the airport po lice officer the certificate of employment heshe used for the application but aft er summary examination both staff member 1 and the airport police officer noticed that the documentation was not the original one 4 19 when questioned on this issue staff member 2 was confused and contradictory in hisher report of the facts and th is general attitude raised suspicion that some sort of pressure or threat had been direc ted to himher d security officer 20 according to the confidential report that trigg ered the case the security officer was allegedly the person responsible for providing the false documentation to the various fraudsters heshe was supposed to be f acto the internal agent of the structure 21 the itf contacted the security officer prior to the matter becoming public and heshe denied any involvement or responsibility for the scam 22 the itf could find evidence that the securi ty officer had exclusive access to the relevant documents and offices in fact dur ing previous visit whose results were sent to kta the security conditions of the of fices issuing ids and certificates were found to be inadequate granting access to authorized personnel as well therefore it is possible that an unauthorized perso n gained access to the id pass office without the security officers consent or aw areness original source 23 due to the lack of other information the itf commenced inquiries on the sole source of information namely the local businessman who supplied the allegation photocopy of the supporting documents delivered b the local businessman who had received them from an airport xray operator s ustained the allegations against the security officer and staff member 1 24 the photocopied documents pertained to an app lication for visa through the member states office of pristina apparently issue d by the individual the origin of this photocopy was not ascertained due to the fa ct that the airport xray operator denied to have ever delivered any internal document to anyone the itf concluded that heshe was not willing to mention th person or the circumstances that had provided himher with the document in orde r to protect hisher position 25 bearing in mind that the abovementioned docum ents were only photocopies the itf sought to locate the originals that would llow the investigators to examine them and to develop evidence of the crime unfortun ately it was not possible to find the original documents and it is assessed most likely that said documents would have been destroyed after the unsuccessful at tempts to obtain the visas f member states office observations 26 the itf undertook monitoring exercise on l persons to visit the member states liaison office in pristina in order to iden tify the individual who offered the false documentation outside the office due to the scant information in the 5 possession of the itf this activity was deemed mor likely to provide leads but unfortunately the case became public and ended any chance of success by monitoring the member states liaison office g local press reporting of the case 27 in early october 2004 the local press publish ed significant details of the allegations against the individual and copies of th documents sent to the member states liaison office in pristina copies of all t hese documents were already in possession of the itf the public disclosure of the visa fraud caused great harm to the conduct of the investigation additional option s to uncover evidence of the offence disappeared with the public disclosure of t he case the itf was not able to identify the source of the leak of the documentatio n to the press vi conclusions 28 evidence of complicity by airport personnel in the attempted visa fraud has been found itf had access only to photocopies of t he false documents therefore clear source of those documents could be establi shed due to general sense of fear witnesses and subjects were extremely unforth coming 29 itf found that staff member 2s certificate of employment was left behind and used for the forging of the certificate itf theref ore concludes that staff member 2 at the least did not apply sufficient attention regarding the use of hisher employment certificate heshe may even deliberatel have left hisher certificate of employment with person not entitled to be in p ossession of it 30 itf found that the id pass office under super vision of the security officer was in disarray when visited by investigators itf concludes that it was therefore easily possible for anyone even outsiders to ge t access to an airport id pass 31 itf was able to establish the attempted visa fr aud by staff member 1 the individual however is not an airport employee the offence committed by himher does not fall within the jurisdiction of th itf as the subject matter does not relate to the airport as publicly owned enter prise but rather to an attempted visa fraud against foreign country the member st ates the individual used false documents in kosovo for official purposes in contravention of article 332 of the provisional criminal code of kosovo falsifying documents vii recommendations 32 the itf offers the following recommendations recommendation 1 the itf recommends
