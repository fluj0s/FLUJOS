code rs20783 updated september 4 2008 the siting of wireless communications facilities an overview of federal state and local law kathleen ruane legislative attorney american law division summary the siting of wireless communications facilities has been topic of controversy in communities all over the united states telecommunications carriers need to place towers in areas where coverage is insufficient or lacking to provide better service to consumers while local governing boards and community groups often oppose the siting of towers in residential neighborhoods and scenic areas the telecommunications act of 1996 governs federal state and local re gulation of the siting of communications towers by placing certain limitations on local zoning authority without totally preempting state and local law this report provides an overview of the federal state and local laws governing the siting of wireless communications facilities1 federal law governing the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities section 704 of the telecommunications act of 1996 governs federal state and local regulation of the siting of personal wireless service facilities or cellular communication towers2 under the 1996 act state and local governments are prohibited from unreasonably discriminating among providers of functionally equivalent services3 this prohibition has been interpreted to provide state and local governments with the flexibility to treat facilities that create different visual aesthetic or safety concerns differently to the extent pe rmitted under generally applicab zoning requirements evenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20783crs2 4 sprint spectrum lp v w illoth 176 f3d 630 639 2nd cir 1999 5 47 usc 332c7biii 6 town of amherst new hamp shire v

th effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services5 this provision not only applies to outright bans on tower siting but also to situations where state or local governments criteria or their administration effectively preclude towers matter what the carrier does6 in these cases the carrier must show not just that this application has been rejected but that further reasonable efforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is waste of time even to try7 the act also prescribes certain procedures that state or local government must follow when reviewing request to place cons truct or modify personal wireless service facilities the state or local government must act on any request for authorization to place construct or modify pe rsonal wireless service facilitie s within reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed8 if the state or local g overnment denies the request the denial must be in writing and supporte d by substantial evid ence contained in written record9 substantial evidence has been define d as such relevant evidence as reasonable mind might accept as ad equate to support conclusion10 courts have found that aesth etics may constitute valid basis for the denial of wireless permit so long as there is substantial evidence of the adverse visual impact of the proposed tower11 in fact according to one court nothing in the telecommunications act forbids local authorities from applying general and nondiscr iminatory standards derived from their zoning codes and aesth etic harmony is prominent goal underlying almost every such code12 federal courts therefore have routinely upheld the denials of applications to construct wireless towers where the decisions of local entities were in writing and based on evidence that the tower would diminish property values reduce the ability of property owners in the vicinity of the proposed tower to enjoy their property or damage the scenic qualities of the proposed location13

reversal of denial of petition based on aesthetic concerns where the only evidence that the proposed tower would be unsightly was the testimony of few residents that th ey did not like poles in general and those residents admitted that they had objection to flagpoles the proposed disguise for the wireless tower15 blanket opposition to poles could not constitute substantial evidence in the opinion of the court16 many community groups also oppose the s iting of towers based on health and environmental concerns17 however the telecommunicati ons act of 1996 prohibits state and local governments from regulating the placement of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the effects of radio frequency emissions if the facility in question complies with the federal communications commissions regulations concerning such emissions18 as written the purpose of the requirement is to prevent telecommunications siting decisions from bein g based upon unscientific or irrational fears that emissions from the telecommunications s ites may cause undesirable health effects19 courts have enforced this provision of the act and have noted that concerns of health risks due to the emissions may not constitute substantial evidence in support of denial20 the act also provides for the appeal of state or local governments denial of request to place construc t or modify facility21 section 704c of the teleco mmunications act provided that within 180 days of the enactment of the act the president or his designee shall prescribe procedures by which federal departments

from the specific limitations set fort h in the telecommunications act of 1996 federal law does not appear to affect state or local zoning authority with regard to the placement of wireless communications towers27 most states delegate zoning authority to local bodies ho wever some states offer guidance on what factors should be considered by the local entities when considering applications for permits to construct wireless communications facilities for example the state of new hampshire has enacted law concerning the visual effects of tall wireless antennas28 the law does not alter any municipal zoning ordinance or preempt the telecommunications act of 199629 it does however recognize that the visual effects of tall antennas may go well beyond the physical borders between municipalities and in doing so it encourages local governing bodies to address the issue so as to require that all affe cted parties have the opportunity to be heard30 the statute also provides that carriers wishing to build personal wireless service fac ilities should consider commerc ially available alternatives to the tall towers such as lower antenna mounts disguised or camouflaged towers and custom designed facilities to minimize th visual impact on the surrounding area31 an illinois law sets forth guidelines for telecommunications carriers to consider when choosing

offers list of locations from most desirable to least desirable for the siting of telecommunications facilities with nonresidentially zoned lots as the most desirable and residentially zoned lots that are less than 2 acres in size and used for resi dential purposes as the least desirable34 t h guidelines set forth for designing facility include preserving trees in the area or replacing trees removed during cons truction landscaping around th facility and designing facilities that are compatible with the residential character of the area35 in addition to the alternativ listed above states can courage the use of existing infrastructure as opposed to the construction of new facilities in orde r to reduce the total number of towers in an area for example in kentucky state law allows the local planning commission to require the company applying for the construction permit to make reasonable attempt to colocate their equipment on existing towers if space is available and the colocation does not interfere with the structural integrity of the tower or require substantial alterations to the tower36 the statute gives the planning commission the authority to deny an applica tion for construction based on the companys unwillingness to attempt to colocate37 connecticut has also enacted law which allows local entities to require the sharing of towers whenever it is technically legally environmentally and economically feasible and whenever such sharing meets public safety concerns38 local municipal or county law many local governments through the use of their zoning authority attempt to limit the impact cellular towers have on the surroundi ng environment one county in georgia enacted telecommunications tower and antenna ordinance which set up new permit system for the construction of cellular towers in an effort to encourage construction in nonresidential areas39 in commercial or light indus trial areas wireless service provider can build tower without

multiple users42 in direct response to the limitations set fo rth in the telecommunications act of 1996 several communities enacted moratoria on permits for cellular towers in an effort to prevent or delay the construction of cellular communications towers43 under the act local governments cannot act to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting wireless communication services in their communities44 local governments justify the imposition of moratoria by claiming that they need time to study the problems with tower siting and how they should change their zoning ordinances to accomm odate construction45 courts have upheld moratoria that have fixed length such as six months46 however they are less likely to uphold those that are for long periods of time or indefinite47 recent developments the fccs wireless telecommunications bureau is seeking comment on petition for declaratory ruling filed by ctia the wireless association in july of 200848 in its petition ctia expressed cerns about the delays many wireless providers face when applying to local and state zoning authorities to site wireless facilities as result ctia has asked the fcc 1 to clarify the time period in which state or local zoning authority must act on wireless facility siting request 2 to declare that failure by state or local zoning authority to act on siting request within that time shall result in the application being deemed granted or alternatively that the applicant is entitled to courtordered injunction granting the application unless the z oning authority can justify the delay 3 to clarify that section 332c7 bi prohibits zoning decisi ons that have the effect of prohibiting additional entrants from offering service in given area in other words to declare that section 332c7b i is
