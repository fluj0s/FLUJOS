united nations for global population issues in 2006 the organization provided services in some 154 developing nd transition countries with funds totaling 6055 million drawn exclusiv ely from voluntary contributions made by 180 nations and some foundations the united states with strong support from congress was an important actor in the launch of unfpa in 1969 during the midtolate 1960s congress began to express heightened concern over the impact of rapid population growth on development prospects in poor countries in 1967 congress earmarked funds for population assistance programs urging the united states to channel family planning resources through the united nations nd other international organizations in its first 25 years unfpa moved fro m an organization focused on statistical collection and analysis to an agency providing maternal and child healthfamily planning assistance unfpa played rge role in shaping the 1994 international conference on population and developmen t

action that continues to gu ide current family pla nning and reproductive health policies including the work of unfpa the plan integrated population concerns into the broad context of deve lopment concluding that education and health including reproductive health were prerequisites for sustainable development during the past two decades there has been continuing and contentious debate within the united states and especially within congress as to whether the united states should financially support unfpa the issue has centered on the extent to which if any unfpa aids chinas coercive family planning programs and policies in 15 of the past 24 years the united stat has not contributed to the organization as result of executive branch determinations that unfpas program in china was in violation of the kempkasten amendm ent banning us aid to organizations involved in the management of coercive fa mily planning programs on june 26 2008 the administration announced that unfpa was ineligible for fy2008 funding under the kempkasten amendment for fy2009 the bush administration requested that 25 million be ma available for unfpa if it is determined eligible under the kempkasten amendment the ppropriated funds would be drawn from the child survival and health programs account while unfpa receives voluntary contribu tions from many countries and some private foundations most of its income comes from handful of donors the netherlands and japan recently have been the largest contributors throughout the last decade when the united states has contributed to unfpa programs the

has been one of the leading contributors to unfpa for the other 15 years however the united states has not made voluntary contributi ons to the organization as result of executive branch

meeting of 133 nations the genera l assembly called for the expansion of international population assistan ce with unfpa taking lead role to implement the plan of action endorsed at the bucharest c onference partially due to the growing attention on world population issues unf pa operations expanded rapidly during this period the scope of unfpas work so broadened so that by the early 1980s the organization focused on eight primary areas family planning including delivery systems and fertility regulation techniques data collection formulation and evaluation of population policies and

china to deter mine whether the organization was involved in any way with involuntary abortions10 in march 1985 that review found that unfpa did not include involuntary abortion as part of its programs and therefore did not violate legislative restrictions or conditions announced at the mexico city conference on funding organizations engaged in involuntary practices11 as result unfpa remained eligible for us support but did not receive the full earmarked amount of 46 million on march 30 1985 aid contributed 36 million to unfpa withholding 10 million t express united states disapproval of coercion in the implementation of the china population control program12 the 10 million matched roughly the amount unfpa spent annually in china because aid wanted to reprogram the 10 million for other bilateral population assistance programs the administration needed to overcome the specific legislative earmark of 46 million in the fy1985 appropriation acco rdingly the white house requested authority as part of an fy1985 supplemen tal appropriation sub mission to shift 10 million from unfpa to other population aid groups the kempkasten amendment rather than approve

training of the individuals who plan manage and ca rry out such program education and publicity about the programs assistance to th official bodies of government that are charged with developing and impleme nting such program and other such assistance15 congressman kemp also stated that the amendment would most likely affect us funding of the unfpa because of its involvement with the program of

million for voluntary family planning programs for use elsewhere in the world he also stated that if kempinouye was enacted again in fy1986 see footnote 13 unfpa could receive funds under only three conditions 1 unfpa withdraws its program from china 2 china would begin to punish abuses concerning coerci ve abortion and invol untary sterilizations or 3 unfpa radically changes its program in china such as by supplying only contraceptive materials20 almost immediately the population in stitute an ngo filed suit against administrator mcpherson and the us g overnment to block the redirection of unfpa funds and i nvalidate the determination on august 12 1986 the court upheld the administrations decisi on to withhold unfpa funding from 1986 to 1992 usaid continued to request funds for unfpa although with the understanding that decision on whether to transfer the money would be reviewed under the terms of the kempk asten amendment which congress also continued to enact each year in the foreign assistance appropriations in each year usaid found that unfpa was ineligible for us support reinterpretation of kempkasten by the clinton administration as one of his first acts as chief executive president clinton reversed the mexico city policy of presidents reagan and bush and issued determination finding that unfpa programs in china did not violat the terms of kempkasten the policy reversal was based on seve ral factors including ambiguity of the kempkasten language the administration noted that the court of appeals in considering the case brought by the population institute deferred to the usaid interpretation of kempkasten because it was reas onable reading of an ambiguous provision and did not otherwise conf lict with the expressed intention of congress the administration argued that because of this ambiguity the new administration had right to interpret kemp kasten for itself overreliance on the 1985 statemen ts by representative kemp the administration pointed especially to the 1985 court of appeals opinion that questioned th relevance of the additional views of representative kemp interpreting the kempinouye amendment the court observed that although the administration considered representative kemp s remarks as the clearesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32703crs12 21 these policy views are drawn from letters of usaid administrator brian atwood to senator helms dated august 6 and september 10 1993explanation of an ambiguous rm congressman kemp could not convince his colleagues to adopt his views in the committee report itself focus should be on the terms coercive and involuntary and the intent of the or ganization in question the clinton administration believed that it was reasonable to apply the kemp kasten restrictions only in cases where the organization knowingly and intentionally provided direct support for or helped manage people or agencies who were clearly engaged in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization th administration concluded that although it remained c oncerned about coercive practices in china it believed that unfpa did not knowingly or intentionally support directly such practices21 the issue of coercive practices within chinas family planning program and the role of unfpa remained c ontroversial throughout the clinton administration and during the first year of the george w bush presidency congress continued to include kempkasten language in foreig n operations appropriations acts and in most years attached additional conditions on unfpa contributions that required the organization to 1 keep us funds in separate account 2 not spend us money in china and 3 to forego transfers from the united states equal to the amount unfpa allocated for its china program in some years the united states withheld about 35 million from unfpa an amount that approximated the size of unfpas expenditures in china for brief period in 1997 the cont roversy over whether to fund unfpa subsided when unfpas program in china expired and new activities did not resume immediately nevertheless spite oppos ition from the united states unfpa reestablished program in china and in fy1999 appropr iation

depa rtment official and dr theodore tong public health professor at the university of arizona the state departments assessment team filed its report with s ecretary powell on may 29 making series of findings and recommendations23 the group found that there was evidence that unfpa has knowingly supported or participated in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china despite some relaxation of government restrictions in counties where unfpa operates china maintained coercive elements in its population programs in law and practice and chinese leaders viewed population control as high priority and remained concerned over implicati ons for socioeconomic change on the basis of these findings ambassa dor brown and his colleagues recommended that the

analysis of the secretarys determin ation found that even though unfpa did not knowingly support or partic ipate in coercive practice that alone would not preclude the application of ke mpkasten instead finding that the recipient of us funds in this case unf pa simply supports or participates in such program whether knowingly or unknowingly would trigger the restriction the assessment team found that the chines government imposes fines and penalties on families social compensation fees that have children exceeding the number approved by the government the department further not ed that unfpa had funded computers and dataprocessing equipmen t that had helped strengthen the management of the chinese state family planning commission beyond the legitimate uses of these and other items financed by unfpa such equipment facilitated in the view of the state department chinas ability to impose social compensation fees or perform abortions by coercion the state department analysis
