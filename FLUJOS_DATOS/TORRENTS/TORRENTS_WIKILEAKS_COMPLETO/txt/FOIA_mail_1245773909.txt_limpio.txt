katewillettmetofficegovuk peter thorne peterwthornegooglemailcom adrian emails to kate yesterday were returned by the ecmwf server for your email address but not for dicks i also found the two emails you sent last night in my spam list idea why this is happening i found some other semiimportant emails in my spam as well anyway hope you get this email all three reviewers are positive which is good but there is still lot of to do as you say here are some initial thoughts before i begin it seems as though rev 2 comments have ended abruptly during 13 id suggest you ask if there is any more rev 1 i would have thought that the second point larger trends in full erainterim fields was just an interesting aside and not as important as the rh decline ill need to go back to see if sections 5 and 6 can be reorderedrestructured both reviewers 1 and 2 they appear to be kevin and aiguo but odd to have two people who only live few rooms apart make quite few statements about gpcc were doing updating work on the higher resolution cruts 05 by 05 degree latlong datasets were doing comparisons with gpcc and for the giorgi type regions as in fig 314 of ch 3 of ar4 and the agreement is amazingly good maybe all you need to point to is this figure and the previous one fig 312 to say that for land regions at the continental scale it doesnt matter which datasets are used for the period from the 1970s the key thing is that they just use gauges with satellites my view is that bringing in satellites as in cmap and gpcp products can lead to problems and some circularity with era results as youll be using some of the same satellite data products the point to emphasize for precip is that gpcc is totally independent from any era 40 or interim input ive come across these issues about gpcc before ive been haranguing bruno rudolf and now tobias fuchs of gpcc to write something up for number of years within aopc i think their qc is likely the best of all the centres but they will continue to get these doubts if they dont write anything up they should at least explain how they do their interpolation it can certainly be done better gpcc is using so much more data that is has to be better than any other product they cant release the raw station data and it seems they cant release the numbers in each grid box there will be an hc paper on the buoyship sst issue but this isnt yet used operationally it will come but not before your paper goes back i hope it is fairly straightforward to do rmss as well as correlations we had sds in the 2004 paper i dont think rmss would show anything untoward but would take up some more space wrt rev 2 im not that convinced by some of aiguos arguments between us im not that convinced by some of his data analyses the ones involving pdsi leave lot to be desired this is coming to light in other work we are doing rev 2 6 obviously not read the papers crutem3 is simple average of stations within grid box there is interpolation if there are stations then there is value i think this is the same for hadcruh as well rev 2 13 comment seems to end abruptly id like to know what i might have said i dont think ive ever said i doubt gpcp i am around all the time except for the week of july 1217 when ill be at the ipcc scoping meeting in venice kevin will be there as well aiguo will be in cru the first few days of the week after july 2021 cheers phil at 2253 22062009 adrian simmons wrote dick its bit irritating getting review one wants to nail just before leaving for brussels for three days of ecrelated meetings im sure now that reviewer 2s comments on synop numbers is easily answered the number of gts synops went up lot but thats not because there were lot more stations installed the existing one just started having their data transmitted more frequently than 6hourly but this should hardly have effected the rh2m analysis as it uses only the 0 6 12 and 18utc obs that have been there pretty well all the time it only uses offtime obs if the value for the main synoptic hour is missing the 4dvar does assimilate more data over time but here we appeal to fig 8 and argue that the increment does not shift over time we already argue in the appendix that the extra obs over north america may well be part of the difficulty hadcruhext has for that region anyway id like to confirm that the number of used synops does not change much over time for the oi rh2m analysis i know how to find the number in the job output but i dont know how to retrieve the job output from the logfiles stored in ecfs i would only look at few samples id be grateful if youd let know how to do this in any case even if there was problem with the numbers increasing sharply around 2000 this would manifest itself in sudden drop in the rh time series not steady decline over the last few years after bit of thinking i can find several things wrong with reviewer 2s argument why q over land is insensitive to variations in q over sea think coastal mountain ranges deserts drought regions moisture does not simply build up everywhere over land via onshore winds from the boundarylayer until it rains and the response can draw attention to other points made in the paper such as the coherence of changes in the vertical and the similarity but lag of the q series over land and sea hard to believe the latter is all coincidence also there is relationship between q and precip not generally strong but theres high correlation for australia better stop for now adrian original message subject 2009jd012442 editor steve ghan decision letter date

review of jgr manuscript entitled lowfrequency variations in surface atmospheric humidity temperature and precipitation inferences from reanalyses and monthly gridded observational data sets by aj simmons km willett pd jones pw thorne and d dee general comments this paper provides nice and useful summary on how the era40 and erainterim surface analysis products of temperature and humidity were derived and fairly comprehensive evaluationcomparison with the hadcru surface data sets derived purely from surface observations as well as with three other precipitation products they found that in general the era surface temperature and humidity data from 1973 onward are in close agreement with the hadcru data sets and that era precipitation also follows closely with gaugebased products although longterm changes differ furthermore the study reports significant and steady decline in surface relative humidity rh over land from 19992008 and suggested that the recent steady ssts might be responsible for this land rh decrease the manuscript is well written the analysis appears to be comprehensive and the results are of interest to many readers in the climate community i think the paper should be published after some relat ively minor revisions my main concern is the interpretation of the recent rh decline over land to the rh decreases shown in fig 4 and fig 7 look bit spurious nonclimatic eg lack of variations in fig 4 and stepwise changes in fig7 rather than realistic changes they are also inconsistent with the rh changes during recent decades up to 2004 reported in dai 2006 jc and this is not pointed out in the paper as shown in dai 2006 there was 3fold increase around the late 1990s in the number of surface humidity reports mostly in north america but also over some other regions included in the wmo synop gts reports furthermore i personally found that there were other undocumented changes in the synop reports around that time that led to shifts in derived precipitation and cloud frequencies over euroasia and other places thus there are reasons to suspect some nonclimatic changes in the synop reports around the late 1990s that might alter the rh trend over land i also was not convinced by the physical explanation of the rh decline p23 even if the surface q stayed the same over the oceans during the 19992008 period when land air temperature has been increasing this can not explain the rh decrease over land this is because as long as the marine air contains more water vapor than continental surface air which is still true even if marine sfc q did not increase advection of marine air onto land should cause land q to accumulate and rh to increase until the land q and rh reach certain levels so that precipitation kicks in to remove the moisture over land remember that the atmospheric moisture storage pw is very small compared with the annual p and fluxes thus any perturbation in rh is quickly within days restored through surface vertical mixing or lateral advectionmixing if the rh in the marine air had decreased then land rh would likely to decease too dai 2006 did not show rh decreases over oceans since the 1980s i wish the authors of this paper would also show rh series over ocean at least since the middle 1980s for the era humidity data the large wellknown inhomogeneities in radiosonde humidity records will certainly propagate into the era background forecast and its analysis fields making them not really suitable for longterm trend analyses for example all usoperated radiosonde records including many in the pacific before about oct 1993 report dew point depression dpd of 30degc or rh of 20 for any cases where rh is below 20 which resulted in an abnormally higher frequency of reports of dpd30degc and few reports below and reports above dpd30degc this practice is also found in some mexican canadian australian and few other places but stopped at different times from the late 1980s to the 1990s in general the newer humidity sensors during the last 1015 years report more low rh or large dpd cases whereas earlier ones had measurements or incorrect values for these cases one can see this shift in the histograms of daily dpd made by different humi dity sensors thus one needs to be very cautious when radiosonde humidity data are used in assessing trends even if they are used indirectly as in the era surface humidity analysis some other comments 1 abstract it gives the impression that even the longterm mean values for surface t q and rh are the same between era and hadcru data sets which appears to be not the case as the respective means are removed in all plots please mention that the climatological mean may differ if this is the case even though the anomaly variations are similar 2 abstract at the end please note that the mean precipitation amount and its change rate are not controlled by atmospheric water vapor amount q although higher q is often associated with higher p eg tropical vs high latitudes locally you can have moist air passing by without any rain globally annual p is controlled by how much moisture gets evaporated from ocean and land surfaces ie pe and this surface is primarily controlled by surface energy terms in essence p and are water fluxes and pw or q is the water storage in the atmosphere people often link p to q because of the associated mentioned above through lowlevel moisture convergence in storm etc and think that p change rates somehow should follow that of q or pw however and p or and q are controlled by different processes and in general the flux terms are not coupled with the storage terms in cycling system eg one would think p or is controlled by water storage in t he ocean 3 p 3 top the net radiative effect of clouds is relatively small when their effect on solar radiation is included to include clouds in the natural greenhouse warmth is bit misleading because the higher surface temperature is maintained primarily by the greenhouse effect of water vapor and co2 4 p 4 middle again any samplingreporting biases in wmo synop reports could affect both era and hadcruh humidity data thus caution is still needed 5 pp56 section 2a so in essence era40 and erainterim surface t q and rh are another analysis product based on surface observations just like the hadcru and other climate data sets the only difference is in the analysis methodology io interpolation with the use of the era background forecast fields vs other more conventional analysis methods like most users i thought the era surface fields are more tightly coupled with the reanalysis model system i think it would be helpful to point out the above at the beginning of this section or in the introduction 6 p 7 top please briefly mention how the station anomalies were aggregated onto 5deg grid in crutemp3 eg by simply averaging station values within the grid box or making use of correlated nearby station data outside the box when sampling inside the box is sparse i think most people would use the later to increase the coverage in the gridded products 7 p 7 bottom have any adjustmentscorrections done for the most recent decades 19992008 in hadcruhext this is the period when rh decreases are there any homogeneity issues in combining the extended records with the homogenized hadcruh 8 p 9 top how could the fit of the era background forecasts capture multiple shifts induced by instrumental changes or reporting practices especially when the future changes are needed to determine the timing and the size of shift many statistical methods specifically designed to do these two tasks by analyzing the whole historical series still have difficulties in reliably detecting the locations of shifts and can only make best guess regarding the real shift size i wonder how one can do this in reanalysis system when future records are not used yet or nearby station series are combined together to form grid box series that contain shifts from multiple stations ie the stepwise patterns become very complex and look more like real variations 9 p 9 middle i cant believe the gpcc people are still gridding precipitation total not anomalies this makes their products useless for longterm change analyses another land precipitation product from 1948present that is derived from gauge records and the oi method is the precl from the ncep climate prediction center cpc ref chen et 2002 j hydrometorol i think that is better products for assessing longterm changes in land precipitation although the gauge coverage for recent years after 1997 may be not as good as that of the gpcc 10 p 11 middle and bottom need to point out in abstract or summary that differences in the mean exist between the era and hadcru t and humidity data 11 fig 1 and other figures i suspect that different mean values were removed in computing the difference series if thats the case then need to point out this ie the difference is between the anomalies relative to their respective mean 12 fig 4 also show rh over the oceans for the last 25 years 13 fig 11 with the changing gauge coverage and gridding precipitation total one can not trust the lowfrequency variations in the gpcc products phil jones and other have reviewer 3 comments review of the paper entitled lowfrequency variations in surface atmospheric humidity temperature and precipitation inferences from reanalyses and monthly gridded observational dataset by aj simmons k m willett p d thorne and d dee recommendation accept with minor changes summary of the paper this is an elaborate study examining trends in temperature humidity and precipitation from the latest ecmwf reanalysis comparing with independent gridded analyses which are also performed with utmost care the paper revealed that the commonly accepted assumption that the relative humidity stays the same under global warming condition does not necessarily holds over land this is an important finding and should be of interest to wide climate communities there are several other important contributions such as the sensitivity of observation coverage on long term trend which can only be studied by the use of reanalysis that has full global coverage this paper also presents that the era40 and erainterim are of very high quality and useable for low frequency climate studies major comments 1 i am particularly impressed with the way the work is performed this is very elaborate work using variety of datasets to present that there is strong long time trend in temperature and humidity this thorough work made it possible to convince readers these observed facts although the finding of the decrease in relative humidity over land is credible it may be more meteorologically interesting and convincing if additional analysis is made to present the possible mechanisms of the absence of increase in specific humidity over land if reanalysis is used it is not impossible to estimate the change in the moisture transport into land areas although this may involve considerable amount of work it may also possible to examine the change in large scale mean landocean circulation that contributes to the transport of moisture from heuristic point of view stronger heating over land tends to strengthen upper level high and subsidence which may prevent moisture to be transported inland and such trend may be detectable from large scale reanalysis in terms of the change in precipitation moisture availability and relative humidity are important but static stability and large scale convergence should also play an important role if any of these additional analyses can be performed or even discussed in qualitative manner it will enhance the paper 2 it is not very clear how the diurnal variations of temperature and humidity are handled in this study it is helpful to state the time frequency of reanalysis output that is used to compute daily mean and the way observed daily mean are obtained 3 are there any reason that the relative humidity or dew point depression is analyzed and not the specific humidity itself 4 the paper is little too long one way to shorten it is to separating it into two parts by adding analysis suggested above or separating the analysis of precipitation this is just suggestion and decision is up to the authors minor comments 1 page 6 11 the authors claim that the use of anomaly will reduce the influence of surface elevation differences can this be true even the relation between elevation and relative humidityspecific humidity is very nonlinear 2 it may be friendlier to the reader why relative humidity and specific humidity are both examined some introductory remarks on the different impact of relative and specific humidity will help 3 page 13 lines 298300 these lines just present why the era40 and interim are different but not the reason for the erainterim worse than era40 over africa 4 page 14 lines 316328 is it possible to separate the actual reduction in the number of observations and the reduction in data used by crutem 5 page 15 line 364 it seems that the difference in analysis between era40 and erainterim seems to be used as measure of the reanalysis accuracy is this good assumption 6 page 17 lines 392397 can it be possible to mathematically estimate the relation between the correlation of specific humidity and relative humidity since relative humidity is function of specific humidity temperature and pressure it seems natural that the correlation for relative humidity should be lower however this will depend on which parameters are analyzed in the first place adrian simmons european centre for mediumrange weather forecasts shinfield park reading rg2 9ax uk phone 44 118 949 9700 fax 44 118 986 9450 prof phil jones
