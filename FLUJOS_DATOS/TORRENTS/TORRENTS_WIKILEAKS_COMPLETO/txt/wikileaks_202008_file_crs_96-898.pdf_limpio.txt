vietnams political and economi c reforms began in the latter 1980s major generational change in leadership coincided with grave internal difficulties and external pressures to prompt significant changes in vietnamese policy in late 1986 old guard leaders were eased from power in favor of new generation of communist leaders the latter were more sensitive to the fact that their political standing rested to considerable degree on their ability to improve the livelihood of the vietnamese people through domestic reforms and international initiatives designed to reduce vietnams isolation stemming in part from its 10year occupation of cambodia they acted to revitalize the vietnamese economy reform and improve the efficiency of the governmentparty apparatus and to broaden vietnams economic and political contacts beyond the soviet bloc httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96898crs2 2schwarz adam promises promises vietnams leaders come under pressure to speed up reforms far eastern economic

that character ized past more orthodox communist economic policies vietnams leaders initiated an economic reform program in 1986 known as doi moi in vietnamese literally economic renovation the reforms attempted to replace centrally planned economy with regulated market economy at the heart of the reforms were measures that eliminated price controls gave farmers greater control over what they could produce abandoned central planning clarified the legal status of private businesses and tightened government spending as part of the latter attempt efforts were made to limit subsidies to stateowned enterprises soes by providing them greater autonomy in production investment and pricing decisions the authorities also moved to open the economy to foreign trade and investment and to attract foreign assistance vietnams economy has prospered since the reforms commenced after years of negative growth economic activity increased an average annual of 39 from 19861990 and of 76 from 19911993 in real terms the economy grew by 88 in 1994 and by 95 in 1995 another year of 95 growth is forecast for 1996 as result vietnams gross domestic product is projected to reach 24 billion this year level that will raise its average per capita income above 300 for the first time2 vietnams rapid growth in 1996 is being accompanied by low inflation due primarily to tight monetary policy and fall in commodity prices through september the cost of living increased by only 29 in contrast to an increase of 171 for the comparable period in 1995 the drop in inflation has allowed the central bank to lower interest rates to around 163 against this favorable backgroun d the vietnamese leaders are confronted by both immediat and longerrun economic challenges the immediate problems facing the economy include rising trade deficit and declining foreign interest in vietnam as an investment site reform of the state sector is top longerterm challenge nearterm economic challenges vietnams trade deficit through the first eight months of this year totalled 32 billion nearly 1 billion more than the deficit for calendar year 1995 this widening trade deficit is large by international standards equivalent to 15 of gdp and may force vietnams policymakers to consider slower growth import restraints or devaluation by 1997 any of these steps could prove controversial to different groups lagging interest by foreign investors is second nearterm problem foreign investment approvals totalled 358 billion in the first eight months of 1996 down 34 from the comparable period in 1995 number of

vietnams attractiveness as site for foreign investment in the process vietnam may be losing its image as an emerging asian tiger4 longerterm economic challenge despite progress in closing down some 6500 mostly small and townbased soes since doi moi commenced vietnam still operates an estimated 6000 state enterprises although the remaining soes account for less than 10 of total employment they dominate strategic sectors of the economy such as banking construction trade telecommunications energy steel and chemicals altogether the soes reportedly still account for 75 of vietnams assets obtain about 65 of the bank credit provide more than half of the governments budget revenues and represent roughly 25 of the economys total output5 as about twothirds of these enterprises are thought to be unprofitable reform of the state sector is required for the modernization of the economy although most direct subsidies to state enterprises have been eliminated the soes still retain immense advantages in gaining access to credit and land this in turn handicaps privately owned small and medium size enterprises which comprise the most dynamic sector of vietnams economy to improve the efficiency of the soes the government is trying to put together several dozen conglomerates known as general corporations in industries such as rubber steel coal power and textiles patterned after the south korean model of huge conglomerates or chaebol the government hopes that combining several soes in the same field will allow them to compete more effectively internationally while at the same time retaining control over their activities skeptics believe that the general corporations will act as monopolies thereby undermining efforts to allow more scope for private sector activity so far the government has resisted outright efforts at privatization but it has established pilot equitization program in which it has sought to issue shares for 21 small state firms the hope is to raise money while retaining majority control any large scale privatization program however faces formidable opposition from the army individual ministries and regional authorities that now control themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96898crs4 6pruzin daniel vietnams communists feud on pace of reform wall street journal p 2political developments vietnams experiment with political reform begun in the late 1980s lagged far behind economic changes and has been largely superseded by an orthodox drive to maintain tight political control reformminded leaders appeared following the vietnamese landmark sixth communist party congress in december 1986 old guard leaders were retired and the new general secretary set about to revitalize the ossified political structure and stagnant economy through reforms and experiments reductions in central control and curbs on the partys power over aspects of state and society the reformers standing remained uncertain as many seniorlevel leaders harbored concerns about the diminution of their control the political crisis in china after the june 1989 tiananmen massacre and the collapse of communism in europe caused these leaders to reassert their views against the reformers the seventh party congress held in hanoi in june 1991 saw leadership emerge that was dominated by relatively younger political hardliners anxious to reassert party prerogatives and avoid political changes incompatible with communist party control new constitution which went into effect on april 18 1992 confirmed the political monopoly of the communist party opposition to the communist party is not tolerated political and religious dissidents are jailed or otherwise repressed vietnam today is not the highly regimented centralized and doctrinaire communist state that it was few decades ago people may not have political freedom but the doi moi process has weakened the position of the party particularly in economic and social affairs in these areas the vietnamese people appear to have considerable personal freedom provincial and local officials also have considerable power and often act contrary to decrees issued from hanoi top party leaders are most often described as pragmatists who are focused on two overriding objectives bringing economic prosperity to vietnam and maintaining the partys monopoly on political power the pace and scope of the economic reform process however is matter of serious divide among vietnams ruling elite6 debate over economic policy one group of socalled reformers advocates more active policy reforms that support development of stronger private sector the contraction of the largely inefficient state sector and the countrys continued integration into the regional and world economy second group of conservatives worry that an increase in the pace of economic reforms could undermine the countrys socialist values as well as undermine the partys monopoly on power through an increase in societal demands for political reforms the eighth party congress held in july 1996 failed to resolve these differences over the pace and depth of the reform process by maintaining the present top leadership team for at least another year the congress confirmed that while there will be turning back of the liberalization process reforms will also proceed in the slow and cautious manner that has increasingly frustrated foreign investorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96898crs5 7grant jeremy power of vietnams leaders criticised financial times july 2 1996 p 6the current three top leaders of the vietnamese regime president duc ahn prime minister vo van kiet and party secretary general do muoi are widely seen to represent different policy perspectives with prime minister vo van kiet seen as the most forward looking reform advocate the inability of the party congress to determine the proper mix of reformers and conservatives in successor leadership lay behind the congress decision to keep the current three top leaders in power despite their advanced age7 signs of retrenchment also emerged from the congress membership in the partys 19member politboro includes more members from the military and internal security branches the central committees report also made clear that changes in the vietnams political system will be vigorously resisted and that foreign sources of instability will be closely monitored in addition although controversial pledge to raise the state sectors share of economic activity to 60 by 2020 was dropped the final report pledged to maintain the state sectors leading role in the economy number of external forces however make it likely that the rhetoric of vietnams leadership will continue to be socialist while its practice continues to be increasingly capitalist for example vietnams membership in the associatio n of southeast asian nation asean and its application to become member of the world trade organization wto are strong incentives for keeping the country moving in direction of more marketoriented economy for vietnam membership in both groupings will help it gain wider access to markets and increase its acceptability to international investors in addition preconditions for loans established by the world bank and asian development bank serve as strong pressures for continuing the reform process continuing divisions among the top leadership are likely to ensure that the pace of vietnams transitio n towards market economy will not be smooth likely scenario barring crisis is for continuation of the twosteps forward and onestep back process where the state will continue to play large role and where small entrepreneurs will continue to operate somewhat handicapped in this context vietnams leadership struggle will continue to condition relations with the united states including efforts to normalize commercial relations relations with the united states since president clinton ordered an end to the us trade embargo on vietnam on february 3 1994

such as import licensing and customs valuation vietnams current systems of import licensing and customs valuation continue to provide major problems for us exporters us negotiators are also seeking guarantees of market access for services including insurance legal services banking and telecommunications in addition us negotiators are likely to insist that vietnams regulatory and administrative procedures become much more transparent most reports indicate that vietnam has long distance to travel before it is ready for bilateral agreement whether vietnam will be able to enact the necessary reforms before the end of 1997 remains problematic in the meantime number of other issues will affect bilateral relations heading the list are continuing controversy over whether vietnam has fully accounted for us prisoners of war and missing in action powmias from the vietnam war and us concerns about the hanoi governments hard line against political dissent and arrests of religious activists

longer be subject to restrictions in the us constitution barring the president from appointing us congressman to such post8
