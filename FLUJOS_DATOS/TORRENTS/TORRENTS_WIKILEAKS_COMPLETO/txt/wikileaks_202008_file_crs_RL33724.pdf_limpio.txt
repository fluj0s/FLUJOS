the house of representatives has changed only six times over the past 75 years and only once in th past halfcentury following the midterm elections of 1994 earlier chan ges in 1931 1947 1949 1953 and 1955 offer little in the way of precedent relevant to the c ontemporary situation moreover given the rapid pace of institutional procedural and technological change over the past decade even the transfer of power in 1995 pr ovides only limited reference to present circumstances there does not appear to be definitive roadmap to all of the issues that could arise in the current majority transition or those that might follow generally the transition to new majority may raise number of issues and challenges affecting house rules certain activities in member offices committees and administrative and legislative operations some of those administrative issues may be addressed by the current majority and the incoming majority that assumes control of house operations at the beginning of the 110th congress during the period between the november elections and when the new congress convenes in early january new incoming majority lacks official institutional authority to implement any changes beyond procedures governin g the activities of its conference or caucus matters relating to ch amber rules house fficers staff office space administrative practices of the outgoing majority or matters pending floor consideration remain under th direction of the outgoing majority although there can be some discussion between leaders of the outgoing and incoming majorities the outgoing majority is not bound to change current practices or to accommodate the preferences of the incoming majority until the current congress adjourns and the new congress convenes although new incoming majority may l ack formal authority to undertake the administration of the house prior to the fo rmal convening of the chamber it appears that many of the decisions related to transition need to be made prior to the formal assumption of majority status this repor t provides discussion and analysis of some of the immediate areas that new incoming majority would likely need to consider as it prepares to assume responsibility for the administration of the house these issues include 1 amendment and adoption of house rules 2 election of house officers 3 administration of

representatives american political science review vol 62 1968 pp 144168administrative issues related to change in majority in the house of representatives introduction the change in majority leadership in the house of representatives could affect house rules certain activities in member offices committees and administrative and legislative operations the transition to new majority may raise number of challenges and issues in the administration of those areas for the current majority and the incoming majority that will assume control of house operations at the beginning of the 110th congress in addition to the concerns typical of any transition to new congress the incoming leadership of the 110th congress will likely also consider issues related to the appointment of new architect of the capitol and address issues related to the completion of the capitol visitor center1 in the 20th century the majority in the h ouse of representa tives has switched eight times most recently in 1995 at the beginning of the 104th congress prior to 1995 the majority last switched in 1955 at the beginning of the 84th congress ending period in which the majority switched between the republican and democratic parties in four out of five cong resses between 1947 and 1955 table 1 summarizes house majority shifts in the 20th century in the past century the house has gr own from relatively modest operation in which members assisted by few staff convened for short legislative sessions2 to complex institution featuring longer gislative sessions supported by large professional staffs dedicated to highly specialized chamber legislative and administrative activities3 as well as committee and member office operations consequently information from majority transitions in the house that occurred more than five decades ago may not offer salient examples of many of the issues that could arise in the transition to democratic majority in the 110th congress and will not be considered herehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33724crs2 4 this evolution includes the development of routine professionalized management of house administrative activities through the chief administrative officer an officer first appointed at the beginning of the 104th congress the integration of advanced information technology systems in administrative committee and member office operations and an enhanced focus on congressional security and emergency planning in addition the house has arguably been shaped by external forces th at could affect some of its activities these include closer scrutiny by media and the public due to the relative ease with which they can gather information about congressional activitie s relatedly the routine use of email congressional web pages and other modes of communication arguably has created an enhanced capacity for the public to contact thei r elected officials and also necessitate the dedication of staff and other resources to manage and respond to those communicationstable 1 majority changes in the house of representatives 18992005 congress new majority party 104th 19951996 republican 84th 19551956 democratic 83rd 19531954 republican

547 although republican majority was elected to the 72nd congress several representativeselect died before congress convened leaving democratic majority to organize the house although the house has undergone signifi cant institutional evolution in the 12 years since the 1995 transition4 it is more likely that some of the issues addressed at that time would arise in the current transition and those that might occur in the relatively near future some of those issues will be used in this report as examples at the same time however since majority transitions have in the past 50 years been infrequent events that featured political social and institutional characteristics unique to the circumstances of each transiti on it is also likely that the 1995 transition would not provide definitive roadmap to all of the issues that could arise in the current majority transition or those that might follow the experiences of one participant in the early days of the 1995 tr ansition may be instructive on this pointhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33724crs3 5 juliet eilperin in switch gop to gr ant leave for fired personal staff of 103rd roll call jan 16 1995 6 quote from treatment of

reportedly noted w ere making up an awful lot of this as we go along5 it should also be noted that during th period between the november elections and when the new congress convenes in early january new incoming majority lacks official institutional authority to implement any changes beyond procedures governing the activities of its conference or caucus matters relating to chamber rules house officers staff office space administrative practices of the outgoing majority or matters pending floor consideration if as is the case in the 109th congress there is lame duck session would remain under the direction of the outgoing majority while there can be some discussion between leaders of the outgoing and incoming majorities the outgoing majority would not be bound to change current practices or to accommodate the preferences of the incoming majority until the current congress adjourns and th new congress convenes as practical matter however the outgoing majority may need to take into account the preferences of the incoming majority which may preven t the outgoing majority from taking particular course of action for example in the 103rd congress representative norman mineta during brief lame duc k session introduced hres 588 to provide severance pay for some committee staff who were to be terminated as part of the majority transition in remarks on the h ouse floor representative benjamin cardin noted that the house was unable to secure unanimous consent to bring up the measure because they were unable to get the clearance from the republicans6 in the 104th congress the house adopted provisi ons to provide payment for accrued leave to house committee administrative and personal staff7 similarly it has been reported that in 1994 soon after the elections the incoming majority reminded the outgoing majority of its obligations to preserve committee and other house records in paper and electronic formats8 there were claims thereafter that suggested that while the outgoing majority did provide the incoming majority with access to records it may not have complied with requests to preserve some electronic records9 additionally the incoming majority in

dec 3 1994 12 see crs report rl30725 the first day of new congre ss guide to proceedings on the house floor by mildred amerweeks of 1994 reportedly informed managers of several house administrative and support offices that they were dismissed10 similarly nearly all house support staff were informed during the same period that they were to be rminated and provided information on the procedures unde r which they might be rehired11 public record of the effective date of these terminations was identified objections to these activities by the outgoing majority were identified nevertheless it is arguable that the incoming majority lacked authority to assume responsibility for house staff prior to assuming formal control of the chamber in january 1995 while new incoming majority may lack formal authority to undertake the administration of the house prior to the fo rmal convening of the chamber it appears that many decisions related to transition need to be made prior to the formal assumption of majority status the follo wing sections discuss and analyze some areas in which new incoming majority would likely need to consider as it prepared to assume responsibility for administration of the house many of these activities however including the adoption of the rule s and election of officers are routine activities carried out on the first day of new congress12 regardless of which party commands majority to organize the house the rules themselves as well as the slate of officers put before the house ar debated and approved within the incoming majority conference or caucus before they are laid before the chamber similarly administration of committee organization nd funding establishment of house wide staffing levels and publication of the members representational allowance mra are based on various party legislative and administrative decisions taken with majority involvement these decisions ma be made at various times from the first meetings on early organization of the cham ber soon after the general election through the first several weeks of new congress rules the principal means of asserting control over the house are the rules that govern floor committee and administrative activities as well as certain member actions the majority that organizes the house rou tinely takes adoption of the rules for the new congress as one of its first actions the package of rules the house adopts typically are those rules of the previous congress with certain amendments to previous practices and procedures ame ndments to the rules which are generally known in advance of their formal adoption on the first day of new congress may come from number of sources including the conference or caucus of the incoming majority which formally agrees to the ch anges prior to their introduction on the firsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33724crs5 13 for example at the beginning of the 108th congress 20032004 house rules were amended to require the speaker to deliver to the clerk of the house ranked list of representatives to serve as speaker pro tempore in the event of vacancy in the office of speaker at the same time the rules were amended to allow the speaker to convene the house in place at the seat of government ot her than the hall of the house whenever in his opinion the public interest shall warrant it these rules changes were part of broader congressional response to the events of ptember 11 2001 and subsequent incidents that temporarily interrupted house operations the rules of the house are most typically considered at the beginning of new congress but they may be amended at any time during the 109th congress the house on february 1 2006 adopted hres 648 under suspen sion of the rules by vote of 379 50 1 present hres

minority party and that became part of house rules as result of the majority transition in the 104th congress the house took number of steps authorized by amended rules affecting floor proceedings including matters related to the consideration of budget measures affecting committee structure procedure and staff and consolidating manageme nt responsibility for financial security and legislative

109th congress16 these positions have developed over time and in acco rd with various changes to the rules adopted by the chamber while some positions like that of the clerk have existed since the first congress others the chief administra tive officer are newer creations or were recently reappointed after peri od of vacancy the historian17 officers elected by the house currently include the clerk sergeant at arms chief administrative officer and the chaplain these officers are elected by the house at the beginning of each congress to serve until their successors are chosen in recent practice the election process has entailed the offering of one resolution containing the majority slate of officers this has then been followed by request from the minority for division of the stion and separate vote on the chaplain position that has generally been uncontested during the opening proceedings the chaplains election has been followed by an amendment to the remainder of the resolution offered by member of the minor ity party offering separate slate of candidates for the other positions18 the amendment is generally then rejected and the remainder of the resolution is agreed to either the house or the speaker may remove the clerk the sergeantatarms or the chief administrative officer the speaker has the power to make temporary appointment if there is vacancy in any of the offices which lasts until person is chosen by the house the parliamentarian gene ral counsel legislative counsel law revision counsel and historian are each appointed by the speaker the inspector general is jointly appointed by the speaker and majo rity and minority leaders although some of these positions have been characterized by the lengthy tenure of the incumbents others have

recent actions the house office building commission may issue rules and regulations that govern the use and occupancy of all r ooms in the house office buildings for example the commission recently

house office building 2022251435 the provision of benefits for staff leaving house service became an issue of particular interest after the most recent partisan changeover topics discussed included the impact of involuntary separati on on those employees close to retirement as well as payment for unused leave that departing employees were unable to utilize before the new congress although th incoming majority initially cited cost concerns and stated that leave not used prior to the new congress would not be compensated this policy was changed early in the 104th congress to provide payment to separated administrative and legislative staff and made retroactive to those employees employed through the end of the 103rd congress28 administrative staff each of the house officers and offici als employs cadre of support staff overall figures or direction for the offices may be directed by leadership or other concerns including those voiced by the house committee on appropriations and the committee on house administration29 most of the positions in these offices are filled by professionals and congressional quarterly has written that the only jobs remaining under patronage are those that do not re quire specialized skills or technical knowledge30 any change in partisan control could potentially have an impact on the staff of the administrative offices although the effects may be more si gnificant for some staff than others in late december 1994 according to news sources the new majority fired virtually the houses entire middle management or approximately 50 people31 other

committees majority transition could have sign ificant effects on committee organization and operations the rules of the house particularly rules xxiii govern the authority and operations of its committees and subcommittees the house allows each of its committees to decide how to conduct business subject to various requirements and prohibitions33 in any transition to new congress the majority could consider amendments to rules governing the activities of committees in practice when new congress convenes leaders typically address three areas of chamber organization and administration directly related to committee activities these areas are negotiation of individual committee sizes and ratios between party leaders assignment of chairman ranki ng minority members and other members to committees by party caucus or conference according to the polices of those entities34 and adoption of resolution authorizing the funding of expenses of committees several weeks af ter the house convenes35 it appears unlikely that change of majority would significantly alter the need to address these issues during early orga nization meetings or soon after the new congress convenes although the form and approach used in the past to address these concerns could be amended in addition to those matters however the prospect of majority transition raises questions related to committee structure and jurisdiction staffing levels36 office space and the preservation of committee records in paper and electronic form in majority transiti on any of the elements of existing committee practice could be subject to review and revisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33724crs11 37 see crs report 95187 committee system rules changes in the house 104th congress by judy schneider 38 alice love

procedures were changed and staff levels reduced37 office space in the 104th congress the majority transition in both chambers reportedly triggered the most extensive offi ce shuffle in congressional history38 in addition to the relocation of member offices typical in any new congress the majority transition necessitated the relocation of committee staff between facilities occupied by the majority and minority on those panels the costs of moving committee staff between majority and minority facilities in the event of majority transition potentially could be met from the interim funds authorized for committees to use prior to march 30 of the first session of new congress in the event that funds were unavailable unobligated funds from other house accounts could be transferred or the costs of moves could be incorporated into co mmittee expense requests when the house considers committee funding39 in addition to funding issues majority transition could raise questions related to parity in
