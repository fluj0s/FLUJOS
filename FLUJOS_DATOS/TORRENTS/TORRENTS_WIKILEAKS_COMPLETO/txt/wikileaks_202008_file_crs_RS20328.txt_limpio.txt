migdalovitz specialist in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary on august 17 1999 turkey was struck by severe earthquake leaving about 15000 dead 24000 injured and 250000 homeless the high casualty toll aggravated by shoddy construction has been partly attributed to corrupt builders and government officials turkish media earthquake victims and other observers criticized the government and military for their slow responses to the disaster yet neither the political system nor the government are likely to change soon turkey had been in recession before the quake and economic growth will continue to decline in the short term but will pick up with spending on recovery parliament has passed macroeconomic reforms paving the way for an international monetary fund standby agreement international support for the earthquake victims has been remarkable the us administration provided aid for rescue and relief longerterm assistance israels response may cement bilateral ties while those of the european union and greece may help heal strained relations hconres 188 introduced on september 22 commends greece and turkey for putting aside their differences in responses to earthquakes in both countries see also see crs report rs20253 turkey continuity and change after elections july 6 1999 this report will not be updated background on august 17 1999 an earthquake registering 74 on the richter scale one of the most powerful recorded in the 20th century struck northwest turkey over 20 of the turkish population lives in the affected provinces the hardest hit areas include izmit an industrial city and location of the countrys largest refinery golcuk home of the largest naval base nearby cities towns and villages and eastern districts of istanbul turkeys largest city severe aftershocks caused more injuries and damage the death toll which includes seven americans exceeds 150001 with 24000 injured and 250000 homeless 1 the official death toll was revised downward by about 5500 on august 24 critics accused the government of downplaying the magnitude of the disaster to mask its poor response amberin zaman critics say turkey is understating earthquake death toll the washington post continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 over 60000 houses were destroyed 58000 moderately damaged and 68000 lightly damaged costing many lives this high number has been attributed to shoddy construction by corrupt contractors on unsuitable land and to lack or inadequacy of inspections by dishonest local officials2 official response government officials and the armed forces were not seen to act for the critical first 36 to 48 hours after the earthquake3 the government blamed its slow response on the destruction of transportation and communications infrastructure but it was clearly deficient in emergency preparedness typified by lack of civil defense operations coordination search and rescue teams and equipment or other trained personnel the government did not commandeer equipment from the private sector for rescue efforts until august 21 these deficiencies are striking since turkey often experiences earthquakes smarting at the criticism chief of staff general huseyin kivrikoglu insisted that the armed forces had mobilized for rescue immediately and the militarys public affairs office claimed thousands of rescues turkish civil society stepped into the void left by government inaction non governmental organizations businesses and individual citizens mobilized for rescue efforts and to provide immediate relief some members of the government criticized these efforts as publicity stunts the government confiscated the bank accounts of some non governmental groups to prevent mismanagement and perhaps also to avoid being upstaged by islamists and others possible political ramifications domestic criticism of the states response was unprecedented in its scope and some analysts hoped that the earthquake would spur changes to the political system how long popular anger at the state will last is uncertain political reform is unlikely in turkey under present conditions however the government and military closed ranks and turned on media critics for demoralizing the people and troops state censors suspended operations of television station because of its castigating commentary other critics then stopped reproaching the military and some journalists defended it in other countries government that responded so poorly to natural disaster might fall threeparty coalition took office in june with large parliamentary majority it is the fifth government in four years and its longevity has never been assured but the earthquake probably will not hasten its

participated in prior governments and might be viewed as at least partly liable for deficiencies in the official response to the quake mhp is newcomer to government and might be considered less culpable but it heads ministries that are in the forefront of relief and recovery efforts thus its actions were more closely scrutinized than its partners and the results were mixed mhp health minister osman durmuss made xenophobic statements as he rejected an armenian search and rescue team and greek blood donations and denigrated foreign medical assistance mhps coalition partners did not join in calls for his resignation however and durmus remains in office by contrast mhp minister of housing and public works koray aydin appeared organized and reassuring aydins ministry is responsible for housing earthquake victims and announced threephase plan of immediate shelter prefabricated temporary homes and permanent reconstruction the government also offered rent subsidies to those seeking alternative housing the opposition islamist virtue party fp finished third in the april national election and is experiencing generational infighting among its leaders yet it is not debilitated and fpled municipalities rapidly sent representatives to the disaster to provide food medical aid and clothing to earthquake victims these actions prompted some fear that fp would exploit the situation for political gain finally as the constitutionally mandated guarantor of the state the military is the major political power in turkey since change of command in summer 1998 the military had been lowering its public profile which it had raised when it forced an islamistled government from power in june 1997 the commanders reportedly recommended state of emergency or martial law after the earthquake but the government said it was not needed and the military deferred to civilians who proved wanting the military possesses transport and communications that could have helped overcome some the problems that the government blamed for its inaction in the early hours of the disaster turks questioned their armed forces absence but the extent that the quake has tarnished the militarys popular image remains unclear economic effects cost estimates of earthquake damage vary the turkish government estimates losses at between 9 billion and 13 billion the world banks assessment includes 65 billion for earthquake damage plus 2 billion in lost production the turkish industrialists and businessmens association tusiad estimates the cost at 17 billion 10 billion in infrastructure damage 5 billion in lost production and 2 billion in emergency relief productivity may fall due to workers fear of returning to work or flight from the region and tax revenues also may decline the turkish economy had been in recession before the earthquake in the first half of 1999 its gross national product declined largely because continuing factors related to the global financial crisis particularly in russia one of turkeys major trading partners growth will continue to fall during the remainder of the year due to effects of the earthquake contraction in the gross national product of 1 to 15 is forecast for 1999 spending for reconstruction of industrial plants homes and consumer goods however is expected to spur growth of the gross national product by about 5 in 2000 when concern about inflation also may return crs4 to meet conditions set earlier by the international monetary fund imf for standby agreement of 15 billion to 3 billion parliament has passed macroeconomic reforms including banking oversight international arbitration of commercial disputes and social security reform the imf still expects to complete negotiations with turkey on an agreement this year it offered

request 100 to 300 million for turkey as part of 12 billion emergency funding request 8 the administration later took account of budget and congressional constraints and emphasized other measures for turkey its view may have suppressed several ambitious ideas that prime minister ecevit and the turkish media had floated for us consideration before ecevits september 28 meeting with president clinton on august 30 ecevit said that he would ask the united states to guarantee bond issue to raise money for reconstruction9 sources suggested that the request would be for guarantee of 5 billion in 10year bonds10 turkey has good debt repayment record but congress would have had to approve an annual loan subsidy to protect the united states against possible default although turkish newspapers alleged that the administration had turned down turkeys request for guarantee11 turkish official asserted on september 24 that the government had decided that bond issue was not needed12 other sources indicated that ecevit would ask for forgiveness of debts incurred from foreign military financing fmf13 especially loans from the 1980s which bear high interest rates us treasury and congressional approval would have been needed and administration officials noted substantial difficulties with debt forgiveness ecevit claimed after meeting president clinton that the latter said he would consider it while us officials said the president did not respond ecevit also said that he had asked president clinton to resume military aid to turkey because of its role in bosnia kosovo and northern watch over iraq and claimed that president clinton wanted to resume aid before the end of his term14 finally turkish journalists and others suggested usturkish free trade agreement perhaps unaware that the united states is party to only two accords the north american free trade agreement nafta and an accord with israel and that congressional approval would been needed and unlikely ecevit did not propose an agreement but requested consideration of qualified industrial zone whose products could enter the united states tax free for turkeys southeast which is recovering from 15 years of guerrilla warfare the main economic results of ecevits visit are 108 million increase in quotas for turkish textile exports to the united states trade and investment framework agreement several us agency programs to

humanitarian aid were striking as were israeli popular concern and turkish gratitude the israeli government immediately dispatched the largest search and rescue team and supplied food medical aid and tents bilateral ties launched by each sides defense establishment are expected to have stronger popular foundation in the future european union the european union eu provided about 32 million in aid for housing 205 million in economic aid and 635 million in soft loans for reconstruction all eu member states gave bilateral donations in december 1997 the eu had failed to include turkey as candidate for eu membership with 11 other countries turkey was insulted and ended all political discussions with the eu france britain italy and more recently germany have advocated more accommodating policy toward turkey after the earthquake all have reiterated this view many eu members also have expressed willingness to name turkey candidate for membership at the eu summit in helsinki this december some eu members had questioned turkeys eligibility for candidacy and membership primarily because of because of its poor human rights record greece the quake could prove to be major step on the improving path of greek turkish relations greek foreign minister george papandreou and his turkish counterpart ismail cem consulted regularly on humanitarian issues during the kosovo conflict earlier in 1999 in july their representatives began talks on five issues of mutual interest tourism environment culture security and trade excluding the more sensitive cyprus and aegean sovereignty issues papandreou was the first foreign official to offer aid to turkey in the aftermath of the earthquake and his government immediately provided search and rescue teams and medical and other assistance greek citizens also gave generously the leading eu countries had been pressing greece to lift its veto of financial protocol that had been promised to turkey as part of turkisheu customs union accord in march 1995 those differences may have been superseded by events despite its longstanding grievances against turkey greece advocated major eu outlay of humanitarian aid for quakedevastated turkey and lifted its veto of some other previously slated financial assistance when severe earthquake struck athens on september 7 turkey responded rapidly hconres 188 introduced on september 22 commends greece and turkey for putting aside their differences in responses to the earthquakes improving relations with turkey remains controversial in greece however some politicians contend that the veto policy has outlived its usefulness while others demand more substantial return from turkey in exchange for lifting vetoes greece has said that it will agree to the eus naming turkey candidate for membership but it will insist that the eu retain conditions for membership concerning respect for borders cyprus settlement and human rights others nearby countries that have had troubled relations with turkey also made notable donations armenia which lacks diplomatic ties to turkey and syria both sent medicine and other supplies the united nations approved an iraqi request to sell 10 million in oil and donate the proceeds to turkey 15 see crs report 98633 israeliturkish relations july 17 1998 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20328
