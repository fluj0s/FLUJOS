historical security logs and reports and spoke to all his staff in the radio room concerning officer 1s assertion that she had reported the ph one calls to the security radio room but found informatio n that such report had been received he added t hat had he been apprised of her complaint he would hav immediately issued her new mobile phone number 15 70 idoios also interviewed senior official 2 and offi cial 6 with regard to officer 1s allegation that official 1 advised her and official 3 that senior official 2 and official 6 were collaborating with the israeli authorities n either was

allegation d alleged interference by official 1 with the admi nistration and processing of officer 1s sick leave 71 officer 1 alleged that official 1 interfered with t he administration and processing

efficiently processed c that official 1 negligently exposed her confidentia l medical information to other staff members during her sick leave from september 2004 d that official 1 prevented the sanctioning of her dical evacuation from gaza investigative details 72 idoios interviewed all the witnesses named by offi cer 1 who she said had been involved in the processing and administration of he r sick leave 73 while there was some delay in the processing and ad ministration of officer 1s sick forms and medical reports this was due to tempor ary oversight on the part of official 3 and logistical problems in the transmission of the reports from gaza to unrwas international personnel section in amman jordan c ompounded by the prevailing security situation in gaza 74 official 1 said that he was abroad when officer 1 w ent on sick leave and he learned of her sickness and hospitalization from official 3 while he was attending meeting in israel he then asked staff member 4 because he was an ass ociate and friend of officer 1 to take care of her while she was hospitalized in isra evidence was found that official 1 or official 3 maliciously questioned the validity of officer 1s illness there was evidence that official 1 delayed the processing of her medical records 75 official 1 said that he forwarded sick leave form to the gaza field administration office which was the proper procedure for handling such forms and it was sent to the appropriate person in the normal course of business evidence was found to support the allegation that official 1 exposed officer 1s medical information to others in negligent manner 76 idoios found evidence to indicate that official 1 prevented the sanctioning of officer 1s medical evacuation officer 3 was inte rviewed and advised that he is ultimately responsible for the approval and sanctio ning of medical evacuation procedures for unrwa staff members but noted that some staff members may be unfamiliar with the medical evacuation procedures officer 3 state d that medical evacuation is generally 16 authorised if there are inadequate or ineffective s pecialist medical facilities in the locality but that israel has comprehensive and excellent med ical facilities he added that he never received any request from officer 1 asking to be dically evacuated to france instead she left gaza whilst on sick leave and travelled to france without his approval he advised that officer 1 had technically abandoned he r post and had not adhered to stipulated medical evacuation procedures nonethel ess she was not counselled or disciplined in this respect and continued to be pai d during this period and beyond 77 number of serving and former unrwa staff members have commented on the fact that officer 1 appeared to be suffering from stress several witnesses reported that officer 1 was of temperamental disposition and hi ghly strung by nature it was also observed by idoios when interviewing various parti that she had demanding workload in the stressful and at times frightening gaza security environment vi findings 78 in cases of this nature it is customary to judge t he credibility of the complainant the subject and the witnesses officer 1s allegations to idoios are specific and far ranging many of those interviewed stated that the felt she had emotional problems and was immature in the handling of her work and the curity situation in gaza although officer 1 claimed that witnesses would be intimidat ed by official 1 and not tell the truth idoios concluded that the witnesses had not been i ntimidated and were credible while many of officer 1s allegations could be resolved b ased on the testimony of witnesses charges of sexual harassment are difficult to rebut or substantiate because of the frequently private nature of this type of misconduc t while many of those interviewed said that officer 1 would have told them of her sex ual harassment or that they would have noticed it idoios notes that sexual harassment of ten takes place behind closed doors and the victim is frequently reluctant to disclose her suffering to others this is when the credibility issue is most important alleged sexual harassment by official 1 79 during this investigation idoios interviewed all members of staff in officer 1s office and official 1s own office interviews were also held with serving and former unrwa personnel officer 1 also provided list of witne sses to idoios and claimed that they would verify her allegation of official 1s sexual harassment and her workplace distress and they were interviewed 80 witness 1 confirmed that officer 1 had told her of the alleged incidents of harassment while she did not observe them she lived in new rk they had frequent phone conversations during the period of the alleged inci dents and witness 1 learned of them soon after their occurrences as very close frie nd for number of years she stated that she found officer 1s accounts of the alleged haras sment credible and commented on the dramatic change in demeanour and personality during her tenure at unrwa 81 witness 2 also stated that officer 1 had told him f the alleged incidents of harassment and observed her demeanour and behaviour change dur ing the time of the alleged incidents he too found her accounts credible 17 82 witness 3 stated that officer 1 told her of the all eged harassment in early 2004 before she had filed her complaint furthermore witness 3 wi tnessed the anonymous telephone calls and officer 1s change in demeanour and behav iour based on her previous work experience she found officer 1s allegations cred ible 83 as previously noted the identities of those placin g the phone calls could not be established by unrwa or idoios just prior to fil ing her complaint against official 1 with the secretarygeneral officer 1 met with offi cial 4 and she related the incidents to him it is noteworthy that specific details such as the request that she taste official 1s sperm were reported by all these witness except fo r witness 2 84 none of the other interviewees including those nam ed by officer 1 could corroborate her allegations nor attest to the existence of an environment of sexual or other form of harassment the evidence does not support findin g that official 1 or anyone else had intimidated any witnesses or suppressed their provi sion of evidence to idoios 85 when interviewed official 1 vehemently denied the allegations of sexual harassment he stated that when he learned that officer 1 was dvising and portraying to other staff members that she was supported by him and had his c ounsel and was also suggesting that they were involved in relationship he distanced himself and minimised interaction with her he instructed official 3 to assume further pervision of her he also instructed his secretarial staff to keep his door open at all time s when she was in his office official 3 and the secretarial staff corroborated official 1s actions and instructions 86 officer 1 provided idoios with the two recordings of telephone conversation she had with official 1 2 she claimed that during the conversation officia l 1 admitted having made rude and sexually explicit remarks towards her acknowledged having made sexual advances towards her and admitted watching her wit h binoculars from his apartment home however the recordings are of poor quality and qualified audio forensic technician retained by idoios was unable to enhanc the quality 87 the recordings were in french an idoios investig ator fluent in french listened to them but only officer 1s side of the conversation was audible the conversation appeared to be amicable and officer 1 spoke of her medical and health problems references to the subjects she claimed were discuss ed were heard 88 in one interview with idoios officer 1 stated tha t official 1 was in relationship with staff member 2 who felt compelled to remain in the relationship as result of fear and his position of influence within the workplace ho wever staff member 2 was interviewed by idoios and refuted officer 1s alle gations in their entirety based on her interview and those of others idoios conclude d that the relationship was consensual 89 officer 1s witnesses corroborated what she had tol d them of her allegations of sexual harassment only witness 1 was told of the earlier incidents contemporaneously however based on the consistency and specificity f some of officer 1s statements to 2 at her last meeting with idoios investigators i n december 2005 officer 1 stated that she had give n another recording to the investigators the investigators told her that she had only given them two sound rec ordings and noted that this was the first time there had ev been mention of further recording as of the time this report was issued officer 1 has not provided idoi with any further recordings 18 witness 1 witness 3 and official 4 the evidence t ends to support officer 1s allegations of sexual harassment by official 1 b alleged general harassment and abuse of authorit by official 1 90 officer 1 alleged that official 1 sought to deliber ately isolate ridicule embarrass and harass her within the workplace and elsewhere 91 witness 1 and witness 3 stated that officer 1 told them of how she was harassed in the workplace witness 2 stated that he noticed that t point in time official 1 ceased to consult her as he had previously however none of the other numerous witnesses interviewed supported officer 1s allegations that she had been harassed or abused within the workplace nor that she had been ridiculed by fficial 1 or anyone else either within or outside the working environment 92 officer 1 also claimed that official 1 allegedly ac cused her of improperly using an unrwa staff vehicle idoios established that offi cial 1 had legitimately requested check to be made on officer 1s use of the vehicle and this was common practice to ensure procedural compliance although officer 1 h ad violated procedures in this incident action was taken with regard to her fa iling to report her use of the vehicle to the fleet management unit here officer 1 was not singled out or discriminated against and official 1s original request that the vehicle usage be checked was appropriate 93 officer 1 alleged that official 1 attempted to coer ce and harass her into overturning the decision she and official 3 had made with regard to the recruitment and selection of an applicant corroborative evidence was found to indicate that official 1 had done so it was learned that official 1 had the authority to override the committees recommendations which he did not 94 there is evidence that official 1 and official 3 d their secretarial staff call officer 1 to remind her of meetings because she was frequently late official 3 noted this issue on her december 2003 performance evaluation report wh ich she accepted officer 1s assertion that official 1s secretarial staff check ed her attendance at meeting with representative of the company was not verified by t he secretarial staff or the representative 95 idoios also established that official 1 supported the applications for an upgrade made by officer 1 and her assistant despite her asserti ons to the contrary officer 1 did not receive the upgrade because the post was not availa ble and the assistants application although supported by official 1 was rejected by u nrwas human resources committee on bona fide grounds 96 the withholding of the salary of officer 1s consul tant was caused by contractual and audit issues 97 idoios found evidence to suggest that official 1 prevented her from taking appropriate training courses 98 the evidence does not indicate that official 1 inte rfered in officer 1s employment applications with agencies outside unrwa official 1 strongly supported officer 1s 19 application for the ictr position for which she th anked him by email for his advice and support but ictr did not consider her to have the requisite experience 99 official 1 told idoios that he had not been aware of officer 1s application for position with unami unami determined that she did not have the experience for the p4 and p5 positions but offered her the p3 positio n which she rejected because it required deployment to iraq condition she was aw are of when applying for the post 100 the weight of the evidence does not support the legations that official 1 discriminated against or harassed her at the workpl ace or in connection with work there was evidence that official 1 negatively interfer ed with her employment applications c alleged monitoring of computer systems threat t life and instances of alleged collaboration 101 officer 1 alleged that official 1 had told palest inian unrwa staff member that officer 1 was collaborating with the israeli author ities and therefore arranged to have her computer monitored she further alleged that the p alestinian community may have learned of this false information which placed her at risk official 1 had the authority to officially request the monitoring of information sy stems in accordance with applicable guidelines which require review by the unrwa legal advisor and approval by the commissioner general idoios found evidence th at official 1 has ever made monitoring request concerning any unrwa staff membe r moreover there is evidence that he caused or requested any staff memb er working in unrwas information system office to do so on covert basi s 102 officer 1 based her allegation on conversation sh had with staff member 6 but when interviewed by idoios he contradicted office r 1s account in its entirety he further denied that he told staff member 5 and offi cer 1 that their computers were being monitored when interviewed staff member 5 also d id not corroborate officer 1s account staff member 5 further told idoios that staff member 6 had never suggested that officer 1s computer was being monitored nor did he state that he had been told that officer 1 was passing confidential information to t he israeli authorities the evidence adduced does not support this allegation 103 officer 1 asserted that because staff member 6 and staff member 5 are both from the same country they may have deliberately or inadver tently alerted others from the same country of her alleged collaboration with the israe li authorities and hence she received anonymous phone calls and text messages and her apa rtment was fired upon which she believes endangered her life 104 however the evidence does not corroborate link b etween the alleged monitoring of her computer and the anonymous phone calls text ssages or the bullet hole in her apartment in the first instance staff member 6 s pecifically denies that he advised her that she was allegedly passing confidential informa tion to the israeli authorities in relation to the bullet hole there was high incid ence of firearm situation reports in that area as confirmed by staff member 1 and by the ap artment building security guards it appears very likely that officer 1s apartment was struck by accident additionally officer 1 had not resided in the apartment for seve ral weeks further suggesting that the bullet fired into her apartment was accidental fu rthermore whilst officer 1 had received 20 threatening text message there is evidence to suggest that any militia groups or other persons have sought to target her 105 officer 1s allegations are not substantiated in l ight of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary the multiple calls and text messages which were witnessed in at least one instance could not be traced to official 1 or anyo ne in unrwa none of the text messages she received were life threatening other t he one previously mentioned there is evidence to suggest that official 1 wished to or did cause officer 1s security or safety to be compromised or harmed d alleged interference by official 1 with the admi nistration and processing of officer 1s sick leave 106 officer 1 alleged that her medical records had been exposed to staff and that official 1 had caused intentional delays in the administrati on and processing of her sick leave official 1 said that he did forward sick form to the gaza field administration office that was the proper procedure for handling such for ms and they were sent to the appropriate person in the normal course of business however there is evidence of some delay in the processing of her medical records due to temporary oversight on the part of official 3 and logistical problems in the transmiss ion of medicalsick reports from gaza to unrwas international personnel section in amman jordan these slippages were accentuated by the prevailing security situation in gaza 107 officer 1 was treated in israel and then on her ow n initiative travelled to another country for further medical treatment while offic er 3 was responsible for approving the medical evacuation of unrwa staff officer 1 did t make such request to him officer 3 stated that medical evacuation is general ly authorised if there are inadequate or ineffective specialist medical facilities in the cality but that israel has comprehensive and excellent medical facilities 108 the evidence adduced does not support the allegatio n that official 1 interfered in the processing and administration of officer 1s sick l eave in fact she received all the benefits available to staff members on sick leave vii conclusions 109 the evidence adduced by idoios tends to support finding that officer 1 was sexually harassed by official 1 based on the corro boration of witness 1 witness 3 witness 2 and official 4 the corroboration was t hat officer 1 had told them of various incidents with specificity however the evidence adduced by idoios does not support finding that official 1 engaged in workplace hara ssment 110 officer 1 told idoios that official 1 would cause witnesses to withhold and suppress their evidence ultimately to her disadvan tage throughout this investigation idoios has found evidence to suggest that offic ial 1 or anyone else intimidated witnesses or unduly interfered in the investigation process it is troubling however that although official 4 learned of officer 1s complain ts on 25 september 2004 he ignored them until he prepared his memorandum of 3 december 2004 21 111 number of witnesses and close associates commente d that officer 1 was immature possessed heavy workload in demanding job wish ed to be married leave gaza and be extracted from the tense and threatening security nvironment within the area they suggested that these factors as described in this report may have contributed to her level of stress it does appear that environmental stres s has played significant role in this case and that officer 1 did suffer emotional stresses wh ich likely contributed to her feelings and allegations perhaps if this stress effect had been identified earlier many of the subsequent problems could have been avoided 112 from the outset officer 1 advised that she would refuse to accept any investigation outcome which did not substantiate all of her alleg ations she also stated that if the findings of the investigation were not in her favou r she would conclude that her due process rights had been violated and that idoios h ad not acted in her best interests viii recommendations 113 in view of the fact that official 1 has retired fro m unrwa idoios makes recommendation as to him but if he was still with the organization we would recommend counseling in view of the preceding find ings idoios makes the following recommendations recommendation 1 as noted the lack of action by official 4 and his advice to unrwa exacerbated this situation it is recommended that unrwa remind its staff members of policies in respect of sexual harassment harassmen t and discrimination and appoint respective workplace focal points id rec iv 0509801 recommendation 2 it is recommended that all appointed focal points receive appropriate training id rec iv0509802 recommendation 3 it is recommended that unrwa develop program of occupational stress management id rec iv0509803 recommendation 4 in light of the problems communicating with offi cer 1 during her sick leave it is recommended that unrwa ensure that n ominated person acts as focal point during the anticipated lengthy sickness absence of any staff member id rec iv0509804
