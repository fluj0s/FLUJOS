from william bee sent 27 february 2007 1635 to drc cardiff and bangor subject fw recent cehr letter dear all neil wooding has circulated an email with his response below to the od letter from trevor and nicola he sees more ambiguity than i do in the letter and remains optimistic about getting positive outcome doubt we will want to discuss the reasons for his optimism as well as responding with suggestions for how we can make positive case for wales and scotland to the central to the cehr when we see him on 9th march the first chance we will have to question anyone about the od will be at fridays assimilation meeting however the representative from the transition team at the meeting heather daley is solely concerned with the transition to the cehr we should remember that she is in way responsible for the content of the letter nor the decision it represents while i think it is entirely fair to show her the depth of concern there is about the apparent down grading of the wales office and the practical implications this has for the assimilation process i suggest that we also need to recognize the position she is in she can in way alter the proposed od other than point out to trevor and nicola the concerns in wales and doubt in scotland where i expect colleagues are raising the issues as i write i had drafted letter which i hoped chris kate and i might jointly send to gwenda thomas chair of the assembly equal opps cttee alerting her to the proposed status or lack of of the wales and scotland offices in the cehr for differing reasons both chris and kate feel that such course of action is premature i am not prepared to send such note from alone as i think this could reflect badly on the drc in the cehr it has to be acknowledged that in the run up to the elections the political atmosphere is getting more tense and the issue of cehr might be exploited for party political gain rather than attempting to bring about resolution to the problem some of you have asked whether the letter from trevor and nicola is confidential nothing in the letter says that this is the case and the fact that it has been sent to all staff of all commissions means that any attempt to retain confidentiality will almost certainly be doomed to failure i think that if you are asked about od issues by people outside the drc you can give factual answer about the proposals set out in the letter i have certainly felt able to brief rhian davies at disability wales about the proposals as they relate to wales i will keep you up to date with further developments will
