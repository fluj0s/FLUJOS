withdrew from the optional protocol the president thereafter issued memorandum instructing state courts to give effect to the icjs decision in avena with respect to the 51 mexican nationals at issue in that case10 in the 2006 case of sanchezllamas v oregon 11 the supreme court found that even assuming that article 36 created an individually enforceable right for detained foreign nationals 1 suppression of evid ence in criminal proceeding is never an appropriate remedy for an ar ticle 36 violation and 2 federal and state procedural default rules prevent the raising of article 36 claims that were not made on timely basis although the court considered th icjs interpretati on of article 36 as deserving respectful consideration it did not deem it to be legally binding or necessarily persuasive because the sanchezllamas case did not involve individuals named in the avena decision the supreme courts ruling addressed neither the domestic effect of the icj judgment instructing the united states review of the state criminal convictions of certain mexican nationals nor the legal weight of the presidents memorandum instructing st ate courts to comply with the avena judgment ernesto medellín who had been convicted and sentenced in texas state court for murder was one of the xican nationals named in the avena decision in 2004 the supreme court granted certiorari in the case of medellín v dretke 12 in which medellín argued among other things that his conviction by texas court should be reconsidered in light of the icjs ruling despite such reconsideration being barred by texass procedural default rules prior to the supreme court reaching decision on this issue president bush issued the memorandum instructing state courts to give effect to the avena decision the court subsequently dismissed its writ of certiorari in medellín as improvidently granted as it was longer clear that medellín had exhausted his remedies at the texas state level in light of the presidents memorandum13 on november 15 2006 the texas criminal court of appeals held that neither avena nor the presidents memorandum preempted state procedural default rules and it rejected medellins petition for habeas relief14 the supreme court thereafter granted certiorari to review the texas courts judgment issues decided in medellín the court granted certiorari in medellín to address two

the 51 mexican nationals named in avena without regard to state procedural default rules15 domestic legal effect of the icjs judgment in avena the court first examined whether the icjs judgment in avena constituted binding domestic law medellín argued that treaties requiring compliance with the avena judgment namely the optional protocol icj statute and charter constituted the law of the land under the supremacy clause thereby preempting contrary state procedural default rules that otherwise barred reexamination of medellins habeas petition the court began its analysis by acknowle dging that the optional protocol icj statute and charter im posed upon the united states an international law obligation to comply with the icjs judgment in avena 16 however the court went on to explain that it had long recognized the distinction between those treaties that while they constitute international law commitments do not themselves function as binding federal law enforceable by us courts17 here the court distinguished between the domestic legal eff ect of two categories of treaties those that are selfexecuting and those that ar nonselfexecuting the court defined selfexecuting treaty as having automa tic domestic effect as federal law upon ratification18 nonselfexecuting treaty in cont rast does not by itself give rise to domestically enforceable federal law whether such treaty has domestic effect depends upon implementing legisl ation passed by congress19 further even when treaties are considered selfexecuting in the sense that they create federal law the background presumption is that internat ional agreements even those directly benefitting private persons generally do not create private rights or provide for private cause of acti on in domestic courts20 the court held that the avena judgment did not constitute automatically enforceable domestic law because none of its underlying treaty sources ie the optional protocol the icj statute or th charter created binding domestic law in the absence of implementing legi slation and such legislation had been enacted by congress in assessing whether these treaty sources were selfexecuting the court first looked to the relevant tr eaty text in order to determine whether each treatys terms reflected determination by the president who negotiated it and the senate that confirmed it that the treaty has domestic effect21 though the court stated that treaty interpretation like statut ory interpretation begins with its text it also acknowledged th at nontextual resources including the negotiating and draftinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34450crs5 22 id at 11 23 id 24 id 25 id 26 id italics in original 27 medellín 2008 wl 762533 at 12 28 id at 13 29 icj statute art 59history of the treaty and the postratification unders tanding of treaty parties could also serve as aids to its interpretation22 turning first to the optional protocol the court concluded that the most natural reading of the optional protocol is as bare grant of jurisdiction to the icj to hear disputes between vccr parties23 according to the court submitting to jurisdiction and agreeing to be bound are two different things24 the optional protocol was silent on the effect of an ic j judgment and did not directly compel case parties to comply with icj decisions the court found that any obligation to co mply with an icj judgment derived not from the optional protocol but from article 94 of the charter which describes the effect of icj decisions although article 941 provides that parties to icj cases shall undertake to comply with its d ecisions the court did not interpret this language as directive to domestic courts25 instead this provision was deemed to impose commitment on the part of members to take future action through their political branches to comply with an icj decision26 the court found support for this interpretation in the language of article 942 which provides that the sole remedy for noncompliance with an icj deci sion is referral of the matter to the security council which must determine whether to take action to effectuate the judgment further as the president and the senate were undoubtedly aware in subscribing to the charter and optional protocol the united states retained the unqualified right to exercise its veto over any security council resolution27 according to the court interpreting icj judgments as automatically enforceable domestic law would eliminate the option of noncompliance with icj decisions contemplated under article 942 additionally the court found nothing in the text of the icj statute to suggest that the avena judgment constituted automatically enforceable domestic law which could be relied upon by medellín28 the icj statute provide s that icj decisions have binding force except between the parties29 and only nations not individuals may be parties in cases before the icj the court reasoned that an individual like medellín could not be considered party to the avena decision and therefore could not rely on its judgment the court also found support for its inte rpretation of the nonselfexecuting nature of the relevant treaties when it considered nontextual aids to treatyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34450crs6 30 medellín 2008 wl 762533 at 13 31 id at 15 32 id 33 id at 17 34 medellín 2008 wl 762533 at 17 35 id 36 id 37 id at 18 38 id at

the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable law30 the court further stated that its conclusion that avena did not constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the pos tratification understandi ng of other signatories to the optional protocol according to the court neither petitioner nor his amici identified single country that treated icj judgments as automatically binding upon its domestic courts31 the court also stated that its conc lusion was supported by general principles of interpretation including the rule that ab sent clear and express statement to the contrary the procedural rules of the foru m state govern the implementation of the treaty in that state32 finally the court made clear that its hol ding was not intended to suggest that treaties can never afford binding domestic ffect to internationa l tribunal judgments only that the charter the optiona l protocol and the icj statute do not do so33 the court agreed with petitioner that in some cases an international agreement to abide by the result of an international adjudication may be selfexecuting34 whether treaties underlying ot her judgments are selfexecu ting so as to permit direct enforcement of these judgments by us courts is matter for this court to decide35 the court also stressed that its holding did not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments or international arbitral agreements by us courts36 further the court acknowledged even international adjudications based on nonselfexecuting agreements c onstitute international obligations and congress may enact implementing legislation to give them domestic effect37 writing in concurrence justice stevens found great deal of wisdom in the dissenting opinion including its claim tha t the text and history of the supremacy clause as well as this courts treaty related cases do not support presumption against selfexecution38 nonetheless justice stevens agreed with the majority that the relevant treaties did not authorize the court to enforce the icjs judgment in avena like the majority justice stevens interpreted the charters requirement that parties undertake to comply with icj decisions as leaving the choice of compliance to the political rather than judicial department of government39 justice stevens also emphasized that the avena decision while not directly enforceable by us courts

appendix b 45 id at 35 46 id at 34federal government and each of the us states justice stevens claimed that texass duty to comply with the avena judgment is all the greater since it was texas that by failing to provide consular notice in accordance with the vienna convention ensnared the united states in the current controversy40 justice stevens urged texas take appropriate action to ensure that it w ould not cause the united states to default upon its obligation under internati onal law to comply with the avena decision41 in dissent justice breyer joined by ju stices ginsburg and souter argued that the many treatyrelated cases interpre ting the supremacy clauseincluding some written by justices well aware of the founders original intent lead to the conclusion that the icj judgment before us is enfo rceable as matter of domestic law without further legislation42 the dissent discussed several instances in which the court had previously concluded that treaty was selfexecuting even in the absence of clear textual language on the point the dissent argued that the majoritys emphasis on treatys text when assessing provision s selfexecuting nature was misplaced and erects legalistic hurdles that can threaten the application of provisions in many existing commercial and other treaties and make it more difficult to negotiate new ones43 in an appendix justice breyer lis ted 70 treaties containing icj dispute settlement provisions similar to that contained in the optional protocol as examples of agreements that had their domestic legal effect potentially called into question by the majoritys decision 44 the dissent argued that established supreme court jurisprudence suggested practical contextspecific criteria for determining whether particular treaty or treaty provision is selfexecuting with treaty provisions subject matter having particular importance45 factors to be considered in determining whether treaty provision is directly enforceable by us court include whether the treaty provision confers specific detailed individual legal rights whether it establishes definite standards that judges can readily enforce whether direct judicial enforcement would require the courts to create new cause of actionand whether direct enforcement by us courts would create constitutiona lly undesirable conflic t with the other branches46 considering these factors the dissent concluded that the relevant treaty provisions underlying the avena judgment were selfexecuting and the judgment should therefore be directly enforceable by us courts legal effect of the

support of the legal validity of the presidents memorandum first it argued that releva nt treaties ratified by the united states following the approval of th senate gave the president the authority to implement the avena judgment and that congress had acquiesced to the exercise of such authority secondly the government argu ed that the president possessed independent power to resolve international disputes wholly apart from any authority derived from relevant treaties the court acknowledged that the presidents constitutional role uniquely qualifies him to resolve the sensitive foreign policy decisions and f ound that the memorandum sought to vindicate plainly co mpelling interests including ensuring reciprocal observance of the vccr preserving foreign relations and demonstrating us commitment to the role of international law47 nonetheless the court found that these interests do not allow us to set aside first principles which establish that the presidential authority to act is derived from either an act of congress or the constitution itself48 the court analyzed the presidents action using the tripartite framework established by justice jacksons concurring opinion in youngstown sheet tube v sawyer 49 first when the president acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of congress his powers are at their maximum for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that congress can delegate50 second when the president acts in absence of either congressional grant or denial of authority he can rely only on his own independent powers but there is zone of twilight in which he and congress may have c oncurrent authority or in which its distribution is uncertain51 in these circumstances congressional inertia indifference or quiescence mayinvite measures of independent pres idential responsib ility52 finally when the president takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of congress his power is at it s lowest ebb for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus an constitutional powers of congress over the matter53 in support of the legal validity of th presidents memorandum the government argued that the optional protocol and charter create an obligation to comply with avena and implicitly give the president authority to implement thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34450crs9 54 medellín 2008

us 203 1942 united st ates v belmont 301 us 324 1937treatybased obligation54 the government argued that the memorandum fell under the first category of the youngstown framework because the presidents action was impliedly authorized by congress pursuant to senate approval of treaties creating an obligation to comply with the avena judgment the court disagreed having already concluded that neither the optional protocol nor the charter were self executing the court held that the res ponsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from nonselfexecu ting treaty into domestic law falls to congress55 the court described nonselfe xecuting treaty as one that by definitionwas ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force56 this understanding the court reasoned means that when the president asserts the power to enforce nonselfexecuting treaty by unilaterally creating domestic law he acts in conflict with the implicit understanding of the ratifying senate57 accordingly the court found that the presidents memorandum fell within the third category of justice jacksons youngstown framework because the presidents action was contrary to the express or implied will of congress58 the court also disagreed with the governments argument that the presidents memorandum s hould be given effect as domestic law in light of congressional acquiescence to such executive action as preliminary matter the court recognized congressional acquiescence as pertinent only when the presidents action falls under the second category of the youngstown framework ie in situations where the president acts in the absence of congressional grant or denial of authority having already determined that the presidents attempt to enforce the avena judgment fell within the third category of the youngstown framework the court deemed congressional acquiescence to be irrelevant to its legal analysis59 further the court stated that even if we were persuaded that congressional acquiescence could support the presidents sserted authority to create domestic law pursuant to nonselfexecuting treaty such acquiescence does not exist here60 next the court addressed the governme nts argument that independent of united states treaty obligations the morandum was valid exercise of the presidents power to resolve international disputes with foreign nations in support of this position the government relied on series of supreme court decisions upholding the presidents authority to settle foreign claims pursuant to executive agreement61 the court characterized these cases as standing for the proposition that if pervasive enough history of congressional acquiescence can be treated ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34450crs10 62 id internal

private claims between us citizens and foreign nationals or governments which was supported by particularly longstanding practice of congressional acquiescence63 in contrast the court characterized the presidents memorandum ordering st ate courts to comply with the avena judgment as an unpreceden ted actionthat r eaches deep into the heart of the states police powers and compels state courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state laws the court concluded that the presidents narrow and strictly limited authority to settle foreign claimsca nnot stretch so far as to support the current presidential memorandum64 the court also briefly considered an ar gument raised by medellín but not the united states that the presidents morandum was valid exercise of his constitutional power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed65 the court rejected this argument because the take care clause pe rmits the president to execute laws not make them and the court had concluded that the avena decision was not domestic law66 the court emphasized that it had not held that the combination of nonselfexecuting treaty and the lack of implementing legislation precludes the president from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation67 though the president could not rely on the power of nonselfexecuting treaty to establish legallybinding rules preempting contrary state law the president could still enforce nonselfexecuting treatys obligations usin g some other means so long as they are consistent with the constitution68 in his concurring opinion justice steven s agreed with the majority that the presidents memorandum did not constitute binding law69 because the dissenting justices would have held the relevant treaties selfexecuting and the avena decision directly enforceable as domestic law they decided not to attempt to resolve the question of whether the presidents memo randum constituted enfo rceable federal law preempting
