the 1995 dayton peace accords brokered primarily by the united states ended the war in bosnia which had cost hundreds of thousands of lives and created over 2 million refugees and displaced persons the dayton peace accords also set up bosnias current political structure of two semiautonomous ethnicallybased entities and relatively weak central government it resulted in the deployment of natoled peacekeeping force which was charged with providing secure environment for the implementation of the peace agreement in december 2004 european union force took over peacekeeping duties from nato appointed high representative created by the dayton accords oversees the civilian implementation efforts in the more than nine years since the accords the united states and other countries have scored significant achievements in bosnia including sharply reduced interethnic violence restored freedom of movement and the return of many refugees and displaced persons to their homes the international community has also helped bosnia hold largely free and fair elections and set up many of the institutions of modern democratic state however these individual successes have not added up to the accomplishment of the overall goal of international efforts in bosnia the creation of stable united bosnia able to continue reforms on its own and integrate into euroatlantic institutions almost all progress on reforms and on promoting greater unity in bosnia continues to require direct or indirect intervention by representatives of the international community reform efforts continue to be met by obstructionism or passivity by the nationalist parties that control bosnian governments at all levels some observers also assert that the cumbersome governing institutions set up by the dayton peace accords are unworkable supporters of international activism in bosnia say that the only way to move forward is to continue to impose reforms when necessary and that when these reforms reach critical mass they will become selfsustaining according to critics of current international policy on bosnia international interventionism has led to dependency and irresponsibility among local elites this problem is all the more serious as the international commitment to bosnia in troops and funding has decreased in recent years another important issue is whether bosnia is still important to us interests some say that pressing us commitments in other countries and regions argue for transferring full responsibility for bosnia to european countries others believe that the united states still has stake in bosnias stability as part of building europe whole and free the overarching us objective in the region they say continued us involvement in bosnia may be needed to arrest indicted war criminals as well as to make sure that bosnia is not used as haven for organized crime or terrorists the 109th congress will likely be involved in such issues as appropriating foreign aid for bosnia

list of figures figure 1 map of bosnia and herzegovina 2 bosnia and herzegovina issues for us policy introduction the 1995 dayton peace accords brokered primarily by the united states ended three years of war in bosnia and herzegovina which had cost hundreds of thousands of lives and created over 2 million refugees and displaced persons under the dayton peace accords bosniaherzegovina remains an internationally recognized state within its prewar borders internally it consists of two semi autonomous entities the largely bosniak and croat federation of bosnia herzegovina and the bosnian serbdominated republika srpska rs under the accords the bosnian federation received roughly 51 of the territory of bosnia herzegovina while the republika srpska received about 49 each of the entities has its own parliament and government with wideranging powers as well as its own armed forces each entity may establish special parallel relationships with neighboring states consistent with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosniaherzegovina most powers are vested in the entities the central government has responsibility for foreign policy foreign trade and customs policy monetary policy and few other areas central government decisions are nominally taken by majority but any of the three main ethnic groups can block any decision if it views it as against its vital interests the federation is further divided into ten cantons each of which has control of policy in key areas such as policing and education the dayton peace accords also resulted in the deployment of natoled peacekeeping force which has been charged with providing secure environment for the implementation of the peace agreement unappointed high representative created by the dayton accords oversees the civilian peace implementation efforts since 1997 this official has had the power to fire and take other actions against local leaders and parties as well as to impose legislation in order to implement the peace agreement and more generally bring unity and reform to bosnia the current holder of this post is paddy ashdown of great britain ashdown also holds the post of the european unions special representative in bosnia1 1 the text of the dayton peace accords can be found at the website of the office of the high representative ohr httpwwwohrint for more background on bosnias history

in bosnia including sharply reduced interethnic violence restored freedom of movement and the return of many refugees and displaced persons to their homes the international community has also helped bosnia hold largely free and fair elections and set up many of the institutions of modern democratic state however these successes in some areas have not added up to the accomplishment of the overall goal of international efforts in bosnia the creation of stable united bosnia able to continue reforms on its own and integrate with euroatlantic institutions almost all progress on reforms and on promoting greater unity in bosnia continues to require direct or indirect intervention by ashdown and other representatives of the international community reform efforts continue to be met by obstructionism or passivity by the nationalist parties which control bosnian governments at all levels some observers also assert that the cumbersome institutions set up by the dayton peace accords are unworkable according to critics of current international policy on bosnia international interventionism has led to dependency and irresponsibility among local elites this problem is all the more serious as the international commitment to bosnia in troops and funding has decreased in recent years in addition the infringement of bosnias sovereignty represented by office of the high representative ohr may also prove to be an obstacle in the countrys path toward european integration according to crs3 some observers critics ask how country lacking all the attributes of sovereignty can hope to join nato or the eu one day or in the near term participate meaningfully in such programs as natos partnership for peace program they wonder if bosnia can or should continue to operate indefinitely as ward of the international community as the rest of the region moves however slowly in some cases toward european integration another important issue is whether bosnia is still important to us interests particularly given perhaps more pressing us commitments in other countries and regions the united states has invested substantial sums to stabilize bosnia from fy1991 through fy2004 the united states spent over 136 billion in incremental military costs in bosnia mainly for the us peacekeeping contingent2 us aid to bosnia over the same period amounted to more than 15 billion3 some observers believe that the european union is now capable of dealing with bosnias remaining problems on its own indeed the eu already provides the bulk of financial aid and political guidance to bosnia and took over the military mission there from nato in december 2004 however many observers believe that the united states still has stake in bosnias stability as part of building europe whole and free the overarching us objective in the region continued us involvement in bosnia may be needed to arrest indicted war criminals as well as to make sure that bosnia is not used as haven for organized crime or terrorists successes and remaining challenges bosnia has achieved progress on some issues since 1995 but continues to fall short in many others one relative success story has been the restoration of freedom of movement within bosnia and the gradual return of refugees to their homes according to the high commissioner for refugees unhcr by october 2004 over 1 million of the 22 million refugees and displaced persons had returned to their homes including over 447000 who returned to areas in which they are an ethnic minority over 92 percent of the legal claims of persons wanting to have their homes returned to them have been resolved4 while ethnic relations are sometimes tense and some acts of violence do occur the main obstacle to refugee returns is economic the war often had the effect of destroying local industries along with the jobs that made communities viable many returnees are elderly many young people want to leave bosnia for better opportunities elsewhere up to twothirds of them according to some polls5 at the 2 see crs issue brief ib94040 peacekeeping and related stability operations issues of us military involvement by nina serafino 3 us

ministry key focus of international efforts in bosnia is to strengthen the rule of law the rule of law is particularly important in order to break down the parallel structures connecting nationalist political parties certain enterprises and organized crime widespread corruption also retards economic development according to an opinion poll commissioned by transparency international bosnians view corruption as the second most serious problem the country faces after unemployment6 high representative ashdown has undertaken several steps to promote the rule of law in bosnia he pushed through new criminal code and criminal procedure code in 2003 and put into place high judicial and prosecutorial council hjpc which has vetted bosnias judges and prosecutors for integrity and professional competence with ethnic representation proportionate to the 1991 prewar bosnian census the hjpc is also responsible for disciplinary actions as well as for appointing new judges and prosecutors ashdown also forced the creation of the bosnian state court with special panels dealing with organized crime this court has both bosnian and international judges and prosecutors until january 2003 police training was conducted by police mission in bosnia the mission vetted policemen for their professional qualifications and participation in war crimes or illegal activity an eu police mission which replaced the mission is continuing the advisory and training functions of the mission ashdown successfully pushed for the establishment of new central government law enforcement institutions including ministry of justice ministry of security and state information and protection agency sipa charged with dealing with issues such as money laundering and organized crime as well as terrorism in december 2004 police restructuring commission composed of bosnian and international officials issued report calling for bosnian central government institutions to take over responsibility for all police matters ashdown has also called for the elimination of entity interior ministries such proposals if implemented would mark dramatic blow to the power of the entities within bosnia which had previously controlled most police functions and have been strongly resisted by bosnian serb leaders however it should be noted the implementation of these reforms has been slow these institutions often do not function effectively as they lack resources and sufficient staffing however there have been few successes in the area of rule of law courts in both entities have prosecuted several cases against organized crime figures in march 2004 the bosnian state court handed down guilty verdict in bosnias biggest human trafficking case another area key to bosnias future stability is economic reform and poverty reduction here again the situation is mixed the international monetary fund has praised bosnia for its success in establishing macroeconomic stability including low 6 bih corruption moderately dropping transparency international bih press release march 11 2004 crs5 inflation and stable currency due to currency board system that pegs the konvertibilna marka km to the euro international officials have pushed through laws to establish an indirect taxation authority and value added tax in bosnia rationalizing bosnias tax system is necessary in order to stimulate economic growth as well as to provide resources for bosnias underfunded central government institutions as well as to assist bosnias eu integration the international community is pressing bosnian leaders to cut back the size and expense of entity and lower level governments as the central governments rule is strengthened however severe economic problems remain bosnia is one of the poorest countries in europe with gross domestic product gdp about 60 of the prewar level about half of the population lives close to or below the poverty line7 according to some experts bosnias economy may be on the verge of crisis many of bosnias main prewar industries including military industries have collapsed and new businesses to replace these lost jobs have not materialized according to this view substantial part of the economy is dependent on government spending on oversized government bureaucracies in part legacy of the complicated government structures created by the dayton peace accords as well as residual international funding government spending accounts for over 50 of the countrys gdp8 efforts to stimulate the economy to produce jobs and foreign investment have only been partially successful ashdown established bulldozer committee composed of ohr officials and bosnian businessmen to develop specific proposals to cut through red tape and take other steps to improve the business climate in bosnia nevertheless bosnia still lacks many elements of suitable legal framework to encourage domestic and international investors moreover the privatization process which is in the hands of the entity governments remains slow and plagued by endemic administrative and legal shortcomings according to the international officials foreign direct investment fdi is increasing in part due to ashdowns efforts but from very low base fdi made up only 5 of gdp in 2003 one of the lowest percentages in the region 9 prospects for stability and selfsustaining reforms major concern for international policymakers is the longterm impact on bosnia of declining international attention and resources as noted above most of the modest reform successes in bosnia have been initiated and pushed forward by the international community international aid has played an important role in keeping the economy afloat the nationalist parties in power have often reacted passively on reform issues or even engaged in overt or covert obstructionism local leaders often concentrate on political maneuvering and securing resources for political patronage 7 usaid fy2005 budget justification to congress annex iii europe and eurasia 49 8 discussions with us and european balkan experts march 2004 9 european commission commission staff working paper bosnia and herzegovina stabilization and association agreement 2004 march 30 2004 crs6 efforts to promote bosnias unity through the strengthening of statelevel institutions have also met with indifference or opposition under international pressure new institutions have proliferated often without the funding or staffing to make them effective analysts have therefore expressed concern about the sustainability of bosnias reforms and the countrys longterm unity according to some analysts part of the problem is due to the shortcomings of the dayton constitution they say the governing structures set up by dayton are too complex with too many layers of government that are too expensive and not accountable to the people various proposals have been made for simplifying the structure including eliminating the entities to create unitary state or system of cantons within more conventional federation10 another problem is that while bosniaks overwhelmingly favor united bosnia serbs and to lesser extent croats do not for example state department sponsored opinion poll in the republika srpska rs in 2003 found that 69 favored rs independence from bosnia another poll from the same source found that former bosnian serb leader and indicted war criminal radovan karadzic is the most popular politician in the rs on the other hand 55 of bosnian serbs expect that notwithstanding their wishes bosnia will remain single state the poll found that 41 of bosnian croats favor remaining part of bosnia while 54 favor independence or union with croatia interestingly bosnian croat support for bosnia has sharply increased since 1999 at the same time as croatian governments have publicly renounced territorial claims on bosnia11 ashdown and previous high representatives have tried to exhort local leaders to take ownership of reforms without much success the international community also tried to influence the domestic political scene by helping nonnationalist parties win elections and form government coalitions however these efforts were not very successful due to the heterogeneity of the coalitions and the continued popularity of nationalist groups which successfully play on the fears of people and still have effective patronage networks after the victory of the three major nationalist parties in the october 2002 general elections ashdown has tried to work with the new nationalist leaders on reform issues but has also jumped into the middle of the bosnian political system himself campaigning under the slogan jobs and justice he has intervened actively in the making of laws and continues to fire and take other actions against obstructionist politicians and parties his moves have angered bosnian leaders at times but there has been little public protest against his actions indeed an october 2003 state departmentsponsored opinion poll indicated little public awareness of the jobs and justice program according to the same poll ashdown is supported 10 for one such proposal see european stability initiative making federalism work radical proposal for practical reform esi website httpwwwesiweborg 11 bosnian political mood hits postdayton low state department office of research september 22 2003 and bosniaks and bosnian croats support serbs oppose unified state state department office of research october 2 2003 crs7 by twothirds of bosniaks but is opposed by twothirds of bosnian croats and 94 of serbs12 bosnian critics of ashdown charge that he has neglected the nonnationalist opposition which could have been his natural allies now they charge he is at political deadend partnered with ruling nationalist elites with little interest in reform and an opposition too weak and disenchanted to serve as viable alternative13 ashdown has replied that he has had to work with whomever the bosnian people elect as their leaders some analysts support ashdowns actions saying that however paradoxical it may seem interventionism is needed in the short term to provide the basis for selfsustaining bosnia14 on the other hand other experts are concerned that local institutions cannot develop as long as ohr continues its active and some critics say undemocratic intervention in bosnian affairs they suggest that the development of responsible democratic local institutions should take priority and that ohrs use of its powers should be more limited and more accountable to the bosnian people15 possibly acting in the international communitys favor in the long run is the slowly increasing realization of bosnian politicians that it is in their own interest to promote bosnias integration into the european union the 2003 eu summit in thessaloniki greece held out the prospect of bosnia and other countries in the region joining the eu when they are ready the problem with possible eu membership as motivating factor is that it may be too distant to have as powerful an effect as it has had in central europe as of early 2005 bosnia continued to fall short in implementing the 16 measures set by an eu feasibility study before it can begin negotiations on stabilization and association agreement first step in the long road to eu membership bosnias central government has set goal of eu membership by 2009 although most observers view this goal as unrealistic at present what would be the impact of reduced international intervention in bosnias political system and decrease in economic assistance particularly if reforms are slowed as result it appears unlikely that the situation could explode into conflict again in the near future perhaps most importantly because the geopolitical situation in the region has changed bosnias civil war was in part the playing out of the designs of nationalist leaders in croatia and serbia on bosnian territory according to state department sponsored opinion poll about third to slightly less than one half of the three main ethnic groups believes that return to fighting could occur 12 bosnian views diverge on the international community state department office of research october 8 2003 13 mirsad

july 2003 6074 crs8 within the next few years only about onetenth are very concerned about such an outcome16 the downfall of nationalist regimes in serbia and croatia in 2000 reduced concerns about partition of bosnia as new democratic regimes in both countries put domestic reforms and improving relations with the west over past nationalist projects to redraw borders the comeback of the nationalist hdz party in croatia and nationalist forces in serbia in 2003 have caused some concern however the hdz government has shown interest in carving up bosnia again knowing that to do so would put an end to achieving its main foreign policy goal joining euroatlantic institutions similar views are held by leaders in serbia although some voices have raised the possibility of partition of bosnia if kosovo is permitted to become independent from serbia the serbian political scene remains unsettled and victory by the ultranationalist radical party in future elections could conceivably pose danger to bosnias future on the other hand even if poor disunited unreformed bosnia could be nominally stable it still might also present problems the weakness of its institutions could provide an environment conducive to organized crime activities such as trafficking in weapons drugs and persons as well as the operations of terrorist groups which could threaten us and european interests us policy issues sfor and partnership for peace due in part to the improving security situation in bosnia and the need to shift troops to the war on terrorism and other responsibilities the natoled sfor has undergone deep reductions in recent years in december 2004 the european union took over peacekeeping duties the eu force eufor of about 7000 troops uses natos planning capabilities and other assets under what is known as the berlin plus formula fewer than 200 us military personnel remain in bosnia as part of small nato contingent to assist bosnian defense reform search for indicted war criminals and fight terrorism it is unclear whether the eu successor force will have the credibility that sfor enjoyed partly due to the us presence bosniaks in particular have viewed the united states as their best ally among leading western nations dating back to the perceived us role in helping to put an end to the war by permitting the bosniaks to arm themselves in contrast european countries are viewed less favorably in part due to the perceived failures of the europeanled protection force unprofor during the war some observers claim that many european troops in kfor were much less effective than us troops during the march 2004 riots in 16 bosniaks and bosnian croats support serbs oppose unified state state department office of research october 2 2003 crs9 kosovo due at least in part to the restrictive rules of engagement they had received from their governments17 an important focus of us and international efforts in bosnia is to promote defense reforms that will permit bosnia to join natos partnership for peace pfp program bosnia and serbia and montenegro are the only two european countries that are not members of pfp sfor ohr and western governments have pressed bosnia to undertake defense reforms that will permit bosnia to be admitted as pfp member these reforms include the unification of bosnias two armies under single command structure including minister of defense and chief of staff the army would not be unified at lower levels however it would eventually comprise three 4000man brigades one brigade would be bosniak another would be serb and the third croat18 the supreme command of this force would be held by bosnias collective presidency which also is composed of one bosniak one serb and one croat the bosnian parliament has passed the legislation needed to create the new command structure it approved new defense minister in march 2004 after two previous bosnian serbnominated candidates for defense minister were rejected by ashdown due to their questionable conduct during the war reforms that are needed include staffing statelevel defense institutions with qualified personnel providing these institutions with adequate funding and premises and eliminating the entity defense ministries19 war crimes and cooperation with the icty the most important factor hindering bosnias membership in pfp and opening talks on stabilization and association agreement with the eu is bosnias lack of cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty an important focus of current us and international efforts in bosnia is to apprehend indicted war crimes suspects and transfer them to the icty particularly former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and former army chief ratko mladic the bosnian government and the two entity governments are required by the dayton peace agreement to fully cooperate with the icty according to icty chief prosecutor carla ponte the federation has largely cooperated with the icty but the rs has not rs officials have not arrested single war criminal indicted by the icty since the peace accords were signed20 indeed some of them have allegedly assisted indictees to evade capture therefore the transfer of war criminals thought to be hiding in the rs to the icty has been left almost entirely to voluntary surrenders of suspects as well as action by international peacekeepers and agents of western governments 17 discussion with serbian official may 2004 18 rferl february 5 2004 19 ohr website httpwwwohrint 20 however the rs government in november 2004 arrested eight bosnian serb war crimes suspects wanted by bosnian authorities crs10 the united states and its allies are motivated in their search for war criminals by desire for justice as well as belief that the arrest and transfer of these two men and other war criminals would deal serious blow to those forces obstructing reforms in bosnia according to press reports both mladic and karadzic move within bosnia and between bosnia and serbia and montenegro both eufor and the remaining nato presence in bosnia participate in developing intelligence for the possible seizure of war crimes suspects although the actual seizures themselves if they occurred would likely be carried out by speciallytrained teams based outside of bosnia high representative ashdown has tried to weaken the support network for the war criminals he has removed many rs officials from their posts including high ranking bosnian serb police officers and mirko sarovic senior official of the serbian democratic party formerly headed by karadzic and now ruling party in the republika srpska ashdown has frozen the assets of these and other persons suspected of helping war criminals as has the european union the united states has also added these people to list of persons who are barred entry into the united states and whose us assets are frozen in april 2004 ashdown blocked state funding to the nationalist serbian democratic party sds charging that the sds had helped to finance karadzics efforts to avoid arrest skeptics have noted that most sds funding does not come from the state but from stateowned firms run by sds supporters21 in december 2004 in further move to punish the republika srpska for its non compliance on war crimes issues ashdown removed nine bosnian serb officials of the state border service the intelligence and security service and the rs interior ministry ashdown also announced plans to abolish entity interior and defense ministries by fall 2005 leaving only central government ministries for these functions ashdown warned that he will take further steps against the assets and institutions of the rs if bosnian serb leaders continued to block bosnias pfp membership by failing to cooperation with the icty in taking such moves ashdown also may be using rs war crimes noncompliance to weaken the rs and the whole system of ethnicallybased entities set up by the dayton accords which some observers see as key stumbling block to reform and euroatlantic integration the united states also introduced measures in december 2004 to punish the rs for noncooperation with the icty freezing all sds assets in the united states and imposing visa ban on all members of the sds and the party for democratic progress pdp key member of the rs government number of high level bosnian serb leaders in the rs and the bosnian central government resigned their posts in protest the united states has offered 5 million reward to anyone providing information leading to the capture of karadzic or mladic ponte claimed that karadzic had narrowly escaped capture during an sfor raid in the bosnian serb city of pale in february 2004 subsequent sfor raids have failed to capture karadzic 21 institute for war and peace reporting iwpr balkan crisis report 492 april 16 2004 crs11 including raid in april 2004 that resulted in severe injuries to serbian orthodox priest and his international critics of sfor say that it has failed to develop much useful intelligence on the whereabouts of war criminals and does not coordinate sufficiently with the icty and other international organizations in bosnia22 in addition to pursuing karadzic and mladic the united states and the international community have promoted efforts to have war criminals tried by local courts this policy is part of the international completion strategy for the icty adopted in security council resolution 1503 in august 2003 the resolution calls for the icty to complete its investigations by 2004 its trials by 2008 and all appeals by 2010 in october 2003 international donors held conference on the establishment of war crimes chamber in the state court of bosnia and herzegovina the united states contributed 5 million and said it would contribute an additional 5 million in 2004 however it is unclear how effective the new court will be bosnian courts have tried few war crimes cases so far but have been criticized for long delays insufficient protection for witnesses and ethnic bias recognizing this fact the court will have international judges and prosecutors working with their bosnian counterparts for the first few years similar to bosnian courts currently charged with prosecuting highprofile organized crime cases however the court will have to depend on local police forces to assist its work domestic war crimes prosecutions will also depend on ashdowns efforts to improve bosnias judicial system including by dismissing corrupt and ineffective prosecutors and judges as well as imposing tougher criminal laws terrorism since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the main focus of us foreign policy has been the war on terrorism terrorism has also become an important focus of us policy toward bosnia which has been haven for qaeda and other terrorist groups although it has not played as important role in this regard as other european countries such as spain germany and britain one way in which bosnia is different from other countries in europe is the role of several thousand islamic fundamentalist fighters during the 19921995 war in bosnia most left bosnia at us insistence after the deployment of the natoled peacekeeping force in december 1995 however few stayed and became bosnian citizens by marrying bosnian women perhaps more troublesome have been qaeda ties among some islamic charities and humanitarian organizations that proliferated during and after the war qaeda used few of them for planning attacks in bosnia and elsewhere some qaeda operatives in bosnia reportedly have had connections to members of bosnias intelligence service another legacy of bosniak wartime cooperation with islamic militants in 2003 six former federation officials were investigated for their 22 iwpr balkan crisis report 490 april 2 2004 crs12 role in helping to establish terrorist training camp in bosnia with irans help during the mid1990s23 the issue of terrorism has been politicized in bosnia to some extent as each ethnic group has used the label terrorist to define its adversaries some bosnian serb officials have alleged that bosniaks were harboring islamic terrorists however it should be stressed that bosnian opposition to terrorism has been remarkably broad despite the stilldeep ethnic divide in the country the united states enjoys strong reservoir of support in bosnia especially among bosniaks for bringing peace to the country and providing postwar aid in addition bosniaks are known in the muslim world as particularly secular and european in outlook this has often caused friction between foreign islamic extremists and many ordinary bosniaks efforts by foreign islamists to recruit bosniaks into their organizations have met with limited success some bosniaks also fear that the terrorists will give bosnia bad name in europe thereby hindering their ability to travel there and setting back bosnian efforts to join european institutions in the long run24 in general the bosnian constitution gives domestic powers to fight terrorism to the entities while the central government deals with international efforts to fight terror bosnian efforts to fight terrorism are hampered by the weakness and inefficiency of its government institutions which have created an environment in which crime and corruption have flourished one example of this corrupt environment was the 2002 sale of arms from bosnia to saddam husseins iraq ashdowns efforts to strengthen statelevel institutions and the rule of law may increase the effectiveness of bosnias fight against terrorism with help from the eu and united states bosnia has deployed state border service throughout virtually all of the countrys territory ashdown is also pushing for implementation of legislation to increase the effectiveness of the state information and protection agency which is charged with combating terrorism organized crime trafficking and smuggling of weapons of mass destruction however as with other issues ashdowns efforts have been slowed by local politicians opposed to an increase in central government power the 2003 state department report on patterns of global terrorism said that bosnias commitment to the fight against terrorism has slowed since the victory of nationalist forces in bosnias october 2002 elections on the other hand the report notes that the federation financial police has continued to shut down ngos and bank accounts linked to terrorists25 the presence of sfor and other international officials on bosnias territory has also helped in the fight against terrorism nato troops and intelligence services can work with their bosnian counterparts and independently track down and arrest suspected terrorists the powerful

christian science monitor march 24 2004 1 25 2003 state department patterns of global terrorism report crs13 bosnia gives the united states more freedom to arrest and deport terrorists than in many other countries which might object on civil liberties or other grounds however the delivery of five suspected terrorists in january 2002 by the bosnian government to sfor was criticized by some bosnian legal experts as violation of the rule of law after sfors withdrawal in december 2004 nato headquarters in bosnia continues to play role in antiterrorist efforts in bosnia as does the eu successor force to sfor us aid us aid to bosnia has declined gradually in recent years after an initial post war surge to deal with urgent humanitarian and reconstruction needs the united states is the largest bilateral donor to bosnia although the european union and the world bank are the largest donors overall us aid has shifted to programs to help bosnia develop democratic institutions and free market economy from bosnias independence in 1992 through fy2002 the united states provided 156 billion in aid the united states provided 447 million in aid for bosnia under the seed program in fy2004 and an estimated 41 million for fy2005 the administration has requested 40 million in seed funding for bosnia in fy2006 us aid programs focus on such issues as strengthening the countrys legal
