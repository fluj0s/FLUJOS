background the pontiac decision arose in response to litigation surr ounding 9527a of the elementary and secondary education act sea as amended by the child left behind nclb act of 20011 section 9527a the so called unfunded mandates provision states nothing in this act sha ll be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the federal government to ma ndate state or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this act enacted in 2002 the nclb act reauthorized and revised the esea which is the primary federal law that provide s financial assistance to state and local school districts for precollegiate education perhaps the most notab feature of nclb is the wide array of assessment and accountability measures that s eek to improve student

districts have protested what they perceive as lack of federal assistance for some of the acts more controversial re quirements such as the tes ting and school choice provisions3 other critics have questioned whether mandating that states pay for the costs associated with some of the acts requirements is even lawf ul given the language of 9527a indeed in 2005 the national education association nea in conjunction with eight school districts in michigan texas and vermont filed lawsuit claiming that the secretary of education was violating both the unfunde d mandates provisi on and the spending clause of the us constitution4 the nea sought declaratory judgment to the eff ect that states and school districts are not required to spend nonnclb funds to comply with the nclb mandates and that failure to comply with the nclb mandates for this reason does not provide basis for withholding any federal funds to which they are otherwise entitled under the nclb plaintiffs also sought an injunction pr ohibiting the secretary from withholding from states and school districts any federal funds to which they are entitled under the nclb because of failure to comply with the mandates of the nclb that is attributable to refusal to spend non nclb funds to achieve such compliance5 in 2005 the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan dismissed the neas lawsuit in its ruling the district court concluded that 9527a should be interpreted as prohibition agai nst the imposition by federal officers and employees of additional unf unded requirements beyond those provided for in the statute rather than as an exemption from the statutes requirements when the federal government fails to fully fund the title i program as result the court dismissed the lawsuit

the sixth circuit which reversed the distri ct courts decision the sixth circ uits decision in school district of the city of pontiac v secretary of the united states department of education threejudge panel of the sixth circuit in 21 vote held that the spending clause7 which empowers congress to spend money for the general welfare of the united states require s congressionally enacted statut to provide clear notice to the states of their liabilities should they decide to accept federal funding under those statutes and that the nclb act fails to provide clear notice as to who bears the additional costs of compliance8 because the court found the statute to be ambiguous in this regard it ruled that the plaintiffs d established claim upon which relief could be granted and therefore reversed the district courts decision and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the sixth circuits opinion in reaching its decision the twojustice majority emphasized its view that the spending clause requires clear notice of states financial obligations under the clause congress has frequently promoted its policy goals by conditioning the receipt of federal funds on state compliance with certain requirements indee d the supreme court has repeatedly upheld against constitutional ch allenge the use of this technique to induce governments and private pa rties to cooperate voluntar ily with federal policy9 although the court has articulated several standards that purport to limit congresss discretion to place conditions on federal grants under the sp ending clause these standards generally have had little limiting effect first the conditions like the spending its elf must advance the general welfare but the determination of what constitutes the ge neral welfare rests largely if not wholly with congress second because grant is muc h in the nature of contract offer that the states may accept or reject congress must set out the conditions unambiguously so that the states may make an informed decision third the court continues to state that the conditions must be related to th federal interest for which the funds are expended but it has never found spending c ondition deficient under this part of the test fourth the power to condition funds may not be used to induce the states to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional fifth the court has suggested that in some circumstances th financial inducement offered by congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion but again the court has never found congre ssional condition to be coercive in this sense10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22839crs4 11 451 us 1 1981 548 us 291 us 2006 12 former 42 usc 6010 13 pontiac 512 f3d at 265relying on the standard that spending c onditions be set forth unambiguously the pontiac court cited two supreme court precedents pennhurst state school hospital v halderman and arlington central school district board of education v murphy 11 the pennhurst decision involved the developmentally disabled assistance and bill of rights act of 1975 which contained bill of rights provision stating that mentally disabled individuals have right to appropriate treatment services and habilitation for such disabilities12 unlike other requirements of the act the bill of rights provision appeared to represent general statement of federa l policy and was not conditioned on the receipt of federal funding as result the court held that the pr ovision did not create enforceable obligations on the state in part because congress had failed to provide clear notice to states that accepting federal funds would re quire compliance with the bill of rights provision meanwhile the arlington case involved the individuals with disabilities in education act which authorizes court to award reasonable attorneys fees to plaintiffs who prevail in lawsuits brought under the act denying the plaintiffs request for reimbursement of fees paid to nonattorney expert the cour t held that the statute did not provide states with clear tice that their acceptance of fe deral funds obligated them to compensate prevailing parties for such expert fees applying these precedents the pontiac court sought to determine whether the nclb act provided clear notice to th states regarding their funding obligations according to the court because the statute explicitly pr ovides that nothing in this act shall be construed to mandate state or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this act stat official would not clearly understand that obligation to exist13 although the sixth circuit consid ered alternative interpretations under which the statute could be read to require states to comply with all nclb requirements regardless of federal funding levels the court ruled that the only relevant question here is whether the act provides clear notice to the states of their obligation as result the court rejected the alternative interpretations advanced in the case which included 1 the district courts view that the provision prevents officers and employees of the federal government from imposing dditional requirements on the states and 2 the department of education s ed argument that the provision simply emphasizes that state participation in nclb is entirel voluntary although the sixth circuit acknowledged that eds interpretation of the statute may ultimately be correct the court held that neither interpretation was sufficiently evident to provide states with clear notice of their obligation to spend dditional funds to comply with requirements that are not paid for under the act as noted above the sixth circuits pontiac decision was not unanimous indeed one of the judges vigorously objected to the majority opinion according to the dissenting judges interpretation 9527a does not render the nclb ac t ambiguous and therefore does not violate the spending clause speci fically the dissent distinguished the cases cited as precedents and cont ended that the text operati on and structure of the act contradict the majoritys inte rpretation asserting that state and local school officials had crystal clear vision of what congress was offering them the dissent characterized thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22839crs5 14 id at 273 15

for the proposition that congress in tended such monumental and unprecedented change in our nations education funding14 ultimately the decision reached by the thr eejudge panel may not be the last word in the case since majority of judges on the sixth circuit recently agreed to rehear the pontiac case15 implications as noted above the sixth circuits actions in the pontiac case both the original ruling and the decision to rehear the case may have significant practical procedural and legal implications from practical persp ective if the decision stands the case has the potential to significantly undermine the opera tion and effect of the title i program as well as other esea programs that are s ubject to the unfunded mandates provision in 9527a from broader perspective the cas if not judicially or legislatively overturned could represent shift in the federalstate relationshi p across wide array of policy areas if the sixth circuits clear notice rule is extended to other statutory schemes that are perceived to suffer from similar ambi guities as re sult the case could potentially create degree of uncertainty across the entire landscape of federal funding programs by encouraging legal cha llenges not only to ot her federal education programs but also to federa l funding programs operated by other federal agencies the pontiac case also has numerous procedural implications in response to the ruling ed sought review of the pontiac decision by petitioning the sixth circuit for rehearing banc 16 typically federal appeals are hear d by panel consisting of three judges but the term banc which translates as full be nch refers to situation in which larger number of circuit judges rec onsider decision made by the threejudge panel under the federal rules of appellate procedure an banc hearing or rehearing is not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless 1 banc consideration is necessary to secure or mainta in uniformity of the courts decisions or

pending appeal18 as result the original sixth circuit opinion in the pontiac case is longer in effect eventually the sixth circuit sitting banc will issue new ruling in the pontiac case once that occurs the losing party may decide to appeal by filing petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court because the supreme court is not obligated to grant such requests however there is guarant ee that the litigation will continue beyond its current stage nevertheless given the reality of banc review and the possibility of supreme court review the potentially lengthy nature of such proceedings could mean that the nclb act litigation may take years to resolve as result the sixth circuits original decision may have little practical effect in the near future if ever in addition to the practical and procedural ramifications there are several important legal implications of the pontiac decision first if the decision withstands banc review it will become effective only in states that fall within the jurisdiction of the sixth circuit those states are limited to kentuc ky michigan ohio and tennessee because school districts and educational agencies in other states w ould not be affected by the decision they may decide to file similar laws uits in other circuits second congress has the authority to override the pontiac decision statutorily according to the sixth circuits decision the states obligation to spend add itional funds or incur additional costs for compliance is unclear and that lack of clear notice violates the spending clause19 if congress disagrees with the pontiac decision then congress is free to amend the nclb act to clarify that states th at accept nclb funds are obligated to comply with all of the acts requirements regardless of whether or not the costs of compliance are fully funded by the federal government
