priority conflicts with other setaside programs such as abilityone abilityone formerly the javitswagneroday program jwod is federal progra m that helps provide jobs for individuals with disabilities

between these two programs the fact that each provides food services loosely define d has led some observers to argue that randolphsheppard and abilityone are facto competitors in certain circumstances for instan ce tensions have mounted around food service operations on military bases in recent years because many of the items that may be purchased off of the committees jwod procuremen t list are also tasks that randolph sheppard vendor could or woul d supply as part of cafeter ia contract including mess hall attendant services eg waiters sales support g cashiers and cleaning assistance eg table busing dishwa shing jwod and the rsa have been perceived to be in conflic t or in competition more over rsa vendors argue that they are at competitive disadvantage for number of reasons first jwod services have fixed price predetermined by the committee second jwod companies do not have to go through laborious and often timeconsuming competitive bidding process most importan tly federal agenciesdepartments are prohibited from acquiring goods and services equivalent to jwod items from sources other than the national industries for the b lind and nish nonprofit agencies18 legislative activity the javitswagneroday jwod and randolphsheppard rsa modernization act of 2008 s 3112 was in troduced by senator michael enzi on june 11 2008 this comprehensive bill would reauthorize reconfigure and expand both programs bolstering the job training aspects of each and increasing regulatory oversight to prevent waste fraud and buse s 3112 changes the name of the existing committee for purchase from people who are blind or severely disabled to the committee for the advancement of individuals with disabilities giving this entity responsibility for administering both the rsa program and the abilityonejwod procurement program this bill also places an explicit emphasis on greater oversight of both jwod and rsa including regular financial audits of randolphsheppards central nonprofit agen cies and of state licensing agencies participating in the jwod program fi nally s 3112 underscores the importance of converting nonintegrated commun ity rehabilitation programs into programs that offer integrated communitybased employment opportunities other significant changes that would occur if s 3112 were to become law include the following requirement that slas train and give rsa permits to persons with other severe di sabilities beyond blindness starting three years after enactment of the legislation requirement that any existing state vr selfemployment program

that prohibits the abilityone program from competing for full food contracts any full food contract that abilityone currently has on its procurement list will be removed five years after this bill
