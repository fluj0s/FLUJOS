to amembassy moscow xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx in the russian view there is another serious threat that should be discussed pakistan pakistan is nation with nuclear weapons various delivery systems and domestic situation that is highly unstable russia assesses that islamists are not only seeking power in pakistan but are also trying to get their hands on nuclear materials russia is aware that pakistani authorities with help from the us have created wellstructured system of security for protecting nuclear facilities which includes physical protection however there are 120000130000 people directly involved in pakistans nuclear and missile programs working in these facilities and protecting them however regardless of the clearance process for these people there is way to guarantee that all are 100 loyal and reliable 63 s in addition to the islamist interest in these facilities russia also is aware that pakistan has had to hire people to protect nuclear facilities that have especially strict religious beliefs and recently the general educational and cultural levels in pakistan has been falling due to these facts extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in the nuclear and missile programs over the last few years extremists have attacked vehicles that carry staff to and from these facilities some were killed and number were abducted and there has been trace seen of them also even if places are well protected transportation of materials is vulnerable point in pakistan it is hard to guarantee the security of these materials during transportation for these reasons russia thinks pakistan should also be particular focus of discussion xxxxxxxxxxx
