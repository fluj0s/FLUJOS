conditions incl uding cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the form er yugoslavia icty the second session of the 110th congress may consider similar cer tification provisions in the fy2009 foreign aid legislation supporters of ai d conditionality say such provisions may have spurred serbias cooperation w ith the tribunal serbian c ooperation with the icty may also be affected by the status of serbia s kosovo province the serbian government and parliament have threaten ed to sharply downgrade relations with any country that recognizes kosovos independence if th united states and most european union countries recognize kosovo as they are exp ected to do in early 2008 serbia cooperation with the icty might cease at least for time this report will be updated as events warrant for more informati on on serbia see crs report rs22601 serbia current issues and us policy by steven woehrel background since fy2001 congress has cond itioned part of us aid to serbia after certain date of the year on presidential certificati on that serbia has met three conditions they are cooperating with the inte rnational criminal tribunal fo r yugoslavia icty ending support for separate bosnian rb institutions and protecting minority rights and the rule of law including the release of political prisoners the provision also has recommended that us support for loans from international financial institutions to the federal republic of yugoslavia the nowdefunc t federation of serb ia and montenegro be conditioned on the certification the certification does not apply to kosovo which is nominally serbian province but is administered by mission the provision also has not applied to humanitarian or democratization aid to serbia1 the certification processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21686crs2 due to extensive use by the administration of waiver authority in the legislation typically affects only modest portion of th amount allocated for any given year due to the deadline being set in the spring of the fiscal year and the exclusion of humanitarian and democratization aid in addition to u s bilateral aid the ai d conditions have said that the united states should vote against financing from the international financial institutions key source of funding for serbia however despite this provision serbias noncooperation with the icty does not seem to have affected its access to international loans such as those from the imf and worl d bank moreover the european union key aid donor has not explicitly conditioned its aid to serbia on wa r crimes cooperation serbian compliance fy2001fy2007 for most of the period since the overthrow of the regime of serbian strongman slobodan milosevic in late 2000 serbian c ooperati on with the icty has followed similar pattern each year serbia delivers several indictees to the tribunal just before or shortly after the certification deadline the administration makes the certification as required by the legislation and urges serbia to do more in particular calling for the surrender of former bosnian serb army ch ief mladic and former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic however serbian cooperation then slow s with serbian leaders claiming that political and legal obstacles preclude greater efforts nevertheless more indictees are delivered as the next deadline for certification approaches and so on for example the conditions on us aid to serbia were an important factor in the timing of the arrest of milosevic by serb ian police on april 1 2001 one day after the march 31 certification deadline set by th fy2001 legislation when making the certification on april 2 secretary of state co lin powell warned that us support for an international aid conference for serbia w ould depend on milosevi cs delivery to the tribunal milosevic was delivered to the tribunal in the hague on june 28 2001 one day before the donors conference serbian c ooperation then decreased significantly the fy2002 deadline passed without certification but serbia encouraged six indictees to surrender to the tribunal in late april and early may 2002 the administration made the fy2002 certification on may 21 2002 the fy2003 foreign aid appropriations measure was included as part of the consolidated appropriations resolution for fy2003 pl 1087 the bill contained certification provisions on aid to serbia similar to the fy2001 and fy2002 bills and required the president to make the certifica tion by june 15 2003 in demonstration of the power of dangerous forces threatening cooperation with the icty and democracy in serbia on march 12 2003 serbia n prime minister zoran d jindjic was assassinated investigators discovered that the crime was committed by organized crime figures who reportedly feared prosecution for war crimes and other criminal activities djindjics murder appeared to galvanize serbian leaders in the fight against organized crime leaders and war criminals indictees miroslav radic veselin sljivancanin paramilitary leader franko simatovic and former intelligence chie f jovica stanisic were turned over to the icty in may and june 2003 secretary of state powell made the fy2003 certification on june 15 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21686crs3 2 statement by richard boucher spokes man january 13 2005 from the state department website httpwwwstategovit should be noted that icty cooperation is only one of the three conditions for us aid to serbia however the administration accepted the assurances of serbian authorities that they had ended support to separate republic srpska institutions which had included paying the salaries of rs army officers neither this condition nor the third condition dealing with minority rights and the release of ethnic albanian political prisoners has proved to be stumbling block to certification particularly after the release of kosovar prisoners from serbia n jails in march 2002 the fy2004 foreign operations appropriations bill incor porated into pl 108199 an omnibus appropriations bill contained th same certification provisions as previous years requiring the president to make the certification by march 31 2004 the administration did not make the fy2004 certification and susp ende d 16 million in fy2004 aid to serbia the fy2005 foreign aid appropriations were incorporated into an omnibus spending bill pl 108447 it contained the same certification process as previous years with deadline of may 31 2005 in january 2005 the administration announced that because there had been improvement in belgrade s cooperation with th tribunal the united states would withhold 10 million in fy2005 aid from serbia us ambassador to serbia and montenegro michael polt said that the aid cuts could lead to the withdrawal of us technical advisors from serbian ministries working on such issues as world trade organization membership and economic reform however an administration spokesman noted that the remaining portion of the 736 million in aid to serbia would still go to organizations and programs outside of the central government that are committed to reform2 on june 9 2005 the administration certified that serbia had t the conditions set out in the fy2005 legislation freeing up the 10 million that had been suspended in january in the first half of 2005 serbia tr ansferred 14 indictees to the icty according to icty chief prosecutor carla ponte however ponte and us officials continued to note with regret that mladic and karadzic were still at large the fy2006 foreign operations appropriations bill pl 109102 conditioned us aid to serbias central government afte r may 31 2006 on 1 cooperating with the international criminal tribunal for yugoslav ia including access for investigators the provision of documents and the surrender and transfer of indictees or assistance in their apprehension including making all practicable efforts to apprehe nd and transfer ratko mladic and radovan karadz ic unless the secretary of state determines and reports to the committees on appropriations that these individuals are longer residing in serbia 2 taking steps that are consistent with the dayton accords to end serbian financial political security and other support which s served to maintain separate republika srpska institutions and 3 taking steps to implement policies which reflect respect for minority rights and the rule of law it says the administration should vote for loans and aid for serbia and montenegro from international financial institutions after may 31 2006 if the certification is made the aid conditions did not apply to montenegro kosovo humanitarian aid or assi stance to promote democracy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21686crs4 the provision was identical to that in fy2005 with few exceptions first it specifically names karadzic as well as mladic as persons serbia should detain second it allows the administration to issue certification even if the two men are not transferred if it deter mines that the two are not living in serbia the exact whereabouts of the two men are uncertain mladic is wide ly assumed to be livin g in serbia under the protection of former and serving military and security officials most speculation on karadzics location places him in bosnia perhaps crossing the border into serbia at times in january 2006 the serbian governme nt admitted that mladic had been drawing serbian army pension as late as midnovember 2005 on may 31 2006 the administration in compliance with the cer tification provision in the fy2006 foreign operations appropriations bill suspended 7 million in us aid to serbia due to its failure to cooperate with the icty the housepassed version of the fy2007 foreign operations appropriations bill hr 5522 cont ains certification provision very similar to the fy2006 bill section 562 blocks aid to serbias central government unless the certificati on is made by may 31 2007 however it omits specific reference to karadzic as person serbia should detain while retaining the mention of mladic th senate did not pass an fy2007 foreign aid bill before the end of the 109th congress section 563 of the version of hr 5522 reported by the senate appr opriations committee conditions aid to serbias central government on icty coopera tion by may 31 2007 including access for investigators the provision of documents timely informa tion on the location travel and sources of financial support of indictees including ra dovan karadic and the surrender and transfer of indictees or assistance in their apprehension including ratko mladic unlike the house version the section retains specific ntion of karadzic but appears to soften it by tacitly acknowledging that mladic might be easier for serbian authorities to apprehend than karadzic the 109th congress did not complete an fy2007 foreign aid bill before it adjourned fy2007 foreign operations we re funded through februa ry 15 2007 by continuing resolution pl 109383 and then through th rest of the fiscal year by another continuing resolution pl 1105 however the terms of the continuing resolution carried forward the fy2006 serbia aid cond itions through fy2007 on july 3 2007 the administration certified that rbia had met the aid conditi ons in the legislation and released 6 million in aid that had previously been suspended in justifying the move the administration pointed to the june 2007 arrest and transfer to the tribunal of zdravko tolimir and vlas timir djordjevic two serb suspects wanted by the icty at present four icty suspects all serbs are still at large including the two most important ones karadzic and mladic fy2008 legislation division j of the consolidated appropr iations act of 2008 pl 110161 includes fy2008 foreign aid appropriations section 699d permits us aid to serbia after may 31 2008 if serbia meets certain conditions th section also says that the administration should vote for loans and assi stance for serbia in intern ational financ ial institutions after this deadline if it meets the aid conditions the most important condition as in past ears is cooperating w ith the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia including access for investigators thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21686crs5 3 tanjug news agency dispatch november 2 3003 as carried by bbc monitoring internationalprovision of documents timely informati on on the location movement and sources of financial support of indictees and the surrender and transfer of indictees or assistance in their apprehension including ratko mlad ic and radovan kara dzic two other conditions also part of the aid conditions in previous years are also included they are taking steps that are consistent with the dayton accords to end serbian financial political security and other support which s served to maintain separate republika srpska institutions and taking steps to implement policies which reflect respect for minority rights and the rule of law thes latter two conditions have not been invoked to deny aid to serbia in recent years as in past years the provision exempts humanitarian aid assistance to promot democracy and aid to kosovo from the conditions laid down in this section us policy although it has used the aid conditions to ex tract at least partia l serbian cooperation with the icty the administration has shown signs of impatience with the certification process and what the administration believes is the seemingly open ended nature of the ictys prosecutions the administration fa vored shifting responsibility for prosecuting all but handful of major war crimes cases from the icty to serbian courts the united states along with other countries successfu lly pushed for the adoption of security council resolution 1503 in august 2003 the re solution calls for icty to complete its trials by 2008 and all appeals by 2010 the unite d states is assisting serbias efforts to prosecute war criminals itself by providing assistance in such areas as helping to set up witness protection programs pr oviding training to judges and contributing funds to help establish new serbian court to try organized crime and war crimes cases in addition to the aid conditions the administration has also used positive inducements to show serbia the benefits of better usserbia re lationship that would follow from icty cooperation for example in november 2003 the ad ministration certified that serbia and montenegro is eligible for normal trade relations ntr with the united states the countrys ntr status was suspended in 1992 in res ponse to its role in the war in bosnia according to th terms of pl 102420 106 stat 2149 the legislation permits the administration to restore ntr to serbia and montenegro if the president certifies that it had ceased armed conflict with other peoples of the former yugoslavia agreed to respect the borders of the former yugoslav states and ended support to bosnian serb forces administration officials say the move was made in response to the improved situation in serbia especially in defense reform and cutting links between the serbian and bosnian serb armed forces serbian official s hailed the restoration of ntr saying it would give significant boost to serbias ex ports to the united states in such areas as furniture hunting rifles and pharmaceuticals on serbian leader added that the granting of ntr was more important to serbia than the aid certification issue3 in june 2005 after the fy2005 aid certification the administrati on announced that it had granted dutyfree treatment to some products from serbia and montenegro under the generalized system of preferences gsp httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21686crs6 in move that surprised some observe rs in its suddenness the administration reversed longstanding policy in nove mber 2006 and offered support for serbias membership in natos partnership for peace pfp program the united states had previously conditioned serbias participation in pfp on mladic s transfer to the tribunal serbia joined pfp in december 2006 pfp is aimed at helping countries come closer to nato standards and at promoting their coope ration with nato pfp membership is prerequisite if country wishes to join nato in the future some have argued that certification has played an important role in encouraging serbian leaders to deal with difficult issues th at they would have ra ther avoided serbias democracy will be healthier in the long run proponents of certificati on say if serbs come to terms with the war crimes issue especi ally since those supporting the war criminals continue to be threats to reform and reform ers as demonstrated by the murder of prime minister djindjic on the other hand it can be argued that while they may be positive for serbia in the long term the aid conditions have been domestic political liability for serbian reformers serbian leaders complain that what they see as unending western demands upon them reduce their credibility in th eyes of the serbian public cooperation with the tribunal has aggravated tensions among reformers but it should be noted that it is only one of many issues dividing th em which include corruption scandals and personal ambitions of their leaders moreover skeptics of the certification process claim that it hinders accomplishment of the most impor tant us goal in the region which is the euroatlantic integrati on of serbia and other countries in the region observers believe the us decision to per mit serbia to join pf p without transferring mladic to the icty was intended to help pr owestern parties in serbian parliamentary elections to be held on january 21 2007 ho wever the elections did not result in marked improvement of the share of the vote won by democratic pa rties nevertheless after months of wrangling new government of democratic par ties was formed on may 15 2007 the new government vowed to coope rate fully with the icty while the government has taken positive steps in transferring tolimir and djordjevic there still may be obstacles to full cooperation including the transfer of the remaining four indictees one is tension within the government the democratic party of president boris tadic and the g17 plus party see icty cooperation as more important priority than the nationalist democratic party of serbia d by prime minister vojislav kostunica more important however may be the impact of international efforts to determine the status of serbias kosovo province the united states and its ke european allies are likely to recognize kosovos independence in early 2008 the serbian government and parliament have threatened to sharply downgrade relations w ith any country that does so therefore if the united states and its allie s were to recognize ko sovo serbia cooperation with the icty might cease and serbias prospects for euroatlantic integration would suffer serious blow at least for time
