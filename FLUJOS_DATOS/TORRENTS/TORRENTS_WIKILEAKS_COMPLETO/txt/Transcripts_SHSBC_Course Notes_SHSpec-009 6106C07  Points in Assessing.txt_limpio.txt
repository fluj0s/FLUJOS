6106c07 shspec9 points in assessing the problem with communicating scientology is that there are agreedupon realities readymade in words if you give person one of these concepts and its name and definition he will recognize the truth of it but it will take awhile for him to really grasp it and he has to get the concept first this is almost like processing people read dmsmh and got an understanding that changed their physical condition but the ideas of dianetics and scientology havent been familiar to man so it takes awhile or it takes familiarity with them to grasp them you could teach someone the principles of scientology by teaching him the vocabulary youve got to get the ptp of long duration off the pcs case if he has one before you can go on with goals processing because the ptp ld is more real to the pc than anything else on his case his attention is fixed on it if the pc has his attention fixed on the hidden standard youve practically got computation right there it has to be gotten out of the way to get case gain it is always right on the goals chain or it wouldnt be ptp of long duration so when you get it out of the way youve got the case flying it has been mistake not to assess the hidden standard finding out who had it when and what this is presession 38 dianetic assist see hcob 23feb61 pt problem and goals or more certain method would be to run the hidden standard with terminals assessment by elimination whose might it be what might it be etc this line of questioning is interesting both to the pc and casewise because the hidden standard is the primary source of individuation for the pc it is what makes him different from everyone else it is the least well duplicated part of the bank so it will fire off as an automaticity because it is the area that is most out of communication and most out of control the pc could get lots of terminals from this the hidden standard is substitute for the case of the pc it is more real to him than any case or life difficulties the pc may have it is form of individuation the pc is the one with the earache this distinguishes him from others
