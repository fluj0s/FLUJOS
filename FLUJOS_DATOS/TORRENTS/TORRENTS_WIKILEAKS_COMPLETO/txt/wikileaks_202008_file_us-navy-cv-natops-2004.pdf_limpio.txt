is char ged with the overall control of the vmc landing pattern figure 56 and is assisted by the lso specific responsibilities are assigned as follows 5541 air officer 1 provide pilot with suf ficient information to ensure that aircraft are established in the landing pattern in time to meet the expected charlie time 2 assign or revise the landing order as necessary 3 regulate the number of aircraft in the landing pattern to ensure steady flow of traffic while preventing the pattern from becoming extended or overcrowded 4 monitor the landing interval 5 whenever possible maintain visual contact with all aircraft in the delta and charlie pattern 6 maintain an accurate count of the number of aircraft to be recovered and inform the bridge when only two remain 7 monitor the upwind pattern being particularly alert to warn pilots of aircraft boltering or waving off of their proximity to aircraft launching or breaking 8 maintain visual contact with aircraft that have radio failure and instruct the lso with regard to visual signals to be given9 inform the lso of any unusual conditions affecting the normal recovery of aircraft 5542 lso under the supervision of the air officer 1 control all fixedwing aircraft approaches after the 180 position 2 ensure that approaching aircraft are properly configured 3 monitor the operation of the ols and crosscheck the approach radaricls glidepath angle 4 instruct and supervise the lso talker and hook spotter 5 assist in controlling aircraft that have radio failure by flashing the cut or waveoff lights in accordance with signals delineated in figure 511 6 whenever possible maintain visual contact with all aircraft in the charlie pattern 7 inform the air officer of any unusual conditions affecting the safe recovery of aircraft 56 recovering helicopters 561 recovery procedures normally helicopters will be recovered after all fixedwing aircraft helicopters recovering after night plane guard duties should be provided positioning information by catcc in order to expeditiously intercept the glideslope and effect landing following recovery of the last fixedwing aircraft when flight of helicopters is being recovered under vmc the leader of the flight should plan to be at the ramp within minimum safe interval after the last fixedwing aircraft has landed the helicopter which is the farthest advanced on the inbound radial and has not turned to parallel the ships course will be considered 1 in the landing pattern and should expeditiously effect landing following recovery of the last fixedwing aircraft the helicopter cleared 1 to land should be assigned landing spot farthest forward into the wind subsequent helicopters should be cleared to land in sequence behind the 1 helicopter in the event the last fixedwing aircraft waves off all helicopters will return to the delta pattern see figure 56 prior to issuing landing clearance the air officer shall ensure the helicopter may land within original wic 31navair 0080t105 original wic 31 520the relative wind envelope prescribed in the respective aircraft natops flight manual and the tower shall transmit relative wind direction speed and landing spots for landings not oriented to the angle or axial centerline day vmc only the air officer will ensure an adequate waveoff path is available to the helicopter because of the severe rotorwash and wingtip vortices produced by ch53e and mh53e helicopters landlaunch operations should not be conducted upwind of other aircraft or any unsecured area because of this severe hazard consideration should be given to conducting ch53e and mh53e operations from afterdeck spots only note c0068rotating beacon light signals for helicopter operations are located in figure 31 of the aircraft signals natops manual navair 0080t113 c0068army helicopters are not equipped with an automatic blade foldspread systemtime for manually folding and spreading main rotor blades should be taken into account for tactical planning during shipboard operations c0068certain army and air force helicopters are not equipped with rotor brake extended rotor coast down times can be expected these times can vary with relative wind speed and direction and can exceed 8 minutes in winds as light as 20 knots the ship shall be ready to provide optimum winds for the windmilling stop of the rotor system during case iii recoveries the approach shall be flown as directed by catcc until the pilot acquires visual contact with the optical landing aids at which time the pilot shall call the ball control will then be assumed by the air officer who shall issue final landing clearance in the event of waveoff the pilot shall parallel the final bearing course and report to catcc for control at night navigation lights shall be steady bright and
