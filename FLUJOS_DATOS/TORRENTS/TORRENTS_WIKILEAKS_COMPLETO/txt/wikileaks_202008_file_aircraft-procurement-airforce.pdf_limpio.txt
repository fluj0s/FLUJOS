and training in support of the nato strategic airlift capability initiative the department of defense dod is committed to providing one c17 aircraft to this initiative whose objective is to provide critical airlift capabilities to affect nato and national security commitments this initiative will result in dedicated fleet of c17 aircraft three or four depending on the level of other nations participation for participating nato allies that will provide strategic airlift capabilities for nations commitments to nato operations the us share of program costs will be consistent with the

answers centcom urgent need request dtg 052020z jan 06 for precise target geolocation funds the improvement of inherent senior scout capabilities through modernization of the special signals collection radio frequency distribution direction finding and communications subsystems increases the number and volume of simultaneous signals to be interpreted to improve critical intelligence and direct support to troops in contact expands inherent abilities to collect against signals of interest sois also permits wideband connectivity for simultaneous and immediate transmission of gathered data and analysis to national authorities and tactical commanders repeated modificationdemodification of c130 main landing gear doors due to high gwot operations tempo since 911 has degraded senior scout antenna performance and has caused significant electrical issues resulting in df performance degradation this action will resolve df array sensitivity shortcomings this increase in senior scout capability will allow for greater ability to disseminate critical information in real time manner this will in turn reduce the time required for command decision to quickly complete the kill chain the replacement of the df array on the mlg doors ensures successful gwot mission execution and to ensure it best serves cocom forces in providing enemy identification target location and friendly forces overwatch these funds provide for the nonrecurring engineering fabrication and installation of three 3 shelter update kits communications sensors and processing upgrades supporting socom and centcom critical collection requirements impact if not funded failure to provide funds leaves cocoms vulnerable to surprise and unable to preempt the evolving gwot target set and may jeopardize usallied lives senior scout is currently constrained in its ability to collect process and disseminate intelligence on multitude of sois due to an ever evolving gwot target set further without wideband
