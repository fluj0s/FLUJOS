from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re fwd re updated mwp figure date tue 28 jun 2005 101105 0600 cc eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed hi keith might be worth talking on the phone you and eystein after you get back you could be right but it is powerful way to look at the issue the question is whether the normalization could be preventing warmer than late20th century signal from appearing should we instead update the bradley science graphic thats not as effective in my opinion so lets talk next week going to tree day meeting or three day meeting it has to be tough looking at tree data all day have fun thx peck jonathan and eystein i am leaving very early for tree day meeting in swansea and will be away til monday presently buried in ec reporting and other stuff but the reason i dislike the mwp figure is that the simple normalization of series as done regardless of regional selection of specific proxies gives largely random amplitude to the various records depending on their spectral character and of course equal weight to all regardless of the strength of their link with local or nh temperatures i will think about this you are the ultimate arbiter anyway sorry to be so abruptly communicative keith at 1610 28062005 you wrote hi tom thanks for the extra effort im pushing others on the author team to think hard about such figure space may end up being the hardest part and i should have something to discuss w you soon thanks for being willing to shift priorities if needed fyi i just got reviews back from an eos piece that took over 15 months to get and of course they want some edits not the speedy venue we once knew loved although i bet if you really keep it short and sweet it might go faster best more soon peck xsieve cmu sieve 22 date tue 28 jun 2005 101349 0400 from tom crowley tcrowleydukeedu xacceptlanguage enus to jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu cc eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno subject re updated mwp figure hi jonathan let answer the last question first there are actually not many records that go back that far and i have used i think every one except quelcaya which being from the southern tropics makes for lonely but potential future inclusion which makes difference on the conclusion several of the sites include multiple time series eg western us time series w siberia time series asia and w greenland i did not want to overweight any site though because of the need for geographic balance note that there are four sites each in the w hemisphere and hemisphere and that the distribution of sites in each hemisphere represents good scatter for almost all of these sites the references are easily imaginable based on the location of the site but they can be provided if you are interested in including the figure can you think of any long sites i have not included right now i cannot in the overlap interval of 15001850 our composite has highly significant correlations with the mann jones and briffa reconstructions that contain much more data thereby suggesting that use of only long time series provides reasonable estimate of the last 1100 years i have not submitted this for publication but if you are interested in including this in ipcc i can knock off tutorial note to eos on short notice i am attaching the figure in several different alternate formats cannot easily do the two you suggest from my mac but again i can get that done with more work if you are interested let know where to go next note that i originally sent this along fyi only to be used if you thought the figure was worthwhile if not i will just reorder the priority of writing it up as note tom jonathan overpeck wrote hi tom thanks for sending this plot im bit late in responding since we were moving to and still into our sabbatical digs in sw co would you be willing to provide more on this plot in order for to understand it better i personally like the plot quite bit but between the space restrictions and others assessment whether we use it or not will take some real thinking for example it would help to have 1 higher resolution version eps or ai 2 caption or text that would spell out which records are included and their origins references 3 bibliography for those refs 4 perhaps you have paper with this included if so can you send prerprint 5 some discussion of why you used the series sites you did and not others more specifically whats wrong with others if you dont mind helping here ill promise to get it in the mix for serious discussion of course its already in the mix since eystein forwarded to keith and you tim but i want to weigh in as informed as possible trying to keep track of lot so your help is much appreciated thanks peck hello i have been fiddling with the best way to illustrate the stable nature of the medieval warm period the attached plot has eight sites that go from 9461960 in decadal std dev units although small in number there is good geographic spread four are from the w hemisphere four from the east i also plot the raw composite of the eight sites and scale it to the 3090n decadal temp record this record illustrates how the individual sites are related to the composite and also why the composite has dramatically warm mwp there is dramatically warm clustering of the individual sites use or lose as you wish tom jonathan t
