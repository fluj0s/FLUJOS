the world trade organization wto have been conducting set or round of negotiations called the doha development agenda dda since the end of 2001 the ddas main objective is to refine and expand the rules by which wto members conduct foreign trade with one another critical element of the dda round is the negotiations pertaining to foreign trade in services trade in services has been covered under multilateral rules only since 1995 with the entry into force of the general agreement on trade in services ga ts and of the uruguay round agreements creating the wto the negotiations on services in the doha development agenda dda round have two fundamental objectives one objective is to reform the current gats rules and principles the second objective is for each member country to liberalize or open more of its service sectors to foreign competition the wto services negotiations have been going on for more than six years however as with the negotiations in agriculture and nonagriculture market access the services negotiations have proceeded slowly with missed deadlines and few results the prospects for the negotiations are difficult to evaluate at this point it is not unusual for negotiations to lag as participants wait to place their best negotiating positions on the table until just before crucial deadlines are reached on july 24 2006 wto directorgeneral pascal lamy suspended the dda negotiations including the services negotiations because major wto members could not agree on the terms or modalities for negotiations in agriculture and non agriculture market access he resumed the negotiations in 2007 and negotiators from major groups of developed and developing countries have been working to nail down the basic elements of draft text however negotiators have failed to reach consensus on the basic negotiating objectives several factors will determine if and when the services negotiations will be completed one factor is the political will the wto members can muster to overcome the obstacles that hamper the negotiations another factor is to what degree the various participants are willing to compromise on goals in order to reach agreements and third factor is how quickly the issues in agriculture and nonagriculture market access are resolved the sooner they are resolved the sooner negotiators can devote their attention to the services negotiations this report will be updated as events warrant the dda negotiations including the negotiations on services could be the subject of oversight during the 110 th congress

organization wto are engaged in set or round of negotiations called the doha development agenda dda the ddas main objective is to refine and expand the rules by which wto members conduct foreign trade with one another critical element of the dda round is the negotiations pertaining to foreign trade in services trade in services has been covered under multilateral rules only since 1995 with the entry into force of the general agreement on trade in services gats and the uruguay round agreements creating the wto the us services sector is among the worlds most advanced efficient and open especially in such areas as financial services and telecommunication services services are significant part of the us economy and the source of most us empl oyment such is the case also with many other economically advanced countries for many years many in congress and successive administrations have been pressing to make trade liberalization in services priority in multilateral trade negotiations and priority in the current round in so doing the united states has sought trade opportunities especially in developing countries for competitive sector of the us economy the us business community considers the dda negotiations in services critical to providing predictability in global markets for services 1 furthermore the outcome of the services negotiations likely will have significant impact on the credibility of the gats which remains fledgling system of rules if the negotiations fail it would be considered by many observers setback for us trade policy congress would have to pass implementing legislation in order for any agreement on services or for any agreement reached during the dda to become part of us obligations under the wto however before the agreement stage the congress plays consultative role during the negotiations as required by the legislation granting the president the fast track trade negotiating authority 2 under this authority the president can negotiate trade agreements that would be handled under expedited congressional procedures limited debate and amendments through consultation members can try to ensure that the administration fulfills negotiating objectives as set out in trade law and is otherwise protecting us economic interests as the congress perceives them the current trade promotion expired on july 1 2007 and will have to be renewed before any dda agreement would receive expedited congressional consideration this report is designed to assist the 110 th congress to understand and monitor progress of the negotiations and the major issues that the negotiators are addressing the report provides brief background section on the significance of services to the us economy it then explains briefly the

one definition services are diverse group of economic activities not directly associated with the manufacture of goods mining or agriculture they typically involve the provision of human valueadded in the form of labor advice managerial skill entertainment training intermediation and the like 3 services differ from manufactured goods in that they are intangible cannot be stored and must be consumed at the point of production trips to the doctor enjoying meal at the restaurant however rapid changes in technology are reducing even these restrictions on services computer software that can be stored online on disks tape etc accounting services that are provided via the internet4 illustrative examples of services include wholesale and retail trade transportation and warehousing information banking and insurance professional scientific and technical services education arts and entertainment health care and social assistance food and accommodation services construction communication and public administration 5 services are an increasingly significant sector of the us economy in 1965 they accounted for 41 of us gdp in 2006 they accounted for 58 of us gdp6 in 2006 workers in the services sector accounted for about 83 of the total nonagricultural civilian workforce7 many services have not only intrinsic value but are also critical to running other parts of large economies for example financial services banking investment insurance are the means by which capital flows throughout an economy from those who have it savers investors to those who need it borrowers financial services are often called the lifeblood of an economy delivery services are critical to ensuring that intermediate production goods and final enduser goods are available when needed distribution services retail and wholesale services provide the means by which goods are made available to consumers inefficiencies in any of these industries could have adverse consequences for the whole economy us trade in services as customarily measured plays an important role in overall us trade albeit much smaller role than trade in goods in 2006 services accounted for 29 of total us exports of goods and services and 16 of total us imports of goods and services shares that have remained about the same for number of years 8 because most services require direct contact between supplier and consumer many service

of the consumer providers of legal accounting and construction services prefer direct presence because they need access to expert knowledge of the laws and regulations of the country in which they are doing business and they require proximity to clients thus crossborder services trade data do not capture all of the trade in services data on sales of services by foreign affiliates of usowned companies and by us affiliates of foreignowned firms help to provide more accurate albeit still incomplete measurement of trade in services in 2005 the latest year for which published data are available us firms sold 5285 billion in services to foreigners through their majorityowned foreign affiliates compared to 3678 billion in us crossborder exports foreign firms sold us residents 3890 billion in services through their majorityowned foreign affiliates located in the united states compared to 2816 billion in crossborder imports 9 even these two sets of figures do not capture the total value of trade in services two other modes of services delivery are through the temporary movement of consumers to the location of the provider and the temporary movement of the provider to the location of the consumer us data on the sales of services via these two modes of delivery are not readily available

negotiations in services trade were planted more than quarter century ago in the trade act of 1974 the congress instructed the administration to promote an agreement on trade in services under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt during the tokyo round negotiations the tokyo round concluded in 1979 without services agreement but the industrialized countries led by the united states continued to press for its inclusion in later negotiations by contrast developing countries whose service sectors are less advanced than those of the industrialized countries were reluctant to have services covered by international trade rules eventually services were included as part of the uruguay round negotiations launched in 1986 10 during the uruguay round gatt members agreed to new set of rules for services the general agreement on trade in services ga ts and new agency the world trade organization wto to administer the gats the ga tt and the other uruguay round agreements known as the marrakesh agreement 11 trade scholar geza feketekuty identifies three main challenges to constructing rules for international trade in services 1 to target the rules at domestic regulations that are the primary sources of barriers to trade in services 2 to distinguish the legitimate use of regulations to protect the health and safety of residents and from the use of regulations to protect domestic service providers from competition 3 to take into account that most services transactions take 9 bureau of economic analysis us department of commerce sales of services to foreign and us

case of like goods trade12 in addition to these one might identify four th challenge technology advances such as the introduction of the internet make once nontradeable services for example consulting tradeable and also have led to the rapid introduction of services products that can be outsourced across borders all of these challenges suggest set of rules sufficiently flexible to meet them yet sufficiently rigid to provide meaningful discipline to wto members activities g22g145g142g561g8g152g158g155g561g15g152g141g142g156g561g152g143g561g6g142g149g146g159g142g155g162g561 an important element to the structure of the gats and the negotiations to expand the coverage of the ga ts has been the recognition that most services transactions are conducted inside borders and that barriers to trade in services occur in side customs barriers effective trade rules would have to take into account the various modes of delivery in order to discern the barriers that foreign providers of services encounter when trying to sell in tradepartners market the ga ts divides the modes of delivery of services into four categories as will be discussed later the concessions that member country makes in opening up its services market are largely mode dependent the four modes of delivery are crossborder supply mode 1 the service is supplied from one country to another the supplier and consumer remain in their respective countries while the service crosses the border for example us architectural firm based in chicago is hired by client in mexico to design building the us firm does the design in chicago and sends the blueprints to its client in mexico consumption abroad mode 2 the consumer physically travels to another country to obtain the service mexican client travels to the united states to obtain the services of us architectural firm commercial presence mode 3 the supplier of service establishes branch agency or whollyowned subsidiary in another country and supplies services to the local market us architectural firm establishes subsidiary in mexico to sell services to local clients presence of natural persons mode 4 individual supplier travels temporarily to country of consumer us architect travels to mexico to provide design services to her mexican client g22g145g142g561g21g157g155g158g140g157g158g155g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g9g3g22g21g561 the gats is an

trade expansion to promote economic development progressive trade liberalization preservation of member governments right to regulate services sectors to meet national policy objectives and facilitation of participation of developing countries and recognition of special circumstances of least developed countries ldcs the gats is divided into six parts13 part i article i defines the scope of the gats and provides that its provisions apply to all services except those supplied in the routine exercise of government authority to all government barriers to trade in services at all levels of government national regional and local and to all four modes of delivery of services part ii articles iixv presents the principles and obligations these principles and obligations apply to all services sectors whether or not the sectors are specifically listed in members schedule of commitmentsthe list of service sectors that are to be covered by the gats they include unconditional mostfavorednation mfn nondiscriminatory treatment services imported from one member country cannot be treated any less favorably than the services imported from another member country 14 transparency governments must publish rules and regulations to ensure that foreign providers have access to those rules and regulations reasonable impartial and objective administration of government rules and

the number of transactions or value of output the type of legal entity or joint venture through which services may be supplied and the share of foreign capital or total value of foreign direct

sectors or subsectors constitute major portion of members obligations under the ga ts and significant element of the negotiations during the doha development agenda round therefore general explanation of what comprises members schedule of commitments sc is in order each wto member was required to submit sc dur ing the negotiations of the gats each new member is required to submit schedule of commitments when it accedes to the wto each of the national schedules is part of the ga ts the sc has been compared to the tariff schedules of each wto member however the schedules of commitments on services are more complex than the tariff schedules the schedule is divided into four columns the first column lists the sector or subsector for which commitments are made the second column lists for that sector or subsector the restrictions on market access that are to be applied for each of the four modes of delivery the third column lists the restrictions on national treatment that are to be applied for each of the four modes of delivery the fourth column lists any additional commitments the member has made for the sector or subsector the schedule is also divided into two parts in the first part the member country identifies its horizontal commitments that is commitments on trade liberalization that apply to all services sectors and subsectors listed in the schedule the second part lists the sectorspecific commitments the scs tend to be long documents because the wto member must identify each service sector and subsector for which it is making trade liberalization commitment and the member must identify the exceptions on market access and national treatment for each of the four modes of delivery for each sector and subsector

acknowledged that they needed to maintain the momentum of the service negotiations even if comprehensive new round of negotiations was not to be launched thus article xix of the gats required wto members to begin new set of negotiations on services later than five years after the gats entered into force that is 2000 as part of the socalled wto builtin agenda article xix stipulates that participants work to resolve some conceptual and procedural issues fo r example how to provide special treatment to least developed countries the gats also mandates that the negotiations address the issue of government subsidies in trade in services and possible countervailing actions article xv emergency safeguard measures that is measures to counter surges in imports that cause or threaten to cause injury to domestic industry article x and government procur ement in services trade article xiii the new services negotiations began in 2000 but progressed slowly in part because of the adverse political climate caused by the failure of the 1999 wto ministerial in seattle 16 in march 2001 the wtos council for trade in services the body that administers the ga ts and oversees negotiations on services approved the guidelines that shape the current set of negotiations the guidelines incorporate the mandates and procedures rooted in the ga ts the guidelines stipulate objectives and principles the main objective is progressive liberalization of trade in services as means to promote economic growth and development while recognizing the sovereign right of members to regulate services sector and introduce new regulations scope all service sectors and subsectors and all modes of delivery are subject to negotiations negotiations on safeguards measures were to be completed by march 2002 that deadline was extended eventually to the end of the dda modalities and procedures the negotiations are to be conducted in special sessions of the council for trade in services and open to all wto members and acceding countries the starting point of the negotiations would be the scheduled commitments at the time the requestoffer format discussed below is to be used for negotiating new commitments in addition special attention is to be given to the special needs of developing countries in requesting commitments from them and making commitments to them modalities were adopted on

reaffirms the march 2001 guidelines but included deadlines to spur the nego tiators participants were to submit their initial requests for market access and national treatment commitments from each member by june 30 2002 and their initial offers of commitments they would be willing to make by march 31 2003 the services negotiations floundered as deadlines passed the rest of the dda negotiations were on the verge of collapse after the member countries could not agree at the september 2003 ministerial in cancun on modalities for the agriculture negotiations and nonagricultural market access after much consternation and discussion wto members forged negotiating framework or package of objectives to put the round back on track in july 2004 the framework reaffirms the mandates contained in the doha ministerial declaration the july framework specifically charges the negotiators to complete and submit their initial offers as soon as possible to submit revised offers by may 2005 and to ensure that the offers are of high quality these pronouncements were in response to complaints from wto officials that only few of the participants had met the deadlines for initial offers and the quality of those offers left much to be desired although the july framework mentions services only briefly the fact that it was mentioned at all is considered important to the us business community in so doing the dda negotiators placed services on par with the negotiations on agriculture and on market access for nonagricultural goods 18

representatives of interested members the negotiations on national treatment and market access commitments are addressed by all members using the requestoffer format in the initial phase of the negotiations each wto member submits its wishlist or request of what commitments it would like other members to offer to make the negotiations then continue with each member responding to the requests with its initial offer of the commitments it would be willing to make the process continues with more negotiations and revised offers until the parties have reached consensus that the commitment offers of each member are acceptable unlike the negotiations on goods in the wto that are conducted multilaterally among all members at the same time the services requestoffer negotiations consist of many series of simultaneous bilateral plurilateral many participants and multilateral wtowide negotiations among wto members the final set of commitment offers or agreements must be accepted by all members to become part of the ga ts 18 one business representative stated that the services industry had to fight to have services given this level of importance meeting with john goyer vicepresident

manufactured goods trade in virtually all developed and developing economies ga ts rules recognize legitimate needs for governments to regulate services to ensure the health and safety of consumers for example by making sure that lawyers and doctors are qualified to practice their professions however in most governments servi ces sectors are regulated by different agencies depending on the service and one service sector may be regulated by more than one government agency some sectors may be regulated by central or federal agencies while others are regulated by regional or local agencies or perhaps by agencies at various administrative levels service providers whether domestic or foreign must be aware of regulations and regulatory procedures in order to conduct business 19 the

competitive nevertheless as will be noted later not all us wtotrading partners have been so sanguine about the us offers the us offers include horizontal commitments that is commitments that apply to all sectors and subsectors that are listed in the us schedule of commitments the horizontal commitments include the following areas temporary entry of personnel mode4 the united states categorically makes commitments regarding the temporary entry of personnel other than for specific groups of personnel most of whom would be working for foreign firms with affiliates in the united states these include services sales persons who sell within the company but not to the us public and who are in the united states longer than 90days intercorporate transferees managers executives and specialists

developing countries and some developed countries have focused most of their criticism on us commitments and offers under the mode4 category of delivery for example that us offers are restricted to

informationrelated services and audiovisual services the eu argued for smaller list and would allow members to choose to make commitments from certain percentage of the core sectors for all four delivery modes the proposals came as result of chairman jaras request that members develop ways to expedite the process the benchmark proposals met with strong opposition from many developing countries who asserted that it was too late in the negotiation to use different negotiating format and that the established mandate for the dda negotiations specifically requires the requestoffer format to be used proponents of benchmarks responded that they would be used as supplement to the requestoffer approach and not as substitute some developing countries also argued that benchmarks would probably focus on those sectors that the developed countries favored since they wield the most influence 24 the us services business community voiced concern that focusing on benchmarks might divert the attention of negotiators and cause additional delays in the process25 the positive list approach whereby members list only the sectors and subsectors that are to be covered to market access commitments has also been criticized the primary criticism has been that it could be disincentive to market access liberalization the default in the negotiations is that sectors and subsectors are not covered by wto rules unless specifically identified and the schedules of commitments would not cover new sectors and subsectors that emerge in between rounds of negotiations on the other hand this approach is also viewed as more conducive way to get reluctant members particularly developing countries to participate in the negotiations the united states prefers the negative list approach and has used it in free trade agreements g15g152g141g142g556g346g561 mode4 delivery temporary entry of supply personnel has become one of the most controversial issues at this stage of the negotiations in services it has divided many developed countries and developing countries although differing pos itions have emerged among members of each category much of developing country criticism of the united states has been regarding mode4 it has also created some tension between the us business community and the us government all of this criticism is despite the fact that mode4 accounts for less that 1 of world trade in services 26 the controversy arises in part because the issue of mode4 delivery is closely related to immigration policy in the united states and some other countries and comes at

free trade agreements members of the senate judiciary committee and the house judiciary committee objected to the inclusion of changes in us visa policies to allow increases in the quotas of workers entering the united states they argued that changes in visa rules must be separate from trade legislation that is considered by congress under expedited fasttrack procedures compromises were reached to allow the two bills to be voted on but not without bipartisan warnings from both committees that changes in visa policy should longer be part of bilateral or multilateral trade agreements 28 in may

committee asked for his pledge not to negotiate immigration provisions in bilateral or multilateral trade agreements that require changes in united states law the two members argued that the us constitution article i section 8 clause 4 gives the congress exclusive power over immigration policy and that power is usurped when the executive branch negotiates changes in immigration laws in trade agreements that cannot be amended and receive limited debate under trade promotion authority 29 in presentation at public forum george fi shman thenchief counsel house judiciary subcommittee on

negotiations indefinitely on july 24 2006 after meeting of the g6 wto members consisting of the united states the european union japan australia brazil and india failed to agree on the basic conditions or modalities for conducting the agriculture and nama negotiations although the negotiations resumed in 2007 progress on the services negotiations remains sluggish at best even before the suspension the services negotiations had not been going well the services negotiations have been going on for more than five years by most accounts the participants have made little progress at the december 2005 biennial ministerial meeting in hong kong wto negotiators were supposed to have good indication of what final agreements will look like if the doha round is to be completed by the end of 2006 participants have expressed widespread disappointment with the offers that have been made several possible reasons can be cited for the lack of progress one is the division between developed countries that have advanced services sectors employing highlyskilled labor and the developing countries with lessdeveloped services industries the former group seeks market opportunities for its services providers and is more willing to open its markets to competition the latter group is more protective of its domestic services providers the halting progress in the agriculture and nama negotiations in the dda has also affected the services negotiations some developing countries have asserted that they will not improve their offers until the united states and the european union commit to reduce their agriculture subsidies third reason could be the complexity of the agenda of the services negotiations and the number of players involved services includes broad range of economic activities many with few characteristics in common except that they are not goods the trade barriers exporters face differ across services sectors making the formulation of trade rules significant challenge furthermore services negotiations include many participants in addition to trade ministers they include representatives of regulatory agencies many of whom do not consider trade liberalization primary part of their mission 32 world trade organization council for trade in services report by the chairman to the trade negotiations committee 11 july 2005 tns20 available at

this point it is not unusual for negotiations to lag as participants wait to place their best negotiating positions on the table until just before crucial deadlines are reached several factors will determine if and when the services negotiations will be completed one factor is the political will the wto members can muster to overcome the obstacles that plague the negotiations another factor is the extent the various participants are willing to compromise on goals in order to reach agreements and third fact or is how quickly the issues in agriculture and nonagriculture market access are resolved the sooner they are resolved the sooner negotiators can devote their full attention to the services negotiations from december 1318 2005 wto trade ministers held the sixth wto ministerial in hong kong the trade ministers were expected to emerge from meeting with modalities that would accelerate the dda negotiations to their conclusion by the end of 2006 in the hong kong ministerial declaration wto members reaffirmed their comm itment to complete the services negotiations with special consideration given to the needs of developing and the least developed countries annex c to the declaration provides modalities and parameters for completing the negotiations in september 2007 the chairman of the trade in services negotiations began process to develop draft text of an agreement and called on membercountry negotiators to submit contributions however by the end of 2007 it was clear that the countries were still sharply divided on basic objectives developed countries including the united states have argued for membercountries at minimum to commit to binding their current practices on trade in services developing countries including argentina argued against such benchmarks and resisted making additional commitments until developed countries commit to greater reductions of subsidies for agriculture 33
