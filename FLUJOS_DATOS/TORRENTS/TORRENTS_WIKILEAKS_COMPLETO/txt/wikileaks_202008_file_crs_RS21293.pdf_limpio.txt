in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary terrorist nuclear attack on us seapor t could cause local vastation and affect the global economy terrorists might obtai n bomb in several ways though each poses difficulties ability to detect bomb appears limited the united states is using technology intelligence interna tional cooperation etc to try to thwart an attack issues for congress include safeguarding foreign nuclear material mitigating economic effects of an attack and allocating f unds between ports and other pot ential targets this report will be updated as needed background terrorists have tried to obtain weapons of mass destruction wmd chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapons while it woul d probably be more difficult for terrorists to obtain or fabr icate nuclear weapon than ot her wmd an attack using nuclear weapon merits consid eration because it would have much higher consequence us seaports could be targets for terrorist attack terrorist hiroshimasized nuclear bomb 15 kilotons the equivalent of 15000 t ons of tnt detonated in port would destroy buildings out to mile or two start fires especially in port that handled petroleum and chemicals spread fallout over many square miles disrupt commerce and kill many people many ports are in major cities by one estimate 10 to 20kiloton weapon detonated in major seaport would k ill 50000 to 1 million people and would result in direct property da mage of 50 to 500 billion losse s due to trade disruption of 100 billion to 200 billion and indirect costs of 300 billion to 12 trillion1 terrorists might try to smuggle bomb into us port in many ways but containers may offer an attractive route container is metal box typically 8 ft wide by 8½ ft high by 20 ft or 40 ft

shipments leading to devastating consequences for the global economy 5 people can however find ways to minimize economic problems terrorist nuclear weapons routes to bomb terrorist group might obtain bomb perhaps with the yield of the hiroshima bomb by several plausible routes russia strategic longrange nuclear w eapons are reportedly well guarded on missiles or thanks in part to us assistance in storage in st thousands of shorter range loweryield weapons intended for use in combat are less well secured and numbers and locations are uncertain see crs report rl32202 nuclear weapons in russia

6 inches in diameter by 6 feet long it was capped at each end with standard explosive at one end mass of uranium highly enriched in the isotope 235 highly enriched uranium or heu next to the explosive and second heu mass at the other end detonating the explos ive shot one mass of heu into the other rapidly assembling mass large enough to support fission chain reaction plutonium cannot be used this

former s alamos nuclear weapons experts held that such weapon could be constructed by gr oup not previously engaged in designing or building nuclear weapons providing number of requirements were adequately met7 national research council study stated t he basic technical in formation needed to construct workable nuclear device is readily available in the open literature the primary impediment that prevents countries or technically competen t terrorist groups from developing nuclear weapons is the av ailability of snm especially heu8 many believe it would be hard for terrorist group to obtai n enough heu for weapon others fear that terrorists could do so the national research council study rated the threat level from snm from russia as high large inventories of snm are stored at many sites that apparently lack inventory controls and indigenous threats have increased9 responses the main approach to reducing vulnerability to terrorist nuclear attack is defense in depth using multiple methods to detect and interdict weapon it would be harder to evade several methods than one attempts to evade one may make bomb more visible to another or reduce the odds that the bomb w ould work defense in depth also seeks to push detection and interdiction far from us shores this section illustrates the scope of effort see crs report rl31733 port and maritime security background and

strengthens the value of controlling russian nuclear weapons and materials finding that material for bomb detonated in the united states came from russia likely source would in all probability lead to the conclusion that the material was stolen rather than that russia conducted the attack at the same time augmenting alreadyexcellent forensic capability through technology and intelligence could help deter other nations from giving nuclear materials to terrorists ports in major cities the terrorist weapons disc ussed earlier while lower in yield than strategic weapons might produce bl ast damage over radius of 1 to 2 miles and fire and fallout beyond that range accord ingly it might be argued that ports with the greatest number of people living or working within mile or two of cargo docks such as philadelphia and new york shoul d have highest priority in receiving security resources ameliorating economic consequences cold war civil defense studies examined how to ameliorate the

containers have just begun terrorists may be deterred by significant chance of failure20 improving the ability to detect terrorist nuclear weapons in the maritime transpor tation system may make terrorist attack on port less likely to succeed and thus less probable the american association of port authorities trade ssociation welcomed federal grants for port security upgrades to comply with
