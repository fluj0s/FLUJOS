see eg cms nursing homes must return unused meds united press intl mar 27 2006 reporting that medicaid requires nursing homes to return unused medications to pharmacies when patients leave or die however these i ssues are beyond of the scope of this report currently many health care institutions especially long term care fac ilities ltcfs routinely dispose of medications that otherwis have useful life this practice typically occurs when drugs are dispensed to patie nts but remain unused because the patient switches medication is discharged or dies studies ve estimated that more than one billion dollars worth of drugs are dis carded each year in the united states3 one way to counter this costly practice is to recycle the unused medications however the ability to implement recycling programs may be cons trained by federal ndor state law current regulation of pharmaceuticals and those who dispense them consists of complex system of federal nd state laws there are three federal laws di scussed below that may impede the practice of recycling medications at the state level state controlled substances laws pharmacy laws and other ru promulgated by state boards of pharmacy govern practices relating to the manufactur distribution and possession of medicines nevertheless state legislatures that have implemented drug recycling programs appear to tailor them to conform to existing regulations state laws vary greatly regarding who may return and accept the medications which medications may be recycled and the procedures in place to safeguard against adulteration or unlawful possession of the medications federal laws affecting reuse of drugs federal laws regulating pharmaceuticals pose potential obstacles to the implementation of drug recy cling programs specifically many of the medications covered by recycling programs are consider ed controlled substances and thus are subject to the requirements of the c ontrolled substances act csa4 furthermore most if not all of the drugs in question also require prescription in order to be dispensed and therefore are regulated by the federa l food drug and cosm etics act ffdca5 thus adding another layer of federal statutory re gulations additionally programs to recycle medications may also encounter logistical problems relating to billing under the health insurance accountability and portability act hipaa6 controlled substances act one potential impediment to drug recyclin g programs is the csa enacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and controlling traffic in

federal drug enforcemen t agency dea the csa establishes civil as well as criminal sanctions for its violation the csa is relevant to drug recycling programs because most if not all of the costly medications the programs seek to recycle are considered controlled substances under the csa9 practitioners who dispense or administer controlled substances listed on schedules ii through v including substances that may not require prescription must register with the dea10 entities that apply for federal registration to handle controlled substances and those so registered must provide effective c ontrols and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances in accordance with security requirements these requirements vary depending on the ty pe of activity and the substances11 however unlike hospitals and pharmacies most longterm care facilities ltcfs are not registrants12 due to the stringent safety standards imposed on registrants registration may not be feasible or costeffective for many facilities to implement because of the prohibition against handling or possessing controlled substances without dea registration the csa seems to preclude ltcfs or any entity not registered with the dea from effectively participating in drug recycling program as result the dea distribution system which is designed to prevent diversion by establishing closed distribution loop among registrants for pur poses of tracking all entities that handle controlled substances prior to dispensing often prevents ltcfs from returning such drugs to pharmacy stock and forces them to destroy any unused controlled substances13 an alternative to recycling programs that ltcfs may wish to pursue is the installation of automated dispensing systems ads similar to vending machine an ads is stocked with drugs by pharmacy which controls the device remotely and programs it to dispense drugs on singledose basis the dea recently promulgated rule to allow this practice as way to mitigate the problem of excess stocks andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22491crs4 14 see preventing the accumulation of surplus controlled substances at long term care facilities 70 f r 25462 25462

pharmacists may be legally lia ble for injuries arising from contamination or adulteration of drugs they accepted and returned to stock 18 providers that would participate in drug re cycling programs are likely subject to hipaa because hipaa applies to health care provider s who bill or receive payment for health care in the normal course of business and do so via elect ronic medium health insurance portability and accountability act 160103b31disposal14 using this system the drugs are not deemed to be dispensed until provided by the ads so any unused drugs remain in pharmacy stock federal food drug and cosmetics act recycling programs must also comply with statutes that regulate the safety and efficacy of prescription drugs federally this regulation occurs under the ffdca one of the purposes of the ffdca is to ensure drug safety by prohibiting the introduction of adulterated or misbranded f oods drugs or cosmetics into interstate commerce15 therefore programs to recycle unused pres cription drugs may encounter barriers if such recycling could lead to drug adulteration or misbranding the federal food and drug administrations fda policy guidance reflects these concerns in guidance that dates back to 1980 the agency states pharmacist should not return drug products to his stock once they have been out of his possession it could be dangerous practice for pharmacists to accept and return to stock the unused portions of prescriptions that are returned by pa trons because he would longer have any assurance of the strength quality purity or identity of the articles16 however the fda has specific regulations regarding drug r ecycling programs and leaves these programs to the discretion of the state so long as state legislation does not offend applicable regulations relating to the safety and efficacy of prescription medications17 health insurance portability and accountability act smaller administrative obstacle to the ffective implementation of drug recycling programs is the billing requirements under hipaa18 this law requires electronic transactions for operations conducted by pharmacies the entities that are responsible for accepting unused medications in many r ecycling programs every transaction that occurs within pharmacy must be part of the hipaa transactions code set however there is currently code for returning an unus ed drug to stock for credit without thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22491crs5 19 see fred gebhart medication recycling new patients for old pills 149 d rug topics 37 2005 20 as of 2005 the following states have medicati on

drug recycling programs19 current state practice in recent years several states have attempted to combat waste associated with discarding unused medications by creating drug recycling programs20 these programs arent as simple as returning leftovers21 rather most state legislation typically specifies who may return the unused dication who may accept the medication what types of medications may be returned and to whom the medications may be redistributed22 this section provides examples of current practices regarding such recycling programs authorized participants most laws specify who may return who may accept andor who may receive unused medications23 some states allow patients to donate while others restrict the practice to pha rmacies doctors and w holesale distribution centers iowa which falls in the former category allows any person to donate unused medications24 in contrast california law allows donations only from drug manufacturers licensed health care facilities and pharmacies authorized medications some states do not place restrictions on the drugs included in their recycling program while ot hers specify the types they will accept for example nebraska restricts

began its recycling program as cancer drug repository but later expanded it to include prescription drugs and supplies for all othe r chronic diseases such as diabetes26 additional precautions states also impose restrictions to ensure that the medications are safe safety requirements are fairly uniform across most states they typically require that medica tions be in their original unopened sealed packaging or in single unit doses that are individually cont ained in unopened tampe revident packaging27 most states also prohibit the return of medications that will expire within six months or appear to be adulterated or misbranded in any way28 despite the precautions states have attempted to build into their recycling programs some people remain unconvinced that th programs are completely safe29 critics argue that insufficient safety controls may lead to adulterated dangerous medicines and drugs that land in the wrong hands they also argue that the actual process of repackaging medications can pose safety hazards30 nevertheless states seem intent on continuing to tailor their legislation in order to conform to existing law while simultaneously acting as laboratories to test new costeffective measures
