decision 200316 the investigation task force itf received numerous legations of improprieties in relation to the procurement construction and occup ation of six apartments owned by the airport named lamela iv ii background information 2 the itf investigators began their investigation with thorough analysis of the development of the previously built twentytwo apar tments denominated lamela i ii and iii this analysis included fact finding s to the construction and ownership of lamela i ii and iii as well as inquiries into the reasons for the subsequent construction of lamela iv which is the subject mat ter of this investigation 3 in the former republic of yugoslavia under the employee housing law employees could contribute part of their salary to general fund that would be used for benefits such as medical care vacations and housing under that regime workers were put on list for the provision of apartments according t seniority job type work record and other factors with those at the head of the li st eventually obtaining an apartment 4 therefore under this yugoslavian law during the years 19961998 the then managing director of peap requested municipality au thorities to grant airport pristina land to build apartments the planned apar tments were divided in three separate structures lamela i ii and iii once th land had been identified and assigned peap management commissioned the construc tion of total of twentytwo apartments within these three structures 5 the eligible employees competed for the assignme nt of an apartment or that of credit value the evaluation for apartment assignme nt was based on points allocation scheme through airport pristina once th list of the twentytwo assigned persons had been decided and completed predecis ion was submitted which would eventually if objections were raised become the final decision 2 6 at that point the apartments would be assigned to the airport employees for their use the government then decided to privatize these airport apartments and the tenants were granted the chance to purchase their partment based on court verified contract under stipulated estimation f the value of each apartment including the options of lumpsum payments or month ly installments for up to 40 years 7 the nato actions in 1999 saw many serbs flee pri stina and vacate their apartments some apartments were occupied by squatters some we re sold by the owners at reduced price other owners rented their apartment to unmik international staff the current owners of the twentytwo airport apartm ents consist of thirteen serbians and nine albanians who are all current airport empl oyees the divisional manager owns one of these flats 8 however it must be noted that in 1998 thirteen banian airport workers that should have received apartments under this system were nied their apartments they therefore filed appeals to pristinas municipal cou rt 9 correspondence in the possession of the itf show s that in 1999 under the new unmik regime official 1 of unmik pillar ii in ord er to appease these staff suggested to airport officials that they commence b uilding an additional six apartments on land adjacent to the existing twenty two apartments four other apartments owned by the airport were allocated to s ome of these staff with the remaining three other staff not returning to kosovo after the war the six topranking persons on the airport evaluation list staff membe r 1 staff member 2 staff member 3 committee chairman committee member 1 and staff member 5 were allocated the apartments in lamela iv 10 in order to level the land and to construct the foundations and the concrete framework for the six new apartments the divisional manager after discussion with official 2 of transport

pertinent documents relevant to the investigation such as leases building permits land title and correspondence cerning the award construction and payments were translated from albanian to engli sh the itf investigators reviewed relevant unmik rules and regulations the provisional criminal code of kosovo as well as certain previous rules and regul ations of the yugoslav republic v investigative details 12 itf investigators conducted the investigation i n five phases in phasei they examined the proceedings that led to building the partment foundations and frame in phaseii investigators examined the award of contract for the finishing works of lamela iv in phaseiii the investigators examined issues concerning the commercial rent of the ground floor phaseiv deals with the m isappropriation of municipality fees paid for lamela iv in phasev itf investigato rs identified additional expenses drawn from the peap budget for works not provided f or in the bidding documents and contract phase i original bid and award of contract for the foundation and frame 13 itf established from all parties concerned in cluding the divisional manager and vendor 1 representative that the bidding exercise tender for the lamela iv 8 compound was conducted in two phases phasei cover ing the framework and foundations of the building whereas phaseii provid ed for the bulk of the remaining works the divisional manager explained this split of operations to itf investigators by pointing out that the airport did not immediatel have dem 12 million readily available to launch one full tender for the entire contract while at the same time being heavily pressured by airport employees to commence the construction of lamela iv 14 itf investigators obtained and reviewed the tract for the construction of the apartment building foundations and frame the divis ional manager told itf investigators that he had selected committee cons isting of staff member 3 staff member 4 and committee member 1 that conducted lective shopping exercise notwithstanding the estimated contract value exceed ing dem 50000 as foreseen in article 613 of the finance administrative instruc tion 21999 the divisional manager explained this contravention by pointing ou t that until 2002 peap did not have procurement officer according to him the p rocurement rules were not clear he therefore sought the advice of an experienced ko sovo lawyer who advised him to proceed as planned 15 vendor 1 representative told itf investigators that his company had done work at the airport for years and that the divisional manag er and staff member 2 had approached him and asked if he would be interested in building the apartments for the airport vendor 1 representative replied that he wa s very interested vendor 1 representative went on to say that he was contacted by member of the committee he did not recall who and was asked for per sq uare meter price for the work vendor 1 representative gave his price of dem 275 p er square meter 16 the divisional manager stated that heshe was f amiliar with the construction company vendor 1 because of previous work they h ad done at the airport moreover heshe knew that vendor 1 would accept being paid when the divisional manager raised the money as opposed to when it was due 17 vendor 1 representative told the itf that the d ivisional manager had asked himher to supply the prices of two other competitors vend or 1 representative admitted that heshe approached two construction companies known to himher vendor 2 and vendor 3 in order to obtain their offers conseque ntly as requested by vendor 1 representative and premeditated by the divisional m anager these companies gave their offers at higher price than vendor 1 namel at dem 295 and dem 300 per square meter respectively vendor 1 representative added that heshe did not know if either of these companies was ever contacted by the divisional manager or staff member 2 18 on 1 july 2000 vendor 1 was selected as the successful bidder by the evaluation committee and on 2 july 2000 the contract was drawn and signed between peap and vendor 1 stipulating costs of dem 30000000 for the construction of the building framework and foundations 19 immediately thereafter vendor 1 began the fi rst part of the construction works foundations concrete frame and site leveling even though peap was still not in 9 possession of the main technical project with speci fied quantity calculations the required municipality building permitauthorization and the document of ownership for the construction lot nevertheless vendor 1 re presentative continued to work as both the divisional manager and staff member 2 assu red himher that this documentation would be ready shortly 20 the divisional manager told itf investigators t hat the architectural firm had prepared the architectural drawings and had indicat ed the construction quantities that would be used for the project the divisional manag er informed itf investigators that an engineer working for the airport as contr actor airport engineer was tasked by himher to review and monitor the project works and drawings of the architectural firm as well as the works of vendor 1 21 vendor 1 representative told itf investigators that in spite of this lack of documents heshe did not stop the airport works because in th stipulated contract article 4 guaranteed that dem 30000000 was only downpaym ent and the final price would be based on the final calculated quantity the fini shed frame costs ended up dem 48400103 phase ii contract for finishing the airport apa rtments 22 on 11 november 2000 peap placed an advertiseme nt in the local newspaper asking for contractors to pick up bid packages for the com pletion of the airport apartments the contractors had seven days to pick up the bid p ackages and another seven days to return their bid proposals the divisional manager selected as evaluation committee members committee chairman committee member 1 committee member 2 committee member 3 committee member 4 committee member 5 none of the committee members had any experience in evaluating bid proposals for construction contracts both the committee chairman and committee member 1 were to be awarded an apartment in lamela iv commi ttee member 1 was not present at the evaluation committee meeting hesh stated that the following day the committee chairman told himher to sign the app roval to award the tender to vendor 1 committee member 4 is staff member 2s daughter 23 itf investigators established that the bid docu ments contained description of the works already completed in phasei and asked the bi dders to price these items as the framework and foundation works had not been properl tendered for in contravention of finance administration instructio n 21999 article 613 it appears that the divisional manager and staff membe r 2 had designed this strategy in order to conceal the nontransparent award of the f ramework and foundations deleted 10 contract at this time the municipality had not au thorized the construction license for the already accomplished works 24 the divisional manager then undertook an unorth odox procedure regarding the payment for these works itf investigators establis hed that the bidding terms called for an upfront payment of dem 32000000 at the sig ning of the contract both the divisional manager and vendor 1 representative stat ed that the upfront payment was intended to cover the work performed under the prev ious contract the divisional manager stated that the bidders were told that dem 30000000 would be deducted from their bid as the framefoundation work had ready been finished under the previous contract the divisional manager could not recall who had advised the bidders accordingly the itf investigators found evidence that he advised any of the bidders other than vendor 1 25 vendor 1 representative told itf investigators that during the conclusion of the works in phasei heshe was approached by the divi sional manager and staff member 2 who advised himher that an airport tende r would be published in regard to the continuation of lamela iv the divisional ma nager and staff member 2 advised himher that should he participate they would make sure that heshe would be awarded the second contract even if heshe was not the lowest bidder 26 fifteen bids were presented of which four were considered incomplete of the remaining eleven the committee selected the fourth highest bidder vendor 1 the same company that had already constructed the origi nal frame for the apartments in its summary written report under article 239112 of finance administrative instruction 21999 giving reason for this sel ection the evaluation committee stated analyzing all the offers the commission ag rees that the work to be performed by vendor 1 the general price dem 133975580 ve ndor 1 from prishtina has performed important construction works on airport p rishtina and it has always performed than with success that is why so again th is round they entrusted the work performance on this enterprise 27 consequently as premeditated by the divisional manager staff member 2 and vendor 1 representative vendor 1 was awarded the contract with bid of dem 133977580 nevertheless the divisional manager presented contract totaling dem 120000000 to vendor 1 representative the di visional manager told itf investigators that there was only dem 12 million i n the budget for the apartments and heshe accordingly advised vendor 1 representat ive that if heshe wanted the contract heshe would have to accept price of dem 12 million vendor 1 representative replied that heshe had officially w on the bid at dem 133977580 but the divisional manager explicitly threatened ve ndor 1 representative to withdraw the award of the tender if heshe did not comply with the price of dem 120000000 by that time vendor 1 representative stated that heshe had already spent large amount of company funds on the projec t and therefore heshe complied 28 the divisional manager admitted that heshe had not sought the dsrsgs approval for this contract although the amount of money allo cated exceeded dem 100000000 as required by article 623 of financ administrative instruction 11 21999 the divisional manager stated that from his point of view such approval was not necessary as the funds allocated for this tende r belonged to peap 29 the divisional manager appointed staff member 2 to oversee the construction of the building staff member 2 who was also assigned an apartment in lamela iv readily admitted that heshe had construction ex perience and that hisher function was to see how many men were on the site and how th works were progressing as well as reporting hisher observations to the divis ional manager 30 vendor 1 representative told itf investigators that only during the finalization phase of the lamela iv works did heshe receive the buil dings volume and quantity calculations heshe then realized that the already built frame was not in compliance with the tender document preliminary measurements and estimation but was one third larger vendor 1 representative immediately c ontacted the architectural firm who verified the error and subsequently provided ve ndor 1 representative letter stating that in the projects foldup there had be neglect of the dimensions namely instead of tender extension 2 tender extens ion 3 had been submitted as the project to construct this tender had smaller qua ntity because the specifications referred to smaller complex 31 vendor 1 representative stated that heshe had warned the divisional manager immediately of the problem and afterwards was conta cted by committee chairman and staff member 2 who both told him not to worry b ecause at the end of the construction they would pay him according to his wo rks vendor 1 representative suspected that the divisional manager had always be aware of the smaller quantities as per the specifications of the tender phase iii commercial use of the ground floor of lamela iv 32 itf investigators reviewed the building plans gainst the actual building the building plans for lamela iv designated the ground floor as storage area or space that could be used for parking the itf investigato rs thoroughly checked the main project designed by the architectural firm and depo sited with the municipality the itf found that changes in the specifications wer submitted the itf confirmed this in interviews of the architectural firms proj ect designer and former managing director 33 itf investigators established that the ground f loor areas of lamela iv were converted into office spaces that have been rented to local b usinesses and international agencies the divisional manager stated to the itf that this had never been officially requested therefore never authorized by peap he greed that this was an illegal procedure as the apartments were given only for fa mily use and there wasis regulationcontractclause that states that tenan t may sublet or modify hisher apartment dwelling or any other facilities in lamel aiv 34 itf investigators interviewed the project manag er consulting company employment regeneration the project manager stated that heshe had been renting ground floor office space in lamela iv from staff m ember 2 and the committee 12 chairman since november 2003 for monthly sum resp ectively of 90000 and 82500 ie for total amount of 172500 per m onth the project manager remembered third office not under his responsibi lity which had been rented out to another company 35 vendor 1 representative confirmed to the itf th at staff member 2 and the airport engineer had verbally instructed himher to change the ground floor area into offices space heshe confirmed that the ground floor had b een designated as garagesstorage rooms but stated that staff member 2 had requested these modifications after the finalization of lamela iv the airport engineer was given full time employment with peap heshe is currently an airport pristina emplo yee phase iv municipality compensation fee 36 the itf determined that the payment of municipa lity fees totaling dem 4170840 was an indispensable prerequisite for the permit f use of the lamela iv apartments the original receipt obtained from airport document ation shows that dem 2500000 was paid in cash on 7 september 2000 by staff mem ber 2 to the municipality on 26 june 2002 the remaining sum of dem 1670840 85 4243 was paid by bank transfer and received in bank account meb 10015960 0101 however the itf checked the municipality records and found trace of the dem 2500000 having been deposited in either of the two disclosed munic ipality bank accounts meb 100159600001 since 11 february 2000 and meb 100 159600101 since november 2000 or registered in any logbook during the years 199920002001 37 staff member at the directorate of finance an d property municipality of pristina stated to the itf that the cash was on daily bas is initially put into the cash box and then deposited into the meb account 100159600001 heshe added that receipt was found as proof of the dem 2500000 being put i nto the cash box the municipality accounting office documentation dates back to 1999 and contains the names of persons who deposited cash into the bank nd other specifics for each deposit transaction after thorough search the s taff member informed itf investigators that evidence could be found to sh ow the questioned amount dem 2500000 receipt issued on 7 september 2000 was deposited into either of the municipality bank accounts used for this purpose 38 the information acquired and the signature on t he only receipt document in possession of peap revealed that dem 2500000 was indeed paid in cash by the airport authorities to an official of the municipal ity of pristina the official when interviewed by the itf clearly remembered the paym ent and stated that as municipality bank account existed at that time he she had collected the money together with another official according to the official of the municipality of pristina they placed the sum of dem 2500000 in t he municipality safe and subsequently used it for petty cash expenditures 39 however the staff member at the directorate of finance and property stated that the possibility of using the money collected from taxes and other financial obligations as petty cash must be excluded the maximum amount of petty cash as authorized by 13 the ministry of finance is dem 500000 furtherm ore whenever any petty cash is expended the directorate of finance and property w ould send the receipts of those expenses to the ministry of finance before obtainin g the approval for additional petty cash the official of the municipality of pristina when confronted with these facts confessed that heshe had signed the receipt of d em 2500000 however heshe was unable to provide the itf investigators with an further information documentation or explanation on that matter phase v extra works 40 vendor 1 representative informed the itf of an additional sum of dem 5047350 spent by the airport for extra works carried out in relation to lamela iv vendor 1 representative told the itf that heshe was request ed by the divisional manager and staff member 2 to fictitiously make it look like ce rtain extra works heating cable tv sidewalk had been completed by vendor 1 thr ough subcontracting with other firms when in fact vendor 1 representative had not executed these works vendor 1 representative told the itf that staff mem ber 2 submitted document to vendor 1 representative for signature stating the w orks and amounts conducted as if hisher company was invoicing airport pristina ven dor 1 representative stated that heshe initially did not understand the reason for this scheme but added that heshe later realized that the divisional manager and staf f member 2 used himher to deceive peap and obtain funds for private purposes from peapkta vendor 1 representative added that the divisional manager an d staff member 2 used the excuse of vendor 1 representatives fictitious invo ice of allegedly unpredicted extra works to have additional equipment installed in the ir apartments and also have amongst other things sidewalk built around lame i ii iii and iv procedure clearly not covered by the peapkta budget authoriz ation according to vendor 1 representative the three companies that conducted these extra works were construction company 1 construction company 2 and construction company 3 41 regarding the payment of dem 5047350 out of t he peapkta budget vendor 1 representative told itf investigators that the comm ittee chairman had called himher to the bank to collect hisher outstanding money once at the bank the committee chairman presented money transfer autho rization of 9551554 to vendor 1 representative the amount of 9551554 contained the outstanding part of vendor 1 representatives invoice to peap dem 1 3633866 as well as dem 5047350 for the extra works these sums had to be converted into euros as at the time of payment the dem had been replaced by the euro as the official currency 42 the committee chairman told vendor 1 representa tive that heshe would only hand over the money transfer to vendor 1 representative if vendor 1 representative immediately upon withdrawal of the cash returned the equivalent of dem 5047350 2580669 for the extra works to the committee chairman therefore and in order to receive the money of hisher outsta nding bill vendor 1 representative complied by cashing the entire money transfer and h anding over the extra works amount of the money to the committee chairman cons equently the committee chairman received 5047350 dem from the airport bu dget 14 43 construction company 1 owner told itf investiga tors that heshe had received sum of dem 999000 for accomplished works directly fro m staff member 2 construction company 1 owner added that heshe was contacted directly by staff member 2 for the job itf investigators confronted construction company 1 owner with copy of an internal airport documentinvoice allegedly issued by vendor 1 which instead represented the invoiced amount of m 1424000 suggesting additional expenses of dem 425000 construction c ompany 1 owner stated that heshe had never received dem 1424000 but only m 999000 therefore it appears that the divisional manager and staff membe r 2 withdrew dem 425000 from the kta budget after having inflated glob comp anys invoice to the amount of dem 1424000 through the fictitious vendor 1 inv oice as for statements also supplied to the itf investigators by the other two companies invoice was ever issued on their behalf for the extra works vi conclusions 44 itf concludes that the procurement process for the foundations and framework component of the lamela iv apartment complex was co nducted in nontransparent manner in contravention of articles 411 43 and 13 of the finance administrative instruction 21999 the divisional manager wh directed the procurement exercise influenced the procurement process in fa vour of vendor 1 by asking vendor 1 representative to submit bid and supply two false offers of two other companies 45 consequently by obstructing truly competiti ve bidding process the divisional manager made peap enter into harmful contract pr ohibited by article 237 pcck moreover by violating articles 411 43 and 13 f finance administrative instruction 21999 the divisional manager cons ciously violated the law and caused substantial damage to the business operation s of peap thereby fulfilling the criteria of article 233 pcck irresponsible economi c activity furthermore the divisional manager abused hisher official position and authority to obtain an unlawful material benefit the award of the ct for vendor 1 thereby abusing hisher official authority in contravention of article 339 pcck in addition the divisional manager failed to perform hisher du ties to protect the peap funds with the intent of obtaining an unlawful benefit fo r vendor 1 breach of trust article 269 pcck 46 the divisional manager violated article 623 f finance administrative instruction 21999 by awarding contract exceeding dem 10 0000000 and lacking the requisite approval of the dsrsg 47 the divisional manager disregarded article 61 3 of finance administrative instruction 21999 by conducting selective shop ping for procurement
