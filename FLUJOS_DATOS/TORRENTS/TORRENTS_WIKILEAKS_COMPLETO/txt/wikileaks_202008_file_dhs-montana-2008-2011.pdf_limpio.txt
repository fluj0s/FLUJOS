discussionbased exercises are normally used as starti ng points in the buildingbloc k approach to the cycle mix and range of exercises discussionbased exercises include seminars workshops tabletop exercises ttxs and games these types of exercises typically highlight existing plans policies mutual aid agreements maas and procedures thus they are exceptional tools for familiarizing agencies and personnel with current or expected jurisdictional capabi lities discussionbased exercises typically focus on strategic policyoriented issues opera tionsbased exercises focus more on tactical responserelated issues facilitators andor presenters usua lly lead the discussion keeping par ticipants on track while meeting the objectives of the exercise seminars seminars are generally used to orient participants or to provid an overview of authorities strategies plans policies procedures protocols resp onse resources or concepts and id eas seminars provide good starting point for jurisdictions that are developing or making major changes to their pl ans and procedures they offer the following attributes informal discussions led by seminar leader lack of time constraints caused by realtime portrayal of events lowstress environment using number of instruc tion techniques such as lectures multimedia presentations panel discussions case study di scussions expert testim ony and decision support tools proven effectiveness with both small and large groups workshops workshops represent the second tier of exercises in the homeland s ecurity exercise and evaluation program hseep buildingblock ap proach although similar to seminars workshops differ in two important aspects particip ant interaction is increase d and the focus is on ach ieving or building product such as plan or policy workshops provide an ideal forum for the following building teams collecting or sharing information obtaining consensus obtaining new or different perspectives problem solving of complex issues testing new ideas processes or procedures training groups in coordinated activities in conjunction with exercise development workshops are most useful in achiev ing specific aspects of exercise design such as the following determining evaluation elements and standards of performance determining program or exercise objectives developing exercise scenario and key events listings for official use only appendix d exercise types d2 state of montana for official use only workshop may be used to produce new standard ope rating procedures sops emergency operations plans eops maas multiyear exercise plans and im provement plans ips to be effective workshops must be highly focused on specific issue and th desired outcome or goal must be clearly defined potential relevant topics and goals are numerous but all workshops share the following common attributes effective with both small and large groups facilitated working breakout sessions goals oriented toward an identifiable product information conveyed using diffe rent instructional techniques lack of time constraint from realtime portrayal of events lowstress environment nofault forum plenary discussions led by workshop leader tabletop exercises ttxs ttxs involve senior sta ff members elected or appoint ed officials or other key personnel in an informal setting discussing simulated s ituations this type of exercise is in tended to stimulate discussion of various issues regarding hypothetical situation it can be used to assess plans polic ies and procedures or to assess types of systems needed to guide the prevention of re sponse to and recovery from defined incident ttxs are typically aimed at facilitating derstanding of concepts identifyi ng strengths and shortfalls andor achieving change in attitude participants are encourag ed to discuss issues in depth and develop decisions through slowpaced problem solving rather than the rapid spontaneous decisionm aking that occurs under actual or simulated emergency conditions in contrast to the scale and cost of operationsbased exercises and games ttxs can be costeffective tools when used in conjunction with more complex exercises the effectiveness of ttx is derived from the energetic involvement of participants and their assessment of recommended revisions to current policies procedures and plans ttx methods are divided into two ca tegories basic and advanced in basic ttx the scene set by the scenario materials remains constant it describes an event or emergency incide nt and brings discussion participants up to the simulated present time players apply their knowledge and skil ls to list of problems presented by the facilitator problems are discussed as group and resolution is generally agreed upon and summarized by the leader in an advanced ttx play fo cuses on delivery of prescr ipted messages to players that alter the original scenario the exercise facilitator usually introduces problems one at time in the form of written message simulated telephone call videotape or other means participants discuss the issues raised by the problem using appropriate plans and pr ocedures ttx attributes may include the following achieving limited or specific objectives assessing interagency coordination conducting specific case study examining personnel contingencies familiarizing senior officials with situation participating in information sharing practicing group problem solving testing group message interpretation operationsbased exercises operationsbased exercises are used to validate the pl ans policies agreements nd

operationsbased exercises are characterized by actual response mob ilization of apparatus and resource s and commitment of personnel usually over an extended period of time drills drill is coordinated supervised activity usually used to test single specific operation or function in single agency drills are commonly used to provide trai ning on new equipment develop or test new policies or procedures or practice and maintain current skills typical attributes include the following narrow focus measured against established standards instant feedback performance in isolation realistic environment functional exercises fes an fe also known as command post exercise cpx is designed to test and evaluate individual capabilities multiple functions or activities within function or interdependent groups of functions fes generally focus on exercising the plans policies procedures and staffs of the direction and control nodes of the incident command system ics and unified command generally in cidents are projected through an exercise scenario with event updates that drive activ ity at the management level movement of personnel and equipment is simulated the objective of the fe

and honed in previous smaller operationsbased exercises the events are projected through scripted exercise scenario with builtin flexibility to allow updates to drive ac tivity it is conducted in realtime stressful environment that closely mirrors real incident first responders and resources are mobilized and deployed to the scene where they conduct their actions as if real incident had occurred with minor exceptions the fse simulates the reality of operations in multiple functional areas by presenting complex and realistic problems that require critical thinking rapid problem solving and effective responses by trained personne l in highly stressful environment other entities that are not involved in the exercise but that would be involved in an actual incident should be instructed not to respond for official use only appendix d exercise types d4 state of montana for official use only an fse provides an opportunity to execute plans procedures and maas in re sponse to
