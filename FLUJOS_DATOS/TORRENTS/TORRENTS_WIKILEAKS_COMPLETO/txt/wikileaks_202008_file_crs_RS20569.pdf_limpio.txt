specialist in natural resources policy resources science and industry division h steven hughes analyst in environmental and natural resources policy resources science and industry division summary water resources management often i nvolves tradeoffs among user groups environmental interest s and local regional and nati onal interests water resources development is partic ularly controversial because of budgetary constraints conflicting policy objectives environmental impacts nd demands for local control hurricane katrina brought to the forefront longsimmeri ng policy disputes involving local control federal financing environmental and soci tradeoffs and multi level account ability and responsibility for water infrastructure proj ects such as levees construction improvement and mana gement of other federal wate r resource projects eg locks dams and diversi on facilities face s imilar challenges the 110th congress faces numerous issues and tradeoffs as it considers water resource development technology water suppl and climate change legislation these issues are likely to arise as congress cons iders authorizations and appropriations for bureau of reclamation and army corps of engineers projects eg water resources development act of 2007 hr 1495 and ag ency policy and program changes eg water reuse federal project operations and oversight of eco system restoration programs such as calfed and everglades oversi ght issues related to hurricane katrina and the federal role in hurricane and flood protection and lev ee construction and management also are ongoing introduction the federal government has long hist ory of involvement in water resource development and manage ment to facilitate wa terborne transporta tion expand irrigated agriculture reduce flood losses and more recently restore aquatic ecosystems increasing pressures on the qua lity and quantity of availa ble water supplies due to growing population environmen tal regulation instream sp ecies and ecosystem needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20569crs2 water source contamination agricultural wa ter demand climate va riability and changing public interests have resulted in heightened water use conflicts throughout the country particularly in the west federal water resource construction wane d during the last decades of the 20th century in response to fiscal constraints interest in more local control of water and land resources and requirements to ssess environmental impacts of fede ral actions and to protect fish and wildlife this marked the end of expansionist federal policies of the early 20th century that had led to widespread federal investment in dams navigation locks irrigation diversions and levees and basinwide planning and development efforts the 110th congress is faced with numerous water resource issues regarding the federal role in the planning construction maintenance insp ection and financing of water resource projects and federal i nvestment in water resources research and data collection congress makes these decisions within the context of multiple and often conflicting laws and objectives competing legal decisions and entrenched institutional mechanisms including centuryold water rights and long standing contractual obligations although most water resource legislation typically addre sses sitespecific needs certain themes and issues appear in many local and regional wa ter resources conflicts for example demand for new project services eg improved na vigation new water suppl improved or new flood control facilities protec tion of threatened and enda ngered species and water quality concerns are common to many conflicts even so most water resource legislation deals with specific sites the 110th congress is considering sitespecific restoration legislation for coastal louisiana the upper mississippi riverillinois waterway sy stem the great lakes the san joaquin river and the platte river however the more typical sitespecific measures on smaller scale are the hundreds of individual water resources projects authorized through water resources development acts wrdas and standalone bills addressing new water supply technologies and augmentation of existing water supplies rural water supply development and indian water rights settlements oversight of existing laws and projects eg central valley project flood protection in new or leans and sacramento and project operations is also ex pected especially where court decisions agency actions or other circumstances suc h as drought may affect project operations eg federal projects on the colorado columbia klamath missouri rio grande and san joaquin rivers and pumps in the california baydelta background in the west naturally scarce water supp lies and increasing ur ban populations have spawned new debates over wate r allocation particularly over water for threatened or endangered species and have increased federalstate tensions since the federal government has generally deferred to state primacy in intrastate water allocation observed changes in the timing of snowme lt and runoff and the potential for further climate variability due to climate change has increased concerns about the reliability of developed water supplies and the flexibility of existing management mechanisms western water legislation during the 110th congress centers on project management and program issues such as san joaquin river settlement legislation the bureau of reclamations title 16 water reclamation and recycling program and sustainability of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20569crs3 1 for example the senate version of wrda 2007 includes provisions establishing national levee safety program and requiring independent safety assurance reviews of

project and colorado river operations also may continue nationally congressional attention during the 110th congress may focus on the federal role in levee cons truction maintenance and ev aluation and water resources management generally1 hurricane katrina oversight issues such as how to better coordinate federal ac tivities and how to respond or rebu ild in the wake of catastrophic damages may be of particular focus as might the examination of other areas of the country that may also be vulnerable so of concern nationwide is the status of threatened and endangered species and the hea lth of the nations rivers and riparian areas federal obligations to protect threatened nd endangered species nd other environmental quality requirements have re sulted in increased attention to river and watershed restoration efforts the fede ral government is involved in several signifi cant restoration initiatives ranging from the florida everglades to the california baydelta calfed2 at the same time the demand for tr aditional or new water supply projects navigational improvements fl ood control projects and beach and shoreline protection continues in fact both the everglades and baydelta restor ation efforts include significant water supply components c ontroversy over how much water should be divided among recovering threatened and endangered species protecting water quality and supplying farms cities and other uses has been ongoing further widespread drought throughout different pa rts of the country over the pa st several years has spurred new requests for developing and ensuring dwindling water supplies and new security threats to water infrastructur have placed added pressure s on budgetary resources the 109th congress left pending veral national wate r policy proposals ranging from new water study commissions and assessments to global sanitation and drinking water aid some of which have been reintroduced in the 110th congress the 110th congress also has addr essed water resource issu during consideration of individual project authorizations as we ll as during debate on wrda legislation hr 1495 and on fy2008 appropriations for the bureau and the corps specific issues that are being or may be discussed during the 110th congress are treated below other general issues also being discussed include federal reserved water rights in relation to federal lands transfer of water across federal lands and through federal facilities indian water rights settlements licensing of nonfederal hy dropower facilities ie private dams regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and whether to establish national water commission to addr ess federal water po licy and coordinationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20569crs4 3 arizona california colorado idaho kansas m ontana nebraska nevada new mexico north dakota oklahoma oregon south dakota texas utah washington and wyoming 4 however congress occasionally passes omnibus bills addressing key bureau policy changes as well as new or revised project and program au thorizations the latest being the reclamation projects authorization and adju stment act of 1992 pl 102575water resource projects most of the large dams and water diversion structures in the united states were built by or with the assistance of the bureau of reclamation in the department of the interior bureau or the us army corps of engin eers in the department of defense corps traditionally bureau projects were designed principally to provide reliable supplies of water for irrigation and some municipal and industrial uses corps projects were designed principally for flood control navigation nd power generation the bureau currently manages hundreds of storage reservoirs nd diversion dams in 17 western states3 providing water to approximately 9 million acres of farmland and 31 million people the corps operations are much more widespread and diverse and in clude several thousand flood control and navigation projects thr oughout the country including 25000 miles of waterways with 238 navigation locks near ly 1000 harbors and 400 dam and reservoir projects with 75 hydroelectric plants bureau of reclamation since the early 1900s the bureau has constructed and operated many large multipur pose water projects water supplies from these projects have been primarily for irrigation constr uction authorizations slowed during the 1970s and 1980s due to several factors in 1987 the bureau announced new mission environmentally sensitive water resources management in the following decade increased population prolonged drought fiscal constraints and in creased water demands for fish and wildlife recreation and scenic enjoyment resulted in increased pressure to alter operation of many bureau projects such changes have been controversial however as water rights contractual obligations nd the potential economic effects of altering project operations complicate any change in water allocation or project operations in contrast to the corps there is tradition of regularly scheduled authorization vehicle for bureau projects instead bureau projects are generally considered individually4 bureaurelated water project and management issues that are under consideration or may be considered during the 110th congress include san joaquin river restoration settlement legislation examination of the bureaus title 16 recycling and reuse program oversight of cvpia and cvp operations oversight of and appropriations for calfed and other baydelta issues such as delta smelt population declines san joaquinsan luis unit drainage issues and potential title transfer authorization of individual water recycling and desa lination projects response to drought and effects of climate vari ability on federal reservoirs and colorado river water management issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20569crs5 broader issue that often receives attention from congress is oversight of the bureaus mission and its future role in western water suppl and water resource management generally as pub lic demands and concerns have changed so has legislation affecting the bureau further many in congress have questioned the bureaus shift in focus from water resources development agency to water resource management agency some have also questioned the in creasing number of proposals to fund new rural water supply projects with high federal costshare ratios and grants for reclaiming and reusing water critical questions congress ma address include what shoul d be the future federal role in water resources velopment and management wh at do western water managers need from the bureau and how can the bureau help with western water management should or to what extent s hould the federal government develop or augment new supply systems designed primarily to serve communitiesmunicipalities or is this localregional responsibility who should pay and how mu ch should the bureau be involved in environmental mitigation or is this best handled through new institutional arrangements eg calfed or other existing agencies g fish and wildlife service andor the environmental protection agency shoul d existing projects be revamped or re operated to accommodate chan ging demands and if so do new policies and institutions statefederal roles need to be addressed and again who should pay relatedly the issue of whether there should be nationa l water commission or pe riodic water resource assessments received some attention in the 109th congress and at least one bill has been reintroduced in the 110th congress corps of engineers congress authorizes corps water resources activities and makes changes to the agencys policies generally in water resources development acts and at times in the annual ener gy and water development ppropriations acts contents of wrda are cumulative and new acts do not supersede or replace previous acts from the late 1980s until 2002 wrdas followed loos ely biennial cycle the last wrda was enacted in 2000 wrda bills were introduced or considered in 2002 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 but were not enacted their enactme nt was complicated by differences over whether to authorize controversial projects nd whether to reform or change the way the corps plans and evaluates projects consideration of wrda 2007 bills by the 110th congress has in cluded debates on changes to state and local roles in projects potential changes in corps policies and practices such as changes to corps permitting and regulatory practices and authorization of highprofile projects prior to hurricane katrina the project authorizations receiving the most attention were coastal louisian wetlands restoration lock expansion and ecosystem restoration for the upper ssissippi riverillinois waterway and evergladesrelated projects the 2005 hurricane season added othe r authorizations to the debate including authorizations for n earterm and longterm hurricane protection measures for louisiana and ot her gulf coast states and fl ood control activities in other areas of the nation vulnerable to flooding hurricane katrina increas ed interest in flood control and louisiana projects in the bill while also increasing interest in streamlining federal spending which has some observers concerned bout authorizing more corps projects for more information on cu rrent wrda issues see crs report rl33504 water resources development act wrda corps of engineers project authorization issues coordinated by cole t carter httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20569crs6 the 110th congress continues to address issues related to the administrations adoption of performancebased budgeting approach for the agency as well as safety and security of corps facilities and implement ation of florida everglades ecosystem restoration recent congresses have expressed dissa tisfaction with the corps financial management particul arly the reprogramming of funds across projects and the use of multiyear continuing contracts for projects corps flood control and hurricane protection projects in particular are receiving cong ressional and public scrutiny following hurricane katrina this scrutiny is added to the attention already on the corps river and reservoir management in many cases corps facilities and their operation are central to debates over multipurpose river management for example water resources management by the corps particularly on the mississippi missour i and columbia and snake rivers system remains controversial and is frequently challeng ed in the courts the corps projects and role in emergency response also may be the subject of congressional oversight legislative direction authorizing legi slation and ppropriations concluding remarks water resources debates in the 110th congress likely will be dominated by different opinions of the desirability and need for changing the water resource agencies policies practices and accountability and for authorizing mu ltibillion dollar investments in ecosystem restoration navigation and flood and storm damage re duction measures broad water resource issue significant to the water resources agencies and the nation is the changing federal role in water resources planning developmen t and management hurricane katrina raised questions about this role in particular the disaster brought attention to the tradeoffs in benefits costs and risks of the current division of responsibilities among local state and fede ral entities for flood mitig ation preparedness response and recovery the question of the fe deral role also is raised by the increasing competition over water supplies not only in th west but also for urban centers in the east eg atlanta which has resulted in growing number of communities seeking financial and other fe deral assistance actions and pe rmits related to water supply development eg desalinati on and water reuse projects reservoir expansions and reoperations congress rare ly chooses to pursue broad legislation on federal water resources policies for many reasons including the challenge of enacting changes that affect such wide breadth of constituencies another practical challenge is the fractured nature of congressional committee jurisdictions over water resources and water quality issues and activities consequently congress traditionally has pursued incremental changes through wrda bills for the corps and projectspecific legislation for the bureau and this pattern seems likely to continue
