operations f unding for fy2004 as approved earlier by the house and senate as h r 2800 the house approved 242176 the conference agreement on december 8 president bush signed the measure on january 23 pl 108199 the conference agreement on hr 2673 provides 1748 billion for foreign operations figure that includes 059 acrosstheboard resc ission and additional amounts for the millennium challenge account specified in division h of the bill this represents 14 billion or 74 reduction from the presidents request but 13 billion or 79 higher than approved in regular foreign operations spending for fy2003 the actual reduction to the executives budget fy2004 proposal however is unlikely to be as significant as this comparison suggests by utilizing funds provided in the iraq reconstructi on supplemental pl 108106 and authority included in hr 2673 to transfer iraq r econstruction money fo r requested regular foreign operations programs the presiden t could make available as much as 575 million to fund his original fy2004 proposal without drawing on the 1748 billion provided in hr 2673 if the administrati on chooses to utilize these resources from the iraq reconstruction supplemental th difference between the fy2004 request and the conference agreement would be about 850 million or 45 cut despite the overall reduction the conference agreement increases spending for international hivaids malaria and t uberculosis programs to 1646 billion when this amount is combined with appropria tions in the pending laborhhseducation appropriation division of hr 2673 the total for global hivaids and other infectious diseases is 24 billion or roughly 400 million above the presidents request conferees further agreed to 400 million contribution to the global fund for aids malaria and tuberculosis th at together with an additional 150 million for the fund in division would bring the total level to 550 million rather than the administrations 200 million proposal the conference agreement further aut horizes and appropriates funds for the millennium challenge account mca one of the top presidential aid initiatives division d of hr 2673 provides 650 million for the mca while

programs food aid an international humanitarian aid program administered under the pl 480 program is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill foreign operations also include funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is regarded as trade promotion program rather than foreign aid in recent years funding for food aid and the eximbank have been about the same so that foreign operations and th official foreign aid budget are nearly identical throughout this report the terms foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeablyeffectively reversed the presidents

introduction the annual foreign operati ons appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences major aspects of executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains the largest share about twothirds of total international affairs spending by the united states see figure 1 the legislation funds all us bilate ral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and frican development foundations most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations including usaids disaster program and the state departments refugee relief support foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the i ndependent states account nd centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending meas ure as are other security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treas ury department nd voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes

decades the foreign oper ations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressi onal oversight of foreign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign policy making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorizati on bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular author izations originating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been the channe l through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 the appropriations measure has also b een key instrument used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently re sulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy makinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs4 status

issues after resolving these remaining issues however instead of filing separate conference report on hr 2800 the hous and senate ppropriation committees decided to incorporate the foreign opera tions bill into hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act fy2004 hr 2673 incl uded seven appropriati on bills that had not received final action as separate meas ures the house approved the conference

swings however are not the result of policy decisions but due to technical budget accounting changes involving how c ongress scores various programs for example the large increase in fy1981 did not repr esent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as off budget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of m ilitary aid loans rather than only the partial appropriation required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropriati on bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown in figure 2 can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign opera tions appropriations over the past 25 years figure 2 foreign operations funding trendsforeign operations funding trends as shown in figure 2 below foreign operations funding levels expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation have fluctu ated widely over the past 27 years2 after peaking at over 33 billion in fy1985 constant fy2004 dollars foreign operations appropriations began peri od of decline to 139 billion in fy1997 with only brief period of hi gher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for panama and caragua 1990

dec line in the foreign policy budget foreign aid spending increased slightly in fy1998 but beginning the following year and continuing to the present foreign oper ations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special and in some cases unanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives although funding for regular continuing foreign aid

foreign operati ons appropriation in fy1997 although foreign operations appropriations had been rising for five consecutive years amounts approved in fy2003 and fy2004 have reached unprecedented levels over the past 40 years regular appropr iations approved in these two years have roughly been on par with amounts of the previous few years but substantial supplementals of 75 billion and 212 billi on respectively for assistance to the front line states in the war on terrorism nd afghanistan and iraq reconstruction have pushed spending upward the regular foreign operations bill signed by the president on january 23 2004 combined with an earlier iraq supplemental approved in november 2003 pl 108106 bring curre nt year appropriations to 387 billion the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s supplemental resources for foreign op erations programs which in fy2004 exceed the regular funding amount have beco significant channel of funding for us international activities due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the us national interest to respond it is not surprising th at foreign aid and

smaller amounts of function 150 are included in four other appropriation billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs9 how much international affairs money to allocate to each of the five subcommittees and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs are decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees nevertheless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the h ouse and senate foreign operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills on april 11 2003 the house and senate agreed to budget framework for fy2004 hconres 95 that included 7847 billion in discretionary budget authority the discretionary budget author ity target for the international affairs function was 2865 billion the same as the presidents request as reestimated by cbo this means that the house and senate appropriations committees received sufficient resources to fully fund the admin istrations foreign policy budget proposal including the foreign operations request the committees however could choos to allocate the 2865 billion among the five subcommittees with jurisdiction over the international affairs programs differently than what the president proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities depending on other competing priorities the final allocations can be quite different from those ssumed in the budget resolution for number of weeks following pa ssage of hconres 95 appropriation committee leaders debated how to distribut the discretionary funds under their jurisdiction and especially how to absorb what they identified as roughly 5 to 7 billion gap in spending requirements nd amounts available departing from traditional practices where house and senate committees work separately on subcommittee allocations committee leaders ne gotiated across both houses with their leadership and with the white house to establish common framework within which to base their initial allocations on june 11 house and senate appr opriations committee chairmen announced an agreed package which would freeup fficient resources to address the funding gap and remain within the overall fy2004 discretionary budget cap of 7847 billion as approved by all parties including the president the appropriations committees reduced defense spending by 3 billi on and moved 22 billion in fy2004 advance appropriations to fy2003 the house appropriations committee which also released its allocation for all 13 subcommittees on june 11 made further lternations beyond the basic framework the committees distribution added f unding beyond the presidents request for several subcommittees including homela nd security up 1 billion vahud up 600 million and commerce justice and state up 229 million in addition to the 3 billion reduction for defense the house committee further cut foreign operations by 1769 billion to 1712 billion this 94 cut from the presidents request was the largest percentage reduction for any of the 13 subcommittees the senate appropriations committee on june 19 agreed to its allocations differing from house levels in several ar eas including foreign operations the senate panel provide d 1809 billion for foreign assistance an amount that washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs10 subsequently raised to 18446 billion on october 29 in order to accommodate additional funds for international hiv aids the senate amount was about 450 million or 23 below the presidents reque st but 13 billion more than the house although senate levels were easier to accommodate conferees meeting to resolve funding and other differences betw een the two bills received relatively low revised allocation of 172 billion the actual reduction to the executives budget proposal however is unlikely to be as significant as comparison between the request 189 billion and the final allo cation congress included in the iraq reconstruction supplemental pl 108106 roughly 700 million in additional funds for pakistan jordan and afghanistan that will allow the president to fully fund the fy2004 proposals for these countries usin g resources from both the supplemental and the regular foreign operations measure as such less money will need to be drawn for these country aid programs from th foreign operations bill than originally anticipated moreover dur ing final negotiations over the conference agreement of hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 to which foreign operations became attached conferees added 350 million for the millennium challenge account an amount that is in addition to the 172 billion allocation consequently taking into account funding in the supplemen tal plus the addon for the mca the cut to the presidents overall request ma be closer to 1 billion or 5 nevertheless cut of this size for foreign operations required substantial trade offs among administration priorities as well as foreign aid programs of high interest to congress with most of the foreign operations increases slated for new initiatives including the millennium ch allenge account and the global aids program cuts were necessary for some of these new proposals and for continuing activities during several months of debate the white house repeatedly emphasized that the budget package should not reduce funding fo r his top spending priorities the white house had been most critical of proposed reductions for the millennium challenge account and successf ully convinced housesena conferees to restore some of the 50 cut initially recommende d by the conference agreement on hr 2800 foreign operations appropriations request for fy2004 and congressional consideration request overview on february 3 2003 president bush asked congress to appropriate 1889 billion for fy2004 foreign operations the budget proposal was 27 billion or 167 higher than regular foreign operations appropr iations for fy2003 as enacted in pl 1087 if enacted the presiden ts recommendation woul d have resulted in one of the largest increases of regular nonsupplemental foreign operations funding in several decades congress subsequently appr oved in midapril an additional 75 billion fy2003 supplemental fore ign aid spending in pl 10811 for iraq reconstruction assistance to coaliti on partners and othe r activities supporting the global war on terrorism including th supplemental brought foreign operations appropriations in fy2003 to 2367 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs11 the fy2004 budget blueprint continued to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority but notable characteristic of the submission was the request for funding four new foreign aid initiatives which together accounted for most of the 27 billion increase over regular fy2003 levels combined the millennium challenge account new structure for delivering foreign aid the state departments global aids initiative and two new contingency funds famine and complex crises totale d 205 billion other foreign operations programs were left with more modest 4 increase table 3 foreign operations new

frontline stat in the war on terrorism implement anti terrorism training programs and address the needs of postconflict iraq and other surrounding countries nearly half of all foreign opera tions appropriations the past two years has gone for terrorism or iraq warrelated purposes the fy2004 budget continued the priority of fighting terrorism with 47 billion or 25 of foreign oper ations resources assisting th frontline states unlike year ago when the presidents fy2003 budget was viewed by many as an inadequate request especially for afghanistan the fy2004 proposal included substantial aid packages for number of the frontline states although the levels for most countries would not increase much beyond what was provided from regular fy2003 foreign aid funding the request rgely sustained amounts that had grown substantially during the past two years antiterrorism training and technical assistance programs also would rise by 45 above fy2003 levels the fy2004 submission did not however include followon funding for iraq relief and reconstruction congress approved 25 billion in fy2003 supplementalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs12 resources an amount many viewed as dow n payment of longterm needs in iraq with great uncertainty surrounding the costs of iraq reconstruction how much of the financial burden the united states w ill shoulder and the process by the reconstruction operations will be managed the administration did not amend its pending fy2004 request to include additi onal amounts instead the white house proposed in september 2003 215 billion s upplemental spending package for iraq reconstruction and dditional aid for afghanistan see discussion below regarding iraq and afghanistan rec onstruction funding issues new initiative the mille nnium challenge account the largest of the new initiatives was the millennium challe nge account mca program designed to radically transform the way the united states provides economic assistance to small number of best perfor ming developing nations the request for fy2004 was 13 billion with promise that the mca will grow to 5 billion by fy2006 and remain at least at that level in the futu re some mca supporters argued that the fy2004 level was too low saying that the president pledged to implement the initiative in equal installme nts over three years and th at an appropriation of 167 billion was what they had anticipated the administration said that the added mca funding would be in addition to and not substitute for existing us economic aid but development advocates we re concerned that given th tight budget environment tradeoffs between regular economic progra ms and the mca might be required see separate page under funding and policy issues for more discussion of the mca new initiative the global aids initiative in his january 2003 state of the union address president bush pledged to substantially increase us financial assistance for preventing and treating hivaids especially in the most heavily inflicted countries in africa and the cari bbean the president promised 15 billion over 5 years 10 billion of which woul d be money above and beyond current funding the global aids initiative which will be housed in the state department represented portion of that pled ge 450 million in fy2004 that when combined with other resources managed by usaid and the department of health and human services hhs would raise total international hivaids resources in fy2004 to about 19 billi on some observers noted however that this fell well short of the anticipated 3 billion per ear implied in the presidents speech and would represent only 500 million in new m oney to fight aids above the fy2003 level some further questi oned whether the state depar tment should be coordinator of international hivaids programs as envisioned in the initiative rather than usaid or hhs see separate page unde r funding and policy issues for more discussion of the global aids initiative new initiative the famine fund this new contingency fund with 200 million requested for fy2004 would allow the administration to provide under more flexible authorities emergency food and other disaster relief support as needs arise executive officials argued that greater flexibility would permit them to respond rapidly to the human consequences of natural disaster s and conflict without having to divert resources from other ec onomic aid accounts critics noted however that the existing international disaster assistance account nd pl 480 food aid program plus legislative authorities th at allow for temporary borrowing of funds from other aid accounts perform the same functions as the proposed famine fund and questioned whether it is necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs13 new initiative the us emergency fund for complex crises the administration proposed to establish within the executive office of the president 100 million contingency fund allowing the united states to respond quickly to unforseen complex foreign crises the re sources would not be used to address victims of natural disast ers but rather would support peace and humanitarian intervention in conflict situations including acts of ethnic cleansing mass killing or genocide in the past congress has b een reluctant to approve this type of contingency fund over which it can apply little oversight the administration had asked lawmakers to launch the complex cr isis fund with 150 million as part of the fy2003 iraq war supplemental congress however chose to defer consideration of establishing such fund until th fy2004 appropriation cycle and instead allocated the requested resources among va rious accounts for iraq reconstruction and aid to regional states affected by the war other key elements of the fy2003 request beyond these specific and prominent issues the foreign operations proposal for fy2004 sought to substantially increase aid activities in few areas while cutting resources for several programs significant appropriation increases when compared with regular fy2003 appropriations excluding the ir aq war supplemental included security assistance economic support fund and foreign military financing these two core security aid accounts that aim to support countries strategically important to the us would have grown by combined 648 million or 10 above regular fy2003 levels much of the addon wa s targeted for 250 million security aid package for turkey and 145 million new middle east partnership initiative peace corps funding would have rise n by 64 million or 22 in an effort to place 10000 volunteers by the end of fy2004 and to keep on track the presidents longer term plan of having 14000 americans serving in the peace corps by fy2007 contributions to the world bank and other intern ational financial institutions would have grown by 259 million or 17 covering all scheduled us payments to the multilateral development banks plus clearing 196 million of us arrears owed to these institutions the request further included an 18 increase for the world banks international development association and the african development fund as resultsb ased incentive contribution that had been promised last year if the banks implemented certain reforms debt reduction which received funding in fy2003 except by transfer of 40 million from anothe r aid account would have grown to 395 million under the administrations budget submission there were three components to the request 300 million to cancel bilateral debt owed by the demo cratic republic of the congo under the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative 75 million as contribution to the hipc trust fund to make up for unanticipatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs14 shortfalls in implementing th program and 20 million for the tropical forestry conserva tion debt relief activity international narcotics control would have grown by 89 million or 45 largely to expand significantly programs in pakistan and mexico the administration further sought 731 million for the andean counterdrug initiative aci an increase from the 700 million regular appropriation for fy2003 the aci proposal would have generally restored amount s that were cut from the fy2003 request for colombia ecuador br azil venezuela and panama the largest reduction proposed in the presidents foreign operations budget targeted assistance to former soviet states and eastern europe collectively aid to these countries would have declin ed by 179 million or 24 from fy2003 levels the request reflected reorientation in th former soviet aid account to focus more on central asian states linked to the war on terrorism and to begin the process of graduation for russia and ukraine aid to these two nations would have fallen by 40 from fy2003 allocations the request further would have cut armenias aid by nearly half from 89 milli on to 49 million for eastern europe aid levels would have fallen for nearly every recipi ent with some of the largest reductions scheduled for serbia montenegro and macedonia funding for the exportimport bank would also have declined under the presidents budget from 565 million to 43 million in fy2004 as reestimated by cbo but because of substantial carry forward resources that were not spent in prior years eximbank officials said that bank lending could total 146 billion in fy2004 which was at least 2 billion higher than the anticipated level for fy2003 assessing the administrations request for bilateral development and health assistance was more complicated and led to varying interpretations with implementation of the presidents new global aids initiative in fy2004 development and health resources incl uding funds from usaids core accounts for development assistance and child surv ivalhealth and the state departments global aids initiative would have incr eased by 205 million or 64 over regular fy2003 levels depending on the purpos for which millennium challenge account funds are spent further additi ons to development and health programs would also be expected from mca allocations but excluding the new global aids initiative and mca from the equation overall funding for usaids two core accounts would have declined in fy2004 by combined 245 mil lion or 76 the implication of this reduction was that with the exception of hivaids nearly all other developmen t programs including those for agriculture basic education family planning malaria nd tuberculosis and democracy programs would have been at or slightly below amounts allocated for fy2003 some critics charged that this vi olated the executives pledge that mca funding would be in addition to and not in place of continuing ec onomic aid programs others expressed concern that the growth in hivaids resources came at the expense of other key health activities for which resources would declinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs15 table 4 summary of foreign operations appropriations discretionary funds in millions of dollars bill title programfy2002 enactedfy2003 regularfy2003

allocations have changed in severa l significant ways the request and subsequently the allocations for fy2004 largely continued the patterns of aid distribution of the past two years since september

have both supported us forces and face serious terro rism threats themselves pakistan for example key coalition partner on the border with afghanistan had been ineligible for us aid other than

the defense department to oversee the governing of iraq immediat ely after the end of hostilities the proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs24 stimulated immediate controversy number of critics including members of congress argued that aid programs shoul d remain under the polic direction of the state department and unde r the authorities of broa d and longstanding body of foreign aid laws they pointed out that during other recent r econstruction initiatives in bosnia and kosovo resources and policy decisions flowed th rough the secretary of state others argued that groups which would play significant role in postwar rehabilitation efforts nong overnmental organizations ngos foreign donors and international organizati ons would be reluctant to take direction and funding from the us military this they contended would hamper relief activities furthermore the placement of reconstr uction funding in presidential account appeared to grant the white house signif icant discretion in responding to changing and unanticipated demands unencumbered by specific programmatic allocations the administration said only that 543 milli on would cover humanitarian expenses 17 billion would be set aside for rec onstruction needs and up to 200 million would be available to reim burse foreign aid accounts fro m which funds were drawn prior to the conflict as with other parts of the supplemen tal dealing with defense and homeland security resources the white house wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over the distribution of the appropriations so that it could respond to changing circumstances and unanticipated contingencies executive officials who acknowledged that some or all of the f unding would be transferred to dod argued that the military would be best situated following the conflict to immediately launch the reconstruction efforts moreover the administration noted that the defense office in charge of reconstruction operations would most likely redirect most of the resources to the state department and us aid who would then be responsible for managing rehabilitation projects officials further argued that it was too early to identify specific reconstruction activities and that it was possible to only provide the most general outlines of how the money would be spent until assessment teams could report on the extent of needs throughout the country congressional action on iraq reconstruction as cleared by congress hr 1559 appropriated 2475 billion for the relief and r econstruction fund slightly higher than requested the pr esident was

attention the key issue was whether they infringed on congressional oversight and the state departments traditional role in directing foreign aid policy and resource allocations they were both similar to proposals made last year in the fy2002 supplemental that focused on the war on terrorism and were closely scrutinized by congress the first would provide 14 billi on for the defense department notwithstanding any provision of law to pay jordan pakist an and other nations that have provided logis tical and militaryrelated suppor t to us military operations in iraq or in the global war on terrorism in the past defense officials argue competing demands on regular military aid resources have delayed reimbursement to key friends that provide services to american forces congress approved funding in the fy2002 supplemental for this purpose but included 15day prior notification requirement that is not part of the fy2003 supplemental draft legislation the more controversial authority concerned dods request for 150 million to support indigenous forces assisting us military operations including those aimed at the global war on terrorism decisions to draw on these funds would be made by the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the secretary of state the defense department defines indigenous forces as irregular forces and resistance movements and notes that such forces

virtually any foreign policy issue of interest to cong ress the annual debate usually focuses on several major policy and spending issues for fy2004 substantial debate has focused on the following foreign aid to combat terrorism since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks nd the initiation of military operations in afghanistan combating global terrorism has become one of the top priorities of american foreign assistance indeed secretary of state powell has said at several 2003 congressi onal hearings that fighting terrorism is the most important objective of the fy2004 fore ign operations request while there is disagreement regarding the extent to which foreign aid can directly contribute to reducing the threat of terrorism most agree that economic and security assistance aimed at reducing pove rty promoting jobs and educational opportunities and helping st abilize conflictprone nations can indirectly address some of the factors that terrorists use in recruiting disenfranchised individuals for their cause as illustrated in the table below the united states has provided more than 59 billion to 26 socalled frontline states in the global war on terrorism inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs34 immediate postseptember 11 and fy 2002 appropriations while fy2003 regular and supplemental spending bills have pr ovided 74 billion the administration proposed

postconflict reconstruction assistance for iraq which totals about 21 bi llion enacted in fy2003 and fy2004 supplementals while increased levels of foreign aid are only one sign of the importance the united states assigns to the support provide d by these frontline states the amounts allocated since september 11 are in shar p contrast to the 34 billion provided to these 26 countries prior to the

kyrgyzstan tajikistan uzbekistan om an yemen and djibouti foreign aid can be programmed in numbe r of ways that contribute to the war on terrorism assistance can be transferred as has occurred in pakistan and afghanistan to bolster efforts of coa litionpartner government to counter domestic dissent and armed attacks by extremist groups and to promote better health care education and employment opportunities to its people security assistance can finance the provision of military equipment and training to nations facing threats from their own internallybased terrorist movements while there has been congressional suppor t for additional foreign aid resources aimed at countering terrorism some warn that the united states needs to be cautious about the risks of creating close aid re lationship with govern ments that may have questionable human rights records are not accountable to their people and are possibly corrupt some members have been especially critical of administration efforts to include in aid proposals for fr ontline states legislative language that would waive all existing restrictions and pr ohibitions on the transfers instead these critics argue the administration should specifically identify any obstacles to proceeding with country aid program and seek congressional waiver for those particular problems for example in late 2001 when the administration wanted to provide pakistan with 600 million in fa stdisbursing economic aid instead of providing blanket waiver of legislativ obstacles congress approved in pl 10757 specific waivers of

educated and healthy population fostering enterprise and entr epreneurship promoting open markets and sustainable budgets if fully implemented the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half century outpaced only by the marshall plan following world war ii and the latin americafocused alliance for progress in the early 1960s the concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to free market economic and democratic principles and policies conditioning assistance on policy perfo rmance and accountability by recipient nations is not new to us aid programs since the late 1980s at least portions of american development assistance have been allocated to some degree on performancebased system what is different about the mca is the size of the commitment the competitive process that will reward countries for what they have already achieved not just what is promised for the future the

calculated using the 10 billion aid level in fy2000 as the base year because of the size of the us economy and continued grow th projected over the next several years the mca increases will have

review board chaired by the secretary of state and composed of the secretary of the treasury and the director of omb would oversee operations of the mcc the decision to house the mca in ne w organization was one of the most debated issues during early c ongressional deliberations of the presidents foreign aid initiative the administration argued th at because the mca represents new concept in aid delivery it should have fresh organizational structure unencumbered by bureaucratic authorities and regulations that would interfere in effective management cr itics however contended that if the mca is placed outside the formal us government foreig n aid structure it would lead to further fragmentation of policy devel opment and consistency some believed that usaid the principal us aid agency should mana ge the mca while others say that the mca should reside in the state department where more us foreign policy entities have been integrated in recent years at least some argued the usaid administrator should be member of th mcc board possibly in place of the omb director for fy2004 the administration sought 13 billion for the mcas first year and remained committed to 5 billi on budget by fy2006 some believed however that the fy2004 request was less than promised in 2002 at the time administration officials implied that funding might be phased in over three years in equal increments resulting in 167 billion program in fy2004 334 billion level in fy2005 and 5 billion in fy2006 in the presidents budget submission thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs42 year however

as passed by the house provided 800 million for the mille nnium challenge account in fy2004 while the senate included 1 billion both were below the 13 billion request the senate further incorporated

to find additional resources fo r international hivaids funding and for other priorities housesenate confer ees tentatively agreed on november 17 to provide 650 million for the mca in fy 2004 half the level requested appropriation committee leaders said that because the program was new and would require some months to be gin operations larger amounts were not necessary in the first year of the mca the white house however strongly objected to the reduced appropriation and convinced lawmakers to add back 350 million as part of package of additional spending needs that were offset by rescission of prior year defense appropriations and an acros stheboard cut for nondefense fy2004 programs the conference agreement on hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 into which foreign operations s been incorporated includes total of 1 billion for the mca 650 million of which is made available in division d of the bill foreign operations and 350 million in division h miscellaneous appropriations and offsets the hous passed hr 2673 on december 8 but the senate most likely will not consider the conference agreement until congress returns on january 20 2004 for the second session congressional action authorization in legislation related to the foreign operations appropriations bill the senate and house debated separate bills to authorize the millennium challenge account when these efforts stalled however the authorizing text was added to the senatepassed foreign operations measure and ultimately incorporated in to the conference agreement on hr 2673 earlier on may 29 2003 th senate foreign rela tions committee reported s 1160 legislation providing 1 billion for the mca in fy2004 23 billion in fy2005 and 5 billion in fy2006 on vote of 118 the co mmittee further approved an

remained in the bill senator lugar who opposed the bidenhagel amendment proposed an alternative structure in ne w legislation s 1240 as introduced on june 11 would create millennium challenge corporati on headed by ceo who would report to the secretary of state senator lugar intended that such an arrangement would provide the corporation with the same degree of indepe ndence and status as usaid but establish chain of command that would permit the secretary of state to exercise broad authority over the mca s 1240 created board of directors made up of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs43 secretary of state chairman the secretary of the treasury the usaid administrator the us trade representa tive and the mcc ceo the full senate adopted the general approach proposed by senator lugar when it voted on july 9 to incorporate modified text of mca authorizing legislation into s 925 the foreign affairs authorization fiscal year 2004 the revised composition of the board of the directors proposed in s 1240 was included the approved text further strengthened the explicit relationship between the corporation and the secretary of state by adding that the ceo shall repor t to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary the administration did not express objection to the revised legislation s 925 as amended also would have permitted lowmiddle income nations to participate in the mca program only if appropriations in fy2006 and beyond exceeded 5 billion annually in such ears these relatively wealthier countries could compete for only 20 of the tota l appropriation in many other areas however the legislation adopted the broa d concepts recommended by the executive on june 12 the house internationa l relations committee reported an mca authorizing measure hr 2441 containi ng at the time significant differences with the senate and the ad ministration the legislation authorized 13 billion for fy2004 as requested 3 billion for fy2005 and 5 billion for fy2006 unlike the original senate measure hr 2441 created new millennium challenge corporation sought by the president but altered the composition of the board of directors and the authority of the mccs chief executive officer the board as designed under hr 2441 included the secr etary of state as chairman and the secretary of the treasury as proposed but deleted the director of omb and added the usaid administrator the us trade representative and the ceo of the mcc the bill also included four additional member s to be appointed by the president from list submitted by the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate the board would have further included as nonvoting exofficio members the ceo of opic and the directors of the trade and development agency peace corps and omb additionally hr 2441 designated the ceo of the corporation as the individual responsible for termining eligible countries rather than the board of directors as recommended by the admin istration the house bill allowed low middle income countries to participate in the mca beginning in fy2006 regardless of the amount of money appropriated but limited the allocation to these relatively wealthier countries to 20 of mca assist ance similar to the senate the house incorporated slightly modified versi on of hr 2441 as division in hr 1950 an omnibus foreign policy authorizati on bill the house passed hr 1950 now called the millennium challenge account peace corps expansion and foreign relations authorization act of 2003 on july 16 as

submitted by congressional leaders and nominated by the president allow lowmiddle income countries to participate in mca programs beginning in fy2006 as proposed but caps the total amount funds that can be allocated to thes countries at 25 of the mca appropriation the house had propos ed 20 cap while the senate had recommended 20 ceiling but only when mca appropriations exceeded 5 billion authorize such sums as may be necessary for fy2004 and fy2005 with mention of fy2006 house and senate bills had included specific amounts for the first two years and an fy2006 authorization of 5

hivaids continuing source of disagreement between the executive branch and congress is how to allocate the roug hly 338 billion core budget for usaid development assistance and global health programs among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in r ecent years have been programs supporting child survival basic education and efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases the administration has also back ed these programs but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors most recently during the fy2003 and fy2004 budget cycles some member s of congress have argued that it has been the executive branch that has dded funds for adminis tration priorities by cutting resources for other development activities in years when congress has increased appropriations for its priorities but not included corresponding boost in the overa ll development aid budget resources for other aid sectors such as economic gr owth and the environment have been substantially reduced this was more pr oblematic during the midtolate 1990s when worldwide development aid funding fell si gnificantly in more recent years and especially for fy2003 and fy2004 congre ss increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could be funded without significant reductions for nonearmarked activ ities nevertheless administration officials continue to ar gue that such practices undermine their flexibility to adjust resource allocations to changing global circumstances in 2001 the bush administration set out revised usaid core goals for sustainable development programs focu sed around three sphere s of emphasis or strategic pillars that include global h ealth economic growth and agriculture and conflict prevention and developmental relief the administration further introduced new initiative the global developm ent alliance gda in an effort to expand publicprivate partnershi ps in development program implementation under the initiative usaid identifie s good development opportunities being conducted by private foundations nongovern mental organizations universities and forprofit organizations and pr ovides parallel financ ing to leverage resources already committed to these activities usaid officials envisioned that the agency would become much more of coordinating and integrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of these nongovernmental deve lopment partners although it started out as much more ambitious project usaid requested 160 million for fy2002 the gda has received re latively modest funding allocations 20 million in fy2002 and 149 million in fy2003 the fy2004 request sought 15 million underscoring the importance of the debate over funding allocations of development aid resources has been an elev ation by the administration of the value of foreign economic assistance as an inst rument of us foreign policy since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 pr esident bush announced plans to launch two major foreign aid initiatives the

fy2004 the president sought substa ntial increase in overall development assistance although the programs are configur ed differently than they have been in the past raising questions in some observers minds about the administrations commitment to broadbased worldwide development for core development assistance programs that match the current structure of usaids strategic pillars and

applauded the increases sought for the new initiatives they remained concerned over the reductions proposed for usaids core development accounts the latter ar worldwide activities that serve multiple development needs in over 55 countries that range from nations with sound commitment to economic and mocratic reforms to countries emerging from conflict to failed states that confront humanitarian crises the hivaids and mca proposals on the other hand are more narrowly focused the global aids initiative implementing preven tion treatment and care projects are to focus largely on 14 priority countries in africa and th caribbean the millennium challenge account will likely support programs in the fi rst year in perhaps as few as 810 best performingcountries that have demonstrat ed progress in the areas of governance economic freedom and social investments in people the administration further had said that mca funding would be in add ition not substitute for continuing core development activities critic s charged that the fy2004 budget request violated that pledge by cutting amounts for core programs what some observers found most probl ematic about the fy2004 development assistance request was that increases fo r selected areas especially those for hivaids to some extent resulted from re ductions in other velopment programs see table 12 among health programs each subsector was cut except for hivaids funding for other infectious diseases including tuberculosis and malaria would have fallen by onethird under the presidents budget request child survival activities would be cut by 11 reproductive health would drop by 5 and vulnerable child programs would be reduced from 27 million to 10 million the administration recommended similar reductions in its fy2003 budget request last year but congress restored most of the f unds that would have been lost under the presidents recommendation for example usaid had sought 110 million for non hivaids infectious diseases out of the child survival and health program fund account for fy 2003 an am ount that rose to 1545 million due to subsequent congressional additions in the fo reign operations appropriation aside from global health programs us aid proposed mix of budget increases and cuts for other core deve lopment sectors those sc heduled for higher spending included agriculture programs would increase by 4 to 268 million economic growth activities including trade and investmentprograms would rise less than 1 democracy and local governance would grow by 20 althoughlarge increases for afghanistan and pakistan would leave similar programs in africa and latin america below fy2003 levels funding for other core deve lopment areas would decline environmental activities woul d drop by 6 to 286 million basic education high congressiona l priority for number of years would fall by 2 to 212 million and resources for higher education would be cut by 17 human rights and conflict preven tion programs would be

debates for nearly two decades for fy2004 the administration request ed 425 million for bilateral population assistance the same as proposed last year but below the 4465 million appropriated by congress for fy2003 although funding considerations have at times been heatedly debated by congress the most contentious family planning issues addressed in nearly every annual cong ressional consideration of fo reign operations bills have focused on two matters whether the unite d states should contribute to the population fund unfpa if the organizati on maintains program in china where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years and whether abortionrelated restrictions shoul d be applied to bilateral usaid population aid grants commonly known as the mexico city policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs59 unfpa funding the most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question but most recent ttention has focused on unfpa and white house decision in july 2002 to block the 34 million us contribution to the organization during the reagan and bush administrations the united states did not contribute to unfpa because of concer ns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in china wher unfpa maintains programs in 1985 congress passed the socalle d kempkasten amendment wh ich has been made part of every foreign operati ons appropriation since barring us funds to any organization that supports or participat in the management of program of coercive abortion or involunt ary sterilization in 1993 pr esident clinton determined that unfpa despite its presence in china was not involved in the management of coercive program in most years since 1993 congress has appropriated about 25 million for unfpa but added directive th at required that the amount be reduced by however much unfpa spent in china consequently the us contribution has fluctuated between 215 million and 25 million for fy2002 president bush requested 25 million for unf pa as part of larger package concerning various international family planning issues congress provided in the fy2002 foreign operati ons bill not more than 34 million for unfpa while members of the appropriations committees say it was their intent to provide the full 34 million the language allowed the president to allocate however much he chose up to 34 milli on ceiling according to february 27 2002 testimony by arthur dewey assist ant secretary of st ate for population refugees and migration before the senate foreign relations committee the white house placed hold on unfpa funds in january 2002 because new evidence suggested that coercive practices were continuing in chinese counties where unfpa concentrates its programs september 2001 investigation team sponsored by the population research institute concluded that consis tent pattern of coercion continued in model unfpa counties including forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations refuting these findings unfpacommissioned review team found in october 2001 absolutely eviden ce that the population fund supports coercive family planning practices in china or violates the human rights of chinese people in any way see house international relations committee hearing coercive population control in china new evidence of forced abortion and forced sterilization october 17 2001 see also testimony of josephine guy and nicholaas biegman before the senate foreign relations committee february 27 2002 although most observers agree that coer cive family planning practices continue in china differences remain over the extent to which if any unfpa supports involuntary activities and whether unfpa s hould operate at all in country where such conditions exist given the conflicting reports the state department sent its own investigative team to china for tw oweek review of unfpa programs on may 13 2002 the team which was led by former ambassador william brown and included bonnie glick former state depa rtment official and dr theodore tong public health professor at the univers ity of arizona made three findings and recommendations in its report dated may 31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs60 findings there is evidence that unfpa knowingly supported or participated in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china china maintains coercive elements in its population programs and chinese leaders view population c ontrol as high priority and remain concerned over implications of loosening controls for socioeconomic change recommendations the united states should release not more than 34 million of previously appropria ted funds to unfpa until china ends all forms of coercion in law and practice us government funds should be allo cated to population programs in china and appropriate resources possibly from the united states should be allocated to monitor and eval uate chinese population control programs despite the teams recommendation to release the 34 million secretary of state powell decided on july 22 2002 to withhold funds to unfpa and to recommend that they be redirected to other international family planning and reproductive health activities the authority to make this decision had been delegated previously by the president to the secretary of state the state departments analysis of the secretar ys determination f ound that ev though unfpa did not knowingly support or partic ipate in coercive practice that alone would not preclude the application of ke mpkasten instead finding that the recipient of us funds in this case unf pa simply supports or participates in such program whether knowingly or unknow ingly would trigger the restriction the team found that the chinese gove rnment imposes fi nes and penalties on families that have children exceeding the number approved by the government practice that in some cases coerces wo men to have abortions they would not otherwise undergo the state departme nt analysis concluded that unfpas involvement in chinas fa mily planning program allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive aborti on the full text of the state departments analysis is online at the state departments web site at httpwwwstategovgprmrlsother 12128htm the state departments assessment team report is also online at httpwwwstategovgprmrlsrpt 200212122htm critics of the administrations decisi on opposed it not only because of the negative impact it may have on access to voluntary family planning programs by persons in around 140 countries where unfp operates but also because of the possible application of the determination for other inte rnational organizations that operate in china and to wh ich the us contributes for fy2003 the president proposed funding for unfpa although 25 million was requested in reserve for the account from which unfpa receives its funding presumably this could have been made available to unfpa if it was foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs61 not to be in violation of kempkasten following several legislative attempts to reverse the administrations denial of unfpa in both fy2002 supplemental appropriations and regula r fy2003 foreign operations measures congress approved in pl 1087 the consolid ated appropriations act for fy2003 provision allocating 34 million to unfpa the same as in fy2002 so long as several conditions were met the most significant requirement was that the president must certify that unfpa is longer involved in the management of coercive family planning program since the july 2002 determin ation the administration s transferred to usaid 34 million from fy2002 appropriations nd 25 million from fy2003 that would have otherwise been provided to unfpa in order to fund us aid bilateral family planning programs for which unfpa has involvement the state departments justification of its september 25 2003 letter to congress regarding the fy2003 resources noted that the factual ci rcumstances do not support making determination that unfpa longer supports or particip ates in the management of program of coercive abortion or invol untary sterilization section 572 of the fy2003 foreign operations appropriations re quired the president to issue such statement before restoring us funding to unfpa like for fy2003 the fy2004 foreign op erations request did not propose funding for unfpa but placed 25 million in reserve for unidentified voluntary contributions to international organizations mexico city policy the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decades ago in 1973 when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first an nounced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administrati on and later the george h w bush administration restricted funds for fore ign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or prom oting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activ ities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial support in some subsequent years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clin ton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding fo r all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortion related work between 1996 and 2000 the house and nate took opposing positions on the mexico city issue actions that repeatedly held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measures the h ouse position articulated by representative chris smith nj and others supported re instatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign or ganizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign c ountries the senate on the other hand rejected in most cases house provisions dealing with mexico city policy favoring position that left these decisions in the hands of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs62 administration unable to reach an agr eement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted interim arrangements during this period that did not resolve the broad population program controversy but pe rmitted the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward the annual compromise removed houseadded mexico city restrictions but re duced populat ion assistance to 385 million and in several years metered the availability of the f unds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month in fy2000 when the issue became linked with the separate foreign policy matter of paying us arrears owed to the united nations reluctant president clinton agreed to modified version of abortion restrictions marking the first time that mexico city conditions had been include d in legislation signed by the president enacted in the foreign operations act for fy2000 hr 3422 incorporated into hr 3194 the consolidated appropria tions act for fy 2000 pl 106113 because the president could waive the restrictions for 15 million in grants to organizations that refused to certify there was major impact on usaid family planning programs in fy2000 othe r than the reduction of 125 million in population assistance that the legislation re quired if the white house exercised the waiver authority when congress again came to an imp asse in fy2001 lawmakers agreed to allow the new president to set policy under the fy2001 foreign operations measure none of the 425 million appropr iation could be obligated until after february 15 2001 subsequently on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from president clinton and dir ecting the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was co mmitted to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance b ecause he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care on february 15 2001 the day on which fy2001 population aid funds became available for obligation usaid issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the presidents directive the guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy applied critics of the certification requireme nt oppose it on several grounds they believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the rest rictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possi bly more abortions oppone nts also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating s ituation in which the united states challenges theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs63 decisions on how to spend their own money they further argue that us policy imposes socalled gag order on the ability of foreign ngos and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations this would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states critics note supporters of the certification requireme nt argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving american taxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abor tion laws and regulations the certification process they contend closes the fungibility loophole since reinstatement of the mexico city policy in early 2001 several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy but except for language included in the senate fy2004 foreign operations ppropriations bill see belo w none has passed either the house or senate and meas ure has been enacted into law congressional action on july 23 the house approved in hr 2800 425 million for bilateral family planning programs as requested for unfpa contributions the house bill provide d 25 million available only under certain conditions none of the funds can be used in china funds must be maintained by unf pa in separate account and may not commingle amounts unfpa does not perform abortions unfpa does not provide any resources for the chinese state plannedbirth commission or its regional affiliates and us contributions will be reduced by whatever amount if anyunfpa spends in china in addition the terms of the kempkasten amendment continued to apply the terms of which resulted in cutoff of us contributions in fy2002 on july 17 the senate appropriations committee approved its fy2004 foreign operations s 1426 including several sign ificant changes regarding international family planning funding and policy that were opposed by the administration the senate on october 30 subseque ntly passed the legislati on approving the house bill hr 2800 without making changes to the committeereported text concerning international family planning issues for bilateral family pla nning activities the sena bill provided 445 million 20 million above the presidents request in section 691 the bill effectively reversed the administrations mexico city policy specifically the provision stated that foreign ngos shall not be declared ine ligible for us funds solely on the basis of health or medical services they provide including counseling and referral services with nonus government funds this exemption would apply so long as the services do not violate the law of the count ry in which they are performed and that they would not violate us laws if provide d in the united states section 691 furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs64 provided that nonus government funds used by foreign ngos for advocacy and lobbying activities would be subject to conditions that also apply to us ngos since it is largely held that american ngos would not be subject to these restrictions

ongoing security concerns infrastructure destruction and hum anitarian needs likely requiring robust and sustained intervention while the hunt fo r qaeda forces within afghanistan continues transitional and reconstruction assist ance are well underway an examination of the progress of reconstr uction efforts and aid priorities since december 2001 reveals the complexity of th tasks at hand and the important roles to be played by the united states and the international community the case of afghanistan may present special category of international crisis response in which the united states and others pursue th war on terrorism in country while simultaneously providing humanitari an and reconstruction assistance so far the international community s continued to provide large amounts of aid and resources for the reconstruction effort longterm commitment will likely be necessary to ensure that stable democratic afghanistan emerges and will not fall prey to the twin evils of drugs and terro rism the outcomes of the international donors conference in january 2002 and other donor conferences since then indicate strong willingness on the part of the international community to assist in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs66 restoration of afghanistan however reconstruction costs are estimated by some to be more than 1530 billion over the next decade current operating environment key developments since september 11 2001 and the collapse of the taliban focu s on three main pillars first the development of plans for security including the presence of an international security assistance force isaf the establishment and training of an afghan national army and police force the demobilization of private militias and the formation of provincial reconstruction teams second establishing the political framework through the bonn conference and afghanistan interim administration aia the loya jirga and islamic transitional government of afghanistan itga and renewed diplomatic ties with the international community and third the creation of strategy for reconstruction beginning with the t okyo reconstruction conference in january 2002 the current operating environment c ontinues to highlight the importance of these three themes and the work that rema ins to be done to ssure afghanistans recovery the most serious challenge facing afghanistan today is the lack of security former commanders maintain control over th eir own areas and continue fighting with their rivals making difficult the extension of control by the na tional government the provision of humanitarian assistance nd progress on reconstruction the isaf created by the bonn agreement has reach ed its agreed strength of about 5500 nato assumed command of the 30nation force in august 2003 because of ongoing threats to afghanistans internal security there have been calls for isaf expansion and deployment to other citie s in october 2003 the security council formally backed an expansion of isaf outside of kabul by adopting resolution 1510 us forces with participation from french and british forces are continuing to train new afghan national army that it is hoped will ultima tely allow the kabul government to maintain security on its own and enable foreign forces to depart afghanistan the targeted size of the army is 70000 but it is expected to take several years to achieve full strength with the continued fighting and insecurity the japan and unled process of demobilization and integration of combatants has also been slow ensuring secure environment for rec onstruction gained greater attention with an initiative by the pentagon to expand the role of the us military in afghanistan in december 2002 dod announced that it would be setting up provincial reconstruction

these prts are already in operation including one run by br itain one by new zealand and one by germany and observers say ngos are grav itating to areas where they are present due to improved security this marks depa rture from the previous policy of relying solely on security through the development of an afghan national army or expansion of the isaf and engages us forces be yond military action to oust the taliban and qaeda httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs67 still factional fighting and increased criminal activity have undermined relief and reconstruction ope rations in some cases wh ere operations were directly targeted this has led to the temporary spension of missions or withdrawal of aid agencies from certain areas the united nations has begun database to record national security incidents and to provide more effective timely information and situation assessments to the aid community the strength and influence of the central government is viewed as key factor that will determine the success of the inte rvention and assistance on the part of the international community humanitarian and reconstruction programs face the challenge of maintaining their foothold despite the complex humanitarian requirements such as populati on returns and resettlement f ood security shelter and winter assistance and rec onstruction problems such as rebuilding the infrastructure economy and agricultural base addressing landmines nd environmental damage and reestablishing health education nd community centers afghanistan is beginning to prepare for presidential ections to take place in 2004 followed by parliamentary elections one year later loya jirga began in mid december 2003 to consider draft permanent constitution that was publicly unve iled on november 3 after constitution is adopted us afgha n and international ttention will turn to the holding of elections apart from the security problems the current operating environment presents number of other urgent challenges the co llapsed infrastructure rugged terrain and extreme weather are significant factors w ith regard to access food aid logistics reconstruction and must be understood in the context of the continuing vast numbers of refugees and idps the differences among the regions in which they are located and the political and security situation thr oughout the country there is need for stronger links between humanitarian and r econstruction projects so that afghans can begin to move beyond initial reintegration to more perm anent resettlement unhcr continues to assist refugees and idps although some have raised concerns that the infrastructure may not yet be able to support this many returnees the united states has international help in carrying out the reconstruction of afghanistan the united states is traini ng the new army and about 9000 us troops continue to combat talibanal qaeda remnants the us treasury department is advising the government on its budget and other financial affairs among contributions by other countries italy is providing advice on judicial reform and germany is helping establish national po lice force the united states japan and saudi arabia are financing the rebuild ing of the kabulqandaharherat major roadway there have been some reports that afgh anistan officials have complained about the slow pace at which pledged funds were being paid in similar vein in the past the united states has been critical of othe r donors for not meeting their fair share of the cost of recovery and for not doing enough on multilateral level on the one hand determining the fair share of the co sts of reconstruction for any one country or group of countries varies from conflict to conflict nd depends in part on the resources being spent on conflicts elsewher on the other hand the way in which funds are distributed be it multilaterally through ag encies or bilaterally with funds supporting international organizati ons and ngos directly has directhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs68 impact on implementation others are c oncerned that inte rnational donors might shift their focus to iraq reconstruction nd lose interest or run too low on resources to continue to participat in afghan reconstruction if progress on security road construc tion and reconstructi on efforts are made in advance of the planned 2004 elections it could increase the ch ances of the success of moderates in those elections additi onal funding could also have an impact on decisions by the international community possibly resulting in larger contributions it could also help efforts of the afghan government to expand isaf which is now limited only to kabul increased funding could also have negative implications there are concerns that it could add to the already high levels of corruption some experts are concerned about absorption capacity and whether additi onal funds can be allocated quickly and effectively if progress is not achieve d the increase could be seen as largely symbolic and ineffective others have raised the possibility that the united states will be seen giving too much s upport to the karzai government in advance of the 2004 elections tokyo pledging conference the international conference on reconstruction assistance to afghanistan held in tokyo in january 2002 gave the afghan interim authority aia chance to demonstrate its commitment to the next phase of afghanistans rec overy and provided the inte rnational donor community an opportunity to come together and forma lly demonstrate support for this initiative the

reconstruction overview among the key policy objectives laid out by the bush administration in conjunction with the war in iraq were the re storation of basic human services and the economic and political rec onstruction of the country while immediate overall responsibility for the war and management of us military activity in postwar iraq belongs to the commander of us ce ntral command the

the occupation authority in the view of many has failed to successfully reestablish order and security restore infrastructure and introduce political and economic reform including iraqi selfgovernance in timely manner these problems are interlinked the successful conduct of much rec onstruction work is contingent on an environment of order and stability and the lack of visible progress in restoring basic infrastructure and institu tions of security opens the door to political discontent and opposition the 203 billion suppl emental request sought to address those infrastructure and security concerns that have made insufficient progress and on which other us objectives in iraq hinge until mid2003 the administration had suggested that the cost of reconstruction up to the end of 2003 could largely be met by iraqi and already previously appropriated us resources national budget for iraq covering the rest of the year announced by the cpa on july 7 estimate d expenditures of 61 billion and the creation of central bank currency reserve of 21 billion for total budget of 82 billion new oil revenue taxe s and profits from state ow ned enterprises would make up 39 billion of these costs according to th cpas analysis the remaining deficit of 43 billion would be covered by recently frozen and seized assets 25 billion the development fund for iraq 12 billion and 3 billion in ready appropriated us assistance iraq was projected to have 11 billion remainin g for reconstruction by end of december 2003 the administration request suggested that reassessment of iraqs immediate reconstruction needs demanded gr eater outlays of revenue than projected in july it also suggested that presumed sources of additional revenue in 2004 chiefly oil export production and interna tional

fi nancing reconstruction until mid2003 the administration had expected most costs of r econstruction to be bor ne by iraq through receipts from its oil exports while the d ecrepit state of oil production infrastructure and recurrent sabotage to pipelines and facilities have forced experts to downgrade expectations of potential exports and recei pts any sustained increase in production will assist the reconstructi on effort current rates of production are nearing 2 million barrelsday but iraqis do not expect to reach 25 million barrels until spring and 3 million until the end of 2004 administration estimates of the prewar level range between 25 and 3 million barrels ambassador bremer indicat ed at senate hearing on september 22 that he expected iraq to produce sufficient oil in 2005 to take care of its basic needs and provide add itional funds for capital investment10 undersecretary of state larson project ed 12 billion in revenue in 2004 and 19 billion in 200511 an association of leading banks and financiers the institute of international finance predicted that oil revenue will be insufficient to cover the iraqi operational budget in 2004 leavin g nothing for reconstruction12 roughly 503 million had been allocated by september 2003 from the fy2003 emergency wartime supplementa l for repair of oil fac ilities and restoration of production and distribution systems the administration request for these purposes under the fy2004 supplemental was 21 billion additional sums for iraqi security forces were in part intended to create an iraqi force that would

econstruction projects was the question of whether assistance could be extended on loan rather than grant basis some argued that given the substantial amount of oil reve nues that iraq will generate at some point in the future baghdad would have the mean s to service debt incurred for the purpose of rebuilding its infrastructure loans either extended bilaterally or through some sort of trust fund possibly managed by the world bank would be repaid at some point thereby reducing reconstruction co sts to the united states they said the administration which proposed th at the entire 203 billion supplemental be offered as grants argued repeatedly during congressional hearings against adding to iraqs already substantial debt obligations witnesses asserted that iraq owed roughly 200 billion in prewar debts repa rations and other claims g7 leaders agreed informally at the june 2003 mmit to suspend through 2004 the requirement for iraq to service any existing debt giving time to construct some sort of multilateral debt restructuring arrangement13 further security council resolution 1483 stated that iraqi oil exports or proceeds c ould not be attached by creditors through 2007 unless authorized by the council beyond the matter of whether iraq should incur more debt obligations in the near term was the question over who coul d legally assume responsibility for new sovereign debt although it would be po ssible that the world bank could manage an iraq reconstruction trust fund that woul d receive contributions from international donors if the bank were to use these res ources for project lending it would almost certainly require as it has in the past that some sort of sovereign iraq authority assume the debt obligation til such time that legal author ity is transferred to iraqi hands the coalition provisional authority is the temporary government of iraq and would be the one signing for the loans most legal scholars take the position that an occupying power has authority to incur new debts on behalf of the displaced sovereign14 some contend however that there is an exception in which new government would be responsible for the bt if it can be shown that the loans were required for the welfare of the occupied territory and the terms were fair and reasonable15 this issue was closely examined by lawm akers the senate adopted 5147 an amendment by senators

iraqs debt earlier senator dorgan had offered amendments in committee markup and on the senate floor tabled in both venues that would have created an authority to use iraqi oil to secure reconstruction financing and convert us grants to loans senator hutchison and others submitted an amendment that did not come up for floor debate directing 10 billion of the total reconstruction supplemental to trust f und to be established within the world bank out of which loans and loan guarantees would be made on the house side representative wa mp proposed but later withdrew an amendment during committee markup that w ould have withheld onehalf of iraq funds until after the election of new ir aqi leader at which time the remaining money would be available in the form of loan

by representative obey regarding shift of grants to loans was defeated in the house 200226 house and senate conferees agreed to provide all iraq reconstruction aid as grants rather than loans contracting concerns an administration decision applied to the early reconstruction contracts to waive the normal competitive bidding requirements and request bids from specific companies wh ich were seen to have preexisting qualifications received considerable attention by the business community the closed bidding and lack of transparency disturbed number of legislators and some members of congress asked the gao to dete rmine whether contracting agencies are following appropria procedures some observers noted that in additi on to many american firms number of international organizations and nonus companies were excluded from the selections made by usaid and other agencies and even british companies were not considered despite that countrys role in th war us official s pointed out that only few select firms possessed the particular skills that would qualify them for the job specifications for iraq reconstruction and th at time and security clearances were also critical factors foreign entities poten tially excluded by buy america provisions of law and other us firm s could participate as subcontractors to the selected american firms subcontractors are likely to compose half or more of the total cost of each contract the supplementals impact on other donors at the time it appeared possible that congressional action on th supplemental could influence the contributions of interna tional donors at the october donors conference and administration officials encouraged cong ress to complete debate on the spending bill prior that date some argued that large pledge of us aid prior to the conference might stimulate other donors to contribute more diminution of the administration plan they argued could have the opposite effect opponents of making us aid for reconstruction in the form of loans also contended that other donors might follow the american lead and offer loans rather than grants adding further to iraqs debt problems in ddition the supplemental targeted

by under secretary of state for economic busi ness and agricultural affairs alan larson september 4 2003 httpusinfostateg ovtopicalpolterro rtexts03090434htmthemselves in similar nationbuilding exercises elsewhere donors have tended to funnel contributions to the social sector s such as education and health and grassroots democratization nd economic development all areas relatively untouched by the supplemental perhaps more important factor in ot her donor calculations was the extent to which they would have say in the use of funds donors had been reluctant to provide assistance because they were wa ry of being perceived as supporting unilateral us policy in response to th is concern donors discu ssed at september 6 meeting in brussels the concept of creating iraq reconstruction trust funds managed by the or world bank which would accept and distribute contributions control over how the money was spent according to undersecretary of state alan larson who represented the us at the september 6 meetings would be handled by some sort of multilateral management board that might include officials from international organizations major donors and iraqis representing interim ministries16 management of iraq reconstr uction funds by us agencies administrative control over iraq reconstr uction funds became significant issue during congressional debate on the 2475 billion appropriation in pl 10811 at that time most had expected that transf ers for reconstruction and postconflict aid would be made to usaid the state partment and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies but with plans for the defense department to oversee the governing of iraq immediately after the end of hostilities the white house wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over the distribution of resources so the president could transfer some or all of the funding to dod the proposal stimulated immediate controversy with number of critics including members of congress arguing that aid programs shoul d remain under the polic direction of the state department and under the authorities of broa d and longstanding body of foreign aid laws although initial house nd senate decisions would have blocked administration efforts to place control of reconstruction funds with the pentagon ultimately congress agreed to allow the white house to allocate the resources among five agencies including dod funds fo r the iraq relief and reconstruction fund appropriated in pl 10811 ve been managed by l paul bremer head of the coalition provisional authority cpa and th us civilian administrator in iraq who reports to the secretary of defense the administration proposed that the entire 203 billion be placed in the iraq relief and reconstruction fund as was the case with the pr evious supplemental and to continue ambassador brem er and the cpas role as administrators of the fund under dod guidance after submitting the s upplemental however the white house announced the establishment of new ira q stabilization groupheaded by national security advisor condoleezza rice th group was intended to help speed up reconstruction efforts by id entifying and resolving problems

reconstruction policy at th same time the state depar tment staff serving under the cpa in iraq was expected to grow fro m 55 to about 110 ne vertheless ambassador bremer would continue to repor t to the secretary of defense17 during congressional deba the senate tabled 5642 an amendment by senators leahy and daschle that woul d have placed the cpa under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state the house bill however added provision barring the coor dination of defense or reconstruction activities in iraq or afghanistan by us government officer who was not subject to confirmation by the senate the house committee wanted to ensure that whoever was in charge of coordina tion be available to testify at congressional oversight hearings senator leahy proposed simila r amendment for sena consideration these proposals appeared to block the initia tive of placing national security council advisor rice who is not subject to c onfirmation and who doe s not testify before congress in charge of coordinating r econstruction the white house however contended that the new iraq stabiliz ation group did not affect control of reconstruction efforts and that the j ob remains under control of the defense department18 in any case the house provision requiring that the coordination of reconstruction activities be headed by confirmed us official was deleted in conference negotiations reconstruction priorities and costs the administration said that the request included only the most pressing immediate needs fo r iraq in fy2004 however the relative importance of certain items detailed in the request re engineering of postal service business practi ces and construction of seven residential communities for example was challenged by congress further the costs associated with reconstruction requests were subject to skepticism with some congressional staff reportedly suggesting that the price tag was intentionally inflated so that the administration would not have to return to congress to ask for more funds in 200419 several senate amendments were offered but not adopted that would have reduced funding for what the sponsors regard ed as lowpriority needs and redirected the resources for domestic or other military programs in iraq the house bill proposed 1655 billion cut in iraq recons truction funding reduc ing or eliminating resources for wide range of activities that the house found to be unexecutable low priority or likely to receive funding fro m other international donors number of these house recommendations for cuts were adopted in the conference agreement see table 17 above for details of sector nd project reductions recommended by congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31811crs81 congressional action fy2004 regular foreign operations appropriations the president did not request nor did either house or senate bills pr ovide additional funding for iraq reconstruction in the regular fy2004 foreign operations appropriations measures although the house did not ddress iraq reconstr uction funding matters in hr 2800 sec 572 of the legislation re quired that iraq reconstruction contracts awarded with appropriated f unds be subject to full and open competition conferees meeting on hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 w ithin which foreign operations has been incorporat ed as division d decided however to drop the house contract provision in sec 572 believing the issue had been adequately addressed in the fy2004 supplemental measure see below fy2004 iraq reconstruction supplemental as illustrated in table 17 above the senatepa ssed measure s 1689 followed the general funding requests proposed by the president while the house bill hr 3289 reduced the 203 billion recommendation by 165 billion both bills further added sections requiring more detailed reporting to cong ress on reconstruction activ ities and placed limits on but not prohibiting noncompetitive contracting procedures the house measure also prohibited reconstruction effort s to be coordinated by an yone not confirmed by the senate apparently in reac tion to the white house announcement establishing the iraq stabilization group headed by na tional security advisor rice house and senate negotiators agreed to total iraq reconstruction at levels similar to housepassed amounts reducing funds for number of activities deemed too expensive or of low priority the conf erence agreement was approved in the house on october 29 perhaps the most challenging issue for conference committee consideration was whether to provide the entire reconstruction package as grant as proposed by the president and hr 3289 or extend 10 billion in the form as loan as the senate bill recommends the 10 billion loan in s 1689 could later be converted to grant if international creditors agree to cancel 90 of iraqs debt under threat of presidential veto house and senate conferees agreed to provide the entire package of
