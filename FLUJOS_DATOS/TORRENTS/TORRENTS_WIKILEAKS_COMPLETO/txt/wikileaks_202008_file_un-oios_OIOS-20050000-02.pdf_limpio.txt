pillar iv the divisional manager was appointed under himher were the peap official and official 3 6 on 1 april 2004 pristina international airport which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of kfor was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction under icao regulations 7 it is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined v investigation details 8 this investigation relates to two tenders for co ntracts for the purchase of winter and summer uniforms for staff members of pristina irport the value of the contract for the purchase of winter uniforms was 1 57060 and the contract for the purchase of summer uniforms was 24997 allegations 1 2 it is alleged that the highest bid received for th winter uniforms was accepted when it was almost twice the cost of the two furthe r bids received and it is alleged there was insufficient information n the bid evaluation sheets as to why the offer from the third company was incomplete 9 bid evaluation report dated 6 december 2002 in dicates that 8 firms were issued with documents and 4 bids were submitted the bids were opened on 27 november 2002 the report indicates at page 3 that vendor 3s offer in the sum of 157060 was almost twice as much as the other t wo bids from vendor 1 80198 and vendor 2 86850 which were reject ed 10 the reason specified for rejection of the bid b vendor 1 on page four of the evaluation was that the evaluation committee asked the company to produce specimen of each type of uniform and it failed to d so this is confirmed in letter to vendor 1 dated 27 november 2002 simila r letter was delivered to vendor 3 11 the evaluation report also concluded that the c ompany vendor 1 has one manufacturer in peja which cant offer the require d quality and had too long date for completion 4 12 in the case of vendor 2 the evaluation report states that the company provided an incomplete offer 13 when asked in what manner the offer was incompl ete in interview the procurement officer member of the evaluation com mittee stated that vendor 2 submitted an offer which did not contain all the required articles 14 the procurement officer was asked why hisher xplanation was not put in the tender evaluation heshe replied that it was due t hisher lack of english in view of the fact that the evaluation committee all signed the evaluation report they would have been aware of the reason for vendor 2s rejection 15 the itf contacted vendor 2 and requested it to provide copy of the tender documents in order verify whether or not its offer was incomplete however the company did not deliver any documents or provide ny information other than the name of the person who delivered the documents and samples for the tender to pristina airport the itf was therefore unable t verify the procurement officers explanation 16 the explanation in the evaluation report that v endor 1 produced uniforms which were of lower quality together with the explanatio n given by the procurement officer in interview that vendor 2 submitted an off er which did not contain all the required articles may account in part for the diff erence in price between the offer from vendor 3 and the lower offers from vendor 2 an d vendor 1 however the price difference is of concern 17 letter of notification and signed contract dated 6 december 2002 confirm that vendor 3 was awarded the contract for the supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenance personnel for the winter season allegation 3 it is alleged that the capital expenditure approva l for the winter uniforms contract was signed on 10 january 2003 after the contract nd letter of notification to the company had already been signed on 6 december 2002 18 capital expenditure approval for the winter u niforms contract appears to have been signed by the divisional manager on 10 january 2003 after letter of notification to the company and the contract had ready been signed on 6 december 2002 19 in view of the necessity to have expenditure au thorised prior to signature of contract the peap official and the divisional mana ger were asked in interview why the contract appeared to be signed before the c apital expenditure had been approved 20 the peap official indicated that although the c ontract was dated 6 december 2004 the actual date of signature for the contract was the protocol stamp on the contract which was 14 january 2003 21 the divisional manager stated that there was date indicating when the contract was signed and added that the date on the contract would not necessarily correspond with the date on which the c ontract has been signed 5 heshe added that the evidence was not conclusive t hat the contract had been signed before capital expenditure approval was obta ined 22 the divisional manager added that heshe assume d the protocol stamp date of 14 january 2003 was the date that the contract was returned to the airport 23 better indicator as to the date on which the contract was signed is contained in routing slip from the procurement officer to offi cial 4 of pillar iv and the kta official dated 13 january 2003 the routing slip st ates your signatures are required before we present the contract to the sele cted supplier this suggests that the contract may not have been signed until 13 january 2003 ie after capital expenditure approval had been obtained allegation 4 it is alleged that the value of the contract for s ummer uniforms was irregularly set at 3 below the limit requiring competitive tender 24 on 3 april 2003 an invitation to quote for the supply of uniforms for the summer season was sent out to 4 companies of which 3 subm itted quotes bids by the deadline of 11 april 2003 25 the offers received were evaluated and vendor 3 awarded the contract contract was signed by vendor 3 on 12 april 2003 an d countersigned by the divisional manager on 18 april 2003 26 the offer received from vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms 24997 was 3 below the maximum limit for competitive shop ping this gives rise to concerns that the offer was set at level to avoid the necessity for competitive tender 27 whilst there is evidence that this was delib erately done second offer was received from the company vendor 2 in the sum of 3 954100 in view of the fact that the evaluation report indicates that contract to be approximately 25000 it is questionable as to whether competitive tender sho uld have been held rather than competitive shopping allegation 5 it is alleged that the companies vendor 1 and vend or 2 were invited to tender for the summer uniforms contract when the evaluation re port for the winter uniforms indicated that vendor 1 could not offer the quality of uniforms required and vendor 2 produced an incomplete offer thereby affording an advantage to the supplier of the winter uniforms vendor 3 28 the evaluation report and tender documents indi cate that two companies vendor 2 and vendor 1 were requested to provide competitiv bids in spite of the fact that some five months earlier vendor 2s previous offer for the winter uniforms had been rejected by the evaluation committee as in complete as it had not included all the items requested whilst vendor 1s previous offer for the winter uniforms had been rejected on the basis that it had one manufacturer in peja which could not offer the required quality 29 the opinion of the winter uniforms evaluation c ommittee concerning vendor 1 was repeated in the findings of the summer uniforms evaluation committee which 6 was indicated by the procurement officer to have re jected vendor 1s offer on the grounds that its offer for the uniforms was not res ponsive from the cut and quality point of view 30 the grounds for the two rejections gave rise to concerns that the inclusion of the two companies in the tender for summer uniforms may have afforded an advantage to vendor 3 the eventual winner having analysed the available evidence and carried out research into the two comp anies the selection of vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the region although doubts about the vendor 1s suitab ility to participate in the summer competitive shopping exercise remain 31 the procurement officer member of the evalua tion committee stated in the course of hisher interview that the companies were invited by one of the peap secretaries secretary 1 or secretary 2 32 the peap official also indicated that the worke r who took delivery of the summer uniforms was secretary 2 33 due to secretary 2s possible connection with nother more serious criminal case involving alleged payments of money in return for jobs at pristina airport itf case 037704 decision was taken by the itf not to interview secretary 2 concerning the choice of companies invited to submi t bids in the competitive shopping procedure in order to avoid any possible prejudice to the more serious case 34 decision was also taken not to interview vend or 3 representative concerning this case due to the fact that heshe was one of th principal suspects in the same criminal case 35 whilst there are some doubts as to the inclusio n of vendor 1 the selection of vendor 2 appears to have been justified in view of its size and reputation in the region in view of this the itf does not find that the competitive shopping procedure was organised in such manner as to prov ide an unfair advantage to the existing supplier vendor 3 allegation 6 it is alleged that the invitations to quote for mmer uniforms sent out to the companies contained differing quantities of items 36 the two invitations to quote for summer uniform s submitted by the companies vendor 3 and vendor 1 contain different quantities of items from that submitted by the company vendor 2 whilst it is accepted that the price of the offer received from vendor 2 was much higher than the other two i t raised question as to whether different quantities of items may have been sent to competing companies 37 when asked about the differences in the quantit ies of items the procurement officer stated that the quantities were changed and revised documents sent out to all the companies before the deadline to submit the offers had ended heshe added that the airport as the procuring entity had the right to do so in view of this response the company vendor 2 was not intervi ewed 7 allegation 7 it is alleged that two further small quantities of uniforms in the sums of 792 and 1188 were purchased without any supporting docume nts or justification 38 two invoices dated 4 july 2003 and 5 august 200 3 indicate that two quantities of 99 and 66 tshirts respectively were ordered with value of 1188 and 792 respectively 39 when asked about these extra purchases the pea p official stated that heshe assumed the airport hired some students and tempora ry staff for three months and that the tshirts were for them to wear the pe ap official subsequently produced two written requests from the security off icial for the two orders dated 1 july 2003 and 1 august 2003 40 when asked why two orders were placed within on month of one another rather than together the peap official stated that the ai rport had run out of tshirts and therefore purchased them from the same company in rder to have the same design of tshirt 41 this explanation is not credible one since i t suggests that the airport did not have any idea as to the numbers of temporary staff being taken on over period of only three months if this was the case it indi cates poor management 42 an alternative could be that two orders were pl aced to avoid having to organise competitive bidding procedure since the limit for single source procurements at that time was 1250 43 the security official was also interviewed by t he itf in connection with the two orders for tshirts dated 1 july 2003 and 1 august 2003 heshe initially stated that the tshirts were purchased for 70 students hi red in the summer of 2003 however heshe later added having reread the docu ments that they were also purchased for approximately 30 workers as well 44 whilst the requests do indicate the tshirts t have been purchased for technical services workers and students both appear to relat to physical workers in view of the fact that the security official stated earlier in hisher interview that each student would be allocated 3 shirts and one pa ir of trousers the number of tshirts ordered 99 and 66 does not correspond wi th the number of employees 45 in addition the two requests specify that the shirts should be the same as the previous shirts of the existing workers this requi rement suggests that vendor 3 who had just won tender for the provision of summ er uniforms to pristina airport in april 2003 had already been chosen as t he supplier 46 the security official stated that heshe had be asked to write request for uniforms by the divisional manager following conv ersation between them on the need for uniforms for the student workers when asked why heshe had addressed the two requests to the peap official rat her than the divisional manager heshe replied that this was because the p eap official was hisher superior however neither of the requests mentions that the security official has spoken to the divisional manager 8 47 the security official also indicated in hisher interview that heshe asked the divisional manager whether company could be found to supply the tshirts as it would be longer and more expensive if tender proc edure took place when questioned further about this response heshe late r added it was not foreseen to have tender procedure in connection with the shirts for students and the part time workers 48 however heshe could not recall who authorised the purchase of the tshirts without tender procedure in summary evidence fr om the two memoranda requesting tshirts and from the security official suggest that two orders were placed within the space of one month with the compa ny vendor 3 in order to avoid having to organise competitive bidding proc edure since the limit for single source procurements at that time was 1250 the documents also suggest that the party who authorised the purchase was the peap official vi conclusions 49 whilst noting the comments in the capital expen diture approval that vendor 3 was the only company that can provide the quality f uniforms needed within the time limit it is of concern that vendor 3s offer for winter uniforms in the sum of 157060 was almost twice as much as the other two bids from vendor 1 80198 and vendor 2 86850 however this may in part be due to the fact that the vendor 2 submitted an offer that did not c ontain all the required articles whilst vendor 1 produced uniforms of lower quality 50 the only original bid documents seen by the itf relating to the tender for the supply of uniforms to administrative and maintenanc personnel for the winter season is the bid submitted by vendor 3 therefore the itf is unable to verify the findings of the evaluation committee resulting in the rejection of the bids submitted by the two other companies 51 evidence as to whether or not capital expenditu re was or was not obtained prior to signature of the contract is inconclusive since the date on the contract 6 december 2002 is contradicted by the routing slip dated 13 january 2003 which suggests that the letter of notification and ct may not have been signed until after 10 january 2003 the benefit of the dou bt must therefore be given to the divisional manager in this respect 52 the offer received from vendor 3 for the supply of for summer uniforms 24997 was 3 below the maximum limit for competitive shop ping of 25000 this raises concerns as to whether competitive tender should have been held rather than competitive shopping procedure 53 whilst there are some doubts as to the quality of uniforms produced by vendor 1 the selection of vendor 2 appears to have been just ified in view of its size and reputation in the region the itf does not therefor find that the competitive shopping procedure was organised in such manner s to provide an unfair advantage to the existing supplier vendor 3 54 the evidence that companies submitting bids wer irregularly requested to provide different quantities of items is not proven in the light of the response given in interview by the procurement officer 9 55 in spite of the explanation given by the peap fficial evidence from the security official indicates that the two small orders for t shirts were placed at value of 1188 and 792 in order to avoid having to organis competitive shopping procedure since the limit for single source procur ements at that time was 1250 it is likely that this was conscious decision and constitutes breach of article 24 of unmik finance administrative instruction 1999 2 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds vii recommendations 56 it is recommended that unmik pillar iv take app ropriate action against peap official based on the findings of this report iv0 427501 57 it is recommended that unmik pillar iv undertak review of the procedures for signing and dating contracts to ensure clarity as t the date on which contract is executed iv0427502
