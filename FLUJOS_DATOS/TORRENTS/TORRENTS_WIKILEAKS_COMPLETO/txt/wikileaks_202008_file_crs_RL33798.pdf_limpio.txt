writing in support of the new as yet unr atified constitution in 1787 james madison identified interest groups or factions groups of citizens united by common impulse of passion or of inte rest as cornerstone of the american regime but one that had potentially negative connotations5 in 1830 alexis tocqueville observed that in country in the world has th principle of association been more successfully applied than in america nd that the inclination to association was positive benefit for american society6 more than two centuries after madisons writings appeared the role of interest groups and lobbyists in contemporary policy ma king is still controversial in the past 40 years observers have noted steady in crease in the number of organized interest groups including associations public intere st groups and professional organizations many of these groups lobby in their own beha lf or retain the services of lobbyists additionally these observers note change in the types of activities lobbyists employ to influence policymaking longstandi ng lobbying techniques of establishing personal ties with members of congress their staffs and executive branch officials testifying at congressional and admin istrative hearings and supporting public officials in their reelection efforts have been supplemen ted by marketing techniques some of these techniques include dir ect mail public re lations newspaper advertisement and other approaches to generate attention nd interest in public policies and programs in an effort to infl uence the decisions of policy makers one consequence of this growth is an increase in the costs of lobbying some observers assert that money plays critical role in gaining access to policy makers and thus desired policy outcomes for those who commit such resources these observers assert that lobbyists might use money to gain favor and influencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33798crs3 7 statements and testimony of fred werthhe imer president

those observers assert that because such funds are intended to help influence the decisions of members they must be subject to appropriate cont rols to protect the integrity of congressional decisions7 others counter that the primary activity of lobbying is communication process regarding issues that may ffect firms organizations and citizens and that such communications are legitimate and nece ssary part of the american political process proponents of this view assert that lobbyists representing broad range of interested parties help members and their st affs both to sort through the large volume of legislative initiatives that are typi cally introduced in each congress and make informed decisions regarding those initiatives for them effective lobbying is not about access or money but organizing nd providing information to congressional and executive branch officials regarding th necessity and potential consequences of various legislative or regulatory initiatives from variety of viewpoints from their perspective enforcement of current rules and regulations regarding disclosure and interactions between government officials and lobbyists such as those cases recently adjudicated8 and enhanced education about thos rules are preferable to enacting more rigorous disclosure regimes9 since the interactions between lobbyis t and policy makers are protected under the first amendment there is likely way to prohibit those interactions in manner consonant with the constitution instead ac tivities of individuals and firms that are compensated as lobbyists are tracked

feca10 as amended but the correlation of the activities of lobbyists and any contributions they might make to candidates is not the intende d focus of that law generally concern has been expressed that current lobbying disclosure requirement s may be inadequate to track all the activities of lobbyists in manner that assures level of transparency sufficient to allow broad understanding of the influences and motivations that animate public policy making some observers believe that one solution to this purported problem is to link data collect ed under lobbying disclosure and campaign finance disclosure laws to achieve clearer understanding of the roles lobbyists play in addition to the constitutional challenges there are practical limitations to identifying the consequences of lobbying activity it is unclear for example how effective lobbyists are at advancing the interests of their clients in policy environment characterized by many lobbyists offering many points of view relatively few policy makers and the simultaneous demands of constituents vying for consideration some argue that money buy s access and lots of money buys lots of access11 and that preferred po licy outcomes could follow12 on the other hand some observers suggest that constituents get the attention of member of congress faster than lobbyist due to members perception of representational duty and perceived electoral pressures13 the difference of interpretation is due in part to the difficulties inherent in efforts to quantif lobbying interactions or in developing qualitative evaluations that capture lobbying activities14 nevertheless this paucityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33798crs5 14 continued politics research vol 33may 2005 pp 404434 and chin constituents versus fat cats pp 751786 15 pl

relations campaigns might circumvent the pro cess of public consideration of lawmaking and regulatory activities observers suggest that the current lda definition of client might allow interested entities to sh ield their lobbying activities through the use of ostensibly separate independent coalitions and associations24 some of these coalitions nd associations sometimes refe rred to as stealth groups form alliances with other groups or serve as groups that exist solely to advance campaign for or against specific policy action25 political scientists darrell west and burdett loomis assert that anonym ous campaigns are carried out in voter education efforts and electoral legislative and rulemaking settings and that the key in each of these efforts is that the actual s ponsor is masked by front organizations that make it difficult for the public to see who really is funding the activity stealth campaigns are consciously designed to fly under the radar of press and public oversight26 in addition to concerns regarding stealth lobbying observers have noted steady increase in the number of interest groups using direct mail public relations newspaper advertisement and other marketing techniques to generate public interest these activities can include engaging citizens to lobby on their behalf to persuade government official regarding legislation or executive agency action some of these organized efforts which are not currently subject to disclosure under lda are also accompanied by sophisticated media campaigns to advance the causes of group27 widespread

public policy makers might circumvent the pro cess of public consideration of lawmaking and regulatory activities those supportin g more detailed disclosure through more frequent or deta iled disclosure or the incl usion of grassroots lobbying efforts under lda might argue that such efforts could afford greater transparency and broader understanding of who supports or opposes particular policy initiative and why from their perspective such an initiative could lead to both better understanding within congress the lobbyin g communities and the general public of how lobbying activities affect the public policy making pr ocess and greater understanding and acceptance of the resulting outcomes critics could argue that expanding disclosure of the activities of coalitions and associations might have potential adverse impact on constitutionally protected rights of assembly associ ation and to petition the g overnment as well as the longstanding tradition of carrying out these activities without the necessity of selfidentification those critics are likely to argue that such changes could have chilling effect on expressing those views or the presentation of critical but politically sensitive matters to lawmakers from their perspective more rigorous disclosure of coalition and association membership could deny policy makers crucial source of information from parties directly affected by pending legislation or regulatory decisions critics of increased disclosure might argue that this could deter members of congress and executive branch decision makers from making broadly informed decisions in their deliberations and could reduce the ffectiveness of policy making in general32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33798crs11 32 continued requirements by jack maskell 33

filing increasingly detailed disclosure reports at more frequent intervals could obligate the registrant to spend increased time and money to comply with the law this could have the effect of further

proponents of lobbying activ ities counter that lobbyin g is legitimate activity protected by the first amendment to the constitution and that all interests are represented35 some maintain that further efforts to extend the duration of the lobbying ban could have the effect of keep ing individuals who might wish to pursue lobbying as career from entering public rvice and may deprive the public as well as congress of access to and the availability of the par ticular expertise of former legislators and staff disclosure of lobbyist contributions and payments the disclosure of campaign contribu tions is governed by feca the acceptance of gifts travel or other considerations by members of congress are governed by house rule xxv limitations on outside earned income and acceptance of gifts and senate rule xxxv gifts as well as criminal laws on bribery and fraud as part of broader c onsideration of lobbying related laws and rules congress might choose to consider changes to existing policies that clarify current practice or proscribe the acceptance of gifts meals or travel from lobbyists some of those proposals could amend lda to require the disclosure of campaign contributions and other payments by lobbyists proposals to link campaign finance and lobbying activities and to enhance current rules regarding the interactions between members of c ongress and lobbyists could serve to provide clear er picture of who participat in public affairs and the scope of the activities that characterize that participation propone nts of such efforts might argue that such efforts could afford greater transparency and broader understanding of the effects of private inte rests in the public po licy making process from their perspective such change might also instill greater government accountability and help to maintain the in tegrity and legitimacy of the broader political system those opposing changes to current lobbying disclosure practices might maintain that expanding lobbying disclosure to include those who make campaign contributions but who may not have any direct participation in lobbying activities could have an dverse effect on the accuracy of lda disclosure data due to potential increase in registrants w ho conduct lobbying but who must register due to affiliations with ent ities that retain lobbying rvices additionally opponents might assert

the number of such referrals made since lda became effective on january 1 1996 is not publicly available during 2006 hearing held by the senate committee on rules and administration to examine procedures to make the legislative process more transparent how ever senator christopher dodd stated that since 2003 the senate office of p ublic records has referred over 2000 cases to the department of justice and nothings been heard from them again40 the department of justice has reporte dly claimed that between september 2003 and september 2005 it has received around 200 referrals involving possible lda violations and has pursued 13 of those cases for further enforcement action of that total media accounts have cl aimed that seven were s till open as of february 2006 three had been closed without further action by the depar tment and three were settled public announcements by the partment regarding the settlements have been identified but it was reported that the three cases were settled for fines totaling 47000 and other considerations including periods during which some registrants were prohibited from conductin g federal lobbying it is not known whether these cases comprise the total lda enforcement effort attorneys for the department of justice reportedly contend that the details of any settleme nts of violations under lda are protected from public disclosure by the privacy act41 an increase in potential penalties for nonc ompliance with lda arguably could increase the level of compliance but it may not be possible to assess those potential benefits given the lack of broadly accepte d understanding of previous enforcement efforts those supporting the approach mig ht argue that more comprehensive and detailed disclosure pr ocess could afford more openne ss of government activity and greater accountability those opposing changes to the current statute might maintain that there could be negative impact on constitutionally protected rights of assembly association and petition of the governme nt additionally opponents might asserthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33798crs15 that if other changes to lda relating to clients are enacted increasing the potential penalties for noncompliance could subject re gistrants to liability in the event that clients whether individuals firms or coalitions withhold information lda administration and oversight lda is administered in the house by the clerk of the house through the legislative resources center and in the senate by the secretary of the senate through the senate office of public r ecords there are

senate re spectively and may have some oversight authority of lda provisions the clerk and the secretary must implement ethics in congress are overseen by the house co mmittee on standards of official conduct and the senate committee on ethics congress might choose to consider range of options regarding the administration and oversight of lda these could include creation of an independent ethics commission within the legislative branch with authority to receive lda registration and reports lda admin istration could be transferred from chamber officers to the ethi cs committees in each chamber another option is the creation of an office of public integrity this office which could be created in the legislative branch or within each chamber could receive lda registrations and disclosure reports and c onduct audits and investiga tions necessary to ensure compliance with lda any entity empowered to administer lda could also be vested with authority to refer violations of the act to doj for further investigation or prosecution in the event that criminal penalties are enacted the creation of new lda administration and oversight proce sses could require the transfer of previously filed disclosure data to the new entity in addition the creation of an office of public integrity ethics commission or transfer of lda responsibility to the chamber ethics co mmittee could necessitate increased staff levels in the legislative branch and concomitant increases in costs to administer those programs finally any reassignment of lda administration might raise questions regarding the status of staff and offi ces that are currently responsible for administering lda the potential consequences of reorgani zing lda administration are unclear for example it is arguable that vesting administration oversight in the chamber ethics committees might provide the opportunity to monitor the interactions between lobbyists and members of congress because those panels already have jurisdiction over congressional ethics rules governing mbers interactions with lobbyists on the other hand it is not clear how thos panels might oversee the disclosure of lobbying interactions with executive branch officials similar c oncerns might affect ethics commissions or public integrity offi ces based in the legislative branch in addition to those concerns creation of integrity offices or
