the island nation through comprehensive economic sanctions incl uding prohibitions on us financial transactions the cuban assets cont rol regulations cacr that are administered by the treasur departments ofac restrictions on travel have been ke and often contentious component of us efforts to isolate the cuban government by denying it access to us currency the regulations do not ban travel itself but place restrictions on any financial transactions related to travel to cuba over the years there have been numerous changes to the cacr regarding family travel in march 2003 the regulations were eased to allow such travel to visit relatives within three degrees of relationship to the traveler eg greatgrandparents and second cousins in june 2004 however the restrictions were tightened to allow family travel only to visit immediate family once every three years for period not to exceed 14 days permission from ofac is required through specific license which ofac reviews and grants on

department of the treasury testimony of robert werner director ofac before the house committee on agriculture march 16 2005 131 world trade atlas department of commerce statisticsunder us sanctions some us commercial agricultural exports to cuba have been allowed since 2001 pursuant to the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 or tsra title ix of pl 106387 however there are numerous restrictions and licensing requi rements for these exports for instance exporters are denied access to us private commercial financing or credit and all transactions must be paid for in cash in advance or with financing from third countries as noted above the adminis tration tightened sanctions on cuba in february 2005 by further restricting how us agricultural exporters may be paid for their product ofac amended the cacr to clarify that the term payment of cash in advance for us agricultural sales to cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the shipment of the goods this differs from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods practice that had been utilized by most us agricultural exporters to cuba since ch sales were legaliz ed in late 2001 us agricultural exporters and some members of congress strongly objected to this clarification on the grounds that the acti on constituted new sanction that violated the intent of tsra and could jeopardize millions of dollars in us agricultural sales to cuba ofac director r obert werner maintained that the clarification conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade130 since 2001 cuba has purchased more th an 24 billion in agricultural products from the united states overall us expor ts to cuba rose from about 7 million in 2001 to 404 million in 2004 us exports to cuba declined in 2005 and 2006 to 369 million and 340 million respectively but increased to 447 million in 2007 in the first seven months of 2008 us agricultural exports to cuba rose to 476 million already surpassing the amount exporte d in 2007 in part because of the rise in food prices131 moreover us food exports to cuba are expected to rise considerably in the remainder of 2008 b ecause of increased cuban needs in the aftermath of several hurricanes and tropical storms that severely damaged cubas agricultural sector
