different economic and environmental forces have converged in recent years to generate growing interest in alte rnate sources of energy including biofuels within the european union eu the european commission ec is using both legislation and formal directives to prom ote biofuel production and use within the eu however eu biofuel production is impeded by its high production cost s relative to fossil fuels to date the most important biofuel produced in the eu has been biodiesel with an 80 share of biofuel production in 2004 bioethanol has accounted for the remainder the major feedstock for eu biodiesel production is rapeseed oil while bioethanol is generally produced using combination of sugar beets and wheat us policymakers are closely watching eu biofuel developments particularly for any successful policy choices that might work in the united states in addition both the production and use of biofuels have important longrun impli cations for eu agricultural production and trade this report briefly introduces some of the more salient agricultural policies and issues related to eu biofuel produc tion and use this report will be updated as events warrant introduction various policy goals reducing gr eenhouse gas emissions boosting the decarbonization of transport fuels diversifying fuel supply sources and developing long term replacements for fossil oil while diversifying income and employment in rural areas have motivated the european union u to promote the production and use of biofuels ie transport fuels produced from renewable organic materials between 1985 and 2004 road transportation i cars and trucks fuel consumption in western europe primarily the eu grew by nearly 50 by 2000 the then eu15 was importing 75 of its petroleum needs with expectations for

gasoline2 by comparison us fuel use was 1776 billion gallons in 2004 petroleum accounts for about 98 of eu transport fuels biofuels comprise slightly more than 1 based on 2001 forecast the european commission ec expects vehicle fuel use in the eu to reach 325 mmt by 2020 in addition under the kyoto protocol the eu has committed to an 8 reduction of carbon dioxide co2 emissions by the end of 20123 various analyses have ggested that both biodiesel and bioethanol produce s ubstantially less co2 emissions depending on the particular feedstock than their fossil fuel counterpart s with these facts in mind in 2005 the ec set goal of replacing 20 of conventional motor fuels with alternate fuels eg biofuels natural gas and hydrogen fuels by 2020 eu biofuels production the eu produced an estimated 768 million gallons of biofuel in 2004 table 1 compared with us biofuel production of 34 billion gallons mostly ethanol4 biodiesel accounted for nearly 80 of eu biofuel pr oduction germany produced over half of the eus biodiesel france and italy are also important biodiesel producers while spain is the eus leading bioethanol producer the supply of feedstocks is crucial to the success of the eus biofuel strategy because they represent the primary cost com ponent in the biofuel pr oduction process the major feedstock for eu biodiesel production s been rapeseed oil although almost any vegetable oil or animal fat i ncluding restaurant deepfry grease is viable in 2004 eu biodiesel production used about 41 mmt of ra peseed or 27 of record eu crop of 153 mmt5 in 2004 the eu harvested

solely for the production of biodiesel or other industrial products and not sold into either food or feed markets energy crop payments in 2003 new round of cap reforms established special aid for energy crops grown on nonse taside land energy crops those grown for the produc tion of biofuels or for use as biomass in the production of electric and thermal energy were eligible for premium of 45 per hectare to establish budgetary ceiling on such outlays the energy payments were to be restricted to maximum guaranteed area of 15 mha12 if fully implemented on 15 mha the program would cost 675

internal sugar support price elimination of the intervention system of sugar purchases and partial sugar production quota buyback the sugar reforms could impact biofuel feedstock availability since they substantially reduce internal sugar beet production incentives13 however much of the potential decline in sugar production could be ffset by drop in eu sugar exports which are restricted to not more than 1273 mmt annually compared with an estimated 71 mmt in 200506 in addition two reform provisions are likely to positively impact the availability of sugar beets as biofuel feedst ock first sugar beet production now qualifies for both setaside payments when grown as nonfood crop and for the energy crop aid of 45ha on nonsetaside area and second suga r used for the production of

2006will be excluded from sugar production quotas despite the reforms the eus internal sugar prices are expected to remain substan tially above internationa l market prices thus preserving it as an expensive feedstock ec directives in recent years the ec has attempted to focus increasing attention on the development of the eu biofuels sector14 three principal legislative directives governing biofuels use taxati on and quality have been issued recently by the ec to guide member state agriculturebased renewable energy production biofuels use directive in 2003 the ec established goal of deriving at least 2 of eu transportation fuel from biofuels by the end of 2005 then growing the biofuels share by 075 annually until december 31 2 010 when it would r each 57515 however the biofuels goal is not mandato ry and individual member states are free to establish higher standards as result the degree of participation varies substantially across eu member states because the targets are not mandatory penalty for noncompliance is involved howev er member states are expect ed to report annually those measures undertaken to aid co mpliance as well as on the sale s of both total transport fuel and the share of biofuels spite various state and euwid policies designed to support biofuels pr oduction the eu biofuels goal of 2 by 2005 was not achieved instead it appears that biofuels attained an euwide share of only about 14 of transport fuels energy taxation directive in 2003 the eus framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity was amende d to allow member states to grant tax reductions andor exemptions in favor of renewable fuels under certain conditions16 however to minimize the tax revenue loss for member states the final tax on biofuels intended for transport use may not be ss than 50 of the normal excise duty fuel quality directive in 2003 the eus environmental specifications for market fuels was amended to establish specifications for petrol and diesel the new specifications encompassed the incorporation of biofuels the european committee for standardization cen has set limits on biodiesel blending to more than 5 share by volume or 46 in energy terms for technical reasons17 as result this appears to be an issue that the ec will need to resolve to achieve its goal of 575 share of transport fuel by 2010 eu biofuels trade biomass productivity whether sugar cane fo r bioethanol or palm oil for biodiesel is highest in tropical environments as result biofuel producti on costs are relatively lower in number of developing countries most notably ethanol production in brazil however global trade in biofuels remains fairly small relative to both biofuel demand as well as to traditional fossil fuel trade in 2004 the eu imported nearly 825000 gallonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22404crs6 18 ec an eu strategy for biof uels com2006 34 annex v of bioethanol18 about 36 of this volume was im ported as normal mo stfavored

euromediterranean agr eement and norway special quota eu imports of biodiesel are subject to an ad valorem duty of 65 since biodiesel production outside of the eu is still limited ther has been significant external trade in biodiesel however to relax pressure on rapeseed oil production biodiesel producers have begun sourcing feedstocks from fore ign sources since 1999 eu imports of palm oil primarily from malaysia have more than doubled to 45 mmt in 2005 representing 18 of world palm oil imports policy summary although the various euwide policies discussed above encourage common goals across member states there exists considerable statelevel variation in terms of the degree of participation in biofuel requirements incentives pr oduction and use in addition eu oilseed production remains cons trained by suitable land and growing conditions as well as high domestic costs of feedstocks relative to foreign producers as result trade of both biofuels and biofuel feedstoc ks is likely to play an increasingly important role in the eu in the future for more information european commission energy new and renewable energies available at httpeuropaeuin tcommenergyres index_enhtm
