science dr gerard encausse b etter known in the world of tradition by the pseudonym of papus gives spe cific example of what he calls psychic telegraphy in concurrence with this monograph dedicated to the study of telepathy as it is used by rosicrucians w suggest that you read this example because it illustrates perfectly what our order has taught for centuries about mental communication the elders to whom th author refers were members of muslim secret society english reports on the war waged in india in connec tion with the revolt of the sepoys relate very strange fact indian bazaa rs always had the news of battles and of their outcome two hours before the t elegram had brought them that is traceable to the psychic communication proc ess used by all orientals process enabling them to cancel time and space in support of this the following is the account of an adventure which happened to m ferdinand lesseps the speed with which news is transmitted in arab c ountries is marvelous here is striking example which we witnessed in m arch 1883 m ferdinand lesseps at the time of his exploration of the s alt lakes of southern tunisia for the inland sea landed in the morning at sfax i led him to the mosque and introduced the muslim dignitaries to him we said t he prayer together then m lesseps announced to them that he was the bea rer of letter from abd elkader recommending colonel roudaires plan he r ead it in the evening he reembarked and the next day at the first hour landed at gabès now from sfax to gabès it takes seven days of march by land yet when on the very evening of his arrival at gabès m seps visited the village of menzel where waiting for him was the djemmaa the c hief of the elders who congratulated him on the letter from the emir the good news he said had reached him from sfax during the day dr gérard encausse 186519163rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 12 dear fratres and sorores the creative power of visualization is not limited to obtaining the realization of desire or the materialization of wish that is particularly close to our heart as you will discover for yourse lf when progressing in the rosicrucian studies the creative power of visualiz ation serves as the basis for large number of mystical practices and constitutes the key to those miracles attributed to masters of the past thus you should accord great importance to the contents of the preceding monographs and let urself be permeated by them as much as possible in this regard do not li mit yourself to reading them only once for as we have reminded you on several ccasions simply having an intellectual knowledge of spiritual principle is not sufficient for you to be in position to apply it successfully in your l ife it must become part of yourself and guide each of your thoughts words and actions constantly bear in mind that mysticism is not an intellectual pastime it is an inner state that must be reflected in your daily behavior and ttract towards you the most positive situations telepathy the process of communicating at distan ce by means of thought is among those mystical practices requiring the use of visualization there are two basic methods used to establish such communicat ion the first involves perfect mental harmonization between two individu alsa transmitter and receiver telepathy is based on transmission of t hought carried out between the objective consciousness of each of these subjec ts for such transmission to take place between them it is necessary for the cond person to know that the first wishes to communicate because this method ca n only succeed if the two people concerned willingly put themselves on the s ame wavelength it is obvious that this form of telepathy although very effective is limited because it implies previous understandin g between the person who transmits and the one who receives yet it is not lways possible to bring this understanding about that is why rosicrucians have used over the centuries second method which unlike the first does not n ecessitate previous agreement between the transmitter and receiver thi s method is based on practice which consists of using the cosmic conscio usness to project precise mental message to the subconsciou s of the person for whom we intend it 4rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 12 we explained to you in the postulant section that ach human being does not truly have an individuality distinct from other s because all people are animated by an emanation from the universal soul an d possess within them the same flow of consciousnessthat of cosmic consc iousness we all bathe in the same vibratory ocean we are all linked by ur spiritual nature and whether we are aware of it or not are affected by the emotions and thoughts of others it is precisely this relationship which allows us to communicate with one another matter how far apart we may be this means that we all have the power to use cosmic consciousness to trans mit mental message to others naturally such transmission requires the m astery of certain technique and it is that technique we wish to present to you today as you will note it constitutes specific application of the method us ed to obtain the realization of desire by means of visualization projecting mental message 1 when you wish to transmit mental message to specific person first define the nature of the message clearly it should be as simple and concise as possible it is imperative that the message be c omposed of minimum of words and that these words be very evocative final ly it involves giving the message the form of mental telegram which summar izes only the essential ideas you wish to transmit 2 after clearly defining your message visualize t he person to whom you wish to send it take into account the instructions that we gave previously to make your visualization effective see that person as though you were really in his or her presence mentally observe this perso ns general build and then the face with all of its characteristics visualize your subjects voice laugh perfume if normally worn etc imagine this perso n with as much realism as if you were physically in his or her presence 3 once the visualization is quite clear and you tr uly have the impression of being in this persons presence repeat your messag several times mentally or in low voice as if you were really nearby sp eaking directly to him or her while doing this imagine that the individual sees and hears perfectly what you are mentally saying see your subject smile or make friendly gesture showing that the recipient understood your message fully 4 when you have repeated your mental message three or four times while visualizing the person to whom you wis h to transmit 5rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 12 it inhale deeply through your nose hold your brea th for few moments then exhale slowly through your nose and say mentally or in low voice this message is projected into the cosmic to the attenti on of give the full name of the person concerned if it pleases the cosmic it is done 5 after having observed the previous instructions forget your message and the person for whom it was intended and place your trust in the cosmic the best way to succeed is to resume your normal activi ties as was the case for the visualization whose purpose was to project desir of what we wanted to be realized the phase of forgetting is imperative th at is the essential condition for the message to be projected into the cosmic sciousness so that it may through its intermediary reach the subconscious of the person concerned receiving mental message ou may have asked yourself how others receive mental message we have transmitted to them most often it appears to them in the form of an intuition that ur ges them to contact us if they are particularly receptive they may even hear it with the same realism as if we had said it to them verbally and they may have t he distinct impression that we have spoken to them in certain cases the messa ge is fully received in one of their dreams and if they are the sort of indivi duals who easily remember what they have dreamed they will wake up thinking of you and of the message you have transmitted in this regard one of the best times to make menta l contact is when the other person is relaxed or asleep because his or h er subconscious is then very active and faces opposition from the objective c onsciousness however you may carry out this form of mystical telepathy at an time of the day when you feel most receptive on the inner level there is ways an interval of time even just few secondswhen any individual is rece ptive to the vibrations of our thoughts another question we may ask ourselves is this how can the persons contacted know whether we were the source of the ssage they received the answer to this question is relatively simple t he method used by rosicrucians for communicating mentally with others is based on the premise that it is possible matter what the distance to use cosmic consciousness as medium to imprint certain ideas into the subconscious of an individual that we know well enough to visualize the subconscious unlike the objective c onsciousness is 6rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 12 able to determine the source of all impressions it receives our subconscious is not limited by either time or space and it perceiv instantly the identity of any person who contacts us the problem is not determining the person who seeks to communicate with us or even the contents of the mental message this person is sending to us rather the problem is transmitting such dual infor mation to our own objective consciousness hence the necessity to develop our i ntuition and generally our aptitude to establish constant communion between our objective self and our spiritual self as we become more intuitive and adept in communicating with our subconscious the more capable we are in p icking up thoughts that are intended for us with positive purpose an example of mental projection let us illustrate what we have just explained regarding the subject of tel epathy through mental projection suppose that you want certain person to get in touch with you as quickly as possible because you have an urgent pie ce of information to ask or transmit this is how you proceed withdraw to place that is as tranquil as possible and relax for few minutes sit comfortably with your back as straigh t as possible and your feet placed flat on the ground and slightly apart from ach other while you are in this position take three or four deep neutral brea ths visualize the person concerned with as much realism as possible as soon as you see him or her mentally with as much clarit precision and life as if you were truly in that persons presence say menta lly or in low voice the mental message you wish to transmit contact as soon as possible while engaged in this visualization repeat the message s lowly three or four times when you feel that your concentration is at its pea k of intensity and that your visualization cannot be made any clearer inhale eply through your nose hold the air in your lungs few moments and then exhal slowly still through your nose after exhaling say mentally or in low voic this message is projected into the cosmic to the attention of full name of the person concerned if it pleases the cosmic it is done afterwards totally forget your message and the pers on for whom it was intended return to your activites with the inner conviction that cosmic law will be put into effect ou may repeat the whole process projecting your message into the cosmic on 7rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 12 additional occasions simply pause for at least h alf hour between sessions in principle two or three attempts should be sufficie nt to reach the subconscious of the person concerned especially if he or she is receptive at that moment this is simple application of the way in which ro sicrucians practice telepathy we are convinced that you will understan d its importance for you have surely been in the position where you wanted t contact person whom you could not reach by usual means of communication apart from this specific example there are great many circumstances where mental projection may prove to be very useful during the days weeks an d months to come you will discover for yourself that many situations may requ ire its use as was the case for the visualization of desire do not expect to be completely successful in your first attempts such faculty requires certain training first you must attain good level of vi sualization and second you must have complete familiarity with the method to b followed also keep in mind that the person to whom you sent your message may not be in receptive state at that moment or this individual will have perceived your message and yet did not take it into account or did not follow his or her intuition whatever the results obtained do not be discouraged during the next several days we suggest that you t ransmit simple mental messages to persons you know quite well and whom u will have an opportunity to meet later to give an example sele ct one person and following the method we have just indicated mentally ask him or her to telephone you for news or to share some of his or her own news with another person follow the same process in order to transmit to him or her you r wish to receive friendly letter finally suggest to third person that he or she pay you visit even if you sometimes have the impression that you have failed in the projection of your mental messages you will probab ly be surprised during some future conversation to hear these individuals exclaim to you its funny but i thought lot about you on that day ou wil l then have confirmation of your success with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 8the purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the wa in which rosicrucians practice telepathy by mental projectio n as you will note the sender uses the objective consciousness t define the content of the mental message to be transmitted since it m ust be reflected on objectively before being projected into the cosmic immediately after being stated this message is projected into the cosmic to the ttention of full name of the person concerned if it pleases the cosmic it is done this message passes into the senders subconscious and then through its intermediary into cosmic consciousness in its turn the latter then sends the message toward the receivers subcon scious which in the form of strong impression intuition or dream r etransmits the message or imprints it strongly into the receivers objecti ve consciousnesssummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 9 visualization is the basis of large number of mys tical practices and constitutes the key to those miracles attributed to masters of the past among those mystical practices requiring the use of visualization we find telepathy the process of sending messages from d istance by means of thought there exist two basic methods for establishing ment communication the first involves transmission of thought occurr ing between the objective consciousness of two subjects the second method involves the use of cosmic consciousness to project specific m ental message to the subconsciousness of the person for whom we intend i t cosmic consciousness is vibratory ocean in which we all bathe that is why we can use it to serve as an intermediary to co mmunicate mentally with all others notwithstanding the distances mental message is generally perceived in the form of intuition strong impression or dream in this regard one of the best times to make mental contact is when the other person is rel axed or asleep for the subconscious is then very active and does not face any interference on the part of the objective consciousness the subconscious unlike the objective consciousnes s is capable of determining the origin of all the impressions it re ceives it is not limited by time or space and instantly perceives the identi ty of any person trying to contact usfirst atrium 13 concurrence 10theophrastes paracelsus an eminent rosicrucian of the 16th century wrote great deal on black magic and superstition since this monograph is directly linked to the study of these subjects we propose t hat you read an excerpt from work that is devoted to them as you will note h attributed the origin of beliefs which have kept humans the prisoners of th most primitive ideas to credulousness and foolishness he devoted his entir life to fighting against ignorance because according to him it is ignoranc which is responsible for all the forms that evil can take on earth centurie s have passed since the death of this great mystic yet the goal of rosicrucian t eachings remains the same to spread knowledge among humans thus liberating u s from prejudice and primitive conceptions which prevent us from being h appy and from evolving toward better comprehension of our divine origin by means of estimation and imaginations many supers titions are fulfilled which are not impressions or incantations or esti mations simply superstitions capable of being understood by similar example i suppose myself imbued with the superstition that when i hear crows chatte r on my roof i consider it the sign of someones death there are many similar examples which need not be quoted this superstition may make ill mysel f or kill my sick friend the cause whereof i set down in my treatise on supersti tions my method of observation is this i regard such cha ttering as natural and that it does not operate according to the foolish i deas of humans by this means my superstition is destroyed for it is rendered do ubtful when i attribute it to my folly nothing destroys superstitions more thorough ly than considering them to be follies thus all harm is taken out of them it is the consensus that leads to action and this consensus is at once removed if i think of my own simplicity and the folly of such empty credulity and this doe s not happen only in the case of crows it happens with many other things which it is not necessary nor would be useful to rehearse in treatise on long life enough has been said on the subject of observations theophrastes paracelsus 1493154111rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 13 dear fratres and sorores the subject of the previous monograph compels us to now consider problem of great importance indeed the method we have taught you for trans mitting mental message to another person may sugg est that any individual by following an identical or very similar technique may project negative thoughts toward us thus the question we may then ask ourselves is this can we come under the influence of evil practices whose aim is to harm us should we believe in the existence of black magic black magic before answering these questions we must first as k ourselves if it is true that some people seek to do evil by means of the creative power of thought unfortunately we are forced to cknowledge that such is the case there do exist some individuals who are k nown as black magicians who engage in practices intended to harm the victim s they have chosen or who have been indicated to them their ways of operatin g differ some of them use incantations or cursesmagical wordswhich accordi ng to them possess the power to unleash demons and evil spirits agains t someone others make mysterious gestures and assert that these gestures set into motion destructive fluids capable of sowing unhappiness and grief sti ll others use photographs effigies statuettes or various other objects and through their mediation claim that they can kill their victims drive them mad m ake them ill burn their homes destroy their herds etc indeed each of th servants of evil has his or her own technique and whether through words or ge stures or even both at the same time it is based most of all upon the power f the mind the question is can this power be used effectively to destructive nds rosicrucian tradition asserts that it is impossible to use mind power to harm other persons at distance thus denying the influence that is sometimes attributed to black magic of course as we have pr eviously mentioned there are some individuals who do engage in evil practice s against certain subjects however it is not these practices which of thems elves may cause evil it is the fear they engender within the consciousness of superstitious individuals moreover you will note that only those people who believe in their efficacy can become their victims this may be explained by the fact that when certain people are convinced that they are und er spell they put themselves into negative mental and emotional state that will in effect harm them in the end in this case they are not under the 12rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 13 evil influence of the one casting the spells rathe r they are under the influence of their own thoughts indeed being convinced that someone wants to harm them they poison their own minds and without trul being aware of it adopt bad form of behavior which eventually makes them ill or attracts painful situations to them therefore we repeat it is very important to under stand that the only power black magic possesses is what we give to it because these practices have absolutely power in themselves their effec tiveness lies only with the persons who lend them any credence because the subject themselves to negative autosuggestion as we shall see in the second temple degree autosuggestion represents great mental force whic h if used wrongly exposes us to many dangers that all originate from within ur own consciousness the greatest destructive power of the mind lies in the negative influence that our own mental attitude can exert upon us if w give it the chance thus without considering the example of black magic it has been scientifically proven that when we constantly harbor negative thou ghts we create within ourselves psychological and physiological condition s that contribute to the onset of illnessboth mental and physical when we begin the study of the sixth temple degree degree devoted to the study of health and mystical healing we will explain to you why this is so and show you that what scientists are now accepting is what rosicrucians have claimed for centuries be that as it may to protect yourself from those w ho claim to cause harm through the use of the mind quite simply pay at tention to them and maintain positive mental attitude any person who refuses to believe in the efficacy of black magicians will not under any circumstance b the victim of their evil practices we can even add that it is the black mag ician who will suffer the harm they wish to inflict most individuals who try to harm others through malevolent practices end up by falling gravely ill or even dying because sooner or later they must suffer the consequences f all the negative thoughts they have entertained superstition we cannot bring up the problem of black magic witho ut considering the problem of superstition since to very large degree it is that which gives to those practices t heir semblance of effectiveness it is impossible to estimate the num ber of superstitious beliefs that have developed over the centuries how ever one thing 13rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 13 is certain all as paracelsus stated have their rigin in human ignorance and none correspond to the workings of natural or unive rsal law let us take few examples to illustrate this in m any countries it is commonly thought that any person who breaks mirro r will experience seven years of bad luck this preconceived notion is so ngraved in the consciousness of certain individuals that they are terrorized by the idea that it may happen to them personally or to any member of their family et logical analysis shows that there is causeandeffect connection betwee n breaking mirror and experiencing misfortune the best proof is that man persons who happen to break mirror or even several mirrors will conti nue to lead perfectly happy existence conversely you know very well that many illfated people have never broken mirror along these same lines it is ridiculous to think t hat the act of walking under ladder will bring bad luck since once agai n there is causeand effect relationship the only reason that should pr ompt us not to walk under ladder is prudence indeed the presence of ladde r generally indicates that person is working overhead and that if we walk belo w we risk being injured if tool should fall from rosicrucian point of view this kind of superstition has its origin in erroneous thinking or an incorrec t association of ideas among superstitious beliefs there are many that in volve animals thus it is frequently said that encountering black cat or crow is bad omen that anyone hearing an owl hoot will have bad luck befor long or that it is very bad omen to see bat fly after the sun goes down such beliefs are absurd and more serious still they have given rise to acts of savagery during past centuries black cats had their throats slashed and crows were poisoned as for owls and bats they were nailed to the doors of homes or bar ns in certain regions such horrors are still committed which proves to what xtent superstitious beliefs are anchored in peoples mentality it is obvious t hat animal brings bad luck and that such sacrifices are the height of hum an meanness and stupidity to claim the contrary would be like saying that div ine intelligence created animals which have in themselves the power to do ev il or to transmit evil all animals without exception have their usefulne ss and even if they appear frightening to us each one has its part to play as part of the chain of evolution in this regard humans h ave rights over them except to respect and love them as they are moreover all 14rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 13 those who mistreat animals or cause them to endure useless sufferingin the name of superstition or even sciencecreate negativ karma for themselves indeed while it is false to believe that some anim als bring bad luck it is true that anyone who causes some animal to suffer w ill someday experience misfortunes intended to make that person understand the cruelty of his or her own acts as is the case with all superstition those associa ted with animals are based on preconceived ideas and must be vigorously opposed to return to the examples that we previously cited it is good t remember that the cat was venerated by the ancient egyptians the goddess bas tet who was represented with the features of this animal was considered to be the benefactress and protectress of humanity in ancient greece both the crow and owl were under the protection of athena goddess of wisdom as for t he bat it is the symbol of happiness and of longevity in many eastern tradi tions in the past these animals were regarded with much respect and were so metimes the object of religious cult if these creatures were later lin ked to negative beliefs it was due to the ignorance of human beings and to their i ncapacity to understand and respect all forms of life while the color blac k has often been associated with evil it is ridiculous to imagine that any obj ect or animal displaying that color is maleficent likewise just because night obscurity and darkness traditionally represent the negative aspect of life it should not be deduced that nocturnal animals are demoniacal and bring bad luck what is involved here is we repeat set of associations or of ideas without any philosophical or mystical foundation since an animal cannot bring bad luck it is quite obvious that animal exists which can bring good luck the same is likew ise true of any object thus fetishes amulets charms talismans medals etc have power in themselves it is incorrect to think that they c an bring luck exorcise evil spells serve as protection or accomplish any othe r action favoring the person who wears them or places them in specific spot in his or her house once again such beliefs are based on superstitions that have been transmitted from generation to generation they have absolutely v alidity if happiness depended solely on possessing certai n object or having certain animal by ones side it would imply that any individual having that object or animal could const antly violate 15rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 13 human and divine laws without the risk of experienc ing negative consequences it is evident that this is in total contradiction t the basic principles of mysticism of spirituality and in general of life itself it is also absurd to claim that if person is experiencing misfortune it is only becau he or she possesses good luck charm when we begin the study of karma i n detail you will fully understand that human beings individually and colle ctively reap what they sow and that their joys and miseries are due to the way in which they apply free will happiness has nothing to do with the wearing of socalled potent object or the practice of superstitious belief all masters of the past whoever they may have been opposed all forms of superstition for they knew that such thinking gene rated fanaticism intolerance and disrespect for life as member of amorc cont inue their struggle and set the example of balanced thoughtful being ani mated by positive ideas having their source in the understanding and applic ation of cosmic laws in this regard your role is very important for super stitious practices and beliefs are responsible for many misfortunes befalling huma nity therefore whenever the occasion arises you have the duty to show that these practices and beliefs have foundation and that they considerably dama ge the evolution of any socalled civilized society with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 16in this monograph we have explained that the power of black magic lies solely in the fear aroused by such practice in the consc iousness of superstitious persons yet fear when it is reasonably founded is an emot ion which plays useful role in everyones life indeed if human beings were in capable of experiencing this emotion we would often place our lives in danger b engaging in acts exceeding the limits of our physical or mental potential in this sense fear is truly the ally of certain form of wisdom and constitutes the fou ndation of the instinct of self preservation what we regret is that fear has been used for servi purposes for such long time for centuries fear was the basis of an education based on corporal punishment however when fear is used as the exclu sive means of forcing child to recognize authority whether that of the childs parents or teachers it arouses within the child feelings of submission and frustration t he child often grows into an adult who may be dominated by false beliefs and superstition the power of many religions has been to maintain it self and to continue to maintain itself by the use of dogmas based on the f ear of and the fear of eternal damnation such religions keep their worshipers ign orant of mystical laws and take advantage of their moral submission to cultiva in them permanent feeling of guilt this involves grave error because peop can evolve only by applying their free will and by learning to think for themse lves from this point of view rather than demanding blind submission to some comm andment religious codes should explain how certain actions are harmful to t he individual or society the spontaneous desire to do good should guide the fait hfuland not the fear of doing evil these remarks are not an unconditional critic ism of religion as the vehicle of fundamental ethical and spiritual values rather t hey are the condemnation of all practices that use these values to dominate human b eings by maintaining fear and through the teaching of dogmatic if not superstiti ous beliefs during the next few days examine some of your beli efs and see if they are based on personal thoughts or on ideas inculcated i n you by others evaluate the influence which the opinion of others has exerted r is exerting on you and by so doing act accordingly to acquire greater freedom f thought also take the time to analyze current superstitions and determine whet her some of them make an impression on you if such is the case you absolut ely must use your good sense and free yourself from their domination for they h ave reality outside of your own consciousnesssummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 17 rosicrucian tradition maintains that it is impossib to use the power of the mind to harm people from distance thus denying t he influence which is sometimes attributed to black magic only those persons who believe in the efficacy of evil practices can become its victims because when they become convinced tha t they are under spell they put themselves into mental and emotio nal state that will harm them in the end the only power black magic possesses is that which we give to it this practice has absolutely efficacy in itself its effectiveness lies only with the persons who lend it any credence subjecting th emselves to negative autosuggestion it has been scientifically proven that when we cons tantly harbor negative thoughts we create within ourselves psychological and physiological condi tions which contribute to the onset of illnessboth mental and physical person who refuses to believe in the efficacy of black magicians will not under any circumstances be the victim of their evi l practices evildoers are the ones who will suffer the harm they wish to infl ict all superstitions have their origin in erroneous re asoning or in an incorrect association of ideas that do not correspond to univ ersal or natural law all those who mistreat animals or cause them to end ure useless suffering either in the name of superstition or sciencecreat negative karma for themselves anyone who causes an animal to suff er will someday experience misfortunes intended to make that person understand the cruelty of his or her acts while it is false to believe that some animals brin g bad luck it is quite obvious that none can bring good luck the sa is true for any object fetishes amulets charms talismans medal s etc have power in themselves individually and collectively people reap what the sow and their joys and miseries are due to the way in which they apply fre will happiness has nothing to do with the wearing of socalled poten t object or the practice of some superstitious belief first atrium 14 concurrence 18the triangle has always been used to symbolize cert ain mystical laws and principles in one of the temple degrees we will st udy its symbolism in detail and see that it varies according to the traditions and religions involved within the framework of this atrium we will limit ourselv to examining the major law that it represents for rosicrucians since this monograph is devoted to that study we propose that you read an excerpt of text found in our orders archives ou will note the law of the triangle hol ds significant place in our teachings all that has been is and will be is governed by t he ternary because it is the ternary which unites the elements that natur has opposed so that mutually complementing one another they mix their potencies and give rise to what was not at the beginning of time the unity xisted alone in the ineffable yet already in its thought god had conceived multi plicity through its v erbum it projected into infinity the primordial substance and the one found in two the mirror it was seeking then the primordial subs tance received the breath of divine essence and it was then that out of the fiat lux surged the three and with it all the forms of life and the human is one of the multiple reflections of the ternary because our soul is only segment of divine essence and our body fragment of the primordial substance and it is because we are soul and body one and two that we are living and scious being manifesting in matter the third point of spiritual triangle and as we are also at the crossroads of macrocosm and microcosm we are also in the center of circle the universal circle which sets the limits of two triangles the first looking toward heaven and the second toward earth rosicrucian archives19rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 14 dear fratres and sorores the method we have taught you for projecting ment message toward specific person leads us to very important myst ical law of the rosicrucian tradition the law of the triangle this method req uires the interplay of three fundamental points the sender cosmic consciousnes s the receiver if you refer to the diagram in the practical application f monograph 12 the existence of these three points will seem obvious t you simple analysis of this diagram clearly shows that it is impossible to transmit or receive mental message if the corresponding triangle is not formed moreover it is for this reason that one can use the power of thought to exert negative influence over you because cosmic consciousness does not rel ay that kind of influence on the contrary it contributes to the transmission and reception of any positive mental impression the w of the triangle mental projection is only one application of the law of the triangle as this law is universa l and applies to all that exists whether on the material plane or the spiritual plan it is based on the premise that perfect manifestation can be produced if tw conditions of an opposite nature do not come together thus the one in the science of numbers represents only beginning start an initial co ndition needing its opposite to take on complete expression or form without t he two the one remains in latent state and can produce true material or spiritual manifestation that is why mystics have stated for centuries that all of creation obeys the law of duality when one and two are placed in the presence of each other they mutually attract and from their union three is born third condition which in itself is the point of manifestation of the triangle thus formed that third condition then possesses the qualities of the first two while constituting distinct entity let us take two simple examples to illustrate the l aw of the triangle in nature life with the exception of few plant or animal species cannot perpetuate itself without the union of two compleme ntary cells male and female as long as that union is not achieved proc reation is not possible if we consider the human species we see that the birth f child results from the fusion of spermatozoon and an ovum that fusion is an example of the law of the triangle because one uniting with two produces three which is none other than the child itself this 20rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 14 child while distinct entity from its father and mother is genetically speaking combination of the two the same principle applies to the material world n electrical current possesses positive phase and negative phase an d the union of these two phases produces electricity such as we generally u it once again we see that the law of the triangle is the combination of two opposing conditions which produces third for without the encounter f the negative and positive poles phenomenon of electricity can manifest in tangible manner here is an important point when one is put in the presence of two and internal or external agent opposes it their uni on inevitably gives rise to three it is this finding that is the source of the sayi ng everything comes in threes many sayings despite their simple and fam iliar appearance illustrate some of the greatest laws of nature and of the univ erse when for instance the opposite poles of two magnets are brought together an attraction is inevitable the application of the law of the triangle to the p henomenon of magnetism results if ball is thrown against wall it wil l of necessity bounce back since the act of throwing ball gives rises to an active force which when in contact with the passive condition represented by the wall produces manifestation the rebound we could use number of examples to show you that all manifestations result from the encounter of two conditions of an pposite nature when this encounter occurs in the world of living matter the two forces in conjunction are described as male gender and female gender when it is manifested in the realm of electricity or magnetism we speak of positive polarity and negative polarity when it is applied to physical or chemical phenom ena we use the terms active principle and passive principle yet matter what terminology is used the fundamental law involved is that of th triangle when the terms negative and positive are used in conjunction with the law of the triangle it is important to understand that negative does not indicate bad or harmful condition in contrast to good r useful condition in reality the two words are relative and concern two polarities that are of equal importance in the application of this law on both t he material plane and the spiritual plane if we consider once again the case of procreation man on his own cannot perpetuate lif or give birth to children likewise the positive phase of electr icity is insufficient 21rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 14 to produce an electrical current as we indicated p reviously the negative phase is indispensable in general every phenomenon or very manifestation results from duality having two poles two aspects or tw elements whose function makes them complementary or indispensable to one an other applying the w of the triangle does the law of the triangle have practical value in our everyday aff airs the answer of course is yes before starting on any new project we can mentally set out our plans in the form of triangle and very carefully define the two conditions we must combine in order to obtain the desired result such an analysis generally makes it possible to discern what we should do or not do to say or not say so as to produce the third point that of the manifestation we desire likewise when we are confronted by disagreeable test or situation rather than enduring it and bemoaning our fate we must determine what two conditions brought it about having done that our task remains to cancel one of them so that this misfortune or situation may di sappear on its own in some cases it is enough to act on the human level to pro duce this cancellation in other cases it must be created in the cosmic by using th power of visualization quite often it is best to join our own efforts to t he spiritual aid we may receive the subject of health affords good example to ill ustrate what we have just explained indeed any illness whether we realize it or not manifests according to the law of the triangle resulting from the conj unction of two conditions or two points illness is the third point of particu lar triangle the first point is none other than the sick person for he or she is the on enduring the suffering caused by his or her condition he or she therefore consti tutes the passive principle of the triangle thus formed the second point is defin ed by the cause of the illness which in this particular case represents the acti ve principle as long as that cause remains unchecked the illness will persist it is therefore necessary to discover the cause and then cancel it after having established the diagnosis little rest and appropriate treatment generally llow healing to take place to this material action should be added the spiritua l aid we may receive from the cosmic for this to occur the instructions giv in the booklet liber 888 council of solace should be followed after the cause of suffering is neutralized the corresponding triangle ceases t exist for the second point has been canceled illness then disapp ears and the patient recovers his or her health 22rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 14 to conclude our study of the law of the triangle w must specify that for centuries rosicrucians have made distinction betw een its material application and its spiritual application even if the principl involved are the same when applied to the material world we symbolize this w by triangle whose point is directed upwards in the absolute such triang represents for rosicrucians perfect earthly manifestation when applied to th spiritual world we use triangle whose point is directed downwards in co ntrast to the previous one it is the mystical representation of cosmica lly perfect manifestation it sometimes happens that the two triangles are repres ented together with the two interlaced as in the star of david or in solomons seal in this case the symbol thus formed corresponds to the number 6 and evokes the union of the material and spiritual worlds with all the manifestations p roper to them in the practical application of this monograph you will find repre sentation of the symbolism of the triangle as perpetuated by us in the rosicru cian teachings it is with this monograph that the first atrium com to close the next entitled the analytical series will constitute review of everything we have examined during the previous months as you will it takes the form of series of exercises whose purpose is to test your bility to analyze some specific situations which in all cases will have direct connection with what you have studied since beginning your affiliation with our rder in the meantime we ask that you pay full attention to the examination offi cially closing the first degree of this neophyte ction read each question carefully and try to answer it as briefly as possib in your study notebook if you have any difficulty in finding one of the answers the subject matter undoubtedly deserves further review in that case do not hesit ate to study again the corre sponding monograph between two consecutive regular sanctum periods with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 23as we explained in this monograph rosicrucians rep resent any perfect material manifestation by triangle with i ts point directed upward the phenomenon of electricity constitutes good example of this particular application of the law of the trian gle as for the second triangle it represents the typical plan that any s piritual manifestation follows that is why its point is directed downward we have applied this symbolism to the process of thought for we have that it results from the interplay occurring in the brain between the vi brations of spirit and those of soul the former energy being predominantl negative and the latter being predominantly positive the third figu re illustrates universal creation the union of all material and spiritual m anifestationssummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 24 the method of sending mental message to specifi c person obeys the mystical law of the triangle by virtue of that law one can use the power of thought to exert negative influence upon us because cosmic consciousness does not relay this kind of influence the law of the triangle is universal and applies to all that exists whether on the material plane or the spiritual plane it is based on the premise that perfect and complete manifestation can occur only if two conditions of an opposing nature come together when one and two are placed in each others presence they attract one another and from their union is born three third condition which in itself is the point of manifestation of the triang thus formed the popular saying everything comes in threes ill ustrates the law of the trianglethat is when two opposing conditions are brought together their union results if internal or external agen t opposes it before starting on any new project we should menta lly set out our plans in the form of triangle and very carefully determ ine the two conditions we must combine to obtain the desired result for centuries rosicrucians have made distinction between the material application and the spiritual application of the w of the triangle even if the principles involved are the same in rosicrucian tradition triangle whose point is directed upward represents perfect earthly manifestation trian gle pointing downward symbolizes perfect spiritual manifestation when those two triangles are intertwined they evoke the union of the materi and spiritual worlds with all the manifestations proper to them notes 25notes 26first atrium selfexamination
