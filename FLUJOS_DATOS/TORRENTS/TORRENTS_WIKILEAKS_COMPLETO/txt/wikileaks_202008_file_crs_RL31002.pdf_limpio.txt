court the treasury and general government appropriation always has at least two titles in addition to the four covering the funding for specific agencies these general titles apply restrictions or rules of the road governmentwide and quite often contain authority for defined actions for example each year there is standard language which prohibits the use of any appropriated funds for the purpose of employing individuals who are not us citizens or citizens of nations either specified in that section of the act or on the state department list of nations covered by treaties which requires that all agencies maintain drugfree workplaces and which authorizes the expenditure of funds appropriated under any act to be used to pay the travel expenses of immediate family members if

otherwise noted those provided by the house committee on appropriations these figures rather than those found in the budget submission are used because they are the basis on which appropriators make their decisions and provide the most recent updated information the budget documents provided by the office of management and budget and the appropriations bills do not necessarily follow the same organization of accounts for example not all of the agencies which are organizationally within the executive office of the president as found in the budget are funded through the treasury postal service and general government appropriations legislation also the fy2002 and fy2001 individual account data in this report do not reflect scorekeeping by the congressional budget office see the glossary for definitions of discretionary and mandatory spending in some instances the mandatory levels drive up the percent of increase represented in the appropriation the appropriators are bound by those entitlements under permanent law and control only the discretionary spending levels the data in the tables and the funding levels provided in the text unless otherwise noted reflect the mandatory and discretionary funding combined fte or fulltime equivalent is budgetary term and does not represent the number of personnel employed by or the number of actual positions allowed in department or agency the fte number is calculated by dividing the total number of staff hours worked in given 12month period usually the fiscal year by the total number of hours in workyear 2087 the number of on board personnel at any given time and the total number of people working in the organization during the course of the year are two entirely different statistical results seasonal

program is intended to make it easier for low and middleincome individuals to gain access to variety of financial services the treasury department plays an important role in federal efforts to combat terrorism through its statutory missions and law enforcement responsibilities treasur bureaus are responsible for protecting the president designing and implementing security at special events like the 2002 winter olympics investigating incidents involving arson and the use of explosives and firearms monitoring and analyzing the financing of terrorist activities preventing weapons of mass destruction from entering the country and implementing sanctions against terrorist organizations with one exception however none of the bureaus has an appropriation account designated specifically for counterterrorism that exception is the counterterrorism fund which is intended mainly to respond to unanticipated emergencies by covering costs related to efforts to counter investigate or prosecute domestic or foreign terrorism and to rebuild the operational capabilities of federal offices facilities or other properties damaged or destroyed as result of terrorist incidents the fund can be used only with the advance approval of the house and senate appropriations committees while the exact size of the departments budget for counterterrorism in fy 2002 is unclear it is thought to be at least 419 million see table 2 please see the section on terrorism for further details on funding for counterterrorism within the treasury department there is reason to believe that the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 are resulting in expansion of the departments involvement in counterterrorism on september 14 2001 the bush administration announced that the treasury departments office of foreign asset control ofac is leading an interagency group devoted to disrupting fundraising by foreign terrorists on october 25 2001 multiagency effort to investigate the financing of terrorist groups known as operation green quest was launched and some of the agencies involved are the irs customs service fincen secret service and ofac and on october 26 2001 president bush signed the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10756 which expands the power of the treasury department to combat money laundering and investigate suspicious foreign financial transactions it is reasonable to expect that these efforts and others that may arise in coming months could lead the bush administration to request significant increase in the departments funds for counterterrorism in fy 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl3100225 for

commercerelated merchandise processing fee mpf established by the 1986 omnibus budget reconciliation act obra customs generally has control over the allocation of mpf fee receipts cobra fee receipts on the other hand are not appropriated for obligation by congress and they account for substantial portion of funding available to customs for expenditure each year from fy1992 to fy1999 cobra fee receipts have ranged from about 176000000 to 274000000 there are codified limitations on the use of cobra fee receipts and initially they were used principally to pay overtime costs for inspectors and caninehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31002crs17enforcement officers surplus revenues could be and were carried over from one year to the next such carryover has been used to fund recurring costs in positions and equipment from previous years as result cobra fee receipts have funded an increasing share of permanent inspector positions and information technology costs in fy2000 however there were reports of dropoff in air passenger processing fee receipts consequently the growing reliance on cobra fee receipts to fund base positions in conjunction with dropoff in receipts may prove problematic in fy2001 as customs may not have allocated enough to pay overtime for customs officers to address the decline in cobra fee receipts the housepassed measure would provide 15000000 for additional positions the conference agreement was silent on this issue the authorization for the cobra fees expires at the end of fy2003 internal revenue service irs the federal government levies individual and

the provision section 609 fy2001 which prohibits payment to political appointees functioning in jobs for which they have been nominated but not confirmed this provision has been in the bill for at least twenty years the previous administration also recommended its elimination the house adopted an amendment which would reinstate that language the bush administration also recommended elimination of the provision section 612 fy2001 which prohibits use of funds to implement administer or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved through statutorily authorized means if the provision were eliminated conceivably the executive could continue regulatory activities which congress had disapproved through resolution of disapproval or the congressional review act the provision in the bill since the early 1980s had been recommended for elimination by the previous administration also the provision appears as section 612 pl 10767 another section section 621 fy2001 recommended for elimination by both the bush and clinton administrati ons is that which requires that funds may be obligated or expended for employee training that does not directly relate to the employees official duties that contains elements likely to induce high levels of emotional response or psychological stress in some participants that does not notify employees of content in the course or postcourse evaluation that contains any methods or content associated with religious or quasireligious belief systems or new age belief systems and that is offensive to or designed to change participants personal values or lifestyles away from the workplace the language affirms the agencies responsibilities to train staff for the performance of officialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31002crs38duties this language has been in the bill since the mid1990s the provision appears as section 621 in the act section 622 fy2001 prohibits the use of funds to require and execute employee nondisclosure agreements without those agreements having whistleblower protection clauses the bush proposal would eliminate that provision which has been in the bill for over ten years the provision appears as section 622 in the act section 627 fy2001 requires approval by the committees on appropriations of release of any nonpublic information such as mailing or telephone lists to any person or any organization outside the federal government that provision would be eliminated under the presidents proposal it appears as section 625 in the act federal employees in executive agencies are required section 629 fy2001 to use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties that requirement in the bill since fy1999 has been slated for elimination by both the bush and clinton budget proposals the argument has been that the ethics statutes in fact place that same requirement on all federal personnel the provision appears as section 627 in the act there were four new sections proposed in the presidents budget to extend to october 1 2002 the franchise fund pilot programs established under the federal financial management act of 1994 pl 103356 budget proposal section 628 pl 10767 section 634 to amend

budget analytical perspectives p 139 crs53federal personnel issues pay general under the federal pay comparability act of 1990 fepca federal white collar employees paid under the general schedule and related salary systems are to receive annual adjustments based on two separate mechanisms the first is the adjustment to base pay which is based on changes in private sector salaries as reflected in the employment cost index eci the rate of pay adjustment is supposed to be the percentage rate of change in that element of the eci minus 5 for january 2002 the base pay adjustment is 36 the presidents budget proposes federal civilian pay increase of 36 in january 200270 however the proposal does not indicate how the pay increase would be split between basic pay and localitybased payments for the general schedule and related pay systems the fy2002 budget resolution hconres 83 as agreed to in the house march 28 2001 and in the senate april 6 2001 expresses the sense of the congress that there should be parity between military and civilian pay adjustments president bush recommended 46 increase in military pay the president did not submit an alternative plan by the end of august which would indicate that the national general schedule pay adjustment will be at the mandated eci level of 36 the deadline for an alternative plan related to locality based payments was the end of november pl 10767 provides for general schedule increase of 46 on july 17 the house committee adopted an amendment which would bring the fy2002 civilian pay raise to 46 on july 25 the house in adopting the rule hres 206 and subsequently passing hr 2590 provided 279 million for partial costs associated with the 46 increase s 1398 as introduced would fund the pay increase at 46 see also crs report rl30744 federal pay fy2002 salary adjustment and crs report 94971 pay and retirement benefits for federal employees increases since 1969 executive order 13249 signed december 28 2001 sets out the pay schedules it establishes an average 46 pay increase for the general schedule all employees receive the 36 base pay adjustment the localitybased comparability payments bring the net increases up by about 1 on average the net adjustments range from 452 to 542 with the washington d c area general schedule employees receiving 477 increase federal wage system the federal wage system fws is designed to compensate the federal blue collar or skilled labor force at rates prevailing in local wage areas for like occupations if the statutory system were allowed to be managed as planned the wage rates and the rates of adjustment in the over 130 wage areas would vary according to the labor costs and compensation in the private sector for the last several years congress has limited the rates of adjustment based on the rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl3100271 hr 2590 conference agreement section 613 conference report p 71 crs54of adjustment for the general schedule71 part of the rationale for that decision is that in certain high costs areas some fws wages would exceed the salaries paid to general schedule supervisors wages in lower cost areas will be allowed to increase according to the findings of the wage surveys but the high cost area wages will be capped the house committee expressing concern about the adequacy of the wage surveys utilized in determining the cost of labor for bureau of prisons wage grade positions would require review and report by opm within 90 days of enactment opm is also required to report on proposal to realign wage area in california pl 10767 limits the wage grade adjustments to those received by the general schedule pl 107117 extends the monroney amendment outofarea survey application to department of defense personnel members of congress judges and other officials under the ethics reform act of 1989 as amende d pay adjustments for federal officials including members of congress and judges are also based on eci calculation s but for different 12month period the eci calculations dictate pay adjustment in january 2002 of 34 however the statute limits those adjustments to the rate of adjustment for base pay of the general schedule therefore hypothetically if general schedule base pay were adjusted at the rate of 33 or below that would have been the maximum rate of adjustment in salaries of federal officials for january 2002 unlike that for members of congress and executive branch officials the annual pay increase must be specifically authorized for judges the authorization for the january 2001 pay increase is in the commerce state justice and judiciary appropriation pl 10777 section 305 at time since the authorization was required have the judges received lower adjustments than the other officials because the mechanism described above is automatic there is bill language necessary to establish the pay adjustment for january 2002 during debate on the treasury bill rule and provisions there was very brief discussion about whether the bill would allow an increase in pay for members the act pl 10767 is silent with regard to member pay see also crs report rs20278 judicial salaries current situation crs report 9853
