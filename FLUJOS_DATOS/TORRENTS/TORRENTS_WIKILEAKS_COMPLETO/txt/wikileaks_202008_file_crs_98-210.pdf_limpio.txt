the conference included general reduction of 505m of unobligated prior year funds gainst the entire program because of delays in equipment and environmental construction permits the dod family housing improvement fund was reduced to 2m from 242m in the hous bill and 7m in the senate bill the large reduction in the house bil l reflects full funding of construction projects in traditional family housing accounts rather than the family housing improvement fund transfer authority to the fund is provided for qualified projects from regular family housing accounts the conference committee noted that 90 of resources xpended for the house revitalization support office hrso for fy199698 was for consultant support therefore the c onferees reduced support for family housing improvement fund to 2m

acquisition of either the leased building or additional land for us souther n command headquarters relocated from panama to miami florida and devolution of chemical demilitarization construction from office of th secretary of defense to the army because of the importance of this activity to overall national security both committees like their authorization counterparts lamented genera l underfunding by the dod of military construction especially for decreasin g maintenance backlogs and increasing quality of life projects the house appropriations committee cided to put all requested privatization projects from the family housing construction account into the family housin g improvement fund increasing the budget re quest of 7 million to 242 million this allocation will enforce the use of privatization authorities mechanisms for thes projects budget agreement usually the budget resolution sets the stage for th appropriations process however the work on this years agreeme nt

issues by martin cohen and stephen daggettcommittees believe that authority should stay within osd each committe noted delays in dods obligation of money for chemical demilitarizatio n projects often because of construction and environmental permit problems the senate cut 50 million from the program because of the backlog f unobligated funds the senate authorizers noted the trend for the dod to fund militar construction projec ts with prior year savings instead of including full funding for the military construction budget the trend started i n the fy1997 and continued through to the fy1999 proposal the sasc denied the use of prior year savings and expects the dod to fully fund military construction requests in future budgets the defense authorization conference report hrept 105736 passed th house on september 24 and the senate on october 1 the fy1999 authorization bill became pl 105261 on october 17 1998 key policy issues recent history and context the funding pattern for military construction budgets in recent years the congress has added significant amounts to annual administrations militar construction budget requests congress added 479 million in fy1996 850 million in fy1997 and 800 million in fy1998 to the military construction accounts three themes xplain the pattern of reoccurring congressional additions first some members of the military construction subcommittees believe that militar construction has been chronically underfunded military construction proponents including faci lity advocates in the military services argue that military facilities have been systematically underfunded for many years even some say in the midst of the defense buildup of the 1980s in arguing that military construction has been chronically underfunded do d facility managers state that th ey have not met their goal of budgeting 3 of the plant replacement value of dod facilities for annual construction and maintenance called real property maintenance at the pentagon although this 3 goal is below th average for public fac ilities nationwide actual dod funding has typically run at 1 to 2 of plant replacement value for example the air force testified on march 11 1998 to the house national security subcommittee for military installations an d facilities that the air force could manage to budget only 1 for real propert maintenance thus facility proponents welcome congressional additions3 second other members of congress as senator bond commented during the floor debate on fy1996 military construction appropriations believe that th pentago n counts on congress to add money to guard and reserve programs i nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98210crs7 for discussion of the formulation of the defense budget proposal by the dod see crs4 report 93317 defense budget primer by keith berner and stephen daggettrecent years congress has added as much as 4018 million fy1995 for national guard and reserve construction projects see table 5 third often congress has different priorities from the administration congressional military construction subcommittees authorization as well s appropriations subcommittees have often taken issue with administration military construction priorities in the 1990s for ex ample the committees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas on the grounds that troop level s abroad should be reduced and that allied burdenshari ng contributions should increase and reallocated the funds to domestic projects in addition congressiona l committees have added unrequested funds for quality of life improvements such as day care centers and barracks renovation the congressional defense committee s have argued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor of warfighting investments funding and longterm plann ing for military construction inadequate along with concern about the level of funding members of congress have als complain ed that poor pentagon planning make it difficult for the congress to insure that added military construction projects meet pressing priorities the military construction budget request is created within the department f defenses planning programming and budgeting system ppbs the ppb s4 process is used to prepare dods internal longterm financial plan the longterm plan extends over sixyear period and is known as the future years defense plan fydp in the 1990s congressional defense committees repeatedly criticized th pentagons longterm planning for military construction in the fy19 98 hearings the chairman of the house subcommittee on military construction representative ron packard chastised the department of defense for repeatedly failing to submit honest budgets reflecting real service priorities h complained that the military construction request traditionally leaves out necessar projects especially for the national guard and reserve which the services expec t congress to add mr packard wanted the subcommittee to get out of the business of adding money for projects that the administration had not requested but ye t apparently needs he also wanted dod and the services to use the future year s defense plan fydp rigorously to set priorities for their construction projects and to integrate guard and reserve needs in testimony on the fy1998 request t the military construction subcommittee of the house appropriations committee thendod comptroller john hamr admitte d that dod needs to undertake good detailed planning for the militar construction budget and s not done this in the past hamre also conceded that the dod has not evaluated the accuracy of the military construction fydps and that he saw need for that assessment its report on the fy1998 military construction appropriations bill hrept 105150 the house appr opriations committee called for dod to prepare futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98210crs8 years defense plan fydp for military construction at the project level of detail including guard and reserve requirements the fy1999 military construction hearings reviewed service efforts to integrate guard and reserve needs into the budget request the services especially th army testified that they have produced integrat ed military construction plans with guard and reserve input alma moore principal deputy secretary of the army for installations logistics and environment testified at house military construction subcommittee that this years military construction budget was built on the armys one team one fight concept we ma conscientious effort to balance our resources among all components the active army the national guard and the army reserve the debate over added projects and the mccain criteria since th congress has added significant amounts to litary construction budgets over the last 10 years congressional debate has centered on how to prioritize additional projects in 1994 the senate debate on the military construction appropriations bil l heavily focused the amount of congressional additions to the request despit constraints on overall defense spending senator mccain in particular objected to the provision of substantial amounts for projects that the administration had t requested he argued that such projects largely represe nt pork barrel spending and come at the expense of higher priority defense programs in senate floo r consider ation of the military construction bill that year the managers accepted mccain amendment that called for criteria to be applied to additional projects his amendment included provision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical yet unbudgeted projects the mccain amendment was not incorporate d into the final conference version of the bill however and the conference agreement provided over 900 million for unrequested construction projects the national defense aut horization act for fy1995 pl 103337 however incorporated senator mcc ains criteria as sense of the senate provision providing that the unrequested projects should be 1 essential to the dods national security mission 2 not inconsistent with planned base closures 3 in the services future years defense plans see above 4 executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated and 5 offset by reductions in other defense accounts through advice from th secretary of defense the purpose of these criteria is to h elp congress rate the relative importance of different projects though sense of t he senate provision does not have the force of law the mccain criteria have been cited repeatedly in senate authorization an d appropria tions debates for fy1996 and fy1997 the criteria were also cited in the house fy1997 debates by members of the porkbusters coalition in practice debates have focused on justifying projects according to the first four criteria while ignoring the offset requirement httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98210crs9 see the line item veto act procedural issues by

congressional powers to the executive branchin debate on the fy1998 military construction ap propriations conference report senator mccain continued to challenge congressional add ons he noted that th

recor d in letter to the president and on his web page at the following address httpwwwsenategovmccainmilconftxt since the 104 congress the house military construction authorizing an dth appropriations committees have used criteria in collaboration with the pentagon to add projects to the military construction budget each added project needs to pass criteria like the mccain criteria is the project essential to the dod mission consistent with brac plans in the future years defense plan and executable in the coming fiscal year if the project can meet those crit eria the military construction authorizing and appropriations committees may add the project the fy1 998 line item veto debate over whether congressionally adde d projects are pork or important to the dod mission tributed to the presidents first use of his line item veto authority in october 1997 the line item veto was used on5 the military construction approp riations law pl 10545 to eliminate 38 projects in 24 states t otaling 287 million according to the line item veto law the 28 76 million in savings would go directly to deficit reduction and not back to th department of defense the white house cited three criteria in explaining why the president vetoe d these projects these criteria are similar to the mccain criteria and the hous committees criteria for adding projects 1 the projects were not in the department of defenses future years defense plan fydp 2 design work for the projects was not completed and therefore the projec t could not be executed in the coming fiscal year 3 the projects would provide substantial contribution to improving the quality of life of us troops according to the clinton administr ation the vetoed projects needed to meet all three criteria to be put on the veto list the administrations criteria however did not square with the data on particular projects that the military officers provided in testimony to the senate appropriations committee in october 1997 first the data showed that 33 of the 38 projects were in the pentagons fydp second some of the projects did have design work in progress and so it appeared that the information that the president received on design work was inaccurate many of the project s appeared to be executable in fy1998 finally the committee questioned the white houses judgement of the quality of life merit of the 38 projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98210crs10 for more details on line ite m vetoes in the fy1998 military construction appropriations bill7 see appropriations for fy1998 military construction by mary t

not meet two out of thre administration criteria for inclusion on the veto list based on this assessment the house and senate passed disappr oval bill hr 2631 in october 1997 to overturn the veto the president vetoed the disapproval bill in november 1997 despite the7 white houses admission that erroneous data were used to canc some projects the office of management and budget mb refused to confirm which projects or how many were vetoed by mistake the canceled projects were restored by vet override of hr 2631 in february 1998 by the house and senate the veto override restored funding for the 38

the office of management and budget had to determine rules t account for government obligations with each of the authorities and the rules were not devised until june 1997 also the pentagon needed to translate loan and loa n guarantee concepts into actual documents tha t the private financial community would trust for investment grade financing represen tative joel hefley chairman of the military installations and facilities subcommittee of the house national secu rity committee pointed out in march 10 1998 hearing that the military housing privat izations authorities expire on september 30 2000 less extended by congress or made permanent law mr hefley state d that my inclination at this time would be to ext end the authorities once the fiveyear period expires but in order to justify an extension congress will have to significantly better execution the senate is interested in how t he use of housing privatization initiatives could affect future base realignment and closure brac rounds this concern came up in march 3 1998 senate appropriations subcommittee on military constructio n hearing on the fy1999 military construction budget senator stevens expresse d concern that many of the housing privatiza tion initiatives contain various mechanisms that shift financial risk and liability to the government especially with respect t brac actions senator stevens commented that housing projects with thes guarant ees could be an advantage to base in future brac rounds and this i s something the committee should monitor the fy1998 senate appropriation s committee report on military construction continued similar themes barr acks improvements to improve the conditions of barracks th department of defense is enfor cing new standards according to dod official john goodmans february 26 1998 testimony to the house national security committee on the fy1999 mil itary construction budget the pentagon directed that gang latrine barracks be eliminated by fy2008 the air force will meet that goal in fy1999 with the marine corps following in fy2005 and army navy in fy2008 implementati on of the 1 1 standard see above for barracks housing will not be completed until well into

brac concerns legislation for mor brac rounds would start in the authorizing defense committees of the house an d senate also if passed budge t authority for future brac rounds would reside in military construction appropriations accounts however this years administration request for two more brac rounds i n fy2001 and fy2005 has been received by the congress with skepticism during13 the fy1998 review of the defense budget both the house and senate rejecte d legislation to approve more military base closures instead the congress passe d section 2824 of the fy1998 national defense authorization act pl 10556 which required the pentagon to report the costs and savings from previously approved domestic military base closures the required report entitled the report of the d epartment of defense on base realignm ent and closure was released by the pentagon in april 1998 the report makes the case that the dod has 23 excess base capacity two new brac rounds will save about 3 billion per year after full implemented actual brac costs reflect budget estimates the brac process overstates costs for environmental restoration and previous brac rounds in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 are saving billions 14 both defense authoriz ing committees rejected the administrations proposal for two more base closure rounds in may 1998 environmental is sues the senate continues to raise concerns about the cost of environmental cleanup and its effects on military functions and readiness th chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee on military construction senator burn s mentioned environmental issues during his subcommittee hearing on march 3 1998 senator burns noted that 45 of the armys fy 1999 brac funding 489m is for studies cleanup and restoration of brac facilities and that thes costs are growing concern to him senator burns said that the subcommittee will look at where the clea nup money is going how it is being spent and to what degree military construction facilities are cleaned when they are turned over to the privat sectorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98210crs14 according to the departm ent of defense advance procurement is authority provided in15 an appropriations act to obligate and disburse during fiscal year before that in which th related end item is procured the funds are added to the budget authority for the fiscal year and deducte d from the budget authority of the succeeding year used in major acquisitio n programs for advance procurement of components whose longleadtime requires purchas early in order to reduce the overall procurement leadtime of the major end item advanc procurement of long lead components is an exception to the dod full funding policy financial management regulation volume 2a p 12use of advanced procurement for army military construc tion this year the congress will consider the armys proposal to use advanced procuremen t procedures for military construction this will be an exception to current practices for defense funding when congr ess appropriates money for defense programs it generally pays all the costs up front in one fiscal year this practice is known as full funding it was mandat ed by congress in the 1950s to give full visibility to the cost of weapon s procured therefore all the money estimated at the time to complete the entir project such as production of 21 trident missiles overhaul of an aircraft carrier or construction of an ammunition depot is approved as single package by th congress often the procurement of these weapons systems can span many years as an exception to this practice congress sometimes provides funding fo r advance procurement of longleadtime weapons components such as nuclear power plants for navy warships 15 the fy1999 army military construction request proposes to use advance d procurement for some of its projects acting assistant secretary of the arm installations logistics an d environment alma moore stated at the house national security committee heari ng on february 26 1998 that with advance appropriations the contract will not define the work to be perfo rmed by the contractor but only limit the work by the amount
