oil corporation cnooc to acquire the us energy company unocal for 185 billion raised many issues with us policymakers even though cnooc ultima tely withdrew its bid in the face of considerable opposition from some member s of congress and other commentors many economic financial and security issues are still to be resolved the cnooc bid came at time when ch ina had become the second largest consumer of petroleum in the world and ra ther than being net oil supplier to the world had become heavily dependent on impor ts this new strategic challenge for beijing had apparently caused it to pursue more secure energy supply the cnooc bid also coincided with period of high oil prices caused partly by chinas increasing demand growing uneasiness in th united states over the rise of china and the security and economic challenge it was presenting the large bilateral trade deficit with china and cerns about whether beijing wa s playing by international trade rules particularly giving insufficient protection to intellectual property rights and systematically holding dow n the value of its currency cnooc ltd is majorityowned subsid iary of cnooc one of three large stateowned chinese petroleum companies unocal is relatively small us petroleum company gross revenues of 82 b illion in 2004 with ssets primarily in the gulf of mexico and southeast asia the combined cnooc and unocal oil production in 2004 amounted to 03 of dom estic us petroleum consumption cnooc would have followed bp britis h owned shell dutch owned and venezuelas state oil company in investing in us petroleum assets the question of whether the proposed ac quisition would have posed security threat to the united states ultimately would have been decided by the president after review by the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius the policy debate centered on whether company that is majority owned by china country some view as potential military threat should be allowed to acquire american assets that include vital energy supplies dual use technology or access to sensitive geographical locations would cfius give sufficient consideration to us economic security should cfius be st rengthened out of 1500 transactions notified to cfius since 1988 it blocked only one other questions touched on whether blocking the bid would push the chin quest for secure oil supplies farther into countries such as iran or the suda n also would blocking the bid affect beijings approval for us investments in china are american companies seeking to invest in china given equiva lent opportunities in that market the withdrawal of the bid by cnooc stopped formal action against the proposed acquisition but it left unanswered most of the questions raised by the bid it is likely moreover that similar cases will arise in the future such as the deal to allow the takeover of operati ons of certain us ports by united arab emirates company in 2006 china and other nations have

questions regarding three vital us national interests these are security protection of life and property prosperity protec tion of economic well being and commerce and value preservation protection and projection of core values of democracy freedom human rights etc with respect to the first vital interest of national security the questions raised by the cnooc bid were several should company that

platforms that could be used to observe underwater activities in the gulf of mexico or in assisting the chinese navy should chinese company be allowed to gain control over rare us natural resource unocal also owned mine for rare earth mineral cnooc indicated it would sell this operation rela ted question revolved around the larger chinese quest for sources of petroleum and whether denying chinese company ownership of us oil we lls would induce them to seek supply in countries either under us and other country sanctions or where the oil revenues are likely to support corrupt governments or terro rist activities another question dealt with the us committee for foreign investment in the united states cfius is that committee sufficiently staffed to do thorough review of such proposed mergers should it be strengthened are us government review procedures adequate to deal with the complexities of the cnooc bid as they apply to us national security would cfius ade quately consider economic security with respect to the second national inte rest of us prosperity the questions revolved around the operation of the free market system the role of central governments in providing finance for mark et transactions issues of fairness and reciprocity and the balancing of stoc kholder and company ma nagement interests with national interests key question was whether chinese company backed by governmentowned banks should be allowed to outbid private american company that has direct governmental support much of the financing for the cnooc acquisition would have come from chinese stateowned or statedirected banks another question centered on reciprocal access are american companies seeking to invest in china given quivalent opportunities in that market are americans able to buy into chinese petroleum or other companies should this be factor in deciding whether to allow foreigners to invest in the united states further question dealt with fairne ss in the operation of free market should the us government intervene to stop company st ockholders and managers from receiving higher offer for their assets because of political or security concerns related question touched on efficiency would gove rnment intervention into the marketplace create inefficiencies or would us intervention merely offset intervention by the chinese government with respect to the third national inte rest of value preservation the questions related to the cnooc bid were less specifi c they extended to broader issues of whether allowing cnooc to purchase unocal would further us goals

cambodia wh ere unocal has investments would blocking the acquisition cause china to negotiate more deal s for oil supply with nations with which the united states had major foreign policy concerns the cnooc bid also coincided with other concerns be ing expressed about china there was growing uneasiness over the rise of china and the competitive challenge it was presenting to number of us industries not only makers of labor intensive products but hightechnology fi rms as well just few months earlier some members of congress had expresse d concern over the acquisition of ibms personal computer business by the chinese company lenovo3 there were related concerns that china was creating nationa l champion companies many of them stateowned and subsidized and that the country was not abiding by the commitments it made as condition for acce ssion to the world trade organization this also was period of rising prices for petroleum copper steel and other commodities in short supply partly because of rising demand from china china had become the worlds second largest consumer of oil the withdrawal of the bid by cnooc stopped formal action against the proposed acquisition but it left unanswered most of the questions raised by the bid it is likely moreover that similar cases will arise in the future given chinas large holdings of foreign exchange reserves more than 800 billion growing needs for industrial resources and willingness by beijing to back its major industrial corporations case with similar overtones s arisen in 2006 with the deal to allow the takeover of operations of certain us ports by united arab emirates company4 chinas energy security and oil industry according to the us department of energy chinas oil consumption surpassed japans in 2003 when it reached 56 million barrels per day mbd this ranked china as the worlds second larges t oil consumer after the united states current consumption is estimated at 72 m bd and is projected to rise to 1289 mbd by 2025 at that time imports are estimate d to be 94 mbd and chinas call on the worlds crude supply will rival that of the united states5 china is relative newcomer to the world oil market and it does not have well established historic supply links chinas arrival as the second largest consumer of oil coincides with tight global suppl ydemand situation this unprecedented dependence on imports

nigeria san tome angola and sudan in order to assure its energy future china also needs access resources including important technologies such as deep water drilling and human skills in project

multinational projects its deep water drilling knowhow the ability to operate complex pipeline systems as well as its access in pacific rim producin g countries close to china all would become assets

the times london july 23 2005 p 65this may initially end at skovorodino wher the oil could be shipped by rail to china7 related factor in the chinese attempt to establish secure sources of supply could be the threat of ec onomic sanctions should it atte mpt to force unification with taiwan or for other reasons it is clear that major disruption in the middle east or blockade of chinas ports would pose severe threat to ch inas economy and the operation of its military this arguably unde rlies some of chinas quest for secure supply sources however even if cnooc ltd were to have acquired unocal the us operation still would be required to abide by us law including regulations on economic sanctions although cnooc mig ht have been aided by ownership of unocals assets in asia economic

us national security would ultimately have been addressed by the executive branch through an established review process in 1988 amid congressional concerns over foreign acquisiti ons of certain types of u s firms congress approved the exonflorio provision of the defense pr oduction act this statute grants the president the authority to block foreign acquisitions of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united statesfirms that threaten to impair the national security congress was concerned at the time that foreign takeovers of us firms could not be stopped unless the president declared national emergency or regulators invoked federal antitrust environmental or securities laws the exonflorio provision grants the presid ent the authority to take what action he considers to be appropria to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions mergers or takeovers of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states which threaten to impair the national security in addition congress amended the statute in 1992 through section 837a of the nati onal defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 known as the byrd amendm ent after the amendments sponsor the provision requires cfius to investigate pr oposed mergers acquisitions or takeovers in cases where 1 the acquirer is contro lled by or acting on be half of foreign government and 2 the acquisition resu lts in control of person engaged in interstate commerce in the united states that could affect the national security of the united states24 congress directed however that before this authority can be invoked the president is expected to believe that other us laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect th national security and that he must have credible evidence that the foreign investment w ill impair

the exonflorio provision congress directed that cfius and therefore the president should consider list of factors in deciding to block foreign acquisition merger or take over this list contains the following elements domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements the capability and capacity of domes tic industries to meet national defense requirements including the availability of human resources products technology materials and other supplies and services the control of domestic industries and commercial activity by foreign citizens as it affects the capability and capacity of the us to meet the requirements of national security the potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods equipment or technology to country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technol ogy or chemical and biological weapons and the potential effects of the tr ansaction on us technological leadership in areas affecting us national security in november 1991 the treasury departme nt issued final regulations after extensive public comment implementing the exonflorio provision these regulations create an essentially voluntary system of notification by the parties to an acquisition but they also allow for notice by agencies that are members of cfius despite the voluntary nature of the notification firms largely do notify because the regulations stipulate that foreign acquisiti ons that are governed by the exonflorio review process that do not notify the committee remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other ppropriate actions by the presiden t under most circumstances notice of proposed acquis ition that is given to the committee by third party including shareholders is not considered by the committee to constitute an official notification the regulations also indi cate that notifications provided to the committee are considered to be confidential and the information is not released by the committee to the press or commented on publicly as consequence of the confidential nature of the cfius review of any proposed transaction there are few public sources of information concerning the committees work for the most part information concerning individual transactions that have been reviewed by cfius or any final recommendations that have been issued by cfius have come from announcements made by the companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33093crs14 26 cnooc ltd statement by fu chengyu chairman and ceo of cnooc limited beijing june 24 2005involved in transaction and not by cfius therefore public info rmation concerning the outcome of cfiuss reviews are incomplete according to one source cfius has received more than 1500 notifications of which it conducted full investigation of 25 cases of these 25 cases 13 transactions were withdrawn upon notice that cfius would conduct full review and 12 of the remaining cases were sent to the president of thes 12 transactions only one was prohibited the transaction that was prohibited by the president involved the acquisition of mamco manufacturing company by th china national aerotechnology import and export corporation catic mamc was an aerospace parts manufacturer catic which is owned by the government of the peoples republic of china acted as the purchasing agent for the chinese nistry of defense president reagan ordered catic to divest itself of mamco under the authority of the exonflorio provision because of concerns that cati c might gain access to technology through mamco that it would otherwise have to obtain under an export license most often cfius has appr oved proposed transactions if the parties involved agreed to certain conditions for instance in 2000 the committee allowed nippon telephone telegraph company to acquire verio inc an internet service provider by obtaining strict ban on involvement by the japanese government in the firm similar concerns arose with the pr oposed acquisition in 2003 of global crossing ltd by hutchinson whampoa ltd of h ong kong and technol ogies telemedia of singapore us officials reportedly were concerned that foreign ownership of global crossings fiberoptics ne twork might make the us government vulnerable to eavesdropping from overseas and some memb ers of congress we re concerned about hutchinsons ties to the chinese military to ease these concerns hutchinson offered to play passive role in the company nevertheless cfius decided to conduct full 45day review of the trans action at which point the chinese firm backed out of the deal eventually cfiu s approved the acquisition by the singapore firm by itself because it offered to put americans on the board of global crossing cnooc took steps to pass cfius review in response to potential objections cnooc stated that it was fully prepared to participate in cfius review of the transaction and that it had ma assurances to unocal to address concerns relating to energy security and ownership of unocal assets located in the united states cnooc said that it was prepared to sell or take other actions with respect to unocals minority pipeline inte rests and storage assets so long as such sale did not cause substantial economic harm to unocal cnooc also was open to discussing with cfius placing nonexploration and production assets under american management through arrangements that it claimed cfius had pproved often in the past cnooc further emphasized its commitme nt to retain the jobs of substantially all of unocals employees as opposed to chevrons plan to lay off employees

consider able concern both for the implications of the deal itself and because it coincided with other issues and policies related to china congressional activity took two tracks the first was to generate public awareness discussion nd analysis that would highlight the implications of the proposed deal and put pressure on cnooc to alter or withdraw it through hearings statements and st udies the issue was raised and scrutinized by the american public the other track was through letters to the secretary of treasury as chair of cfius and legislation aimed at cfius these raised concerns called for thorough review required st udy of chinas energy requirements and how that affects the united states or in the case of one bill would prohibit cfius from approving the proposed acquisition the expressed opposition by certain mbers of congress to the proposed cnooc bid for unocal arguab ly played key role in the withdrawal of cnoocs offer on august 2 2005 in explaining wh it withdrew the bid cnooc stated that the company had given active consideration to further improving the terms of its offer and would have done so but for the political environment in the us cnooc said that the political environment made it very difficult for them to accurately assess their chance of success creating level of uncertainty that presented an unacceptable risk to their ability to secure this transaction they accordingly reluctantly abandoned their offer28 the bills in the 109th congress that directly addr ess the cnooc bid for unocal are as follows hres 344 pombo expressing the sens of
