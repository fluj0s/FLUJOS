divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34069technical assistance for agriculture conservation summary defining exactly what conservation technical assistance is and does and reaching agreement on defin ition is difficult broadly defined it is information technical expertise and delivery system for providing assistance to landowners and users with respect to conservation and use of natural resources the natural resources conservation service nrcs the federal agency that provides this assistance defines it as getting c onservation on the ground while this definition lacks specificity it is the one most often used technical assistance has been discusse d extensively at congressional hearings on agriculture conservation producers ra nchers environmenta lists and wildlife advocates continue to raise the issue of tec hnical assistance and the need or desire for additional support though congress is to discuss conservation technical assistance in the 2007 farm bill other issues related to it exist outside of the traditional farm bill debate broader perspec tive on technical assistance ra ises questions about the capacity of the current technical assistance structure as well as future limitations perceived lack of definition and understanding of what t echnical assistance is and is not creates questions around this capacity th at are not easily answered or understood technical assistance is provided and funded if only partially within most conservation programs there is sing overarching desc ription of technical assistance for all programs similarly there is single method of providing technical assistance it involves multiple disciplines working together to provide collective pool of conservation knowledge the full scope of technical assistance is best understood by examining how it opera tes within each conservation program historically technical assistance has evol ved in the range of topics addressed it currently addresses wide variety of natural resource concerns recent farm bills have repeatedly added natu ral resource concerns to th conservation mission leaving many to question whether the current technical assistance delivery system has retained the capacity to function effectively demands on available capital both human and financial combin ed with additional questions for technological capacity and an everexpanding list of natural resource concerns has caused discussion in the current farm bill debate though technical assistance can only be br oadly defined this report is intended to offer information about aspects of the definition future policy changes affecting technical assistance may in clude funding levels spending caps accountability and staff capacity immediate discussion of the topic in the context of the 2007 farm bill likely will center on common themes such as demand and capacity cost and funding conservation mission and prio rities and technology and advancement longterm issues regarding technical assistance are expected to extend beyond the farm bill debatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34069contents definition funding and implementation 1 definition 1 funding 2 funding history for mandatory programs 4 determining

technical assistance is funded through both mandatory and discretionary programs discretionary programs are funded annually through the appropriations process most mandatory funding currently is authorized under the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 the 2002 farm bill and provided through the us department of agricultures usda commodity credit corporation ccc given this distinction programs are presented separately in this report as either mandatory or discretionary technical assistance for agriculture conservation in the immediate future congress is expected to discuss technical assistance for agriculture conservation in the context of the 2007 farm bill although this is an issue in the 2007 farm bill most t echnical assistance is funded through appropriations legislation ra ther than mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill1 questions concerning the current and future capacity of the technical assistance system are highlighted by perceived l ack of definition and understanding of what technical assistance is and is not one challenge for congress lies in finding an acceptable balance between how much technical assistance capacity currently exists and how much is needed to meet demand in the search for this balance many policy questions arise regarding what technical assistance is and does especially in the areas of definition funding and imp lementation this report doe s not attempt to directly answer these questions but rather provides framework for the debate conservation technical assistance has ta ken on number of dimensions over its long and continuously evolving history this report describes the past progressions that made conservation technical assistance what it is today and also comments on where it might be headed in the future after discussing what technical assistance is and is not this report poses additiona l topics for discus sion thr oughout this report conservation technical assistance refers to conservation as applied to activities on or affecting agricultural lands definition funding and implementation definition there is single definition of agricu lture conservation technical assistance in law or regulation in the most general rms technical assist ance is any technical service it is basic rvice that provides conserva tion knowledge to producers and landowners beyond their leve l of knowledge it includes information technical expertise eg engineering biological et c and delivery system for assisting landowners and users to cons erve and use natural resour ces in broader terms it involves outreach education and training in practices and t echnological advances that create compatibility between produc tion and the land definitions andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34069crs2

rehabilitation program resource conservation and development and healthy forests reserve program which received 9971 million in total in fy2006 discretionary programs are funded annually thr ough the appropriations processperceptions of technical assistance vary by region land use type accessibility and individual stewardship techni cal assistance is considered by some to be science based and therefore subject to the conti nuous progression of advances in the field by this definition inflexibility and static change is undesirable others view conservation technical assistance as limited to preparing conservation plan the scientific underpinning s add to the stability of the plan however without additional followthrough this definition remains narrow implying that technical assistance is just plan and nothing more increasingly this service is not only provided through the federal government by the natural resources conservation service nrcs but also by other public and private experts technical assistance is most simply service this service is provided voluntarily and at the request of wide c lient base including private landowners conservation districts local and state government agencies tribes and other partnership organizations2 this service includes various activities and actions by service provider the extent to which one includes certain activities and not others depends on how one defines t echnical assistance the more narrow definition might be limited to conservation planning practi ce implementation and perhaps technology transfer activities broa d definition might also include education outreach local coordination training mapping research technical guid ance demonstrations site specific consultations and program deve lopment implementation delivery and monitoring funding the confusion over how tec hnical assistance is define d could be closely tied to the complexity over how it is funded tec hnical assistance is funded through every us department of agriculture usda mandatory and discre tionary conservation program most of the funding for tec hnical assistance is provided through six discretionary cons ervation programs3 mandatory funding for certain conservation programs is currently authorized primarily under the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 and provided through the usda commodity credit corporation ccc

amount unless reduced in the appropriations process aut horizing legislation for manda tory programs does not set specific spending levels for technical as sistance funding llocated to technical assistance in mandatory programs is dete rmined by the administration not through appropriations one exception to this is the conservation security program csp authorized in the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 which limits the amount of funding for technical assistance to more than 15 of the total amount expended in the fiscal year5 conservation program advocates prefer mandatory funding to discretionary because supporters believe that it is easier to protect ma ndatory funding levels than it is to protect spending s ubject to annual appropriations6 discretionary spending has declined as share of total fe deral spending over the last 40 years7 likewise for agriculture conservation tec hnical assistance discretiona ry funding has decreased in recent years while mandatory funding has increased the 2002 farm bill provided much of this increase in mandatory cons ervation funding and c ontinues to shift large number of nrcs staff years fro m technical assistance funded though discretionary programs to those funded through mandatory programs despite this shift discretionary funding still remains the largest s ource of technical assistance funding see figure 2 funding

the ccc in late 2002 after the 2002 farm bill wa s enacted omb determined that the section 11 cap was still in effect and used it to limit technical assistance funding in mandatory conservation programs om b was supported in an opinion by the department of justice which stated that co appropriations d iscretionary funds could fund technical assistance for farm b ill programs mandatory funds10 congress disagreed with this deter mination believing that the nguage it had added in the 2002 farm bill allowed for technical assist ance for each program to be funded out of allocations for each program c ongress was supported by government accountability office gao then known as the general accounting office opinion stating that usda improperly obligated co appropriations to fund technical assistance for farm bill programs11 for three years following these opini ons the presidents budget included proposal to fund farm bill program tec hnical assistance through new separate account using annual appropr iations congress reject ed these proposals and prohibited using any discretionary co ppropriations for tec hnical assistance to implement mandatory farm bill program technical assistance the combination of this congressional prohibition and ombs opinion on the section 11 cap led to the shifting of funds for technical assist ance between mandatory programs thereby reducing the amount of financial assist ance funding availa ble in th donor programs in fy2003 the environmental quality incentives program eqip authorized at 700 million12 used 145 million for technical assistance however technical assistance shortfalls in other programs led to the shifting of more than 107 million in additional technical assistance funding from eqip to those programs thereby reducing the available eqip fi nancial assistance funding to 442 million the farmland protection prog ram fpp grassland reserve program grp and wildlife habitat incentives program whip shifted total of 50 million to other programs in fy2003 in late 2004 congress addre ssed the funding situation when it enacted pl 108 498 requiring technical assist ance for each mandatory program to be paid

determining funding for mandatory program technical assistance since fy2002 annual agriculture appropria tions acts have placed limits on funding below authorized levels for certain mandato ry conservation programs many of these reductions support administra tion requests through the presidents proposed budget each year while program reductions vary from year to year two trends are clear 1 there is growing gap between authorized and appropriated vels and 2 overall funding for conservation initially grew stead ily after 2002 then leveled off in recent years13 technical assistance for mandatory prog rams is percentage of the overall annual funding nrcs uses model to estima the total cost of technical assistance necessary to administer each mandatory pr ogram this model came under scrutiny by gao in 2004 when it reported the mode ls inaccuracies in estimating technical assistance costs14 according to gao these inaccur acies were result of delays in technical assistance work the inclusion of external costs not reported in actual costs and inaccurate assumptions in 2006 nrcs c onducted national update to more accurately ascertain the true workload cost of providing technical assistance called activity based costing abc data these data were collected at national state and county levels though nrcs uses the updated model to estimate the level of technical assistance funding needed for each program the agency does not determine the actual level of funding provided for technical assistance instea d this level is set nationally by an omb apportionment15 after nrcs receives an apportionment the funding available for both financial and technical assistance is allocated to nrcs state offices the nrcs state conservationist is then responsible for administering the state

congress assesses the current need and demand for technical assistance many questions remain brief discussion follows on how this system is implemented and the results since its inception in the 2002 farm bill more r ecent means of addressing the capacity to meet technical assistance demand is throug h third party providers the confusion surrounding two terms technical assistan ce and administrative support is also discussed as well as the current impact of congressional directives on technical assistance third party providers section 2701 of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 amended section 1242 of the 1985 farm b ill to allow pr oducers to retain approved third party providers for technical assistan ce nrcs refers to these individuals as technical service providers tsps nrcs sets the qualifications for approving individuals and entities to provide specified types of technical assistance including conservation planning and design layout installation and ch eckout of approved conservation practices producers pay the tsps and are then reimbursed by usda for technical assist ance activities received technical assistance can be provided by t sps through three different means 1 individual producers contract individually w ith certified tsps 2 nrcs enters into contracts or cooperative agreem ents directly with certifie d tsps and 3 through the pilot agricultural conservation enrollees seniors aces program in which retired individuals work parttime on temporar basis with nrcs for stipend nrcs may not reimburse tsps for more than it costs nrcs to perform the same tasks these funding limitations are specific for each task tsps are permitted to perform in each county and are referred to as nottoexceed rates in march 6 2007 appropriations hearing nrcs chief arlen lancaster testified that nrcs mainta ined more than 1600 certified tsps and obligated more than 626 million to these services in fy200617 this number has steadily increased since the inception of the program in 2003 between 2003 and 2006 more than 2100 tsp services have been used and more than 1635 million have been obligated18 technical assistance vs administrative support though these two terms technical assistance and administr ative support are generally considered separate in the case of funding technical assistance the terms do not appear mutuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34069crs9 exclusive and are occasionally used inte rchangeably deba still continues between the administration and congress over whether funding provided in the name of technical assistance is preferred to providing fundi ng in the name of salaries and expenses within congress and betw een the administration there are different interpretations of the two terms the administration tends to favor the term technical assistance while congress is divi ded on the issue some observers claim that both terms would appear to provide the same service with different titles the lack of definition for technical ssistance has heightened longstanding point of confusion between technical assistance and administrative support by nrcs definition the two are not mutually exclusive nrcs describes technical assistance as funds received to get conservation on the ground this is an imprecise definition and there are two distinct viewpoints about how this spending is categorized one is to include all personne l costs as technical assistance and all non personnel costs as administrative suppor t administrative support includes non salary support costs such as travel rent utilities transportation equipment and supplies while technical assistance in clude the personnel cost of employing individuals who provide technical capacity the second view is that tec hnical assistance costs are all direct costs incurred while serving customer admin istrative support costs are all indirect costs incurred while serving others ie n rcs other parts of usda etc in this view technical assistance is the cost of providing profe ssional expertise throug h trained individuals including third party provide rs or nrcs employees and all of the costs associated with maintaining the working environment to serve customers landowner state or local government tribe or partnering orga nization for example the direct costs associated with an nrcs district conservationist making field visit to survey an eqip contracts practice implementation c ould be considered technical assistance this would include the salaries and benefits associated with employing the district conservationist the cost of the truck to dr ive to the field the fuel for the truck and all other supplies necessary for the ev aluation however an nrcs human resources specialist working in the state office to serve other nrcs employees could be considered administr ative support by contrast following the first view only the personnel cost of employing th district conservationist would be considered technical assistance the cost of vehicles fuel and supplies would be considered administrative support the second view is much broader this debate appears to ve grown out of the 2002 farm bill which brought an increase in funding for conservation prog ram financial assistance the increased attention on administrative costs by congress was of little debate in the past when nrcs sole purpose was to provide technical assistance the increase in financial assistance has led to cong ressional inquiries to distinguish between providing technical assistance and administering financial assistance in agriculture conservation programs the two services technical assistance and administering financial assistance overlap creating confus ion in terminology if congress decides to place spending restrictions on administrative costs the conflict in defining these two terms could lead to reduced technical assistance service and capacity to administer financial assistance programs

funding could place additional strain on the current capacity to deliver technical assistance what impact these directives have on this capacity remains to be seen virtually all of the di rected funding in agriculture conservation programs is fo r discretionary programs these congressional directives can be viewed in three ways first some define where specific technical assistance funding is to be applied and for what purpose for example in fy2006 the managers repor t directed technical assistance funding for the nrcs plant material s center in fallon nevada20 second type is similar to the first but it directs financial assistan ce funding to specific projects these directives are seen more in the watershed programs for example in fy2006 congressional language dir ected over 3 million in wate rshed and flood prevention operations program funding to specific wate rshed projects located in illinois ohio arkansas alaska missouri hawaii iowa and utah21 third type is pass through funding in which the agency is directed to enter into agreements with specific external entities ranging from non prof its to state or local governments for congressionally specified amounts these f unds are not used for technical assistance provided by nrcs and are therefore passed through directly to the external entity in fy2006 passthrough agreements were directed in conservation operations program funding for over 68 million22 congressional directives direct most f unding within the watershed operations programs pl 78534 and pl 83566 in fy2006 approximately 85 of

technical assistance became this complex this complexity has emerged through incremental policy changes over time when the federal agriculture conservation effort was limited primarily to soil erosion control and water supply technical assistance was limited in re source concerns as well as funding technical assistance has expande d in both scope and funding recently and has been brought to the forefront of th debate for both imple mentation and funding levels how this process evolved is discussed below federal conservation assistance federal technical assistan ce for agriculture conservation as we now understand it originated with the creation of the so il conservation service scs not until the 1930s and the occurrence of the dust bowl did soil conservation became national priority on august 25 1933 through the use of public works program funding the department of the interior doi created the soil erosion service in march 1935 the president ordered soil erosi on service moved to the usda the severity of soil erosion at the time helped gain congressional support for the passage of the soil conser vation and domestic allotme nt act pl 7446 49 stat 163 in april 1935 estab lishing the scs within the usda the scs was established for the purpose of providing p ermanently for the control and prevention of soil erosion and thereby to preserve natural resources control floods prevent impairment of reservoirs and maintain the navigability of rivers and harbors protect public health public lands and relieve unemployment25 following the passage of the 1935 legislation creating the scs most of the services provided to landowne rs were through demonstra tion projects agreements usually five years in length were tered into with landowners who agreed to contribute access to their land labor and so resources in exchange for following conservation plan the scs provided tec hnical assistance materials labor using the civilian conservation corps and emergency conservation work camps the overlapping mission with other federal and state agencies the extension service and land grant universities in pa rticular and limite d landowner buyin forced the usda to look toward more localized entities to carry out these demonstrations this brought about the establishment of the soil conservation districts model state legislation to create and operate districts was presented to state governors in february 1937 by president franklin d roosevelt who encouraged adoption this level of inte rest directly from the president highlights the significant level of political support for soil conserva tion during this time in 1937 twentytwo states passed legislation creating districts following the creation of these districts scs increasingly concentrated on providing technical assistance to farmers through these new local entities the current role of conservation districts is discussed in the outlook for technical assistance section

funding authority 28 outlook for technical assistance today technical assistance varies in its activity imp lementation and in funding across conservation programs when co nservation programs received large increase in funding in the 2002 farm bill some questioned whether the traditional technical assistance infrastructure could meet the increase in demand that would accompany additional conservation funding now as the 2007 farm bill is being written an evaluation of this capacity will likely influence how technical assistance will look in the future capacity refers to the ability to

contribute to the capacity to provide tec hnical assistance human capital technology mission goals and funding additional qu estions about this capacity are raised during this discussion and though the availa bility of data somewhat limits answering these questions they are intended to shape and inform future discussions on technical assistance the expectations placed upon technical assistance

increased demands on the technical assistance capacity knowing the evolution of technical assi stance and the desire to meet expanded needs in the future changes to the current technical assistance system are being discussed in the 2007 farm b ill debate the following di scussion and questions are intended to help frame future deliberation on technical assistance capacity in four broad areas human capital t echnology mission and funding human capital currently nrcs employs roughly 12500 full and parttime employees most employees approximately 12000 are located in state area county or regional technology service offices according to nrcs 84 of their offices directly provide financial and technical assistance service this network of local field and state offices has been used to provide c onservation technical assistance for decades traditional approach to expanding the capacity to provide technical assistance had been to draw on the capabilities of partnering organizations the largest are locally led conservation districts over 3000 conservation districts authorized by the states and administered at the county vel coordinate cons ervation and natural resource interests among private landowners districts traditionally work closely with federal employees in local and county field offices as well as local officials to provide assistance to privat landowners and managers29 the conservation district network adds capacity to the federal network providing t echnical assistance other organizations at state levels such as st ate departments of na tural resources and wildlife water districts environmental and land management in terests contribute to the overall network of tec hnical assistance providers section 2701 of the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 expanded the human capital capacity that provides conser vation technical assistance with the authorization of third party providers known as technical rvice providers tsps described earlier according to nrcs tsps have provided the equivalent of 905 nrcs staff years since fy200330 whether program may expand in the future will likely be important in any discussion about how much dditional capacity might be

mandatory conservation programs were fully funded and provided all authorized financ ial assistance is there enough technical assistance capacity currently available to implement them properly certified third party pr oviders have expanded the pool of available technical assistance to private landowners how much additional capacity has been provided by thir d parties and how much additional capacity could they provide wh at additional technical services could be provided if increased capacity is sought using tsps related issues are the location and availability of providers in some cases third party providers are not available locally what are the practical limits of the tsp option given the potential limits on availability is the cost of certification too high causing technical providers to not apply or is th reimbursable fee schedule too low discouraging potential tsps from participating nearly 80 of nrcs employees that are considered mission critical occupations most of w hom provide tec hnical assistance will be eligible for retirement within the next four years32 other technical assistance organizations both public and private are expected to face similar transitions in the near future will the loss of such knowledge affect the capacity to provide technical assistance is there adequate technical capacity and replenishing mechanisms in place to fill the gap

scope when compared to the broad resource concerns nrcs is currently assigned by law or the secretary this expansion of duties has required an expansion of technical capacity and questi ons are raised about where these expanded responsibilities should be concentrated one suggested solution to expanding technical capabilities and meeting the need of additional technical assistance is to reduce or remove the administrative support functions associated with conservation programs36 for this suggestion administrative functions are limited to distributing financial assistance in contractual agreements to producers37 some have suggested that these functions be moved to the fsa or competitively contracted to the private sector r eception to this suggestion varies in its 2007 farm bill proposal usda pr oposed plethora of conservation program consolidations in the name of streamlining cost saving estimates were provided based on these consolidation pr oposals however many other
