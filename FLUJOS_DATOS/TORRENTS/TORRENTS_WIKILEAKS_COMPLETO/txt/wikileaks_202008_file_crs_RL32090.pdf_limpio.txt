fy2003 emergency wartime supplemental and the remainder from the regular us agency for international developmen t usaid budget see below for further discussion large part of the debate in cong ress about the administrations 87 billion request focused on cost issues including the impact of the new funding on the overall federal budget whether the administration was adequately forthcoming in its previous statements about costs how accurate and complete the current cost projections are and how great costs will be in future years the following sections review each of these issues in turn impact on the federal budget the office of management and budget omb midsession review of the budget released in july estimated that the federal budget ficit would total 455 billion in fy2003 and 475 billion in fy 2004 assuming congre ssional enactment of the administration program for fy20046 white house officials said that the requested additional appropr iations of 87 billion for fy2004 would push the deficit to about 525 billion for that year7 the congressional budget office cbo updated budget baseline projected defi cits of 401 billion in fy2003 and 480 billion in fy20048 it is important to note that the cbo baseline for fy2003 included outlays from the april 2003 war time supplemental and cbo projections for future years assumed growth with infla tion in overall discreti onary spending so in effect the cbo estimate of the fy 2004 deficit already assumed additional supplemental appropria tions for military activities in iraq and elsewhere roughly equal to the amount provided in fy2003

bumiller budget director lowers estimate of cost of war new york times dec 31 2002 pg 1 afghanistan however was more than thr ee times as high in the fy2004 request as in fy20039 administration officials argued that th economy can readily absorb additional federal borrowing entailed by the requested supplemental particularly since the economy is still recovering from recessi on using omb economic projections deficit of 525 billion in fy2004 would total equal 44 of gross domestic product less than the 56 of gdp that the government borrowed in the mid 1980s congressional critics argued that funding for domestic programs though not tax cuts has been constrained that bo rrowing 2025 of the overall federal budget is fiscally irresponsible and that continui ng deficits will endang er the economy in the long term others including some members of c ongress contended that given iraqs future oil revenue potential reconstruction costs should be financed as loans rather than grants in this way they say fu ture loan repayments would be source of revenue for the united states earlier administration statements about costs in the months leading up to the war with iraq administration officials were generally unwilling to provide longterm estimates either of the costs of war or of subsequent postwar needs saying that fi nal decision had been made to go to war and that costs could not be projected with sufficient accuracy what little officials did say however became matter of cont ention in congress in september 9 senate armed services committee hearing senator levin r ecalled that former white house economic advisor larry lindsey had said year earlier that conflict with iraq could cost 100200 billion10 other administration officials however notably then budget director mitch daniels immediately dismissed lindseys figures as ill founded and the press widely reported administration timates that costs would be in the range of 50 billion11 that figure proved reasona ble for the war itself and for subsequent stability operations for the re mainder of fy2003 but did not take account of later postwar costs by march of this year shortly befo re the white house submitted its fy2003 supplemental request some legislators were complaining that the administration was withholding cost projections so as not to weaken support for pending tax cut legislation at one point during the tax debate the senate pproved an amendment to set aside 100 billion of the of the tax cut as hedge against unplanned war costs before the war began several independent estimates of war costs and of postwar expenses were prepared in cluding assessments by the congressional budget officehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32090crs8 12 deputy secretary of defense paul wolfow itz before the house

reconstruction costs became particular focus of attention in view of the administrations request for 20 billion for iraq in widely quoted statement last march when asked about longter m reconstruction costs in iraq deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz said that the oil revenues of that country could bring between 50 and 100 billion dollars over the course of the next two or three years now there are lot of claims on that money but were not dealing with afghanistan thats permanent ward of the international community we are aling with country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon12 more recently secretary of defense rumsfeld acknowledged that the us government underestimated iraq reconstruction costs saying the infrastructure of that country was not terribly damaged by the war at all it was damaged by 30 years of saddam hussein with stalinistlike economy denying the people of that country the money and the funds and the resources and the investments that they could ve had now did we underestimate something yes i dont think people rea lly fully understood how devastating that regime was to the infrastructure of th country how fragile the electric system is how poorly the waters being managed and how the extent to which the people are being denied13 reliability of current estimates leaving aside the politically contentious issue of past cost estimates many questions remain about the accuracy of the most recent military and reconstruction cost projections on the military side officials have said that they do not believe there will be any need for more us tr oops in iraq first because the security situation in the country is generally g ood except in areas like the sunni triangle where diehard opposition is concentrated second because rapid progress is being made in organizing iraqi security forces which the administration expects will take up most of the burden14 and third because of expected contributions of forces

14 2003other nations cost projections justifyi ng the supplemental request assume that current force levels and the current pace of operations will be ma intained for the next year whether that is sufficient however depends first of all on whether the security situation is improving as administration officials insist or getting worse as others argue there have also been some questions about specific elemen ts of the defense departments supplemental funding re quest in hearing of the senate appropriations committee on september 24 senator harkin questioned whether several requested projects were warrelated emergencie s that require immediate funding including 293 million for various milita ry construction projects 329 million for rd projects and 345 million fo r base camp housing others have raised the opposite question whether th dod request understates costs by leaving for the future projects which will later need funding one particular issue is that the request includes relatively little money for reconstituting or in the new dod vernacular resetting army forces the army estimates that several billion dollars will be required to refill stocks of prepositioned materiel and repair equipment to prewar standards but the reque st does not finance these measures in addition as recent congressional budget office asse ssment concluded it is questionable whether the current force level can be maintained without further extending reserve tours and perhaps mobiliz ing even more reserves either of which might undermine reserv personnel retention15 several members of congress have proposed increasing the size of the army to ease pressures on the force though cbo cautions that this would take up to five years to implement nd would subsequently cost 910 billion per year on the reconstruction side official s acknowledge that they originally underestimated significantly th weakness of iraqs infra structure and overestimated potential shortterm iraqi oil revenues even now however different officials project somewhat different upper estimates of likely recons truction costs moreover how much multilateral donors w ill contribute to cover th current reconstruction financing gap 50 to 75 billion minus th 20 billion supplemental and perhaps 5 to 6 billion per year from iraqi oil revenue s beginning in 2005 is highly unclear undersecretary of state larson told the senate banking committee on september 16 that while the administra tion believed that bilatera l donors and international financial institutions should make maximu m effort to pay their share he was not in position to provide specific figure until better estimates of reconstruction costs are available with the madrid donor conference scheduled for

allied fo rces in iraq said its going to be few years before the united states can withdraw from iraq18 how long us forces will stay is the main f actor affecting longterm estimates of costs most recently the house budget committee democratic staff has prepared an updated report that projects that the longt erm cost of the war in iraq and the postwar reconstruction effort will be more than 178 billion and under plausible assumptions could exceed 400 billion19 by comparison the vietnam war from 1964 through 1973 cost about 584 billion in fy2003 prices issues in congress number of issues were

familie s through the dod tricare program nonactive duty reservists would be allowed acce ss to tricare by paying premiums substantially below the average cost of private health insurance cbo estimated that the provision would cost about 500 million in fy2004 and over 2 billion year by fy2008 as more reservists signed on the administration threatened to veto the authorization if it included this provision s upporters said that they might offer the measure as an amendment to the supplemental if it were not enacted in the authorization on october 2 the senate approved an amendm ent to its version of the supplemental bill providing health insuran ce to nonactivated reservists though only to those who are unemployed or ineligible for employer provided insurance see below under congressional action for disc ussion of senate action on this issue also see the discussion of milita ry personnel benefits below competitive contracting and corporate profits in iraq particularly sensitive political issue was whether companies like halliburton which have been awarded noncompetitive c ontracts for support of us forces and for reconstruction activities in iraq may be earning excessive profits some legislators mentioned measur to address the issue representative maloney for example introduced the clean contractin g in iraq act of 2003 hr 3275 in its markup the senate appropr iations committee approved an amendment by senator leahy to stiffen penalties for fraud and profiteering on contracts for iraq the house version of the bill included measur to limit

noncompetitive contracts third amendment byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32090crs13 representative sherman required oil infra structure procurement to follow normal competitive bidding procedures combin ation of these proposals was included in the enacted legislation see congressional action below loans rather than grants for iraq reconstruction several members dr afted amendments to require portions of the 203 billion iraq reconstruction request to be guaranteed by iraqi oil or extended as loans rather than grants the administrations proposal called for all assist ance to be provided on grant basis although most of these efforts failed or were not offere d senatepassed amendment by senators bayh ben nelson and others drew strong objections from the white house on october 16 the sena adopted 5147 nguage that would convert 10 billion of iraq r econstruction funding to loans the us would treat these loans as grants however if foreign creditors cancel 90 of iraqs debt this was one of the key issues during congre ssional conference delib erations although it was dropped from the enacted bill other unsuccessful attempts to shift grants to loans included amendments by senator dorgan tabled during bot h committee markup 1514 and floor consideration 5739 creating an iraq r econstruction finance authority that would obtain financing for infrastructure rehabilitation by collateralizing the revenue from future sales of iraq oil the full senate also tabled similar amendment by senator landrieu during floor debate 5247 representative wamp offered but withdrew under white house pressure proposal during house committee markup that would have made half of the rec onstruction available only after an elected government was in place and only on loan basis simila r amendment by representative pence was ruled out of order during house floor consideration senator hutchison and others introduce d but did not offer an amendment samdt 1798 directing 10 billion of the proposed 203 billion supplemental to an iraq reconstruction trust fund to be created within the world bank that would issue loans and loan guarantees to implement economic development projects in iraq any us contribution to the fund would require matching pledge from other bilateral donors after six months if the trust fund had not been established the 10 billion would transfer to the cpa and be used for reconstruction loans to the iraq governing council there were however legal questions as to who could assume responsibility in the near term for accepting sovereign loans and concerns raised

some minor change s in requested equipment funding and most notably rejected an administra tion proposal to revi military personnel benefits in action on some key issues the senate committee bill extended through fy2004 an increase in imminent danger pay and in family separation allowances that congress provided in the april 2003 wartime emer gency supplemental the administration proposed eliminating these increas ed benefits after december 31 2003 and instead using an increase in amounts of hazardous duty pay to provide the same amounts to troops deployed in conflict areas see below

onstruction to be cons idered later in separate measure the committee also rejected an amendment by senator byrd to limit the transfer authority for defense programs that the bill provides for iraq and afghanistan reconstructi on and other global war on terrorism s 1689 as reported provided 21445 billion as requested supporte d the full request for afghanistan and made sma ll changes in other areas regarding iraq reconstruction the nate appropriations committee supported the total funding request of 203 b illion and provided the president with the flexibility to allocate resources to any federal account this would allow the coalition provisional authority headed by ambassador bremer who reports to the secretary of defense to continue its coordination role and control over reconstruction funding th senatereported measure however deleted the 605 million requested for us dipl omatic facilities in iraq noting that these funds were previously provided in the fy2003 emerge

senate committee markup the panel tabled 15 14 two amendments by senator dorgan related to reducing us costs of rebuilding iraq the first would have created an iraq reconstruction finance authority that would use future iraq oil revenues to secure financing for reconstruction projects senator dorgan argued that the iraq governing council had sufficient au thority to create such facility and to raise money that could reduce the size of proposed us expenditures senator dorgan subsequently reintroduced the amendm ent for senate floor debate at which time the senate tabled the proposal 5739 the s econd dorgan amendment considered during committee markup would have converted th reconstruction package from grants to loans opponents of the dorgan amendments maintained that adding to iraqs already sizable debt ob ligations would enormously complicate the difficult task of stabilizing the economy also tabled during markup 1514 was proposal by senator harkin that would have reduced recons truction funds to 10 billion and delayed submission of additional requests until the president had reported on contributions made by other donors and submitted tailed reconstruction plan for other matters concerning the globa l war on terrorism s 1689 as reported approved the presidents request for 100 million emergency fund for complex foreign crises the sena appropriations committee ex

549839 sources hrept 108312 srept 108160httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32090crs34 several aspects of the request are worth noting including basis of the cost projections funding flexibility authority to train and equip foreign military forces and military personne l benefits basis of the co st projections according to dod officials the request is based first on the assumption that current force levels and the current pace of operations will be maintained throughout fy2004 although it assumes some change in the mix of active and reserve forces deployed dod and omb backup material on the request notes that the number of army combat divisions in iraq will be reduced but this will not substantially affect the total number of personnel deployed in southwest asia and nearby areas in support of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom in afghanistan the requested is based second on the use of model for estimating costs of military operations know as the continge ncy operations support tool cost the cost model was developed by the institute for defense analyses ida in the late 1990s under contract from the depar tment of defense comptroller following problems the defense department had in accu rately projecting costs of operations in the mid1990s using inputs of data about the duration of an operation the number and original location of units to be deployed means of transportation both to deploy and to sustain forces and unique expenses and relying on historical cost factors based on earlier operations the model can provide quite tailed breakdowns of projected costs in advance of an operation although these projections are not tec hnically considered budget quality data for purposes of making congressional requests the estimates resulting from the model appear to be the most reliable ava ilable advance projections of costs of an operation though actual expenses may differ as operations unfold one question for congress may be why the fense department is usin g cost model data now but did not choose to provide cost model figure s to congress last spring in advance of the war an answer may be the defens department did not feel in position to provide an estimate of war costs until final decision was made to go to war and the size and composition of the force remained in flux until very shortly before the war began dods new cost estimate s appear to be substan tially higher on per troop basis than recent estimates by the congressional budget office funding flexibility an ongoing issue between the administr ation and congress particularly the appropriations committees has been how much flexibility the defense department needs to reallocate funds after they ar appropriated in the fy2003 emergency wartime supplemental the administra tion proposed that 599 billion of the 626 billion it requested for the department of defense be provided in flexible transfer account called the iraq freedom fund c ongress agreed to provide 157 billion inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32090crs35 21 an army national guard brigade like active duty brigades normally has about 3000 personnel three combat brigades are typically in division which also includes additional support units full divisions range from about 10000 to 15000 personnel marine expeditionary force mef typi cally includes 3000050000 personnel including ground combat units air units and support units it seems unlikely that full mef would be deployed for peacekeeping in iraq more likely only ground elements of marine expeditionary brigade meb bout 3000 troops would be deployed 22 see department of defense fy2004 suppl emental request for operation iraqi freedom oif operation enduring freedom oef and operation noble ea gle one sept 21 2003 for the iraq freedom fund request see p 46 and for the general transfer authority and construction contingency fund request see pp 6566the fund some of which was subject to dditional ceilings on expenditures in the new request the defense partment asked for 20 billi on to be appropriated into the iraq freedom fund while the rest is requested in regular appropriations accounts the iraq freedom fund amount is in eff ect contingency fund that dod says it will use either to support multinational divi sion or if allied forces are not available to deploy two army national guard enha nced separate brigades and one marine expeditionary force21 the defense department also requested authority to transfer 5 billion between appropriations accounts provided that the secretary shall notify the congress promptly of each transfer made pursuant to this authority according to dod promptly means that the secretary will inform congress within five days after such transfers this money therefore would not be subject to normal limitations on transfers or in dod parl ance reprogramming of funds in which transfers above certain thresholds require advance approval of congressional defense committees in addition in another pr oposed general provision the defense department has requested that 500 million of the amounts appropriated be available for contingency construction account for military construction projects that are not otherwise authorized by law22 see above for discussion of senate and house appropriations committee action on these proposals authority to train and equip foreign military forces though not budget item per one element of the request reintroduces an issue that has been controversial in cong ress in the past the request includes proposal to provide the defe nse department with genera l authority to use up to 200 million of available funds for training and equipping m ilitary forces in iraq afghanistan and other friendly nearby regional nations to carry out counter terrorism operations and support us military operations in iraq and afghanistan in earlier funding bills congress has agr eed to administration requests to provide money termed coalition support to reim burse nations such as pakistan and jordan that have provided material support for us milita ry operations and to lift and sustain foreign troops such as the po lish forces now in iraq that are directly participating in ope rations the new request in cludes 14 billion for coalition support and additional amounts to lift and sustain multinational forces httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32090crs36 congress has however rej ected repeated administra tion requests for funds for the defense department to train and equip foreign militaries which would be in effect dodrun military assistance program not approved through the usual congressional budget procedures and not subject to human rights and other provisions of standing law governing us foreign aid most recently the administration requested 200 million for that purpose in the regular fy2004 appropriations but neither th house nor the senate pproved the request in any version of the regular fy2004 defense author ization or ppropriations bills the new request differs in that it is limited to suppor t for nations in the region of iraq and afghanistan the senate appropriations committee agreed to provide 200 million to train and equip the new iraqi army nd the afghan national army and the house appropriations committee provided 100 milli on see above both committees also required 15 days advance notification to congress before obligating funds military personnel benefits in the april 2003 emergency wartime supplemental pl 10811 congress increased imminent danger pay from 150 to 225 per month and the family separation allowance from 100 to 250 per month these in creases expired at the end of fy2003 on september 30 the first continuing resolution for fy2004 hjres 69 pl 10884 extends the bene fits through october 31 2003 the house and senate have taken somewhat different approach to extending these benefits permanently in their versions of the fy2004 defense authorization bill hr 1588 in its supplemental proposal the defense department requested that the increased imminent danger pay and family separation allowance payments continue through december 31 2003 after that dod requested that it be permitted instead to provide 225 per month in add itional hardship duty pay to personnel serving in combat zone in operation iraqi free dom and operation enduring freedom dod argues that this would equalize pay between troops deployed in combat zones troops with dependents now receive more because of the family separation allowance it may also mean however that troops not act ually deployed in combat zone would receive less so there may be some opposition from military advocacy groups and in the congress both the house and the senate appropriations committees however rejected the administration request and instead extended increased imminent danger pay and family separation allowances through fy2004 another significant issue in senate action on the supplemental was whether to provide health insurance for nondeployed military reservists the senate approved an amendment to the fy2004 defense au thorization bill that would allow non activated reservists to sign up for health insurance for themselves and their dependents through the dodrun tricare program the administration has threatened to veto the authorization if it includes this provision in floor action on the supplemental the senate approved an amendment by senators daschle and graham of south carolina to offer health insurance to reservists through tricare though with somewhat different provisions from those in the senate version of the fy2004 authorization specifically the da schlegraham amendment is available only to reservists who are receiving unemployment compensation or who are not eligible for an employersponsored health insurance plan the measure also requires copayment of 28 of the value of the plan on the model of the federal governments fehbp insurance plan for civilian employees so the daschlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32090crs37 graham amendment is much more limited and more targeted than the senate provision in the fy2004 defense authorization bill iraqafghanistan reconstruction and

assessment they conducted of 14 iraqi economic and social sectors27 the resulting bankundp estimates have blished targets by which the adequacy of available resources will be judged the bankundp

months30 that the administration request in categories such as electric power and water composes half or more of requirements projected by the world bank assessment over fouryear pe riod however suggests that the request may meet needs beyond even 18 months iraqi oil revenues and fi nancing reconstruction until recently the administration had expected most costs of r econstruction to be bor ne by iraq through receipts from its oil exports while the d ecrepit state of oil production infrastructure and recurrent sabotage to pipelines and facilities have forced experts to downgrade expectations of potential exports and recei pts any sustained increase in production will assist the reconstructi on effort current rates of production are nearing 2 million barrels day but iraqis do not expect to reach the prewar vel of 28 million barrels until spring after subtracting 05 million barrelsday for domestic consumption level of 23 million might ge nerate between 185 billi on and 23 billion annually depending on the price of oil production levels of 6 millionday possible within decade would require significant investment outlays31 in the near term administration officials said that thei r budget calculations assume an average production of 2 million barrels per day over the next 12 m onths generating about 12 billion in revenues that will roughly cover government operating expenses but not the type of urgent reconstruction need s identified in the supplemental request32 roughly 503 million has already been allocated from the 2003 emergency wartime supplemental for repa ir of oil facilities and re storation of production and distribution systems the administra tion request for these purposes under the fy2004 supplemental was 21 billion additional sums for iraqi security forces were in part intended to create an iraqi fo rce to defend against pipeline and other oil facility sabotage loans vs grants for reconstruction closely related to the issue of iraqi oil revenues as means of financing reconstruction project s was the question of whether assistance could be extended on loan rather than grant basis some argued that given the substantial amount of oil reve nues that iraq will generate at some point in the future baghdad will have the means to service debt incurred for the purpose of rebuilding its infrastructure loans either extended bilaterally or through some sort of trust fund possibly managed by the world bank would be repaid at some point thereby reducing reconstruction co sts to the united states they said the administration which proposed th at the entire 203 billion supplemental be offered as grants argued repeatedly during congressional hearings against adding to iraqs already substantial debt obligations witnesses asserted that iraq

could not be attached by creditors through 2007 unless authorized by the council beyond the matter of whether iraq should incur more debt obligations in the near term is the question over who coul d legally assume responsibility for new sovereign debt although it is possible th at the world bank could manage an iraq reconstruction trust fund that would recei ve contributions fro m international donors if the bank were to use these resources fo r project lending it would almost certainly require as it has in the past that some sort of sovereign iraq authority assume the debt obligation until such time that legal au thority is transferred to iraqi hands the coalition provisional authority is the temporary government of iraq and would be the one signing for the loans most legal scholars take the position that an occupying power has authority to incur new debt s on behalf of the displaced sovereign34 some contend however that there is an exception in which new government would be responsible for the debt if it can be shown that the loans were required for the welfare of the occupied territory nd the terms were fair and reasonable35 also while loan reconstruction assi stance would likely require smaller appropriations than grant aid some cong ressional appropriation would be necessary under the 1990 credit reform act congre ss must provide subsidy appropriation in advance of the us government extending direct loans or loan guarantees the size of the subsidy appropria tion is based on several fact ors including any subsidy value of the loan terms and the likelihood th at the loan will be repaid fully and on time given the current state of the iraq i economy and the high degree of uncertainty over when the debt service payments could begin the necessary subsidy appropriation likely w ould be quite large as discussed in more tail above under cong ressional action this issue was closely examined by lawmakers the senate adopted 51 47 an amendment by senators

was defeated in the house 200226 the supplementals impact on other donors many including administration officials believed that congressional action on the supplemental could influence the contributions of in ternational donors at the lateoctober donors conference some argued that large pledge of us aid prior to the conference might stimulate other donors to contribute more diminution of the administration plan they argued might have the opposite ffect opponents of making us aid for reconstruction in the form of loans also contended that other donors might follow the american lead and offer loans rather than grants adding further to iraqs debt problems in addition the supplemental targeted sectors infrastructure and security that other donors would be less likely to support themselves in similar nationbuilding exercises elsewhere donors have tended to funnel contributions to the social sectors such as educati on and health and gra ssroots democratization and economic development all areas relatively untouche d by the supplemental perhaps more important factor in ot her donor calculations was the extent to which they would have say in the us of funds up to then

that time most had expected that transf ers for reconstruction and postconflict aid would be made to usaid the state partment and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies but with plans for the defense department to oversee the governing of iraq immediately after the end of hostilities the white house wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over the distribution of resources so the president could transfer some or all of the funding to dod the proposal stimulated immediate controversy with number of critics including members of congress arguing that aid programs shoul d remain under the polic direction of the state department and under the authorities of broad and longstanding body of foreign aid laws although initial house nd senate decisions would have blocked

stabilization groupheaded by national security advisor condoleezza rice the group is intended to help speed up reconstruction efforts by identifying and resolving problems that had in some cases been the source of d ecisionmaking disputes in washington some analysts believe that the move is also intended to allow the state department greater voice in reconstruction policy at the same time the state partment staff serving under the cpa in iraq is expected to grow from 55 to about 110 nevertheless ambassador bremer will continue to report to the secretary of defense37 as noted above the senate tabled 5642 an amendment by senators leahy and daschle samdt 1803 that would have placed the cpa under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state the house bill
