which funds are allocated among the states and the propos ed reduction in assistance to firefighters grant program fire appr opriations these issues are discussed below distribution methods for st ate and local programs for years since publication of the final repor t of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states often referred to as th 911 commission members of congress have debated the formula or process to be used in distributing federal homeland security grant funds the 911 commission recommended that funds should be distributed based on threat and risk assessments while deba has ensued on this recommendation certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22596crs5 5 pl 11053 title i sec 101 sec 2004e1aprogram funds have been distributed pursuan t to the formula set out in section 1014 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 this statute guaranteed each state minimum of 075 of total appropria tions for domestic preparedness programs the administration requested that fy2008 funds for only the emergency management performance grants empg and citizen corps programs ccp be distributed pursuant to the section 1014 form ula additionally the administration proposed that shsgp be discretionary pr ogram but guaranteed each state minimum of 025 of total appr opriations certain members of congress did not agree with this proposal neither the house passed nor senatep assed versions of hr 2638 included provisions to alter the funding distributi on method because the issue was included in debate on other legisla tion hr 1 and s 4 with enactme nt of this legislation pl 110 53 implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 fy2008 funding allocations will be based upon different formula the min imum allocation for each state for shsgp grants will be 0375 of tota l shsgp and uasi appr opriations in fy2008 with the floor eventually reduced to 035 of the total shsgp and uasi appropriations in fy20125 while some may contend that this agreement resolves the debate that has been the focus of congressional attention for years others might argue that shsgp would not be discretionary progra m if there is guaranteed minimum amount for states each fiscal year reduction in funding for the assistance to firefighters program administration budget proposals have typica lly recommended significant cuts for fire grants as well as zero funding for safer gr ants opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments while the administration has argued that reduced levels are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of terrorist ttack or major disaster for fy2008 the administration proposed 300 million for fire grants in fy2008 45 cut from the fy2007 level funding was proposed for safer grants the total request for assistance to firefighters grants afg wa s 55 below the fy2007 level for fire and safer grants combined the fy2008 budget proposal eliminated grants for wellnessfitness activitie s and modifications to facilities for firefighter safety the budget justification requested funding for applicati ons that enhance the most critical capabilities of local response to firerelated hazards in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster the budget justification also st ated that the requested level of funding is an appropriate level of funding given the ava ilability of significant amounts of funding for first responder preparedness missions from other dhs grant pr ograms which are be tter coordinated with state and local homeland secur ity strategies and unlike afg are allocated on the basis of risk on june 5 2007 the house appr opriations committee recommended an appropriation of 570 million for fire gran ts and 230 million for the
