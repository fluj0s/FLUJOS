how to audit lecture given on 10 january 1963 thank you all right this is the second lecture saint hill special briefing course 10 january ad 13 and ive told you all you have to know now so there isnt anything here to lecture about in this particular lecture and you have become wise beyond measure here in the last hour ill talk to you about the implications of processing we have had problem for all these years of auditing somebody and everything was fine and then auditing another guy and everything was fine and then auditing third guy and he starts tearing up the neighborhood well this comes under the general headingand only this heading only this headingof missed withholds and the biggest missed withhold you can have of course is the missing answer to the auditing question he didnt give you the answer he didnt put the item on the list that is the biggest one this is so gigantic that if you did that right all the time you practically could omit pulling missed withholds but you cant omit pulling missed withholds and ill tell you why on your may third bulletin i think it is great many manifestations of missed withholds are given and amongst those are dopeoff boiloff arc break and that sort of thing now in routine 2 youre pulling missed withholds by the carload lot how many missed withholds do you think are in one routine 2 track item see thats well when you miss that whole package this of course makes terrific crashing missed withhold see because its conglomerate mess as well as mass now you however have to pull and continue to pull the little icky dicky ones you know about i bit my fingernails last night you know because youre liable to make this mistake you say there is so much unconsciousness in the bank that of course pc will go anatento use one of the oldtime wordswill go unconscious under the impact of this list and brother that isnt true pc wont go unconscious under the impact of an item even when you fire it straight to them and shift their attention they wont go unconscious by simply reading lists they wont get dopey or groggy simply by reason of reading lists none of these things are going to happen it sounds so reasonable to you that under this much impactand reading down one of these very vital rock slamming lists back to them again because of the anaten contained in the list itself natively and naturally that theyre going to dope off little bit that you tend to miss the fact that thats the little bite the fingernails missed withhold that you didnt get in the session any timenow mark thisany time that you see pc go dopey boil off anything like thator even go groggy and start shutting their eyes and slumping down on nulling you pull up right there and get those nearly foundouts now of course this is aided and abetted if you have just got through missing an item on list but the missing item on the list doesnt cause that anaten it merely gives it body theyve got to have pt type nearly found out before they will go under on list or as result of an item in other words an item wont do it all by itself and list of items wont do it all by themselves now just mark my words here its just not possible i cant say this too strongly i know this phenomena of boiloff and that sort of thing it is just not possible for pc to go anaten groggy boil off without near presenttime missed withhold you give them an item pc thinks of an item goes anaten you give them an item they go anaten you read list to them they go anaten they groggy and you know thuuh thats not items now listen to thats not items theyve been biting their fingernails last night thats what that is they havent told you that theyve actually been haunting the door of the theory room getting the questions being asked currently on bulletin so andso you see theyve been doing something theyve been carefully contemplating busting rule 28 see something is awry here it takes that present time booster to knock them out and the ordinary behavior of missedwithholdfree pc during listing and nulling and receiving of items and thinking of items is bright awake that is the expected behavior not groggedout at all bright awake oh they can close their eyes so that they dont watch your pencil wiggle or something but theyre bright awake that is your expected attitude on the part of the pc now during nulling this is terribly terribly important because you are depending on reading an item once to get it to rs and although on test after test prehav some ticks would register even though the pc is out meter will not rock slam while the pc is anaten now thats pretty dangerous isnt it youre counting on that meter rock slamming just by reading the item once and you wont see the rock slam if the pc is boiled off pc cant tell you the last six items five items three items four items didnt hear them because he was boiled off hm he wouldnt have rock slammed on them either so that is enough for you to have some cold chills about and you see that pc sitting there and he goes zzwhaawel youummgo mummm khh somewhereanywhere on that gradient scale you cannot count on the meter rock slamming you can count on it doing tick you can count on it doing tiny reaction if you hit something significant which is all we were counting on on doing prehavsassessments but you cant count on it rock slamming theres just insufficient attention present to charge up the package so itll slam so that is marvelous opportunity you have there of missing slamming item thats enough to give you cold chills unless you know it now that you know it thats easy now that will work the same way on rocket reads and so forth on goals checkouts and this is still data for 321 an anaten pc wont rocket read anaten pc wont rock slam ticks yes but notnot good healthy crashing manifestation like rocket read or rock slam see theyre not that active because theyre not there now you get yourself an accustomation of keeping pcs bright awake not using the dianetic methoddianetic methods are frowned on these days the fbi thinks that theyre very bad so that used to kick them in the soles of the feet that was the method of bringing pc awake thats right thats right you didnt audit them when they were boiling offyou kicked them on the soles of the feet and woke them up there were two schools of thought on this one you went on auditing them even though they were boiling off and wait until they woke up and the other school of thought was that you kicked them on the soles of the feet and woke them up and went on auditing them and finally i remember during suzies day in the wichita foundation i think the accepted method was if they began to snore was the borderline and you kicked them on the feet if they began to snore but otherwise you left them alone had director of training there in those dayshe used to blow bubbles his method of boiling offhow to keep from getting audited the point here is that that was way back when now midway along the line i found out why people boiled off what boiloff actually was it actually is flow which is run too long in one direction thats what boil off anaten and so fortha flow running too long in one direction that is to say this person auditsgives an auditing command too long in one stuck flow he can eventually walk into situation where he is groggy now thats essentially what it is now where does this fit in with the missed withhold missed withhold is restrained flow and because it is restrained flow any effort to outflow by the pc while he is busy inflowing causes him to inflow harder and when the pc has missed withhold hes inflowed as far as he can go and hes very very prone to boiloff in other words hes holding back flow see so he gets stuck flow real quick anything sticks you get that the withhold that has been excited that is restimulated see the restimulated withhold there causes this flow to lock up right now and its very thing you might get subjective reality on this someday somebody is very very industriously pulling these things and you all of sudden find yourself bright awake you give him the one which was knocking you out you go thuu bright awake room gets bright everything gets bright see and youre sitting there holding on to withhold and things start to get dim and very often trained auditor being audited trained auditor being audited actually doesnt do the same things that raw meat does you know ive noticed that they keep their own rudiments in and do various things and they always haveno matter how deeply interested they are on this and thatand theres always small section of one eye cocked on the professional skill and aptitude of the auditor auditing always is he cant escape it anyway not even an arc break involvedhes just keeping an eye on it found suzie out of session here few weeks ago i was auditing suzie and i found her out of session i just knew it wasnt quite right so i pulled missed withhold on the thing and shed been sitting there very brightly and alertly finding out how i was getting that many items called tricky so even shell do it now any pro will do this kind of thing and it doesnt constitute very much but its probably bigger trick to keep pro in session than it is raw meat raw meat is attitudinized and they dont know how youre supposed to do it right and auditing is even rather crude auditing looks flawless to them and you give them some real smooth auditing my god they dont know what hit them theres thought of any criticism in this department dont you see but there it is the fellows sitting there he gets this little withhold andnow mark thisthe session withhold quite commonly keys in presession withhold you almost never get the session withhold as the sole source of the anaten so thats very interesting see in other words session withholds tend to key in missed withholds in other words we didnt have any missed withhold at the beginning of session see we hadit wasnt keyed in so you hadnt been missed and then something happens in session and you see weve cleaned it up beautifully since the last time i audited you is there anything you have failed to reveal you see thats fine so we obviously got the last twentyfour hours clean as wolfs tooth nothing showed this will explain mystery to you maybe if youve ever wondered about this and then halfway through the session the fellow starts to say something doesnt say something forgets what it is then remembers and then thinks hed better not say it and starts to look little groggy and then you try to pull this missed withhold in this session is there anything youve failed to reveal and it doesnt pull and you say whats coming off around here pc just gets edgy well of course the withhold youre looking for is not in the session got that audience mmhm the keyin is in the session but the withhold isnt well nearly found out in this session is there anything i have nearly found out is quite fortuitous and usually takes care of the situation but an auditor should know this as part of his bag of tricks ptps dont necessarily key in willingness to talk to the auditor remains the same actual overts and that sort of thing they tend to come off at the beginning of session but session something happens in session can key in missed withhold that happened before the session so thats why that has to be kept as random rudiment and fully expect in session that something the pc did and was missed day before yesterday will key in see it doesnt happen every time but it happens often enough to get in your road trying to make this person wake up you got that youyoull see that every once in while youll see that every once in while it isnt every time but pc holds something back doesnt give you an item youre listing doesnt give you an item is there anything you failed to reveal gives you the item and gets groggy says yeah i didnt reveal this item soandso you expect him to brighten up see you say whoa wait wait why doesnt he suddenly come up here you know and start in here batting instead of that he gets groggier somehow or another this item keyed in every once in while enough to make it part of the auditors bag of tricks see something keyed in that he did last week or yesterday so never fail to never be completely unwilling to uncork whole track sort of withhold question oh dangerous itll keep you busy but listen itll get you out of more trouble than itll get you into like has anybody missed withhold on you you see or is there anything anybody nearly found out horrifying here we expect this guy to sit there and give you now two hundred trillion years worth and make it terrific missed withhold all over the doggone place well in actual practice in actual practice it will get you out of more trouble than it gets you into doesnt say that it wont get you into trouble but itll get you out of more sometimes ill date it on this you know on the basis of in the past week even though ive got betweensession rudiments in you see now thats used that way only when you cant wake up the pc you got that you start uncorking this kind of trickyou understand thisand you uncork this trick of just broaden that missed withhold question if you cant wake the pc up ordinarily and generally like in this session is there anything i nearly found out in this session is there anything i nearly found out in this session is there nearly found out you got that fine the pcs bright oh well dont break anybodys back see thats fine so that did it so youre all set but lets supposing the reverse happens in this session is there anything i nearly found out glug uh soandso in this session is there anything aonnowsmmsdunn in this session is there anything i nearly found out uyuhyuyu or worse than that you put it in at ten minutes past the hour and you find him boiling off at twenty minutes past the hour again now you just got to wrap that thing up and fire it man because youve got keyedin nearly foundout it didnt exist to amount to anything during the session up to this point but the session for some reason or other which we neednt even bother to inquire into is keying in this missed one and its now keyed in and it wasnt keyed in at the beginning of session and that causes and causes and causes now something else you should know about missed withhold that i hate to have to tell you but youre old enough to know the facts of life one of them is that not all missed withholds are on the second dynamic i thought that might people have been known to let air out of other peoples tires and you start steering missed withholds by dynamics or something weird like this youre going to get yourself into more trouble youre going to start more unfinished lists so you just keep this question pretty broad and pretty general now you do have to know this about the nearlyfoundout question it is lefthand button in other words suppressortype button and does not necessarily read on the meter so you run into situation where your pc looked little bit groggy early in the session and you said in this session is there anything i nearly found out about you and he gives you an answer and thats good enough he brightened up and fifteen minutes later hes twice as groggy as before you know exactly whats happened hes got presession earlier thanthesession nearlyfoundout of some kind or another that your question is not capable of eliciting an answer to and the thing for you to do is to prepcheck the nearlyfoundout question i dont care whether you give time limit or not its going to do you lot of good to straighten this pc up to that degree doesnt come under the head of auditing auditing pc who is boiling off while youre reading lists to him or trying to get lists from him amounts to auditing see this is the point where auditing is not auditing definitely well you cant do anything with boiling off pc his needle wont slam so what have you got to do with him youve got to because its lefthand button you know suppressed careful of nearly found out failed to reveal comes under that heading too those are all lefthand suppressive buttons they do not cause thing to read they prevent things from reading all the other buttons cause things to read unnecessarily so thats fine you can see all those these are visible to the naked eye weve added one button recently to big mid ruds that i ought to make some reservation about and that is anxious about tends also to be left hand button but now were getting into the very big mid ruds when we add that but mistake suggest decide protest these all make things read they dont keep things from reading your suppressor buttons over here they prevent read from occurring actually you realize that you can check out rock slamming item with suggest invalidate and mistake just about as alive as they can get you realize that the ones youve got to worry about are suppress careful of and nearly found out or failed to reveal and to less extent anxious about now of course protest follows on the heels of nearly found out or something of that sort or failed to reveal and so it tends to be the point where these two tie togetherthe left and handrighthand side you actually you know can use protest as random rudiment did you know that all right now as we inspect the pc during nulling of course pc who is boiling off cant list because he wont talk thats very obvious but it is less obviousa pc slumped back in the chair particularly if hes not snoringits less obvious that this pc is suffering from lots of unconsciousness see thats less obvious you got to keep an eye on that got to keep an eye on that and the only cure you have today is not kicking them in the soles of the feettheyve been known to arc break when this occurs and it doesnt do much good because itd just arc break and close your meter outthe thing to do is to get off the nearlyfoundouts and if the session nearly foundouts dont cure it why expect lot of the time if it goes down to severe thing as boiloff to have to cure it with much broader time base now there istheres fairly important data in running routine 2s and the way you prevent this thing from happening in coaudityou go down the line of coaudit well hpa student something like that or public co audit of some kindone of the things you must watch as an auditing supervisor is that somebody hasnt grogged out particularly during nulling session that you must watch and the waythe best way to cure this the best way to cure this is to sit in on it dont try to teach the auditor how to get the missed withholds off the case for gods sakes and take it for granted if its happening that its out of the session dont even bother to put in the session mid ruds dont you see just swing the random rudiment right in against the guy is there anything we nearly found out about you when you say we you also give it time limit because hes probably only been around for week or month or six months or something like that and see if you get response on the part of the guy worm it out of him or get his auditor to run it totally repetitive say just sit there and run this for the next twenty minutes see then when you finally see the pc is starting to arc break on it decide its flat and tell him he can go on listing i mean theres crude ways of adjudicating and handling these things as ratheras well as neat ones you know see the pcs starting to look desperate you know you look down the line and see this pc kept your eye on him hes looking desperate by this time is there anything we nearly found out about you the auditors been going on go over peer over the shoulder and grab hold of the guys meter is there anything we nearly found out about you yeah thats good and flat go on and list thats it something like that doesnt take any more than that because let tell you its pretty grossyou get it on the public like that its fairly gross manifestation but its very fine thing what really put him to sleep thats whats amusing about it the slightness of the thing that actually kicked him off the slightness of the keyin maybe it keyed in something important behind that maybe you got that maybe you didnt maybe it wont key in and maybe it will thats beside the point you sometimes askyou get this down searchingly and the pc has just got through saying well ii uhi nearly found outii nearly found out something ii nearly found out what the item was or something you see then i realized i hadnt and so forth thisll be the type of answer youll see him suddenly brighten up little bit you know i nearly found out you know the thing is reverse end to but thats perfectly acceptable as an answer on broad generally was anything nearly found out and then youhe stillyou could see that if you went on doing whatever youre doing hes going to go off again so you press this question just another time or two and all of sudden he says well actually this morning herbie offered ride and he nearly found out that i thought that it was too dangerous you know little thing like this it wasnt any vast deeds or anything of the sort you know and all of sudden the pcs bright as awake as gopher see wheres the list you know well fine wheres the list you read sometimes too much significance into these things its how it locks into the bank dont you see maybe the guy is about to give you an item that you wont get for another session or something or maybe hes about to give you an item coachman you see and anybody refusing ride in coach this is terrible moral break or something you know or something like that you dont care much how it adds up you actually dont care about the significance of it its just that is what knocks the pc out and you just mustnt audit knockedout pc thats all you got all the cures for it why not use these cures something elseyoure probably all at sixes and sevens weve been knocking auditing around and giving it bad name lately doesnt mean you shouldnt be able to do it well youre probably wondering these days what is model session what is goal finders model session what are all these things you know well ill tell you i use as much auditing as i have to and thats what i use as model session these days and it certainly has these elements you cant really reduce session now for safetys sake knowing what we know about goals you cant reduce session below this and still be fairly safe before session ordinary usual routine is of course you get the room all right and adjust the pcs chair get his can squeeze and put in the reality factor you certainly do those things because this thing could go very awry if you didnt do at least those things look around and see if the rooms all right adjust the pcs chair get can squeeze and put in an rfactor for the session now thats certainly minimal action youd get into trouble if you took any less action than that and then you have to give him start of session and you give pc start of session of course with tone 40 and you have him there and then you find out if the session started for him this isalso you could get into trouble little bit if you didnt find out and then what goals would you like to set for this session you certainly cant avoid that now but in actual fact that could stand trifle of an overhaul its distractive to have goals for life or livingness come after the session goals they probably should be in reverse i wouldnt say that were putting them in reverse im just pointing out that that improvement would be an improvement but we are not at this time using it got it be released in due course if its ever released im just pointing out to you theres possible improvement there goals for the session goals for life and livingness all right youre fine so far now it depends utterly on whether or not you are going to do listing or nulling session depends utterly what you do now but let tell you that if you had good complete list yesterday and the needle was very free and flowing and you thought you were all set to null in this session today and the pcs needle is free and flowing today and you do more than take down the goals and say all right were now going to null this list pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa youre taking risk if you do more than that because it becomes auditing you see that audience mmhm you thought the list was complete yesterday and the needles clean as wolfs tooth today and the pc is all eagereyed and bushytailed and were all set to fire here and so forth justwell you got the goals down all right you say now im going to going to null this list there you go start nulling take your chances on whether or not he has any betweensession mid ruds out because generally hes so interested in the list that these are more or less pushed aside now only get worried if he starts to boil off now hes going to boil off why there you are you better get in your not mid ruds you just better get in your random rudiment on nearlyfoundout basis since we dont care how you word it just as long as you pull those missed withholds and get them quick and get back there to doing what youre doing if your missed withholds didnt do it the list isnt complete and thats all there is to that simpleadd to the list now thats whats known as really shorthanding sessions right down to nothing all right pcnow lets take listing session we do exactly those things in other words we give them the basic form of an auditing session listing session pocketapocketapocketa what are you doing on listing session ever getting in missed withhold or any other damn thing what you doing whatwhat are you doing why start of session what goals would you like to set for this session any goals youd like to set for life or livingness all right weve got this list who or what would oppose catfish all right what item would you like to put on this list now all right here we go who or what would oppose catfish popocketapocketapocketa pocketapocketapocke i dont care whether the needles dirty tying itself in knots rock slamming to hell with it who cares what its doing you understand audience umhm because that action is far more therapeutic in cleaning up the needle than anything else you could do and its probably dirty because of the pcs thoughts about doing it you got that so listing sessionlist dont do anything else if you cant hold the pc insession or something like that or something like that the pc wont sit there and list why thats another thing now if the pc stops listing and i say its another thing thats missed withhold situation but if the pc stops listing what are you doing getting in dozen mid ruds you know theres only two mid ruds that stops pc from listingsuppress and invalidate and those are the primary mid ruds theyre the primary rudiments as far as mid ruds are concerned suppress and invalidate very often if pc is on fairly hot list you never have time to get in more than suppress and invalidate and hes off to listing again well why try to get in anything else why try to get in anything else just call those two the primary rudiments and if your listing interrupts and the pc stops listing get in the suppress get in the invalidate and there we go suppress is by prepcheck by the way and fire on down that list and andandandand you get in the suppress and he gives you suppress and suppress and then you ask suppress and he gives you an item you want to get the case tied in an absolute knot dont take the item just abandon suppress and invalidate right there youre not going to do anything more with them just going to go on listing got that youre not going to bay another word about it anything you suppressed well actually i was suppressing herei got an item i got an item waterbuck yeah theres waterbuck and caterwump and you justto hell with it see skip any of that other stuff see go right on listing see because why did you put them in you put them in to get the pc to start listing now youre not going to sit there and try to get your auditing question cleaned up he hit something and there was something he failed to reveal there or something of the sort in actual fact but itll all come out on suppress and invalidate now if you cant get him to list again get in the rest of them but ive never seen it happen ive yet to see this happen where you had to get in more rudiments than suppress and invalidate to get the pc back to listing see so what i know isim talking now about just cutting short corners around auditing see all right we get down to the end of the days session and we discuss what were doing here and where we have gotten to and we put in bit of reality factor on where we are going and what wedont necessarily put it in for the session tomorrow but just say where we got and thats it and then say thats the end of the body of the session you see and that closes off the body of the session and now what ive been doing is cock the meter up here to 64 on mark v and say in this session was the room all right and pull any stuck reactions on the thing and get the needle back to flowing again in other words get him out of the auditing environment as the most important thing that you could do for the pc to keep him from being stuck in the session just that one in this session was the room all right clean it sometimes you find pc starts protesting this question and that sort of thing well take it easy and do it next session too you know say all right hes protesting the thing and hes probably nervy and theres probably missed withhold something like that dont beat his brains out because of the thing but you can also assume theres probably something wrong with the room get your auditing question answered but dont necessarily clean this thing up you knowgrind him to death heres what im trying to do im trying to give you the answer to the pc who is inventing answers so he can answer the question you understand one of the best ways to clear that up is this question being protested oh yes have you invented any answers oh soandso and soandso oh well thank you very much and then just dont touch it dont ask the question again just come off of it see you understand because its more important to pull the protest and the invented answer than it is to try to get the auditing question driven home between his ears because its just courtesy youre trying to get him out of the auditing environment i refer to youto book which is not liked at all by the phew thethe department of the government phewscientology 88008 now that talks about thetan in the physical universe see and actually all the thetan is doing is stacking himself up against the physical universe and batting around like the blue bottle in the cage and if you want to do something to free him up out of his session well you just ask him if the auditing room was all right you get the modus operandi then youve got the thetan and the physical universe and youve got the sixth and seventh dynamicsthese straighten up and the pc feels better you understand sometimes they become very very gratuitous and start inventing answers for it why then youre in trouble and you dont bother to clean the thing up you assume theres probably missed withhold or something of the sort or he feels nerved up because of the session youre not going to do anything about it anyhow with the room you got it see youre not going to do anything about the room so get the inventinvented answers the protest offget off of it go ahead and do it next session again dont be scared off just because the pc has objected to it because he probably was objecting to it because his mind was on something else see in other words you dont have to kill that one with shotguns axes now we move over into the next action which is the can squeeze and normally you ask this other question in this session was the room all right to cut down the number of times you have to run havingness because very often if the pc has answered this question and cleaned itis the room all righthis havingness will snap back quite often and youll save auditing time by answering the question this is all in the direction of saving auditing time and then you get the can squeeze and you ask him to squeeze them up make sure that youve got the same thing and if your pc has actually been beat up in this session about the best thing you can do for that pc toward the end of session is not beat him to death with lot of rudiments you know you normally are getting shorttimed toward the end of session you could very easilybecause of the time nature of your sessions you seeyou could very easily leave him with only part of the mid ruds squared away or something like that or in an hgc and so on so youractually your best trick is to run some havingness if you dont know the pcs havingness processwhat are you doing auditing pc whose havingness process you dont know feel that touch that and notice that are the best havingness processes there are and normally any pc will respond to one or another of those its very funny thing though they very often dont respond to touch that when feel that is their havingness process and vice versa you tell why but its true its true i figured out the other evening it might bei was auditingit might be that feel that requires more confront than touch that there might be something in that its only few commands of this thing i was watching tv demonstration you were given the other day and so on and somewhoever it was who was running that havingness on that pc was going far far too long man it only takes few commands you just want to get that can squeeze restored how long does it take to get can squeeze restored well let tell you something you can start running the bank with havingness with the greatest of ease were talking now in the direction of about dozen commands or slightly less see and if were not sure of the pcs havingness process were certainly not going to run more than five commands of strange process all were trying to do is just run this pcs havingness cansqueeze test back up thats all were trying to do and that takes very little time so you snap him back to battery with havingness and thats yourand then take up goalsnever take up life or livingnessnever never go over your life or livingness goals with pc just go over the goals session goals now you take up gains and you take down whatever gains the pc says and you make your own comments over on the side of the thing and the pc can sit there and hold onto the cans while you scribble down whatever comments you make too and dont take the cans out of the pcs hands until the session is ended dont fall for practice like that because it gives him double change it ends the session materially before it ends the session mentally and it tends to kind of throw him out of balance little bit all right you got your goals you got your gains you say is there anything you to say and the pc says oh yes yes soandso and so andso and soandso and soandso something like that usually its question did my tone arm go down or something like that answer it be crisp now because youre startedyouve started the cycle of ending the session dont err i myself make this mistake occasionally i all of sudden get interested you know again in the session confounded thing rock slams you know you say whatwhat was that you know thats bad practice youre ending session sometimes its so vital that you have to know what that is though and you still ask him but end the session and anything you care to ask or say before i end this session and so forth and he says it well dont prompt him to say anything else is the point im making here cut that off man usually its thank you or something like that and you say all right here it is and give him good tone 40 end of session that leaves doubt in his mind whatsoever tell him tell im longer auditing you so as he shakes out of that and that is through pc who continues to talk about his case to you its almost inevitable the pc will make some kind of remark about his case give him an entirely altered aspectis the best trick of ending the session now visually too i never put itdoubtmuch doubt in the pcs mind but if the pc looks is shaking his head when ive said end of session going like this ill end session again for him see ill ask has session ended all right you know i take little care if its kind of obvious he didnt get out of session im not going to spend any time on it im not going to put him back on the meter and do various things of this particular care if ive given him an item and said thats your item and now were going to end the session and i see the pc isnt coming out of session i say well whats the matter youyou having doubts about that item hell say kind of well all right you dont have to have that for your item well go on listing on it next session pc brightens right up and you say good all right got that now end of session pow and hes out of session see that missing item can hold him from coming out of session and then youre through now when i say an altered aspect youve been an auditor and so forth and youve been willing to listen to him youre still willing to listen to him youre not going to arc break him youre not necessarily going to give him wisecrack or invalidate their case or something like that but look more cheerful and natural than usual ask him something like hey you got cigarette you know something its an altered aspect an altered tone of voice and it helps them come little further out of session you got it audience yeah well now you say whats model session today well model session is still model session and its got all those rudiments and its got everything else in itthats model session now were talking about very shortened routine 2 session see this is routine 2 it isnt goal finders model session that was itself too this is routine 2 session it just fits for routine 2 honestly if you use much more session than this youll get into trouble now youre trying to null youre trying to null the list is obviously complete and so forth use this other trickjust to get back to it little bitof handing the pc the sheet and saying whatwhat cooks on this sheet here whatanyany big thoughts on this sheet here or something like that pc says oh well yes and i invalidated that and i did this and i did that and so on and kind of suppressed that and i didnt think that was it and you say all right thank you very very much thank you dont ask him any rudiment on it just give him the sheet you understand oh you dont know about this trick maybe its not worked well for you audience yeah yeah it has yeah all right its nice trick it gets all the rudiments in brrrr bow bring it back over and go on going now but aside from that i would assume if pc became agitated in routine 2 sessioni would assume immediately that there was something wrong with the routine 2 not something wrong with the auditing thats the first thing id assume id assume he was getting auditing or something or he thought he wasnt and so forth pc who starts to act very selfauditish in session i wouldnt pay any attention to it you know hes starting to get his own rudiments in and starting to fill everything in i just give him cheery yes okay fine thank you and so the pc starts interrupting while im nulling and so forth to getting his own rudiments in id just stop and give him cheery aye aye and go on again see i dont start snarling at him and frowning and i sometimes have been known to frown at pc who scratches their head with the back of the can when theyre listingwhile giving four items you know i very often say well thats four we dont know whether they rock slammed or not oh oh says the pc well thats the extent of the importances of session i guess you could have called this lecture what you do in an auditing session these days and relative importance thereof and of course as you see the manifestation of boiloff and therefore pulling missed withholds is paramount to everything else because youof course he cant list while hes asleep and you cant null because he wont rock slam while hes asleep so there you are that makes routine 2 impossible but within those limits why thats about as much sessioning as i would use these days now something very funnyive got to tell you one little other piece of data and well end this lecture you start on list that is incomplete or wrong way to and you start nulling itif you use the 210 type nulling of just call call call looking only for rock slams you see barkbark barkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbarkbark and you get about halfway down the front page of that list and that needle starts getting dirty you would normally assume that the pcs rudiments have gone out i lately have begun to assume the correct answer its either wrong way to or the item isnt on the list you never saw anything asquite as agitated as needle goes on nulling on list thats got something sour about it now the faster you call off items the more briskly you enunciate them the less the pc thinks so at the speed ive been nulling lately the pc didnt haveno pcs had chance to do any thinking so ive managed to sort out this other datum and that is that ive taken some lists that are wrong way to and so forth and tested them and your needle will dirty up and its an indicatorits just an indicatorit isnt rule but you should always be leery that if youre calling down list fairly rapidly and you straighten out the list give him the page let him straighten it out and youre calling this off again and it goes dirty almost at once you should beget very alert man there is something wrong here it isnt just the rudiments going out the routine 2 is wrong wrong source wrong way to or item isnt on the list and usually all else being equal its the item isnt on the list thats the only place that an auditor can foul up now you can alsosomebody has done it here in this unitlist endlessly way beyond the point where the thing could be listed way way way way beyondthirty pages or so beyond the point where it ought to be nulled thats very extreme look but its fact and if it hawt been for the vacation and the snow and so forth and another auditor taking aver the case we never would have found it out the auditorthe pc to this day wont still be listing because of course needle starts going dirty on the protest you overlist and overlist and overlist and overlist the needle goes dirty on protest but you know that an incomplete list the needle doesnt go dirty on the protest you know the person really never protests it they snarl they sound arc broke they sound this way and that you cant find any protest they go on listing one way or the other even though youve had to say if you dont list any further on this list you get the message oh well you put it that way and so on rudiments in see just list not recommended but sometime when you know damn well the list is not complete and the pc wont add any more to it you know and the pcs getting all arc broke and all this way and that why your rudiments fail to get him to list again why list you know the only crime you can actually pull is not completing the list you realize that all other crimes fall short of that crime and in essence theres minimal sessioning oddly enough its going to take you more mid ruds on 321 than it does on routine 2 youre going to use mid ruds lot more on 321 now as soon as youve got the pt problems out of the roadas soon as you got the pt problems out of the roada case actually is ready for 321 you recognize that you could overuse routine 2 if youre clearing auditor you realize this you can overuse it it wont do the case any harm he goes on he gets clear and so forth but theres point where you get the present time problems out of the road as far as this pcs concerned and so on hes ready for 321 hell 90 right down find his goal as nice as you please all youd actually have to do on him is brief prepcheck and hed practically present you with his goal you see where that borderline comes it is safer for an expert auditor to do goals on case than it is to do routine 2 he will actually make less mistakes doing goals on case if he is an expert but it is more catastrophic for an inexpert auditor to do 321 on case than it is routine 2 do you see how those two points add up audience yes now in actual fact an expert does 321 more smoothly than he does routine 2 because routine 2 after all is not running on the pcs goal what you want to do is get the pcs goal and run it against pt if you want to get the rest of the problems out of the roadand you do all kinds of things you can do more with his goal any day in the week than you can do with routine 2 but youof course you cant get most peoples goals without getting some packages out of the road i want to give you one change in routine 2 just as one final remark here that list 1a in present time who or what are you upset about would probably run more easily on pc just as any version of in present timeorwho or what does present time consist of let give you that as the basic model who or what does present time consist of you see who are you in contact with in present time who or what are you in contact with in present time you understand any such version now one more remark about missed withholds and this changed line you realize that you can list the wrong universe remember theres the wrong universe theres the universe of the pcs life and livingness his auditing universe and the parts of existence and do you know that itll constitute on some pcs missed withhold if you dont list that one first which is ready to be listed you got that theres another way that you can miss an item is choose the wrong sphere of interest for your first list thats not very fruitful one but it can happen so you should be advised of it and that is pertinent to what ive been telling you tonight you insist on running auditingtype universe see and actually his present time universe has got him caved in you know his life and livingness universe got him caved in you try to do parts of existence on him and his auditing universe is kicking his head in and the pc will act like he has an arc break hell act like missed item by choosing the wrong one of these three universes to do first so that has to be sorted out with the pc on real expert action its not common but it canit could actually louse up case somebody screams like mad running about auditing ah hes about to be divorced or shot or president of the united states has heard his name and is therefore in rage see something of that sort has happened then his attention is so stuck on that type of universe that he cant even think about being audited dont you see and you cant get that one out of the roadif you dont get that one out of the road he wont be able to get any of the auditing things out of the road so theres another source of missed item okay all right and that is it and i hope it does you some good thank you very much and good night
