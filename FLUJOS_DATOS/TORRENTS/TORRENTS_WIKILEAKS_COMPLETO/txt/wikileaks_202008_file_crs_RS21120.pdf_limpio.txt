public companies register to sell new s ecurities and annua lly thereafter auditor assurances about company financia l statements remove barrier to the efficient use of capital and offer some protecti on to third party investors however the recent accounting scandals and numerous revi sions of previouslyissued financial statements have eroded public confidence in auditing while auditors are regulated by both governmental agencies and professiona l organizations many question whether this oversight has been adequate in response to these problems the 107th congress enacted the

made by its em erging issues task force eitf in addition it stated that the aicpa board that had been issuing technical standa rds that c onstitute gaap the accounting standards executive committee would cease doing sorepresentations made by the management of these entities other types of audits include compliance audits which see if established policies and procedures are being followed and operational audits which see if organizations are efficien t and effective accountants are also increasingly engaged in widening array of other assuran ce services which have different standards and pr ocedures than audits financial statement audits of private s ector organizations usually are done by independent accountants some times called external accountants today nearly all of these audits are carried out or superv ised by accountants who are certified public accountants cpas independent accountants ar owners or employees of private sector firms that are separate from the entities they audit they might be distinguished from internal accountants who work for the or ganizations being udited and government accountants who do most auditing of govern mental agencies however independent accountants also do internal and government accounting work financial statement audits of private s ector organizations are to be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas their basic objective is to see if the balance sheet and related st atements about income retained earnings and cash flows are fair presentations in all material respects of certain financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaas are qualitative standards regarding who is to conduct audits how audits are to be planned and carried out and how audit results are to be reported they are not lists of specific audit procedures gaas have carefully defined tec hnical meaning that clarifies both what audits do and what they do not do understanding these standards is important when questions ar ise regarding audit engagements gaas and other standards for privat sector audits are established largely by the american institute of certified p ublic accountants aicpa generally accepted accounting principles gaap are the conventions rules and procedures that define accepte d financial accounting practices at particular time they include both broad guidelines as well as detailed procedures the most important source of gaap for private sector entities is the statements and interpretations of the financial acc ounting standards board fasb nongovernmental entity that began operating in 1973 and similar issuances of its predecessors other sources of gaap with lesser authority include issuances fromfasb task forces and staff and from the aicpa widely accepted industry practices and other prof essional positions and literature 1 the us securities and exchange commission sec historically has accepted gaap developed from these private sources however it hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21120crs3 broad authority to establish accounting principles for the companies within its jurisdiction generally public companies whose securities are offered or sold in interstate commerce the sec issues bulletins that express the views of its staff on various accounting issues auditing plays critical role in modern ec onomies which are characterized by large multifaceted organizations complex economic exchanges and remote relationships between business managers and the owners nd other investors managers have the ability to obtain reliable information about thei r own firms at least in theory but it is risky for outside investors and other creditors to rely on managers representations alone to the extent auditors provide assurances about these representations they remove barrier to the efficient use of capital and offer some protection to parties that are indirectly affected by investing decisions annual fina ncial statement audits have become common for nearly all large organizations because of the demands of outside investors in the case of business entities outside s upporters in the case of notforprofit organizations tax authorities and government re gulators the sec requires audited financial statements when public companies register to ll new securities and annually thereafter who regulates

accounting oversight board the pcaob was mandated by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 p l 107204 to oversee auditing of public companies ie sec registrants though not federal agency the board is subject to sec oversight among the major issues the board will be considering are whether new auditing standards are required whether dditional consulting restrictions should be imposed on auditors and

retained kornferry international an executive search company to help find people to fill the top staff jobs in addition the board set annual salaries for the chairm an at 560 000 and for the ot her members at 452000 these salary levels have provoked criticism from so members of congress though it is also argued that board salaries like those of the staff of which there will be several hundred should be comp etitive with national accounting firms first year costs are anticipated to run between 25 and 50 million under the sarbanesoxley act the amount is to be advanced from the sec s fy2003 budget and then reimbursed to the treasury once the board begins to collect fees other legal liability auditors can be sued for breach of contract by their clients the entities being audited for failing to carry out their work with due professional care among other things clients usually must show they suffered damages and that there is close causal connection between the breach and the damages to reduce this risk most accounting firms use engagement letters to clarify what they will do and identify client responsibilities third parties normally can sue auditors only in tort action not for br each of contract one exception would be if the thir d party is subrogee of the client such as trustee in bankruptcy th ird parties must also show they suffered damages and that there is close causal connection between the auditors breach and the damages however in some states barring showing of gross negligence or fraud third parties may be unsuccessful in their suit unless it is shown that the auditors actually foresaw the parties would rely on the audit or in some st ates that the auditors might reasonably have foreseen their reliance third parties may also sometimes bring suit against auditors under provisions of fede ral securities laws 107th congress highlights numerous accounting and auditing re forms were proposed during the 107th congress including some by the accounting i ndustry most of the leading proposals would have established new oversight board for auditors of public companies though they often differed on the scope of its pow ers on its relation to the sec and on its independence from the firms and accountants it would regulate the leading house bill was hr 3763 re p oxley which was reported by the committee on financial services on april 22 2002 and approved by the house on april 24 2002 the leading senate bill was s 2673 sarba nes which was reported by the committee on banking housing and urban ffairs on june 25 2002 and passed by the senate on july 15 2002 the conference agr eement formally hr 3763 was approved on july 24 2002 it largely followed the nate amendment though modifications proposed by the house were accepted both houses passed the conference measure on july 25th and the president signed it on july 30 2002 pl 107204 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21120crs6 known as the sarbanesoxley act pl 107204 among other things

providing consulting services for audit clients for the most part they favored the house bill hr 3763 rather than the senate bill s 2673 since arthur andersen can longer legally perform audits and in any case has largely collapsed the socalled big5 accounting firms have been reduced to four pri cewaterhousecoopers deloitte and touche kpmg and ernst and young
