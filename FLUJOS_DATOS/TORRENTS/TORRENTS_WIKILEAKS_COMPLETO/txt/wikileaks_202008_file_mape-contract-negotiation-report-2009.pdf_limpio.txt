the teams tracking doc ument and making sure it represents the full language in the teams propo sal the team also spent time reviewing and refinin g the rationale behind mapes proposals in the early afternoon mape executive director jim monroe welcomed the governors team the governor s team gave partial response to mapes proposal for articles 4 614 and 16 first they went through all the arti cles that appeared to have changes they are articles 1 2 3 5 15 20 2 1 28 31 32 and 33 on the second day the governors team responded to our proposals for articles 17 18 22 23 27 and 29 article 24 is deferred to the wage discussion mape assistant executive director bob haag discusse d the recall list and the process the mape team made an effort to move the process fo rward by packaging several proposals both from ou r team and the governors team we met with the governors team in the afternoon to continue negotiations remember first the governors proposal went after mape mem bers with laundry list of take backs that they ve done for the past three contracts changes to grievances holid ay pay expense allowances severance eligibility s well as layoffs and recalls then the governor dropped bomb due to 64 billion budget deficit in minnesota governor pawlenty wants to force furlough onto ma pe members for up to 24 days each year of our contract which is total of 48 days for our next contract minnesotas historic deficit mess is due to pawlent ys shortsightedness with his pledge for new t axes and now as the chickens come home to roost he is willi ng to cut important state services rather than admi t he was wrong furloughs will mean that the governor will have the ability with rhyme or reason to give manageme nt the right to arbitrarily decide who gets furloughed and how long they are furloughed the preliminary financial impact of the furlough wi ll be 10 percent pay cut and 10 percent reduction in retirement savings furloughs can be used in way to undermine every u nion protection we have staff will have say abo ut the furlough process anyone can be targeted at any time which will cause workplace stress for emp loyees due to hostile work422009 mape mapeorgnegreport7032709asp 12process anyone can be targeted at any time which will cause workplace stress for employees due to hostile work environment it is certainly way to run any busi ness or state government let us give you some insight as to the seriousness of the furlough issue the governors lead negotia tor said when it comes to furloughs we believe that we already h ave the right to do it now we believe this is jus t clarification and then she had the nerve to say that the governor wanted to formalize the furloughs in order to pro tect mape members in terms of whether or not currently the governor h as the legal authority to furlough it does not ma tter because governor pawlenty says he believes he already has the author ity he has issued veiled challenge to get mape t file lawsuit any lawsuit would take years to settle given the possi bilities for multiple court appeals that would be very hard on mape make mistakes the governors team wants to use furloughs and take backs as ways to save state budg et money the governor wants to be able to use close to 250 mill ion in proposed cuts to essential state services pr ovided by mape and afscme in the next two years that way he can still boast that he hasnt raised taxes but he wil l not boast to minnesotans about all the services he is willing to cut this is severe assault on the livelihoods of our members these furloughs will not save any mape mem bers their jobs unemployment already hit historic high of 81 per cent in february for the state like many minnesota ns we have members who live paychecktopaycheck just to make their house payments and put food on the table even members whose jobs are federally funded should know their jobs are not safe dont forget pawlen ty is using the stimulus money to balance the budget in the short t erm in these tough economic times with record def icits and record unemployment rates there are guarantees for emp loyment what this boils down to is cuts cuts and more cuts thats the way the governors team plans to try t solve the states 64 billion budget deficit it wont work we can t cut our way out of this budget mess we already have the 10th smallest workforce in the country do you realize that we have approximately the same number of state employees as the state of mississip pi but minnesota has close to double the populatio n its time for the governor to consider additional revenue as one of t he solutions to the budget crisis not by shrinking the services we provide and it is time for mape members to pull together an d fight the governors proposal not to try and fi nd ways to accept it as if the proposal was reality mape needs its members to pull together and unite t fight the governors proposed contract offer tal k to your coworkers
