summary data mining has become one of the ke features of many homeland security initiatives often used as means for detecting fraud assessi ng risk and product retailing data mining involves the use of data analysis t ools to discover previously unknown valid patterns and rela tionships in large data sets in the context of homeland security data mining can be potential means to identify terrorist activities such as money transfers and communications and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves such as through travel and immigration records while data mining represents significant advance in the type of analytical tools currently available ther are limitations to its capability one limitation is that although data mining can help reveal patterns and relati onships it does not tell the user the value or significance of these patte rns these types of determinations must be made by the user second limitation is that while data mining can identify connections between behavior s andor variables it does not necessarily identify causal relationship successful data mining still requires skilled technical and analytical specialists who can structure the analysis and interpret the output data mining is becoming increasingly common in both the private and public sectors industries such as banking insu rance medicine and retailing commonly use data mining to reduce costs enhance res earch and increase sales in the public sector data mining applications initially were used as means to detect fraud and waste but have grown to also be used for purposes such as measuring and improving program performance however some of the homeland security data mining applications represent significant expansion in the quantity and scope of data to be analyzed some efforts that have attract ed higher level of congressional interest include the terrorism information awarene ss tia project nowdiscontinued and the computerassisted passenger prescreening system ii capps ii project now canceled and replaced by secure flight other initiativ that have been the subject of congressional interest include the multistate antiterrorism information exchange matrix the able danger program the automated targeting system ats and data collection and analysis projects being conduc ted by the national security agency nsa as with other aspects of data minin g while technological capabilities are important there are other imple mentation and oversight issu that can influence the success of projects outcome one issue is data quality which refers to the accuracy and completeness of the data be ing analyzed second issue is the interoperability of the data mining software and databases being used by different agencies third issue is mission creep or the use of data for purposes other than for which the data were originally collected fourth issue is privacy questions that may be considered include the degr ee to which government agencies should use and mix commercial data with government data whether data sources are being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally signed and possible application of the privacy act to these initiatives it is anticipated that congressional oversight of data mining projects will grow as data mining efforts continue to evolve this report will be update d as events

nition0294236sid11_gci21190100htmldata mining and homeland security an overview what is data mining data mining involves the use of sophisti cated data analysis tools to discover previously unknown valid patterns and re lationships in large data sets1 these tools can include statistical models mathematical algorithms and machine learning methods algorithms that improve th eir performance automatically through experience such as neural networks or decision trees consequently data mining consists of more than collecting and managing data it also includes analysis and prediction data mining can be performed on data represented in quantitative textual or multimedia forms data mining applications can use variety of parameters to examine the data they include association patterns where one event is connected to another event such as purchasing pen and purchasing pape r sequence or path analysis patterns where one event leads to another event such as the birth of child and purchasing diapers classification i dentification of new patterns such as coincidences between duct tape purchases and plastic sheeting purchases clustering finding and visually documenting groups of previously unknown facts such as geographic location and brand preferences and forecasting discovering patterns from which one can make reasonable predictions regarding future activities such as the prediction that people who join an at hletic club may take exercise classes2 as an application compared to other data analysis applications such as structured queries used in many commercial databases or statistical analysis software data mining represents difference of kind rather than degree many simpler analytical tools utilize verificationbased approach where the user develops hypothesis and then tests the data to prove or disprove the hypothesis for example user might hypothesize that customer who buys hammer will also buy box of nails the effectiveness of this approach can be limited by the creativity of the user to develop various hypotheses as well as the structure of the software being used in contrast data mining utilizes discovery approach in which algorithms can be used to examine several multidimensional data relationships simultaneously identifying those that are unique or frequen tly represented for example hardware store may compare their customers tool purchases

discovery in databases kdd other steps in the kdd process in prog ressive order include data cleaning data integration data selection data transformation data mining pattern evaluation and knowledge presentation4 number of advances in technology nd business processe s have contributed to growing interest in data mining in both the public and private sectors some of these changes include the growth of computer networks which can be used to connect databases the deve lopment of enhanced search related techniques such as neural networks and advanced algorithms the spread of the clientserver computing model allowing users to access centralized data resources from the desktop and an increased ability to combine data from disparate sources into single searchable source5 in addition to these improved data management tools the increased availability of information and the decreasing costs of storing it have also played role over the past several years there has been rapid increase in the volume of information collected and stored with some observers suggesting that the quantity of the worlds data approximately doubles every year6 at the same time the costs of data storage have decreased significantly from dollars per megabyte to pennies per megabyte similarly computing power has continue d to double every 1824 months while the relative cost of computing pow er has continued to decrease7 data mining has become increasingly common in both the public and private sectors organizations use data mining as tool to survey customer information reduce fraud and waste and assi st in medical research however the proliferation of data mining has raised some implementation and oversight issues as well these include concerns about the quality of the da ta being analyzed th

continuedlimitations of data mining as terrorist detection tool while data mining products can be very powerful tools they are not self sufficient applications to be successful data mining requires skilled technical and analytical specialists who can structure the analysis and interpret the output that is created consequently the limitations of da ta mining are primarily data or personnel related rather than technologyrelated8 although data mining can help reveal pa tterns and relationshi ps it does not tell the user the value or significance of thes patterns these types of determinations must be made by the user similarly the validity of the patterns discovered is dependent on how they compare to real world circumstances for example to assess the validity of data mining application designed to identify potential terrorist suspects in large pool of individuals the user may test the model using data that includes information about known terrorists however while possibly reaffirming particular profile it does not necessarily mean that the application will identify suspect whose behavior significantly deviates from the original model another limitation of data mining is that while it can identify connections between behaviors andor variables it does not necessarily identify causal relationship for example an application may identify that pattern of behavior such as the propensity to purchase airline tickets just shortly before the flight is scheduled to depart is related to characteristics such as income level of education and internet use however that does not necessarily indicate that the ticket purchasing behavior is caused by one or mo re of these variables in fact the individuals behavior could be affected by some additional variables such as occupation the need to make trips on short notice family status sick relative needing care or hobby taking advantag of last minute discounts to visit new destinations9 beyond these specific limitations some researchers suggest that the circumstances surrounding our knowledge of terrorism make data mining an ill suited tool for identifying predicting potential terrorists before an activity occurs successful predictive data mining requires significant number of known instances of particular behavior in order to develop valid predictive models for example data mining used to predict types of consumer behavior ie the likelihood of someone shopping at particular store the potential of credit card usage being fraudulent may be based on as many as millions of previous instances of the same particular behavior moreover such robust data set can still lead to false positives in contrast as cato institute report suggests that the relatively small number of terrorist incidents or attempts each year are too few and individually unique to enable the creation of valid predictive models10 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31798crs4 10 continued data mining cato institute

of purposes in both the private and public sectors industries such as banking insu rance medicine and retailing commonly use data mining to reduce costs enhance resear ch and increase sales for example the insurance and banking industries use data mining applications to detect fraud and assist in risk assessment eg credit scor ing using customer data collected over several years companies can develop models that predic t whether customer is good credit risk or whether an accide nt claim may be fraudulent and should be investigated more closely the medical community sometimes uses data mining to help predict the effectiveness of procedure or medicine pharmaceutical firms use data mining of chemical compounds and gene tic material to help guide research on new treatments for diseases retailers can use information collected through affinity programs eg shoppers club cards frequent flyer points contests to assess the effectiveness of product lection and placement decisi ons coupon offers and which products are often purchased together companies such as telephone service providers and music clubs can use data mining to create churn analysis to assess which customers are likely to remain as subscribers and which ones are likely to switch to competitor11 in the public sector data mining applications were initially used as means to detect fraud and waste but they have gr own also to be used for purposes such as measuring and improving program performan ce it has been reported that data mining has helped the federa l government recover millions of dollars in fraudulent medicare payments12 the justice department has been able to use data mining to assess crime patterns and adjust resource allotments accordingly similarly the department of veterans affa irs has used data mining to help predict demographic changes in the constituency it serves so th at it can better estimate its budgetary needs another example is the federal aviation administration which uses data mining to review plane crash data to recognize common defects and recommend precautionary measures13 in addition data mining has been increas ingly cited as an important tool for homeland security

project s being conducted by the national security agency nsa terrorism information awareness tia program in the immediate aftermath of the ptember 11 2001 terrorist attacks many questions were raised about the countrys intelligence tools and capabilities as well as the governments ability to detect other socalled sleeper cells if indeed they existed one response to these concerns was the creation of the information awareness office iao at the defense advanced research projects agency darpa15 in january 2002 the role of iao wa s in part to bring together under the leadership of one technical office director several ex isting darpa programs focused on applying information technol ogy to combat terrorist threats16 t h mission statement for iao suggested that the emphasis on these technology programs was to counter asymmetric threats by achieving total information awareness useful for preemption national security warning and national security decision making17 to that end the tia project was to fo cus on three specific areas of research anticipated to be conducted ove r five years to develop t echnologies that would assist in the detection of terrorist groups planning attacks against

of the tiarelated projects did involve some form of data collection the continued language translation data search with pattern recognition and privacy protection and advanced collaborative and decision support tools language translation technology would enable the ra pid analysis of foreign languages both spoken and written and allow analysts to quickly search the translated materials for clues about emerging threats the data search pattern recognition and privacy protection technologies would permit analysts to search vast quantities of data for patterns that suggest terro rist activity while at the same time controlling access to the data enforcing ws and policies and ensuring detection of misuse of the information obtained the collaborative reasoning and decision support technologies would allow analysts from different agencies to share data18 each part had the potential to improve the data mining capabilities of agencies that adopt the technology19 automated rapid language translation could allow analysts to search and monitor foreign language documents and transmissions more quickly than currently possible improved search and pattern recognition technologies may enable more comprehensive and thoroug h mining of transactional data such as passport and vi sa applications car rentals driver license renewals criminal records and airline ticket purchases improved collaboration and decision support tools might facilitate the search and coordination activ ities being conducted by different agencies nd levels of government20 in public statements darpa frequently referred to the tia program as research and development project designed to create experimental prototype tools and that the research agency would only use data that is legally available and obtainable by the us government21 darpa further emphasi zed that these tools could be adopted and used by other agencies and that darpa itself would not be engaging in any actualuse data minin g

looking down over the globe accompanied by the latin phrase scientia est potentia knowledge is power26 although darpa eventually removed the logo from its website it left lasting impression the continued negative publicity surroundi ng the tia program contributed to the introduction of number of bills in cong ress that eventually led to the programs dissolution among these bills was s 188

areas of development some of ardas research thrusts include information ex ploitation quantum information science global infosystems access novel intelligence from massive data and advanced information assurance the novel intelligence from massive data nimd program focuses on the development of data mining nd analysis tools to be used in working with massive data114 novel intelligence refers to actiona ble information not previously known massive data refers to data that has characteristics that are especially challenging to common data analysis tools and methods these characteristics can include unusual volume breadth heterogeneity and complexity data sets that are one petabyte one quadrillion bytes or larger are considered to be massive smaller data sets that contain items in wide variety of formats or are very heterogeneous ie unstructured text spoken text audio vi deo graphs diagrams images maps equations chemical formulas tables etc can also be considered massive according to ardas website longer available115 some intelligence data sources grow at rate of four petabyte s per month now and the rate of growth is increasing with the continued prolif eration of both the means and volume of electronic communications it is expected that the need fo r more sophisticated tools will intensify whereas some observers once predicted that the nsa was in danger of becoming proverbially deaf due to the spreading use of encrypted communications it appears that nsa may now be at greater risk of being drowned in information data mining issues as data mining initiatives continue to evolve there are several issues congress may decide to consider related to implementation and oversight these issues include but are not limited to data quality interoperability mission creep and privacy as with other aspects of data mining while technological capabilities are important other factors also influen ce the success of projects outcomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31798crs27 data quality data quality is multifaceted issue that re presents one of the biggest challenges for data mining data quality refers to the accuracy nd completeness of the data data quality can also be affected by the structure and consistency of the data being analyzed the presence of duplicate records the lack of data standards the timeliness of updates and human error can significantly impact the effectiveness of the more complex data mining techniques which are sensitive to subtle differences that may exist in the data to improve data quality it is sometimes necessary to clean the data which can involve the rem oval of duplicate records normalizing the values used to represent information in the database eg ensuring that is represented as 0 throughout the databa and not sometimes as 0 sometimes as an n etc accounting for missing data points removing unneeded data fields identifying anomalous data points eg an individual whose age is shown as 142 years and standardizing data formats g changing dates so they all include mmddyyyy interoperability related to data quality is the issue of interoperability of different databases and data mining software interoperability refers to the ability of computer system andor data to work with other systems or data using common st andards or processes interoperability is critical part of the larger efforts to improve interagency collaboration and information sharing thr ough egovernment and homeland security initiatives for data mining interoperability of databases and software is important to enable the search and analysis of multiple databases simultaneously and to help ensure the compatibility of data mining activities of different agencies data mining projects that are trying to take advantage of existing legacy databases or that are initiating firsttime collaborative efforts with other agencies or levels of government eg police departments in different states may experience interoperability problems similarly as agencies move forward with the creation of new databases and information sharing efforts they will need to address interoperability issues during their planning stages to better ensure the effectiveness of their data mining projects mission creep mission creep is one of the leading ri sks of data mining cited by civil libertarians and represents how contro l over ones information can be tenuous proposition mission creep refers to the use of data for purposes other than that for which the data was originally collected this can occur regardless of whether the data was provided voluntarily by the i ndividual or was collected through other means efforts to fight terrorism can at times take on an acute sense of urgency this urgency can create pressure on both data holders and officials who access the data to leave an available resour ce unused may appear to some as being negligent data holders may feel obligated to make any in formation available that could be used to prevent future attack or track known rrorist similarly g overnment officialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31798crs28 116 technology and

databases to identify potential threats unlike physical searches or the detention of individuals accessing inform ation for purposes other than originally intended may appear to be victimless or harmless exercise however such information use can lead to unintende d outcomes and produce misleading results one of the primary reasons for misleading results is inaccurate data all data collection efforts suffer accuracy concerns to some degree ensuring the accuracy of information can require costly protocols that may not be cost effective if the data is not of inherently high economic value in wellmanaged data mining projects the original data collecting organization is likely to be aware of the datas limitations and account for these limitations accordingly however such awareness may not be communicated or heeded when data is us ed for other purposes for example the accuracy of information collected thr ough shoppers club card may suffer for variety of reasons including the lack of identity authentication when card is issued cashiers using their own cards for customer s who do not have one andor customers who use multiple cards116 for the purposes of marketing to consumers the impact of these inaccuracies is negligible to the individual if government agency were to use that information to target individua ls based on food purchases associated with particular religious observances though an outcome based on inaccurate information could be at the least waste of res ources by the government agency and an unpleasant experience for the misidentified individual as the march 2004 tapac report observes the potential wi reuse of data suggests that concerns about mission creep can extend beyond privacy to the prot ection of civil rights in the event that information is used for targeting an i ndividual solely on the basis of religion or expression or using information in wa that would violate the constitutional guarantee against selfincrimination117 privacy as additional information sharing and data mining initiatives have been announced increased attention has focu sed on the implications for privacy concerns about privacy focus both on actua l projects proposed as well as concerns about the potential for data mining applica tions to be expanded beyond their original purposes mission creep for example some experts suggest that antiterrorism data mining applications might also be useful for combating other types of crime as well118 so far there has been little cons ensus about how data mining should be carried out with several competing points of view being deba ted some observers contend that tradeoffs may need to be made regarding privacy to ensure security other observers suggest that existing laws and regulations regarding privacy protections are adequate and that these initiatives do not pose any threats to privacyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31798crs29 119 the report is available at httpwwwefforgprivacytiatiareportpdf 120 for

provision see crs report rl31805 authorization and appropriations for fy2004 defense by amy belasco and stephen daggettstill other observers argue that not enoug h is known about how data mining projects will be carried out and that greater oversight is needed there is also some disagreement over how privacy concerns should be addresse d some observers suggest that technical solutions are adequate in contrast some privacy advocates argue in favor of creating clearer policies nd exercising stronger oversight as data mining efforts move forward congress may consider variety of questions including the degree to which government agencies should use and mix commercial data with government data whether data sources ar being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed and the possible application of the privacy act to these initiatives legislation in the 108th congress during the 108th congress number of legisl ative proposals were introduced that would restrict data mining activities by some parts of the federal government andor increase the reporting requirements of such projects to congress for example on january 16 2003 senator feingold introduced s 188 the datamining moratorium act of 2003 which would have imposed moratorium on the implementation of data mining under the total information awareness program now referred to as the terrorism information awareness project by the department of defense as well as any similar program by the department of homeland security s 188 was referred to the committee on the judiciary
