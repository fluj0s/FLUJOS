mile s frederick ehrlich california bar number 237954 dear mr drexel and ms stowe i received your response to my complaint regarding former assistant united states attorney miles frederick ehrlich who resign ed his position with the department of justice hereinafter referred to as the doj sometime during the fall of 2005 you state your response is predicated on the fact that mr ehrlich didnt represent and therefore there is conflict of interest th ats not at all dispositive of the issues i evidenced to the state bar of california and given the acts underlying the complaint committed by miles ehrlich his c lients and their cohorts are criminal in nature very disturbing i hereby request that the audit and review office of the chief trial counsel of the state bar of california review my july 31 2007 co mplaint in light of the further information and analysis provided herein the office of the chief trial counsel needs to look at this case from pedestrian perspective herewith is synopsis of the facts 1 crime victim and witness reports the id entities and criminal activities including narcotics trafficking money laundering fraud bribing foreign judicial officials and conspiracy to federal prosecutor 2 the federal prosecutor apparently did not act on the victims report 3 six months after the victims report th federal prosecutor resigned from the department of justice 4 thereafter the victim discovers coincidentally that the former federal prosecutor is representing as criminal defense attorney one of the parties the victim identified to the former federal prosecutor as engaged in the criminal activity and is providing advice and counsel to at least one of several of the other perpetrators mr scott j drexel ms lisa stowe wednesday december 12 2007 page 2 of 32 jon goodwin 5 and that the former federal prosecutor is co lluding with others waging campaign of intimidation against the vic tim employing threats harassment and misleading tactics to dissu ade and undermine his attempts to engage law enforcement officials enabling his client her husband and their cohorts to evade prosecution 6 the victim reports the forego ing activity to the state bar of california because large influential law firm is in the mids t of the case the state bar of california attempts to dissuade the victim from fu rthering his complaint by intentionally misinterpreting the facts the case of miles ehrlichs successive representa tion of adverse interests first in the role of federal prosecutor and thereafter as cr iminal defense attorney not only appears improper it is improper particularly be cause miles ehrlich was in position of authority as government prosecutor and law enforcement official that enabled him not to pursue investigating nd prosecuting the clients hes currently representing the criminal activities i reported to miles ehrlic h the federal prosecutor directly affect multiple victims including the government of foreign country india an ally of the united states by definition criminal activity affects society as whole in this case the people of the united states and the state of california moreover federal prosecutor whos sworn to up hold the cons titution and the public trust must not be allowed to engage in representing persons identified to him as committing criminal acts in contravention to laws of the united states after leaving government service otherwise crime victims witnesses and in formants will be reticent to re port criminal activity out of fear 1 they will be retaliated against and 2 their interests have been sold to the higher bidder as officers of the court with responsibilities to the administ ration of justice attorneys have an obligation to be professional with clients other parties and counsel the courts and the public this obligation includes civ ility professional integrity personal dignity candor diligence respect courtesy and cooperati on all of which are essential

privileged nature of the may 9 2005 criminal matters information as averred above and in my ju ly 31 2007 complaint acting in the dual capacity as an attorney and law enforcement official for the united stat miles ehrlich obtained sensitive information from material fact witness and victim regarding the may 9 2005 criminal matters i believed the information i supplied miles ehrlich would be held in confidence by him and the department of justi ce for the following reasons 1 the information had not been disseminated to the general public 2 to my knowledge an inve stigation into the activities i reported to him had not commenced 3 the information detailed very serious cr iminal activity incl uding but not limited to the identity of and links to criminal narcotics trafficking organization operating in the san francisco bay area which information if obtained by the individuals i identified to miles ehrlich would be adverse to an investigation and prosecution by the united states of the may 9 2005 criminal matters 4 that in any event given b ecause i am material fact witness the united states would have an interest in protecting my safety and the safety of my family from those involved in the may 9 2005 criminal matters thus when i divulged the may 9 2005 criminal matters i reasonably expected miles ehrlich would maintain the in formation in confidence to preserve the united states interests and protect the rights and safety of w itnesses and victims related to the case in fact my recollection is that i observed to miles ehrlich that the information was sensitive because heller ehrman llp ma jor law firm was involved as well as criminal narcotics trafficking organization and that he should therefore maintain the information in confidence the

criminal investigation including reports of informants and investigators and associated with an identifiable individual or c reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision emphasis added former attorneys general janet reno john ashcroft and alberto gonzales and their predecessors have sought to protect the in formation described in 5 usc 552aj2 through the adoption of multitude of rules governing such information as described above and elucidated more fully in the usam fbi manua ls and doj memoranda for example pursuant to usam chapter 13100 prior approval requirements the deputy attorney general must approve any disclosu re of information by doj employees which would be in violation of 28 c fr sec 1626b which sets out those interests that the doj must protect see also usam 16420 440 28 cfr 16 judicial administration production or disclosu re of material or information further supports the fact that the may 9 2005 crimin matters information was confidential information of the united stat which is not authorized to be made available to the public on request these regu lations strictly prohib it the disclosure of information where the disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes and would interfere w ith enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures such that their effectiveness would be impaired see 28 cfr 16265 pursuant to 28 cfr 1626b4 considerations in determ ining whether production or disclosure should be made pursuant to demand among the demands in response to which disclosure will not be made by any department official are those demands wi th respect to which disclosure would reveal confidential source or informant unless the investigative agency and the source or informant have objection emphasis added stating the obvious i would ne ver have released miles ehrlich to use the information i provided him to represent and provide advice and counsel to the individuals i identified to him as primary actors involved in the may 2005 criminal matters moreover because mr scott j drexel ms lisa stowe wednesday december 12 2007 page 15 of 32 jon goodwin of the nature of the criminals acts ie narcotics trafficking moneylaundering bribery of

iles ehrlich obtained from included the identities of the parties to the may 9 2005 criminal matters the specific nature of those crimes as well as the general nature of the ev idence in my possession in addition miles ehrlich was aware i reported the may 9 2 005 criminal matters to him such information would certainly be helpful to his representati on of marcia bruggeman hatch and his provision of advice nd counsel to seamus hatch and or aran strategic finance llc for example their learning that i reported the may 9 2005 criminal matters would be useful to because it would be obv ious that their marcia bruggeman hatchs husbands and his cohorts manufacturing accusa tions to cast in an unfavorable light and the use of their manufacture d statements to attempt to ex tort general release from had not prevented from contacting law enforcement authorities to inform them of their criminal activities thus miles ehrlich and his criminal defense attorney colleagues could use their contacts and influence with w enforcement agencies to assist marcia bruggeman hatch et to evade investig ation and prosecutio n by preempting and delaying my attempts to comm unicate with law enforcement offi cials i believe this was the strategy they were pursuing until i discove red by happenstance that miles ehrlich had switched sides and was clandestinel representing marcia bruggeman hatch when miles ehrlich returned my call to him on november 15 2006 he did not tell he was representing marcia brugge man hatch and providing advi ce and counsel to seamus hatch andor aran strategic finance when i asked him for referral to his successor at the united states attorneys office he asked if i could be reached at the telephone number he called on to wit i responded ffirmatively miles eh rlich then told ill get back to you and term inated the call several hour s later i received harassing telephone call from agents who refused to disclo to the identity of their client i believe were employed by the parties to the ma 9 2005 criminal matters these agents wanted to know my location wh ich i refused to provide them sometime later i received mr scott j drexel ms lisa stowe wednesday december 12

criminal acts ag ainst the united states the state of california and other victims the interests of marcia bruggeman hatch seamus hatch and aran strategic finance llc are by definition adverse to the interests of the people of the united states victims witnesses w ho can provide testimony regarding their illegal acts any representation miles ehrlich has undertaken against th witnesses to or negatively parties affected by the may 9 2005 criminal matters to facilitate the evasion of prosecution or to cover up crimes perpetrated by marcia bruggeman hatch seamus hatch and their cohorts is adverse to the obje cts of his former client the people of the united states because i discovered the fact that miles eh rlich had undertaken the representation of matters adverse to his former client the pe ople of the united states it is my assessment that it is best to disclose th facts in light of his clie nts and her cohorts continuing pattern of illegal activity my hope is th at by making this information public it will 1 dissuade marcia bruggeman hatch her husb and and their cohorts from continuing their criminal enterprises and attacks on and 2 counteract any effect miles ehrlich and his cohorts have had to impede an investigation of the case by law enforcement authorities the application of crpc rule 3310e is ve ry straightforward in this case because it can be proven 1 miles ehrlich possessed conf idential information of his former client material to the representation of his current cl ients 2 that in obtaining the may 9 2005 criminal matters informati on from miles ehrlichs in volvement was direct and personal and 3 the matters in which he is representing marcia bruggeman hatch and providing advice and counsel to seamus hatc h andor aran strategic fiance llc are substantially related because his criminal fense efforts are centered on harassing and retaliating against the witness and victim who re ported the criminal activity to him in the first place regarding the possibility miles ehrlich obtaine d waiver from the united states prior to undertaking representation of marcia bruggeman hatch et i have information miles ehrlich fully informed th people of the united states or the doj the custodian of the may 9 2005 criminal ma tters information in writing pursuant to cr pc 3310a and that he was provided waiver to re present marcia brugge man hatch and provide advice and counsel to seamus hatc h and aran strategic finance prior to his undertaking such activities moreover section 6068 subdivi sion of the cbpc may in fact have precluded miles ehrlich from making adequate disclosure under crpc 3310a if such disclosure is precluded informed written consent is likewise precluded california law is very clear that without in formed
