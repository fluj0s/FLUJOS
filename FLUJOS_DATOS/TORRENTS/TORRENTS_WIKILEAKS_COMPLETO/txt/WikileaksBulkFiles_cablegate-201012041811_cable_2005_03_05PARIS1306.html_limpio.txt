subject sarkozy watch former foreign minister charette extends ump hand of friendship and cooperation to us classified by ambassador howard leach for reasons 15 b and d 1 c summary in remarkable initiative the new head of international relations of the governing ump party former foreign minister herve charette called on ambassador leach march 1 offering hand of friendship and cooperation charette applauded the positive results of us policies across the middle east on israelpalestine iraq and lebanon and even assigned blame for the embarrassing downturn in relations over iraq to president chirac charette said the ump would like to establish links with both major us political parties and connect with official us visitors to paris as appropriate charettes gesture unprecedented in our memory reportedly came at the behest of ump president sarkozy the views he expressed are just as clearly those of the politician currently best placed to end chiracs tenure as president end summary 2 c former foreign minister herve charette called on ambassador leach march 1 in his capacity as head of international relations of the governing ump party note ump president nicolas sarkozy recently named charette to this position charette is also vicepresident of the foreign affairs committee of the national assembly he served as foreign minister from 1995 to 1997 under prime minister alain juppe charette referring to recent events in the middle east iraq israelpalestine lebanon egypt observed that us policies have prospered the ump applauds these positive results he and the ump also agree with the usg thesis that the middle east is immobile politically because it is immobile economically he cited secretary rices view which he shares that it is necessary to work with the world as it is but we need not accept that it must remain as it is this is view he added that comes more naturally to great power smaller countries generally must accept the hand they have been dealt charette said that this commonality of views had led the ump to the conclusion that it should organize useful relationship with the us charette spoke specifically of reaching out to us political parties to its natural partner the republican party but also to the democrats in addition to contacts with parties the ump would be interested in meeting official visitors to paris as deemed appropriate by the ambassador 3 c commenting further on the current scene charette posited that the relationship with the us is the basis of french foreign relations the last two or three years have been embarrassing charette pointed the finger of blame in one direction the president of the republic went down route that didnt make things any easier note in february 2003 charette was one of only handful of french parliamentarians to warn against french veto of new unsc resolution the ump welcomes the positive turn of recent weeks said charette he put particular stress on recent progress on palestinianisraeli relations returning several times to refrain commonly heard here that this is the key issue for europeanus relations france he said needs to adjust its approach so that it does not always fall on the same ie palestinian side of the road the us which tends to fall on the other side has been right to reproach the palestinians for never being able to control their terrorist movements the second intifada was disastrous for the palestinians for the peace camp in israel and because it encouraged the establishment of more settlements the new palestinian leadership will not be able to escape the need to settle matters with the terrorists the israelis for their part cannot hope to keep 250000 of their own in the palestinian territories the situation is extremely complex said charette requiring all the energy of the us and europe he said he remains extremely anxious about the situation and skeptical it is not at all clear that the conditions for peace are at hand bearing in mind the downward spiral that occurred after promising beginnings in the 1990s 4 c ambassador leach took the opportunity to ask charette his views regarding turkey and the eu given his chairmanship of the francoturkish friendship group in the national assembly charette said that the french people have deep and strong conviction against turkish entry it is feeling that will not disappear over time note this view in contrast to that of president chirac reflects the opposition of ump president sarkozy and the majority of the ump membership leach
