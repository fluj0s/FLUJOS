in the united states through highrisk highreward research in areas of critical national need according to the authorizing legislation nist published the final rule prescribing the policies and procedures for the tip activity on june 25 2008 15 cfr part 296 the intent of the program is to provide grants to small and mediumsized firms for individual projects or joint ventures with other research organizations to undertake work that has the potential for yielding transformational results with farranging or wideranging implications b addresses critical national needs within the national institute of standards and technologys areas of technical competence and c is too novel or spans too diverse range of disciplines to fare well in the traditional peer review process1 small or

laboratories universities or other nonprofit research institutions may be funded for total of up to 9 million over five years competitive meritbased process is to be used to make grants of up to 50 of total project costs the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 provides 652 million with an additional 5 million in unobligated balances from the fy2007 tp appropriation this is 176 less than fy2007 funding for the advanced technology program which tip replaces according to nist the major portion of this fy2008 support will be used to meet previous tp funding commitments the presidents fy2009 budget request does not contain any financial support for tip the fy2009 appropriations bill ordered reported from the house committee on appropriations provides 652 million for the

industry as noted in the conference report to accompany the bill placed within the national institute of standards and technology nist in recognition of the laboratorys ongoing relationship with industry atp provided seed funding to single companies or to industryled consortia of universities businesses andor government laboratories for development of generic broadbased precompetitive technologies that had applications across industries awards based on technical and business merit were for highrisk work past the basic research stage but not yet ready for commercialization market potential was an important consideration in project selection awards were for either product or process technology development individual firms were restricted to funding of 2 million over three years money was to be used only for direct rd costs large firms provided at least 60 of total direct and indirect projects costs small and mediumsized companies were not required to costshare direct costs joint ventures could receive up to five years of financing for any amount limited only by availability in such cases the private sector provided more than 50 of funding while universities and federal laboratories could participate in collaborative work the tp grant was made solely to companies according to nist through the end of 2007 824 projects had been funded of which about 28 were joint ventures approximately 24 billion in federal funds have been matched by 22 billion from the private sector small businesses or cooperative efforts led by such firms made up almost 68 of the awardees the legislation creating tip pl 11069 requires that the director of nist continue to provide support originally awarded under the advanced technology program in accordance with the terms of the original award and consistent with the goals of the technology innovation program continued support for the advanced technology program was major funding issue opponents of the program cited it as prime example of corporate welfare whereby the federal government invests in applied research activities that they emphasize should be conducted by the private sector others defended atp arguing that it assisted businesses and small manufacturers in developing technologies that while crucial to industrial competitiveness would not or could not be developed by the private sector alone the national institute of standards and technol ogy undertook numerous analyses of tp the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office also studied the program in its first evaluation 1994 nist concluded the program had stimulated research that would not have been done without the federal support that rd cycles within companies have been abbreviated and that valuable business alliances had been created 3 however in may 1995 report gao argued that these conclusions can not be adequately substantiated by the information provided in the nist study on which they were based4 acknowledging that it was too early to determine the longterm impact of atp the gao report stated that some of the indicators nist utilized may create false expectations of the programs economic

half and accelerated technological progress within the firm stimulated productive collaborative activities among companies and between firms and universities facilitated commercialization and increased private sector investment in high risk technology development5 an april 2000 progress report reinforced these earlier findings6 this study indicated that participants in 261 projects have identified more than 1200 different applications or uses of the technologies under development and that the majority of these are new solutions to market needs or improvements in existing products or processes product cycles are being reduced and while 24 of respondents said that they would not have undertaken the project without tp funding most others noted that the rd would have been sign ificantly slower without such support nist found that organizations are pursuing different rd than they would have undertaken without atp funding and that this work is more technically advanced and risky the atp financing also stimulated additional private sector money in th technical areas than otherwise would be the case over half of the companies are now able to make new or improved product in march 2000 testimony raymond kammer then director of nist stated that approximately 120 new technologies have been commercialized according to nist more than 60 of tp projects have resulted in commercial products and processes available in the marketplace 7 the concern over whether atp supports projects that could reasonably attract private sector investment has been an issue throughout the life of the program in report examining award winners and near winners during the first four years of atp gao found the program funded both projects that would not have progressed without this federal support and those that would have been financed by the private sector8 half of the awardees stated that they would have continued without atp financing of the near wi nners 50 pursued their efforts in the absence of federal money but took longer to achieve their goals according to gao while 63 of the applicants did not look elsewhere for funds abou t half of the applicants who did were told by prospective funders that their projects were either too risky or precompetitivecharacteristics that fulfill the aims of tp funding respondents also noted that the program facilitated development of joint ventures to pursue tp activities study undertaken by the american enterprise institute concluded that tp has had only limited success in choosing projects that could not raise private sector funds according to the authors this has occurred because companies are not interested in pursuing rd that fails to complement work performed for profit in addition the atp selection criteria focus on commercial sales and job creation not on projects for which there are broad social benefits and insufficient private investment an april 2000 report by gao reinforced by may 26 2005 5 silber and

selection processthe need to guard against conflicts of interest and the need to protect proprietary informationmake it unlikely that tp can avoid funding research already being pursued by the private sector in the same time period9 g3g561g6g146g143g143g142g155g142g151g157g561g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g561 the technology innovation program appears to have been designed to avoid what was seen as government funding of large firms that did not necessarily need federal support for rd activities the committee report to accompany hr 1868 part of which was incorporated into the final legislation stated that tip replaces tp in consideration of changing global innovation environment focusing on small and mediumsized companies the structure of tip also acknowledges the important role universities play in the innovation cycle by allowing universities to fully participate in the program 10 while similar to tp in the promotion of highr isk rd that would be of broadbased economic benefit to the nation there are several differences in the expected operation of the new technology innovation program primarily associat ed with the size of eligible companies financial support under tip is limited to small and mediumsized businesses whereas grants under tp were available to companies regardless of size in addition in the advanced technology program joint ventures were requir ed to include two separately owned forprofit firms and could include universities government laboratories and other research establishments as participants in the project but not as recipients of the grant in the tip initiative joint venture may involve two separately owned forprofit comp anies but may also be comprised of one small or mediumsized firm and university or other nonprofit research institution single company could receive up to 2 million for up to three years under tp under tip the participating company which must be small or mediumsized business may receive up to 3 million over three years in atp small and mediumsized companies were not required to cost share large firms provided 60 of the total cost of the project while in tip there is 50 cost sharing requirement which again only applies to the small and mediumsized businesses that are eligible there were funding limits for the fiveyear funding available for joint ventures under tp the tip limits joint venture funding to 9 million for up to five years the advisory board that was created to assist in the advanced technology program included industry representatives as well as federal government personnel and representatives from other research organizations the advisory board for the technology innovation pr ogram would be comprised of only private sector members

activities are seen by opponents as industrial policy the means by which government rather than the marketplace picks winners and losers instead measur that would occasion better investment environment for industry to expand their innovationrelated efforts would proponents argue be preferable to government funding the current approach including the new technology innovation program involves varied mechanisms to facilitate technological advancement legislation has created body of laws programs and policies that involve both indirect and direct measures to stimulate technology advancement in the private sector indirect incentives include research and experimentation tax credit changes to the antitrust laws to encourage collaborative rd and cooperative manufacturing ventures alterations of patent ownership policies to facilitate governmentindustryuniversity interaction and practices to promote technology transfer direct measures involve among other things federal funding for tip and the small business innovation research program these costshared programs have been supported in part because of what proponents argue is their potential contribution to the countrys national or economic security the elimination of tp and the creation of tip have renewed the debate over the role of the federal government in promoting commercial technology development in arguing for less direct federal involvement advocates believe that the market is superior to government in deciding technologies worthy of investment mechanisms that enhance the markets opportunities and abilities to make such choices are preferred it is suggested that agency discretion in selecting one technology over another can lead to political intrusion and industry dependency on the other hand supporters of direct methods argue that it is important to focus on those technologies that have the greatest promise as determined by industry and supported by matching funds from the private sector they assert that the government can serve as catalyst for cooperation technological progress is important to the nation because of its contribution to economic growth and high standard of living how best to achieve this continues to be debated critics viewed atp as means for federal agency to select commercial firms andor technologies for support they maintained that the absence of marketgenerated decisions will result in technologies that can not be utilized productively by participating companies such program they argue encourages selection of wellwritten proposals rather than assistance for truly important technologies however proponents stressed that tp was market driven and that the technical areas for investment had been developed in conjunction with industry in addition companies were required to put up significant amounts of funding and survive rigorous business review procedures that made the tp different from other federal efforts replacing tp with the technology innovation program may be one response to criticisms that large firms should not be recipients of this form of federal research funding support that should be reserved for small and mediumsized companies which do not have the financial resources available to major corporations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22815g22g145g142g561g22g142g140g145g151g152g149g152 g144g162g561g11g151
