significant role in developing water quality regulations and standards for municipal and industrial water use it historically has provided relatively small percentage of the funding for construction of water supply and treatment facilities for uses yet several programs exist to assist communities with development of water supply and treatment projects and it appears that congress is more frequently being asked to authorize direct financial and technical assistance for developing or treating water supplies for use this report provides background information on the types of water supply and wastewater treatment projects traditionally funded by the federal government and the several existing programs to assist communities with water supply and wastewater recycling and treatment these projects and programs are found primarily with in the department of agriculture usda department of commerce depa rtment of defense dod depa rtment of housing and urban development hud department of the interior doi and the environmental protection agency epa the focus of some programs has been enlarged over the years the department of the interiors bureau of reclamation was established to implement the reclamation act of 1902 which authorized the construction of water works to provide water for irrigation in arid western states congress subsequently authorized other uses of project water including use even so the emphasis of reclamations operations was to provide water for irrigation similarly the us army corps of engineers department of defense constructed large reservoirs primarily for flood control but was authorized in 1958 to allocate water for purposes over the past 30 plus years congress has authorized and refined several programs to assist local communities in addressing other water supply and wastewater problems these programs serve generally different purposes and have different financing mechanisms however there is some overlap federal funding for the programs and projects discussed in this report varies greatly for example congress appropriated 829 million in fy2008 for grants to states under epa s state revolving fund srf loan program for drinking water facilities and 689 million for epa s srf program for wastewater facilities funds appropriated for the usdas rural water and waste disposal grant and loan programs are 535 million for fy

industrial water use it historically has provided relatively small percentage of the funding for construction of water supply and treatment facilities for uses yet several programs exist to assist communities with development of water supply and treatment projects and it appears that congress is being asked more frequently to authorize direct financial and technical assistance for developing or treating water supplies for use recent proposals include rural water supply projects to be built and funded by the bureau of reclamation in the department of the interior hereafter referred to as reclamation water recycling projects built and partially funded by reclamation and programs for water supply and wastewater treatment projects to be largely funded by the us army corps of engineers corps interest also has been growing in expanding the size and scope of the state revolving fund loan programs under the clean water act and the safe drinking water act as well as support for individual wastewater and drinking water projects through congressionally earmarked grants in appropriations legislation this report provides background information on the types of water supply and wastewater treatment projects traditionally funded by the federal government and the several existing programs to assist communities with water supply and wastewater treatment projects developed by reclamation and the corps typically require di rect individual project authorizations from congress in contrast projects funded by othe r agencies are funded through standing program authorizations these programs are found primarily within the department of agriculture usda department of commerce department of housing and urban development hud and the environmental protection agency epa the key practical difference is that with the individual project authorizations there is predictable assistance or even guarantee of funding after project is authorized because funding must be secured each year in the congressional appropriations process the programs on the other hand have set program criteria are generally funded from year to year and provide process under which project sponsors compete for funding for each of the projects and programs discussed this report describes purposes financing mechanisms eligibility requirements and recent funding the report does not address special projects and programs aimed specifically at assisting indian tribes alaskan native villages and colonias 1 or other regional programs such as those associated with the appalachian region or us territories g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the federal government has built hundreds of water projects over the years primarily dams and reservoirs for irrigation development and flood control with use as an incidental self financed project purpose most of the nations public municipal water systems have been built by local communities under prevailing state water laws 1 colonias typically are rural unincorporated communities or ho using developments near the usmexico border that lack some or all basic infrastructure including plumbing and public water and sewer

reclamation act of 1902 which authorized the construction of water works to provide water for irrigation in arid western states congress subsequently authorized other uses of project water including use even so the emphasis of reclamations operations was to provide water for irrigation this emphasis is evidenced in part in the different payment mechanisms that evolved to finance projects described below similarly the us army corps of engineers corps constructed large reservoirs primarily for flood control but was authorized in 1958 water supply act of 1958 72 stat 320 43 usc 390b to allocate water for purposes in this act congress emphasized the primacy of nonfederal interests it is declared to be the policy of the congre ss to recognize the primary responsibilities of the states and local interests in developing water supplies for domestic municipal industrial and other purposes and that the federal government should participate and cooperate with states and local interests in developing such water supplies in connection with the construction maintenance and operation of federal navigation flood control irrigation or multiple purpose projects 43 usc 390b over the past 30plus years congress has authorized and refined several programs to assist local communities in addressing other water supply and wastewater problems the agencies that administer these programs differ in scope and mission for example the primary responsibilities of the corps of engineers are to maintain inland navigation provide for flood and storm damage reduction and restore aquatic ecosystems while epas mission relates to protecting public health and safeguarding the national environment others such as hud and the department of commerce focus on community and economic development likewise the specific programs discussed in this reportwhile all address water supply and wastewater treatmentdiffer in important respects some are national in scope those of usda epa and the department of commerce for example while others are regionally focused reclamations programs and projects some focus primarily on urban areas hud others on rural areas usda and others do not distinguish based on community size epa the corps in addition these programs serve generally different purposes and have different financing mechanisms some provide grants others authorize loans however there is some overlap for example the rural water and waste disposal program of the usda typically author izes water delivery assistance to improve community water systems and water quality while epa s drinking water infrastructure program is driven primarily by end of the pipe water quality requirements of the safe drinking water act sdwa similarly while the clean water act sets performance standards for discharges of municipally treated sewage it also provides financial assistance to municipalities for constructing and improving treatment facilities in order to comply with the law federal funding for the programs and projects discussed in this report varies greatly for example for fy2008 congress appropriated 8290 million for grants to states under epa s state revolving fund srf loan program for drinking water facilities and 6891 million for epas srf program for wastewater treatment facilities funds appropriated for the usdas core rural utilities programs total 535 million for fy2008 hud community deve lopment block grant funds used partly but not exclusively for water and wastewater projects are 36 billion for fy2008 in contrast reclamations title 16 reclamationrecycling program received approximately 236 million for fy2008funding for the entire agency is 12 billion for fy2008 collectively congressional funding for these programs in recent years has been somewhat eroded by overall competition among the many programs that are supported by discretionary spending despite the continuing pressure from stakeholders and others for increased funding

significant source of total funds available to local communities for drinking water and wastewater improvements for example from fy1991 through fy2000 states contributed about 101 billion to match 180 billion in epa capitalization grants for drinking water and wastewater srfs and made about 135 billion available for these activities under statesponsored grant and loan programs and by selling

the construction of water works to provide water for irrigation in arid western states reclamation generally manages numerous municipal and industrial water supply facilities as part of larger multipurpose reclamation projects serving irrigation flood control power supply and recreation purposes overall these facilities serve approximately 31 million people delivering total of approximately 285 million acrefeet of water an acrefoot is enough to cover one acre of land one foot deep or 325851 gallons reclamationfunded municipal and industrial water deliveries total approximately 28 million acrefeet and have more than doubled since 1970 the bureau is authorized to construct projects only in the 17 western states unless otherwise directed by congress reclamation water deliveries are generally incidental to larger project purposes however since 1980 congress has individually authorized construction of several rural water supply projects and more than 30 reclamation wastewater and reuserecycling projects one recycling project has been undertaken pursuant to general authorities the recycling projects discussed below are known as title 16 projects because they were first authorized in 1992 under title 16 of pl 102575 title 16 the reclamation wastewater and groundwater studies and facilities act also authorized reclamation to undertake specific and general feasibility studies for reclamation wastewater and reuse projects and to research construct and operate demonstration projects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30478g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g149g162g561g21g158

reclamation constructed projects with federal funds then established repayment schedule based on the amount of total construction costs allocated to specific project purposes reclamation project authorizations typically re quire 100 repayment with interest for water supply facilities however on some occasions congress has authorized other reimbursement terms for example for the nonindian portion of some reclamation rural water supply projects congress has authorized 1525 repayment levels 85 and 75 federal costshare respectively and in at least one case the perkins county rural water supply system grant of 75 of total project costs the federal share of costs for title 16 projects is generally much lower as it is limited to maximum of 25 of total project costs or for projects authorized since 1996 maximum of 20 million in most cases the federal share for title 16 projects is nonreimbursable resulting in facto grant to local project sponsors

unlike many other programs described in this report reclamation undertakes projects largely at the explicit direction of congress local project sponsors may approach reclamation or the congress with proposals for project construction and funding however project must be authorized by congress before construction may begin because there is program per there are clear and concise eligibility or program criteria two exceptions to this generality are 1 the statutory authority for the title 16 projects title 16 of pl 102575 see discussion below which outlines items to be considered during development of feasibility studies and 2 new statutory authority for creation of rural water supply program pl 109451 3 yet even for these projects congress must authorize construction before it is to

portions of such projects are generally repaid 100 with interest via repayment contracts congress generally has authorized more favorable repayment terms for several rural water supply projects the federal costshare for these projects has averaged 64 but ranges from 15 to 80 for nonindian rural water supply projects 3 although new department of the interior rural water supply program was

largely local responsibility communities particularly rural nd small communities increasingly have come to congress for assistance with water infrastructure since 1992 congress has authorized the corps to assist local communities with municipal water supply and treatment needs not necessarily associated with other corps projects these authorizations have been either for project in specific location or for program for defined geographic area at the corps these projects for municipal water supply and wastewater including treatment and distributioncollection facilities or surface water resource protection and development are called environmental infrastructure the corps involvement in these projects varies according to the specifics of the authorization sometimes the corps is responsible for performing the work under other authorizations the corps uses appropriated funds to reimburse nonfederal sponsors for their work before 1992 the corps generally was not involved with environmental infrastructure projects since 1992 congressional authorization has resulted in the corps contributing to or being authorized to contribute to more than 400 environmental infrastructure projects appropriations however have not kept pace with authorizations only subset of authorized corps environmental infrastructure projects have received appropriations the clinton and bush administrations generally left environmental infr astructure projects out of their corps budget requests the bush administrations fy2009 request continued this trend by seeking funds for studies or construction of environmental infrastructure projects since 1992 congress has added funds to numerous environmental infrastructure projects during its consideration of the presidents request for example the omnibus co nsolidated appropriations act 2008 division c title i pl 110161 included more than 1832 million in appropriations for environmental infrastructure projects since 1992 the corps has received more than 1 billion in appropriations for environmental infrastructure activities water resources development act wrda is the typical legislative vehicle for corps authorizations beginning with sections 219 and 313 of wrda 1992 pl 102580 congress has authorized the corps to assist local interests with technical planning and design and design and construction assistance for environmental infrastructure projects subsequent wrdas authorized new environmental infrastructure projects and raised the funding ceilings and availability of direct grants for many of the projects previously authorized congress also has authorized corps environmental infrastructure act ivities in selected appropriations legislation as with reclamations rural water supply and title 16 projects the future implementation of authorized local infrastructure projects has the potential to create new and perhaps competing mission to the corps traditional navigation flood control and aquatic ecosystem restoration missions because the environmental infrastructure authorizations are generally specific to geographic locations or region are funded individually through congressional appropriations and are not part of national corps program per there are clear andor consistent project or program criteria

to allow use of multipurpose corps reservoirs to allocate excess supplies of stored water to local governments or organizations for municipal and industrial use the water supply act of 1958 does not

this fund is used for loans direct and guaranteed to develop storage treatment purification or distribution of water or collection treatment or disposal of waste in lowincome rural areas loans are repayable in not more than 40 years or the useful life of the facilities whichever is less usda makes either direct loans to applicants or guarantees up to 90 of loans made by thirdparty lenders such as banks and savings and loan associations loan interest rates are based on the communitys economic and health environment and are designated poverty market or intermediate poverty interest rate loans are made in areas where the median household income mhi falls below the higher of 80 of the statewide nonurban mhi or the poverty level and the project is needed to meet health or sanitary standards generally this is the lowest of the three loan interest rates the market rate is adjusted quarterly and is set using the average of specified 11bond index it applies to loans to applicants where the mhi of the service area exceeds the statewide nonurban mhi the intermediate rate applies to loans that do not meet the criteria for the poverty rate and which do not have to pay the market rate generally this rate is less than the market rate as of january 2008 applicable interest rates were poverty 45 intermediate 4375 and market 4375 6 interest rates on guaranteed loans are negotiated between the borrower and the lender water and waste disposal grants grants for the development costs of water supply and waste disposal projects in rural areas also are authorized under the consolidated farm and rural development act only communities with poverty and intermediate rate incomes qualify for usda grants an eligible project must serve rural area that is not likely to decline in population below the level for which the project was designed and constructed so that adequate capacity will or can be made available to serve the reasonably foreseeable growth needs of the area grant funds may be available for up to 75 of the development cost of project and should only be used to reduce user costs to reasonable level grants are only made after determination of the maximum amount of loan that community can afford and still have reasonable user rates grants which typically provide 3545 of proj ect costs may be used to supplement other funds borrowed or furnished by applicants for project costs and may be combined with loans when the applicant is able to repay part but not all of the project costs priority is given to projects serving populations of less than 5500 emergency and imminent community water assistance grants rus also is authorized to help rural residents where significant decline in quantity or quality of drinking water exists or is imminent

in pl 110161 which provided 30 million for watershed and flood prevention operations and 20 million for watershed rehabilitation in previous years the watershed and flood prevention operations appropriation had included numerous instances of congressionally designated funds for specified projects sometimes the total value of these designated grants approached the total appropriation also in previous years limits had been placed on how funding could be spent by limiting the amount available for technical assistance and for carrying out activities related to the endangered species act however in fy2008 congress provided funding for only few specific projects in most years recently the administration regardless of which party controls the white house has requested significant funding reductions which congress has rejected although fy2006 was the first time at least in many years that the administration had called for funding and it has done so each year since then in prior years congress had always responded by appropriating funds usually in amounts that were similar to the preceding year in the late 1980s and early 1990s for example annual appropriations averaged around 160 million although the presidents budget requests were often for lower amounts historically overall watershed funding ultimately has varied great deal from year to year much of this variation is the result of appropriations for the emergency component which is enacted in emergency supplemental appropriations and varies widely from year to year some consider the

prescribes performance levels to be attained by municipal sewage treatment plants in order to prevent the discharge of harmful wastes into surface waters the act also provides financial assistance so that communities can construct treatment facilities in compliance with the law which has the overall objective of restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters in historic terms funding under the clean water act has been the largest federal program for wastewater treatment assistance since 1973 congress has appropriated more than 78 billion in program grants funds are distributed to states under statutory allocation formula and are used to assist qualified projects on priority list that is determined by individual states these funds are used to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs most recently estimated by epa and states at 221 billion nationally for all categories of projects eligible for federal assistance under the law in 1987 congress amended the clean water act pl 1004 and initiated new program of federal capitalization grants to support state water pollution control revolving funds srfs prior to 1989 when the srf program became effective states used their allotments to make grants to cities and other eligible recipients since 1989 federal funds grants of appropriated funds have been used to capitalize state loan pr ograms or srfs with states providing matching funds equal to 20 of the federal funds to capitalize the srf all 50 states plus puerto rico participate in the clean water srf program over the long term the loan programs are intended to be sustained through repayment of loans to states thus creating continuing source of assistance for other communities rural and nonrural commun ities compete for funding rural areas and other small communities have special priority nor are states required to reserve any specific percentage for projects in rural areas nevertheless rural areas are not shut out of the program epa data indicate that since 1989 nationally 63 of all loans and other assistance comprising 23 of all assistance have gone to assist

the safe drinking water act sdwa requires public water systems to comply with federal drinking water regulations promulgated by epa through these regulations epa has set standards to control the levels of approximately 90 contaminants in drinking water and more regulations are under development to help communities meet these federal mandates congress amended the sdwa in 1996 to establish drinking water state revolving fund dwsrf loan program the program is patterned closely after the clean water srf and authorizes epa to make grants to states to capitalize drinking water state revolving loan funds states use their dwsrfs to provide assistance to public water systems for drinking water projects states must match 20 of the federal capitalization grant and develop annual intended use plans that indicate how allotted funds will be used including project priority list the law generally directs states to give funding priority to projects that 1 address the most serous health risks 2 are needed to ensure compliance with sdwa regulations and 3 assist systems most in need on per household basis according to state affordability criteria additionally states must make available at least 15 of their annual allotment to public water systems that serve 10000 or fewer persons to the extent the funds can be obligated to eligible projects in recent years roughly 72 of dwsrf assistance agreements and 37 of funds have gone to these smaller systems capitalization grants are allotted among the states according to the results of the most recent quadrennial survey of the capital improvements needs of eligible water systems needs surveys are prepared by epa and the states and the most recent survey 2003 estimated that public water systems need to invest minimum of 2768 billion over 20years to ensure the provision of safe drinking water and compliance with federal standards g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561g18g158g155g153g152g156g142g561 this stateadministered program

generally must repay the entire loan plus any interest dwsrfs may also be used to buy or refinance local debt obligations to guarantee or purchase insurance for local obligation as source of revenue or security for payment of principal and interest on state revenue or general obligation bonds if the proceeds of the sale of the bonds are deposited into the dwsrf and to earn interest on dwsrf accounts states also may use up to 30 of their annual dwsrf grant to provide additional subsidies eg principal forgiveness and negative interest rate loans to help economically disadvantaged
