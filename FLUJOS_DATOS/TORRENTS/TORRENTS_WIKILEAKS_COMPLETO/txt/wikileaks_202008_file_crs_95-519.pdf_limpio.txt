uniform the fact that many members of our armed forces have engaged in direct battle with an enemy or carried out their duties under enemy attack is certainly si gn of this bravery and courage however the level of heroism usually cited among those who receive the medal of honor is uncommonly high and of qualitatively different magnitude the distinction of this type of valor heroism courage and bravery in an environment where bravery and courage are the norm and must be the norm in order to carry out effective military operations may prove difficult to recognize by the outsidermedal of honor

rson must be proved by incontestable evidence of at least two eyewitnesses it must be so outstanding that it clearly distinguishes his gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms of bravery it must involve the risk of his life and it must be of the type of deed which if he had not done it would not subject him to any justified criticism recommendation for the army or air force medal must be made within 2 years from the date of the deed upon which it depends award of the medal must be made within 3 years after the date of the deed the recommendation for navy medal of honor must be made

basis must have been previously unknown and not considered by the recommending and disa pproving officials the determination of the existence of the new material and substantive information being

while the actions are fresh in the minds of the witnesses the process for restoration of rescinde d medal of honor is different since the rescissions during world war i ot her moh awards have been rescinded however if request for restoration of moh were made the process would be different than the procedures noted above for those seeking restoration of the medal of honor an appeal must be considered by the appropriate board for correction of military records this appeal is requested via the president member of congress or the secretary of defense if the board recommends reinstatement the decision is passed to the service secretary and then ultimately to the president presentation of the moh when practical presentation of the moh shall be made by the president of the united states as cinc commanderinchief in formal ceremony in washington dc as suc h premature public disclosure of information concerning recommendations processing nd approval or disapproval actions is potential source of embarrassment to those recommended and the government additionally in the case of approved recommendations it could diminish the impact of ceremonies at which the presen tation is made therefore to prevent premature disclosure the policy of the department is not to comment on any moh case under consideration accordingly the processing of moh recommendations shall be handled on for

congressional and other efforts to award the medal of honor generally speaking the originating request for military awards including the moh is made by the military commander or other appropriate uniformed personnel those on the scene andor those familiar with military operations are often considered to be in the best position to observe the individual actions and make the recommendation for award it is considered appropriate therefore that military personnel that is those familiar with hum an behavior under the stress of combat situations make the originating recommendations regarding

have offered numerous bills for this purpose much of this legislation takes the form of extensiv findings detailing the background situation and exploits concerned where important special mention may

and when forwarded to the services varies depending on whether the individual was originally recommended for the medal of honor or in certain cases had already r eceived the medal versus those instances in which original recommendation was made generally speaking the services will not favorably consider awarding the moh unless the individual was originally r ecommended but did not receive the award because of extenuating circumstances g the paperwork was lost and only rediscovered allegations exist that th individuals award was downgraded for reasons of racism etc in nearly every case specific findings of fact are required that the individual was originally reco mmended or that the downgrade occurred under questionable but verifiable circumst ances in these cases review may be undertaken by the board of correction for military records bcmr of the appropriate military department following the findings of the bcmr the decision is then passed to appropriate authorities for further andor final consideration this approach has not usually been successful in cases where original recommendation has been made extensive and reliable findings of valid facts must be presented in these instances since there is original record to correct the bcmr is not necessarily involved in the consideration process without an orig inal recommendation f actual data supporting the award and compelling reasons for it to be awarded at later date it is very unlikely that the moh will be awarded this is particularly so given that great deal of time has often passed and eyewitn esses cannot

medal recipients of her day specific act of heroism was cited for receiving it17 under the review panels considerations dr walkers award was st ricken because she was not member of the armed forces

congress and president carter contacted the department of defense on th matter the army board for corrections of military records ruled with one dissent that the decision to rescind the award was unjust although the board noted that if it had not been for her sex she would have been given commission and her actions would have been those of soldier specific act of gallantry or heroism wa s noted in 1977 her medal was restored the restoration of the meda l remains highly contentious among both proponents and opponents of this action18 on september 12 1980 president cart er awarded

was later named in hi s honor legislative and other efforts to upgrade the navy cross to the medal of honor have proven unsuccessful noting that at the time blacks received the medal of honor durin g wwii critics cite racism as main reason for re fusing seaman miller this honor the reluctance to upgrade awards to the medal of honor or to award it outright is generally based on efforts to award the medal to those truly deserving to maintain the integrity of the award itself and the awards process in general and to avoid opening the floodgates to retroactive requests for this and other awards and decorations this reluctance has led many to feel that the system of awarding medals is overly restrictive and that certain individuals are denied earned medals it is noteworthy that two moh awards

could well mean that the individual who performed the act of heroism would be in eligible for the meda l because of time on making recommendations third congress waived the time requirements and other restrictions and the asked the secretary of the army and the secretary of the navy to review the records relating to the award of the distingu ished service cross and navy cross respectively awarded to asian americans or native american pacific islanders who served during world war ii29 the purpose of this review is to determine whether such awards should be upgra ded to the medal of honor the reasoning for this review is based on claims of discrimination that confronted americans of asian descent during the war for example many americans of japanese descent were relocated to internment camps during the war on october 12 1998 it was reported that ar my historians had completed two year search for asian american recipients of the distinguished service cross dsc the names of 104 recipients including nator daniel k inouye were forwarded to board of senior officers this board is to consider if any of the forwarded recipients meet the criteria for an upgrade to moh according to the report the army anticipates the board will recomme nd approximately ten recipients for upgrading the list of those considered worthy of upgrading is then submitted to the president for final consideration the na vy has determined th at its sole asian american dsc recipient did not merit upgrading proponents of the review upgrading view this process as an over due recognition of the heroics of these individuals long delayed by racism critics contend that the process is an act of racebased political correctness that diminishes the value of the medal30 finally congress included
