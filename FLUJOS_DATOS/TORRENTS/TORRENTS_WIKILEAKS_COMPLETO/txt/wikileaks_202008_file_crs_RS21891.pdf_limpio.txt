provisions in hr 4840 are in tended to assist business taxpayers first the bill would amend the expensing provisions in irc 179 under current law certain business assets that w ould otherwise be depreciable are allowed to be deducted in the year the property is placed in service ie expensed special provisions apply for taxable years 2002 to 2006 that allow taxpayer s to claim larger ductions and increase the number of taxpayers who qualify for the deduction the bill would extend the expiration date of these special provisions from 2006 to 2008 second the bill would change the accounting rules in irc 448 under current law taxpayers may use the cash method of accounting if they meet certain criteria eligiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21891crs2 2 see revenue ruling 200372taxpayers include businesses with average gross receipts over threeyear period of less than 5000000 the bill would adjust the 5000000 limit for inflation finally the bill would remove various corporate tax provisions that are longer operative this would include deleting re ferences to repealed programs or acts eliminating transitional rules that are longer applicable and removing references to dates that are sufficiently in the past that their inclusion in the statues would longer appear to be relevant the bill would include savings provision so that any amendment removing provision would generally be disr egarded if it would affect the businesss future tax liabi lity as it relates to events that occurred before the bills enactment eg liability relating to property acquired or transactions that occurred before the bills enactment hr 4841 the provisions in hr 4841 are in tended to simplify various tax laws that apply to individual taxpayers first the bill would codify rule for determining when an individual attains his or her next age numerous provisions in the irc use an individuals age as criterion for eligibility or to determine whether the provision applies to the taxpayer in some situations the internal revenue service irs determines that an individual has attained an age according to his or her birthday2 however in other situations the irs uses the common law rule that an individual attains an age on the day before his or her birthday the bill would generally require that the individuals actual birthday be used the bill would also rename the filing status of head of household to single head of household another provisi on would allow more taxpayers to file tax returns using the shorter versions of form 1040 fo rms 1040ez and 1040a currently one reason that taxpayer will not qualify to file either short form is if he or she has more than 50000 in taxable income the bill would increase the threshold to 100000 and adjust this amount for inflation like hr 4840 hr 4841 includes numer ous amendments that would delete obsolete language in the irc hr 4841 w ould amend various irc sections that affect individual taxpayers by dele ting references to repealed acts eliminating inoperative transitional rules and removing references to dates that are longer necessary hr 4841 also includes savings provision that is identical to that in hr 4840
