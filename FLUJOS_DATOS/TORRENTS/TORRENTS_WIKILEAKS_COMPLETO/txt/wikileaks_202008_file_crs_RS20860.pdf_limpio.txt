february 27 2001 the supreme court handed down its decision in whitman v american trucking associations challenge to epas promulgation in 1997 of revised national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulates under the clean air act on the broader issues the court ruled that 1 the acts provisions governing the setting of primary healthp rotective ambient standards did not transgress the nondelegation doctrine moribund constitutional principle that the court below had resurrected and 2 the act bars epa from considering implem entation costs when it sets primary national ambient standards on narrow issue the court held that epa had not been justified in promulgating its ozone implementation plan in applying only the acts nonattainmentarea subpart of general application rather than subpart specific to ozone nonattainment as result the court charged the agency with developing reasonable interpretation accommodating both subparts such accommodation is likely to prove difficult task however and almost certainly once adopt ed will generate further legal challenges on february 27 2001 the supreme court handed down its eagerly awaited decision in whitman v american trucking association s1 the case stems from epas controversial promulgation in 1997 of revised national ambient air quality standards naaqss for ozone and particulates under the clean air act caa more

constit utional limits on congressional delegation to agencies of standardsetting authority background naaqss lie at the very heart of the clean air act these standards prescribe maximum pollutant concentrations for groundlevel outdoor air and have been promulgated by epa for six pollutants2 including ozone and particulates the naaqss determine the stringency of emission limits that each state must impose on individual stationary sources of the six pollutants to achieve the naaqss within its borders naaqss come in two forms primary naaqss protect the public health while secondary naaqss protect the public welfare nonpublic health effects3 once naaqs has been promulgated epa must review it and the criteria documents on which it is based every 5 years and make such revisions as may be appropriate4 in 1997 epa revised the naaqss for ozone and particulate matter making them stricter given the perceived impact of these more stringent standards on the economy it was unsurprising that numerous legal challenges were brought with two members of congress rep bliley and sen hatch filing as amici on the side of the challengers pursuant to caa requireme nt the suit was filed in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in may 1999 the dc circuit ruled 21 that various deficiencies in epas promulgation of the two naaqss required that they be sent back to epa for further consideration5 among other things the twojudge majority held that epas reading of the caa section governing the setting of primar naaqss gave the agency too much discretion and thus violated the constitutional nondelegation doctrine it also rejected industrys position that epa in arriving at primary naaqss may consider the costs of implementation finally it ruled that epa could not enforce its revised primary naaqs for ozone owing to its being an eighthour standard rather than the onehour standard envisioned by caa nonattainmentarea provisions added to the act in 1990 see further discussion on page 4 five months later the threejudge panel made minor modifications in its opinion but the full court refused to grant rehearing banc all the judges of the court sitting6 in may 2000 the supreme court took the case7 what the supreme court said the supreme court in american trucking gave epa unanimous victory on the two major issues in the case consideration of costs and nondelegation doctrine justice scaliahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20860crs3 8 42 usc 7409b1authored the opinion of the court with various justices writing separate concurrences to note differences as to rationale but not as to holding consideration of costs the court affirmed the dc circuit decision which in turn had endorsed existing case law of the circuit in holding that when promulgating primary naaqss or revised primary naaqss epa may not consider the costs of implementing the new standard health impacts and health impacts alone are to be the touchstone the governing standard in the statute the court said made this clear section 109b1 instructs epa to set primary naaqss the attainment and maintenance of which are requisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety8 industrys arguments that considerations other than the health impacts of pollutants were cognizable could not overcome the directness of the above statutory text for example industry contended that very stringent naaqs might close down whole industries thereby impoverishing the workers dependent on that industry and in turn reducing their health healthbased standard such as the primary naaqs should include these indirect impacts industry asserted the court however pointed to numerous other caa sections where congress had explicitly allowed consideration of economic factors concluding that had it intended to allow such factors under section 109b1 it would have been more forthright particularly given the centrality of the naaqs concept to the caas regulatory scheme looking for such forthright textual commitment of authority for epa to consider costs the court found none its conclusion section 109b1 unambiguously bars cost considerations from the naaqssetting process nondelegation doctrine the most controversial portion of the dc circuits majority opinion was its embrace of longmoribund constitutional principle known as the nondelegation doctrine this separationofpowers doctrine derives from article i of the constitution which vests all legislative powers in congress not surprisingly the supreme court reads this vesting provision loosely recognizing that congress routinely delegates quasilegislative powers to nonarticle i bodies in particular congress frequently commits to the specialized expertise of executivebranch agencies the task of rulemaking in technical areas such as air pollution control the nondelegation doctrine says that such delegations pass constitutional muster only if congress gives the agency an intelligible principle to guide its exercise of that authority the majority opinion below found that epa had construed caa section 109 so loosely as to render it an unconstitutional delegation the court agreed with the factors used by the agency to assess the public health threat posed by air pollutants but it said epa had articulated intelligible principle for translating the factors into particular naaqs nor is one apparent from the statute given that both ozone and particulates are nonthreshold pollutants adverse health effects occur at any concentration above zero some public health threat has to be tolera ted if epa is to avoid shutting down entire industries the agency in the courts view had articulated standard for determining how much in invoking the nondelegation doctrine the dc circuit drew considerable attention it was the first time in 65 years that the nondelegation doctrine had been successfully usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20860crs4 9 the supreme court also soundly rejected the dc circuits view that an unconstitutionally standardless delegation of power can be remedie d by the agencys adoption of an interpretation confining its own discretion congress it said must lay down the intelligible principleand raised serious implications for how congress delegates standardsetting authority to agencies generally commentators pointed to other federal statutes such as the corps of engineers wetlands permitting program under the clean water act and the rulemaking authority conferred by the occupational safety and health act as vulnerable to nondelegationdoctrine challenge should the dc circuit be affirmed on appeal the supreme court however reversed the scope of discretion allowed by section 109b1 the court said is well within the outer limits of our nondelegation precedents under section 109b1 primary naaqss are to set at levels requisite to protect public health requisite being argued by the united states and accepted by the court as meaning sufficient but not more than necessary to be sure acknowledged the court more guidance must be furnished the agency when the agency action is to have broad scope as here where the revised naaqss affect the entire us economy but even for sweeping regulatory schemes the court disclaimed any demand that statutes provide determinate criterion for saying precisely how much of the regulated harm is too much epa may therefore be allowed discretion to determine how much of public health threat from ozone and particulates recall they are nonthreshold pollutants it will tolerate at nonzero levels9 issues involving implementation of the revised ozone naaqs epa lost again unanimously on two issues arising from its policy for implementing the revised ozone naaqs in nonattainment areas first the court rejected epas argument that the policy did not constitute final agency action ripe for review the court then proceeded to the second issue which caa provisions govern the ozone nonattainmentarea implementation policy this calls for some background the caa imposes restrictions on nonattainment areas over and above those that the act imposes generally these additional nonattainmentarea restrictions are found in title i part d of the statute subpart 1 of title d contains general nonattainment regulations that apply to every pollutant for which naaqs exists subpart 2 of part d addresses ozone in particular the dispute before the court was whether subpart 1 alone or rather subpart 2 or some combination of subparts 1 and 2 controls the implementation of the revised ozone naaqs in nonattainment areas epa in its implementation policy took the former subpart1only course the problem it faced was that subpart 2 contemplated 1hour ozone naaqs reflecting the ozone standard existing when subpart 2 was enacted in 1990 the revised ozone naaqs however embodied an 8hour standard thus some subpart 2 provisions in particular the nonattainmentare classification scheme that identified the requirements to be imposed depending on an areas degree of nonattainment did not fit the new ozone naaqs the court found that epa could not ignore subpart 2 entirely as it had done whatever awkwardness of fit results from applying subpart 2 to the new ozone standard it cannot said the court justify rendering subpart 2s carefully designed restrictions on epa discretion utterly nugatory once new standard has been promulgated one example of the discretionlimiting nature of subpart 2 under subpart 1 epa may extendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20860crs5 10 mistretta v united states 488 us 361 372 1989attainment dates for as long as 12 years under subpart 2 only 2 years though subpart 2s attainment deadlines stretch from 3 to 20 years depending on the severity of an areas ozone pollution the court left it to epa to develop reasonable interpretation of the caas nonattainment implementation provisions for the revised ozone naaqs legal commentary as to the nondelegation issue in american trucking epa had gone to the supreme court with the stronger arguments it was not foregone conclusion however that epa would win unanimously as it did even though the court had on many occasions sustained federal statutes containing standards as loose as or looser than that in the caa governing naaqs setting few justices voting for at least some resuscitation of the nondelegation doctrine was widely deemed possibility on the ground that the court in other areas recently has revealed an interest in cabining congressional power and discretion and not only when the federalstate balance is implicated though it has been 66 years since the last successful nondelegationdoctrine challenge the court has not hesitated to reverse longst anding patterns in its constitutional jurisprudence when doing so furthered the agenda of contingent of the justices very likely the courts refusal to bring back the nondelegation doctrine stemmed in part from the courts view that in our increasingly complex society replete with ever changing and more technical problems congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives10 moreover the task of rewriting federal statutes necessitated by reinvigorated nondelegation doctrine might be one of daunting magnitude from the environmental area to antitrust to civil rights federal laws abound that give agencies only the broadest of guidance likewise epa had the better argument when it came to inclusion of costs in the setting of naaqss as critic of using legislative history to divine the meaning of statutes justice scalia restricted his analysis for the court to examination of the statutory text itself but the concurrence by justice breyer reveals legislative history from the enactment of the 1970 caa that sides unambiguously with epas keepcostsout position for the foregoing issues then the american trucking decision largely restores the status quo as before the filing of this case lax jurisprudence under the nondelegation doctrine and the impermissibility of considering costs in setting naaqss are once again regarded as relatively settled law some commentators have noted the courts refusal in american trucking to defer to epas interpre tation of the caa on ozone standard implementation and speculated that the legacy of the decision may lie in its signalling desire by the court to lessen the degree of judic ial deference to agency decisionmaking but it is premature as yet to draw this conclusion remaining issues the courts decision in whitman v american trucking is not the end of court proceedings in the case numerous issues remain before the dc circuit and epas next attempt at an implementation plan may also be subject to court challenge httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20860crs6 11 national ambient air quality standards for ozone final rule 62 fed reg 38856 38858 1997 quoted in whitman at 121 s ct 903 918 12 121 s ct 903 918developing an implementation plan that embodies reasonable interpretationof the acts nonattainment implementation provisions for the revised ozone naaqs as the court mandated is not an easy task epa has said that an 8hour standard of 009 ppm would have generally represented the continuation of the old level of protection11 but the new standard is in fact set at more stringent level of 008 ppm thus the statutes classification system contains gap that does not address areas with readings of 008 009 ppm second problem relates to the setting of attainment dates in the 1990 amendments congress was specific in setting dates of attainment that ranged from 320 years from the date of enactment depending on the severity of an areas ozone pollution the court read this specificity as denying epa its previous broad discretion in setting attainment dates but three of the acts deadlines for marginal moderate and serious ozone nonattainment areas have already passed how epa is to respond to this is unclear the court itself noted that the acts method for calculating attainment dates seems to make sense for areas that are first classified under new standard after november 15 199012 in these circumstances it would seem likely that whatever approach epa may take will be subject to challenge by parties opposed to the new standards with the potential for several additional years of litigation before the issues are resolved whether congress should intervene to settle these matters is possibility that few have discussed while logical in many respects such legislative clarification would open number of issues regarding the level of the new standards the implementation measures to be required and the nature of epas standardsetting authority that interested parties may not wish to have legislated
