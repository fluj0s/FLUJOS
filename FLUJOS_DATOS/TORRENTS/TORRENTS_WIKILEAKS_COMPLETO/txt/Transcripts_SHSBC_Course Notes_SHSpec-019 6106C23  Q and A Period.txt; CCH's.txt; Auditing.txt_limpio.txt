6106c23 shspec19 q and period cchs auditing many people dont see objects theyve been looking at facsimiles of the objects when the facsimile asises the wall looks bright such people tend to have bad depth perception because they never see anything they are easily invalidated because the reason hes making and looking at facsimiles is that the physical universe isnt safe for him the auditor begins to be real as the pc sees that he can duplicate him so if the auditor indicates eg on cchs 3 or 4 you didnt do it the auditor ceases to be real and the pc will put pictures of him up instead overrunning the process tells the pc that he was wrong to think hed got it this makes auditing unsafe the purpose of the cchs is to make the auditor the physical universe and present time real to the pc to show him he can observe the auditor the room and pt his havingness on otherdeterminism is very low the cchs remedy it he sees somebody else exists and the universe is here you can run cchs wrong by making the pc aware that the auditor and the room are real but dangerous when running child take account of the childs shorter attention span if its biting run it at least an hour before youd expect it to flatten exteriorization as done in 19525 was unstable lrh found that before thetan could get along without body he had to be able to have body and people who exteriorize easily generally want nothing to do with one philosophies that strive for peace are covert operation towards making people succumb spots of sudden change of pace are spots which brake persons life theyve got upsets in them and advice to take it easy and from then on it goes wrong they were asked to confront motionlessness which is most difficult to do medicine and psychiatry gave drugs etc to make person be quiet unless person can confront motion hes dead he cant confront life cant work and will become criminal the natural consequence of adopting motionless philosophy is to get religion peaceful one if you enforce nomotion on someone and make him think motion is bad hell get buddhistic road safety campaigns make sense because they emphasize going slowly less motion not keeping unsafe drivers off the roads or putting freight on trains the more you make population motionless the higher the crime rate tv corrupts the youth because it pins child motionless not because of the tv material the theory that people get seasick because of motion led lrh to think one should have pictures of very still scenes to counteract this he chose some thought about it and started to feel seasick he realized that whats needed is pictures of motion to accustom them to motion not motionlessness the cure for motion is motion not stillness philosophies of motion dont necessarily mean criminality eg space opera if you could keep it up with rest you might manage to be ok when you become incapable of handling the motion of life you can then start to experience pain the experience of pain comes about because of intolerance of motion you can run motion or nomotion to handle this situation predictable motion is better from the pcs viewpoint than unpredictable motion because with unpredictable motion he doesnt know what to confront when he gets the idea that its bad not to be able to confront everything at once he starts to butter all over the universe stick on the track etc also whenever person gets hit hard by life or as soon as he begins program to coerce people into working harder that person will obsessively start producing production follows defeat as in germany japan etc someone whos been defeated will produce more bank than someone whos doing well so in eradicating on the one hand persons intolerance of motion and on the other hand his failures or defeats you are causing his bank to disappear the first can be done by cchs the second by goals running everything becomes cure for past failures every goal is consequence of not having done we dont erase the bank the person gets accustomed to not needing one the person himself takes over the automaticities of beingness identities doingness creation and havingness most havingness is the result of defeat and the whole cure sequence where nearly everything in the universe is cure for past failures every goal also is the result of not having done so we get intolerance of motion feelings of defeat ability to have without having defeated anything if you can remedy those things for someone youve produced new being who is not the same as an old being whos never had the experience his knowingness of whats happened doesnt leave him but his knowledge of the consequences of what hes done lets him emerge as veteran of campaigns unscarred by his battles tough and capable that which strips all games from the universe would normally result in motionlessness but how about ending certain games for somebody who doesnt have the consequence of ending in motionlessness youve broadened the persons view of games he can play this gives him more games not less play is delusory motion about which youre not supposed to be serious so youre not supposed to asis it so person gets trapped in it because its not real play is dishonest doingness work is not serious activity person can work at sport and have fun as his job also if you dont just do what you are doing but put an i should be doing something else in youll stick in it if one just did what he did when he did it he wouldnt get stuck in it morality is nowimsupposedto which makes people not willing to do what theyre doing when they do wrong so they never asis their wrong acts so they continue to do them its certainty then that one gets persistence of the things he doesnt want or tanglement of the things he does want then he wonders why he feels odd so auditing is straightening someone out so he has tolerance for motion and motionlessness and can have what he should have or not as the case might be as he wishes to do that you have to erase all the oddities of doingness all the pain and boredom of motion or nomotion the prehav scale disentangles all the doingnesses but if you make the pc intolerant of motion or be motionless when he cant or give him failures in auditing or dont make it duplicative so he cant have then you reverse the process goals are to large extent do something else or nowimsupposedto if the individual isnt doing anything he simply isnt doing anything there should be nowimsupposedto superimposed upon the situation
