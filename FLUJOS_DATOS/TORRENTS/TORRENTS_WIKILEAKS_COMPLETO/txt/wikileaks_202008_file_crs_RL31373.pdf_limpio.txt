under the immigration and nationality act ina as amended1 immigrants are aliens who are lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence they are also referred to as legal permanent residents lprs they either arrive in the united states with immigrant visas issued abroad and become lprs upon admission or they adjust their immigration status to permanent resident status in the united states adjustment of status is the process under immigration law by which an eligible alien in the united states obtai ns lpr status without leaving the country most aliens who become lprs are eligible for that status on the basis of close family relationship to us citizen or lpr familysponsored immigration job skills needed by us employer employmentbased immigration or humanitarian circumstances familysponsored and em ploymentbased permanent immigration are both subject to complex set of numerical limits and preference categories2 among familysponsored immigrants only the immediat relatives of us citizens minor children spouses and parents if the citizen is at least age 21 are admitted outside the preference system and are not subject to direct numerical limits within the familysponsored preference system there ar four preference categories first preference for example is given to the unmarried adult sons and daughters of us citizens employmentbased immigration is subject to similar ranked system with five preference categories within the employmentbased preference system aliens who are members of the professions with dvanced degrees and aliens of exceptional ability for example may petition unde r the second preference category the process of becoming an lpr on the basis of either family relationship or job skills has multiple steps in the case of prospective familysponsored immigrant the sponsoring family member must first file an immigrant visa petition on behalf of the alien with the immigration and naturalization service ins if the petition is approved the state department then must determine if visa number is immediately available to the alien because of the numerical limits and their allocation among the various preference categories and count ries of origin it can takehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31373crs2 3 under current procedures aliens adjusting st atus in the united states are not subject to background checks by state department official s but must satisfy ins officials in the united states that they are admissible 4 parole is the discretionary authority gran ted to the attorney general under the ina to continuedmany years between the time familyspons ored immigrant petition is filed and visa number becomes immediately available to an alien when visa number becomes immediately available the alien can apply for assignment of visa number aliens who are outside the united states mu st go to us consulate or embassy in their country of origin to complete the pr ocessing aliens within the united states when visa number becomes immediately available may be able to apply to adjust status here as discussed below the process for prospective employmentbased immigrants is similar but may require an additional step at the beginning of the process in some preference categories before an employer can file an immigrant petition on behalf of an alien the employer must first apply for labor certification from the us department of labor dol labor certification reflect s finding by dol that there are not sufficient us workers available to perform the work and that the employment of alien workers will not advers ely affect the wages and wo rking conditions of similarly employed us workers the visa process for employmentbased immigrants is the same as for familysponsored immigrants due to some r ecent changes in the employmentbased preference system however these immigrants have not been experiencing waits for visa numbers admissibility the ina 212 enumerates grounds of inadmissibility grounds upon which aliens are ineligible for vi sas and admission they include security and terrorism related grounds immigration law violations and public ch arge the likelihood that an alien will require public support some grounds of inadmissibility may be waived by the attorney general as specified in the ina as part of the process of becoming an lpr familysponsored and employmentbased immigrants like all aliens seeking legal admission to the united states must be found to be admissible to the country they must satisfy state department consular officials abroad that they are not ineligible for visas

report on the fy1995 cjs appropria tions bill the nate appropriations committee explained the rationale behind the new 245i according to the committee the requirement that unauthorized aliens obtain their visas abroad was originally designed to dissuade liens from circumventing normal visa requirements and entering the united states before their visas became available the committee concluded however that this process has not provided the intended deterrent effect and merely creates consul ar workload overseas as aliens in the united states travel abroad to obtain visas6 ins published an interim rule in october 1994 to implement 245i7 i n information accompanying the rule the agency echoed the senate appropriations committees view that the existing requirements had burdened consular officials abroad ins also identified burden pl aced on the intending immigrants while at the same time characterizing them as immigration law violators it seemed to suggest that 245i struck balan ce

beneficiaries consideration of 245i extension bills by the 107th congress prompted questions about how many unauthorized aliens had adjusted status under past extensions and how many might be eligible to adjust under the thenpending proposals similar questions can be expected if the 108th congress takes up 245i legislation as discussed be low it is not possible using currently available ins data to determine the number of aliens who benef itted from past extensions of 245i ins however does have some recent if limited data re levant to discussion of 245i according to ins in fy 2001 it received total of about 640000 adjustment of status applications of these some 215000 we re filed under 245i20 ins does not have data on 245 i application approvals problems arise in attempting to tie these 215000 fy2001 245i adjustment applicants to particular extension of 245i given the multistep process of obtaining lpr status it is not known how many of the fy2001 applicants were covered by the current april 30 2001 dead line for the filing of immigrant petitions or labor certification appli cations and how many were covered by prior deadlines as explained above filing deadlines apply only to the filing of the initial petitions or applications by sponsors after the f iling of immigrant petitions beneficiaries must wait sometimes for many years for the petitions to be approved and for visa numbers to become immediately available to them before they can file adjustment of status applications in light of these time lags it seems reasonable to assume that many of the unauthorized alie n beneficiaries of petitions or applications received by ins in fy2001 were filed by aliens c overed by the january 14 1998 deadline that preceded the current deadline and that many of the beneficiaries of the current april 30 2001 filing deadline may not show up in in s statistics on adjus tment application receipts until fy 2002 or later with respect to the 245i extension provision

section 245i is cont roversial immigration provi sion and arguably has become more so in the wake of the septem ber 11 terrorist attacks supporters argue that 245i bestows special rights and onl benefits aliens w ho are eligible for legal permanent residency on the basis of family or employment ties they characterize it as practical humane profamily measure that enables prospective immigrants present in the united states to remain with their families while they go through the long process of becoming lprs in addition proponents argue that 245i prevents disruptions to the economy by enabling these prospective immigrants to continue performing their jobs more broadl 245i supporters maintain that it is in the national interest to fully integrate resident prospective immigrants into society opponents characterize 245i as an amnest and maintain that it rewards those who violate immigration laws they ar gue that it undermines immigration law generally and iiriras 3 and 10 year bar provision see above in particular which was intended to deter illegal presence they further argue that 245i promotes fraud as unauthorized aliens ter sham relationships in order to take advantage of the provision opponents contend that 245i and the expectation of future extensions encourages illegal immigration by giving aliens tangible incentive to enter the country illegally rather than wait overseas to complete the visa process they maintain that this is unfair to prospective immigrants overseas who follow proper procedures and endure long waits nd separations from th eir families in order to enter the united states legally since september 11 both supporters and opponents of 245 i have cited security and terrorismrelated concerns in making their arguments supporters point out that beneficiaries of 245i are subj ect to background checks more generally they maintain that in the absence of 245 i many unauthorized aliens would choose to remain underground subject to ch ecks and representing potential security threats opponents counter that the background checks performed on 245i applicants in the united states are not as comprehensive as those performed on visa applicants abroad where state department officials also check for criminal records in the applicants home countries they contend 245i is possible avenue for potential terrorists to legalize their immigration status
