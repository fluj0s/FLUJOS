divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30967national missile defense russias reaction summary in the late 1990s the united states be gan to focus on the possible deployment of defenses against longrange ballistic missiles the planned national missile defense nmd system would have ex ceeded the terms of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty recognizing this the c linton administration sought to convince russia to modify the terms of the treaty but russia was unwilling to accept any changes to the treaty it also decried the us plan to deploy nmd insisting that it would upset strategic stability and start new arms race russia claimed that the abm treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability and that without its limits on missile defens the entire framework of offensive arms control agreements could collapse furthermore russia argued that us nmd system would undermine russias nuclear terrent and upset stability by allowing the united states to initiate an attack and protect itself from retaliatory strike the clinton administration claimed that the us nmd system would be directed against rogue nations and would be too limited to intercept russian attack but russian officials questioned this argument they doubted that rogue nations would have the capability to attack us territory for some time and they believed that the united states could expand its nmd system easily furthermore they argued that when combined with the entirety of us c onventi onal and nuclear weapons an nmd system would place the united states in position of strategic superiority during the clinton administration and first year of the bush administration russian officials stated that if the united states withdrew from the abm treaty and deployed an nmd russia would withdraw from range of offensive arms control agreements furthermore russia could deploy multiple warheads on its icbms to overcome us nmd or deploy new in termediaterange miss iles or shorterrange nuclear systems to enhance its military capabilities russia has also outlined diplomatic and cooperative military initiatives as alternatives to the deployment of us nmd russia has proposed that the international community ne gotiate global missile nd missile technology non proliferation regime as means to discourage nations from acquiring ballistic missiles it has also suggested that it would cooperate with nations in europe to develop and deploy defenses against theat errange ballistic missile s many analysts believe this proposal was designed to win support among us llies for russias opposition to the us nmd program us fficials expressed an interest in the idea but said it could not substitute for fenses against longerrange missiles the clinton administration sought to address russias concerns by offering continued support to the funda mental principles of the abm treaty and by seeking to convince russia that the us nmd sy stem would remain too limited to threaten russias nuclear deterrent the bush admin istration in st has supported more robust missile defenses but it also has stated that they will not be directed against russias offensive forces the president has indicated that the united states will need to move beyond the limits in the abm treaty but he suggested that russia join the united states in developi ng new strategic framework

during the latter years of the clinton presidency the united states began to focus on the possible deployment of defenses against longrange ballistic missiles the administration and many missile defense supporters claimed that the united states needed to pursue national missile defenses nmd because rogue nations such as north korea iran and iraq mig ht soon acquire longer range missiles that could strike us territory and the united states could not be certain that the threat of offensive retaliation would deter these unpredictable actors the clinton administration realized that its plans for nmd would exceed the limits imposed by the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty between the united states and soviet union consequently the administra tion opened discussions with russia in an effort to negotiate amendments to the treaty that would permit the deployment of limited nmd system russian officials consistently and rep eatedly insisted that the 1972 abm treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability this is defined on page 4 they argued that any changes to the treaty that permitted the deployment of defenses against long range ballistic missiles woul d undermine international st rategic stability upset the nuclear balance established by the treaty and interfere with russias nuclear deterrent capabilities during talks with the clinton administration russia refused to accept any modifications to the abm treaty that would pe rmit national missile defenses and campaigned against the us po licy at meetings with other nations and international organizations russia also offered alternatives suggesting that the united states russia and the international community address emerging missile threats with diplomacy and arms control measures that would seek to stop the proliferation of new threats and with cooperation on theaterra nge ballistic missile defenses to address those threats that did emerge this report provides deta iled review of russias r eaction to us

the negotiations united states arms control and disa rmament agency washington dc 1990background the abm treaty the united states and soviet union signed the treaty on the limitation of anti ballistic missile systems abm treaty in may 1972 this treaty prohibits the deployment of abm systems for the defense of the nations territory or an individual region or defenses that can provide the base for such defense it permits each side to deploy limited abm systems at two locations one centered on the nations capital and one at location containing icbm silo launchers 1974 protocol further limited each nation to one abm site locat ed either at the nations capital or around an icbm deployment area each abm site can contain more than 100 abm launchers and 100 abm intercep tor missiles the treaty so specifies that in the future any radars that provide early warning of strategic ballistic missile attack must be located on the periphery of the nati onal territory and or iented outward the treaty bans the development testin g and deployment of seabased air based spacebased or mobile land based abm system s and abm system components these include interceptor missiles launchers and radars or other sensors that can substitute for radars each party can propose amendments and in the standing consultative commission establis hed by the treaty they can consider possible proposals for further increasing the viability of the treaty each party can also withdraw from the treaty after giving 6 months notice if extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests1 in september 1997 the clinton admin istration signed memorandum of understanding on succession th at named russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan as the successors to the soviet union for the treaty this agreement never entered into force because congress insisted that the clinton administration submit it to the senate for advice and consent as an amendment to the treaty the clinton administration never did so in part because it feared that the senate might reject the agreement in an effort to abolish the treaty some members of congress argued that the abm treaty was longer in force because the soviet union has ceased to exist the clinton administration how ever determined that in the absence of alternative arrangements russia would serve as the successor to the soviet union for the treaty the bush administration did not explicitly accept the argument that the abm treaty was longer in force and deputy s ecretary of defense wolfowitz said the united states would withdraw before viola ting the treaty during their nomination hearings secretary of defense rumsfeld referred to the treaty as ancient history and secretary of state powell stated that the treaty is longer relevant to our strategic framework the president bush has also said that the abm treaty is outdated and that the united st ates must move beyond the l imits in the treaty to deploy effective missile defenses he announced the us withdrawal from the treaty on december 13 2001 this wit hdrawal took effect on june 13 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30967crs3 2for detailed discussion of the us nmd program and policy towards the abm treaty see us library of congress congressional research service national missile defense issues for congress crs issue brief ib10034 by steven hildreth and amy f woolf 3the bush administration does uses the phrase m issile defense rather than the clintonera national missile defense to describe the systems currently under consideration this is broader concept for missile defense that could combine defenses against both shorter medium and longerrange missiles in an integrated defense architecture 4george w bush delivers remarks on missile defense transcript federal document clearing house may 1 2001national missile defense plans clinton administration the clinton administrations plan for nmd which it outlined in 1999 called for the deployment of 100 interceptor missiles at single site in alaska2 this system would have been signed to defend against relatively limited threat of perhaps 20 missiles eventually the system might have expanded to 200250 interceptors at one or more site s to defend against larger and more sophisticated threat it might also have included space based sensors and components currently banned by the abm treaty the administration recognized that this site and some of the technolog ies under consideration would not have been consistent with the limits in the abm treaty as result it participated in discussions with russia in an effort to modify the abm treaty to permit limited deployment it would however have retained many of the central features of the treaty that limit the capabilities of abm systems president clinton announced on septembe r 1 2000 that he had decided not to authorize deployment of an nmd syst em because he did not have enough confidence in the technology and the ope rational effectivene ss of the entire nmd system in two of three tests the defensive missile had failed to intercept its target the administration announced that it pla nned to continue with research and development on its nmd technologies and that it would continue discussions with the russians about the abm treaty but the final decision on whether to begin nmd deployment would be ft to clintons successor bush administration president bush has emphasized that he places high priority on defenses that could protect the united states its forces and its allies from ballistic missile attack he outlined his administrations approach in speech on may 1 20013 when he indicated that we can draw on already established technologies that might i nvolve landbased and seaba sed capabilities to intercept missiles in midcourse or after they reenter the atmosphere4 during hearing s before congress in july 2001 deputy secr etary of defense wolfowitz provided more details on the administrations missile defense program he stated that the pentagon would pursue robust research and development program into wide range of technologies that could be based on land at sea or in space he stated that the administration had not yet identified specific architecture for its system because it would make use of the most promising t echnologies as soon as they were ready ultimately though the administration is seeking to develop and deploy an integrated layered system that can defend the united states its forces and allies from missiles of all ranges at all phased of their flight trajectories httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30967crs4 5 russias former defense minister igor sergey ev has said the 1972 abm treaty is the cornerstone for strategic stability and the basis for the system of international agreement s in the sphere of the monitoring and control of weapons now it has been threatened due to the fact that the usa has decided upon the ployment of national abm system which is prohibited by the abm treaty if such sy stem is deployed in the usa it the treaty will become meaningless see russian defense minister sergeyev on military reform chechnya abm defense vek february 23 20001 translated in fbis document cep20010301000351 6russias president putin has said people must realize that the mutual reduction of strategic attack weapons the most dangerous of all nuclear weapons is possible only when the abm treaty continues to hold sc rapping it would make further reduction of strategic attack weapons according to starti impossible startii would not come into force either as it would be impossible to conclude startiii aimed at talking bout the radical reduction of nuclear arsenals this blow would also affect other agreements that continuedadministration officials acknowledged that many parts of its missile defense program would not be consis tent with the terms of the abm treaty they argued that the treaty and the nuclear strategy it embodied should be replaced by new framework for deterrence that combines both offensive and defensive capabilities the administration participated in consultations with russia on new strategic framework but when it was unable to convi nce russia to withdraw from the treaty with the united states it announced that the united states would withdraw itself the russian response concerns about strategic stability and arms control the dominant theme in russias response to the us approach to missile defenses and the abm treaty is the idea that the abm treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability and that th us deployment of missile defenses would undermine stability and upset arms control5 according to this view the treaty with its ban on widespread ballistic missile defenses unders cores the cold war model of deterrence where neither the united states nor soviet union could threaten an attack on the other without facing an overwhelming reta liatory strike the assured destruction promised by this retaliatory strike meant that the strategic balance was stable that neither side would risk an attack matter how grave crisis accordingly the deployment of ballistic missile defenses that could protect all us territory as opposed to the limited defens permitted by the treaty would undermine this concept of stability if nation could intercept missiles launched in retaliation particularly if it had diminished their numbers in its initial strike it might believe it could launch first strike without fear ing retaliation knowing this the nation without the defensive system might conc lude that it had to launch preemptively before losing any of its forces in an initial attack under these circumstances stability would be lost and nation might have an incentive to launch first in crisis

and reducti ons in their offensive forces because they knew they could maintain an effective deterrent at lower levels when the offensive forces could not be blunted by defensive systems accordingly if the united states were to abrogate the abm treaty to deploy ballistic missile defenses russia might feel compelled to abrogate agreements on offensive forces so that it could retain an arsenal of sufficient size to ensure that it could penetrate the us ballistic missile defenses finally russian critics note that the us approach to missile defenses and the abm treaty would upset not only strategic stability between the united states and russia but also international strategic stability they argue that other nations such as china might believe that their offe nsive forces would be undermined by us defenses and might feel compelled to expa nd their arsenals to ensure an effective retaliatiory attack but if one nation such as china were to react this way other nations might feel threatened and might react themselves by increasing their offensive military capabilities hence the deployment of missile defenses and us abrogation of the abm treaty could set off new threatening international arms race russian critics and ma ny critics of missile defense in the united states argue that in the long run the united states could become less secure with nationwide missile defenses than it is in its current more vulnerable condition the clinton administration sought to r eassure russia about its concerns for strategic stability on several occasions wh president clinton met with president yeltsin or president putin he signed stat ements and declarations acknowledging that the abm treaty remained the cornerstone of strategic stability at their summit meeting in june 2000 presidents clinton and putin signed joint statement on principles of strategic stability in this document the presidents declared that they agree on the essential contribution of th abm treaty to reductions in offensive forces and reaffirm their commitment to that treaty as the cornerstone of strategic stability7 at the same time the united states sought to convince russia that the treaty

about the scope and intent of nmd differing threat assessments russian officials have agreed with the us view that ballistic missile proliferation could pose problem and introduce new missile threats to both nations the joint statement on principles of strategic stability signed after the june 2000 summit st ated that the presid ents agreed that the international community faces dangerous and growing threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery including missiles and missile technologies furthermore the presidents agreed that this new threat represents potentially significant change in the strategic situation and international security environment9 in an interview held shortly before the summit president putin proposed that the united states nd russia cooperate on the development of boostphase theater missile defense syst em that could be based near rogue nations to address this emerging threat10 however russian officials disagree with th us view that missile proliferation and the potential missile capabilities of roguenations pose significant or immediate threat to the united states in an interview with the russian press president putin acknowledged that such thr eats theoretically in principle could emerge one day but he went on to state that we do not believe that there are such threats now nor that they are coming from any specific states11 consequently president putin did not agree with the us view that these emerging threats justified the us proposals for changes to the ab m treaty and the deployment of an nmd system12 moreover russian officials claim that even if rogue nations could threaten the united states with longrange missiles the overwhelming power of us offensive forces would deter such an att ack

future in the possession of third world states that do not possess sound economy or the re levant technologies appear very lightweight and unfounded indeed ev if we imagine the purely theoretical situation where such missiles will become part of the armory the nuclear deterrence factor that demonstrated its effectiveness back in the cold war years will still apply to those countries13 thus minister sergeyev and others in russia have conc luded that if the emerging missile threats in rogue nations do not really threaten us territory then us nmd system cannot really be direct ed against those threats instead the united states must be seeking to develop missile defense system that can contribute to its global drive for domination nd undermine russias nuclear deterrent the results of our militarytechnical analysis indicate that the threat of the carrying out of strike against the usa by intercontinental ballistic missiles launched by soca lled problem states wh ich the usa sets forth as the primary reason for the developm ent of its national abm system is in realty not being considered ie it is not the real reason for the development of the national abm system we do not see any real motives for the deployment of this national abm system other than the striving of the usa to acquire stra tegic domination in the world we are deeply convinced that such depl oyment would be primarily directed against russia14 skepticism about limited nmd many russian officials and analysts did not believe that the united states planned to limit its missile defense system even under the clinton administration some argued that the united states would not spend more than 100 billion dollars to develop and deploy missile defense system then limit it to capability to intercept only 1020 missiles15 the clinton administration contributed to this disbelief when it stated that it would seek modifications to the abm treaty in two phases the first would simply allow the deployment of single nmd site in alas ka and the upgrades to some early warning radars in the second phase the clint on administration pla nned to request an increase in the permitted number of inter ceptor missiles and the addition of space based sensors some russi ans suspected that additiona l phases with additional minor modifications would have followed and that even tually the us approach would have loosened the treaty enough to permit the deployment of more extensive defenses the bush administration also insists that its missile program would be limited to address only the threat from rogue

upgrading its early warning and command and control structures then quickly adding to the number of deployed interceptors former defense minister sergeyev outlined this concern in an interview with the russian press he noted that it is not the quantity of interceptor missiles that termines the combat potential of any antimissile defense system first and foremost it depends on the systems information components which ensure the acquisition and tracking of targets the ability to distinguish real warheads from dummy targets16 russian analyst alexander pikayev also noted that the united states could easily expand its nmd capabilities once it had developed the sp acebased sensors that would improve targeting and tracking capabilities he stated that once it had developed and deployed these capabilities it would be easy for the us to produce and deploy large numbers of interceptors17 in april 2000 pentagon officials presen ted russias foreign minister igor ivanov with detailed

about the us assessments of emerging ballistic missile threats and their doubts about the limited natu re of prospective us nmd system many russian officials and analysts concluded that the socalled

russian federa tion and the peoples republic of china21 the threat to russias deterrent russian analysts have argued that the united states could undermine russias st rategic nuclear dete rrent and possibly acquire disarming first strike capability with even relatively limited missile defense capability first they note that russias arsenal of strategic offensive nuclear weapons is likely to decline sharply over the next decade to perhaps fewer than 1500 warheads as older weapons are retired and financial cons traints preclude the acquisition of newer weapons but the unite d states could maintain much larger offensive nuclear force of several thousa nd nuclear weapons even under prospective arms control scenarios in addition nato enlargement the us advantage in anti submarine warfare and the us advant age in precisionguided conventional weapons such as the sealaunched tomaha wk cruise missile provide the united states and its allies with the ability to conduct conventional attacks on strategic targets in russia in comprehensive first strike if the united states launched an attack against russia with its conventional and nuclear forces and destroyed large percentage of russias diminished nucl ear forces few hundred missile defense interceptors could be sufficient to intercept russias retaliatory strike hence according to this argument even limited missile defense syst em could undermine strategic stability and contribute to us fforts to achieve radical changes in the military balance22 russian analysts also note that china is likely to react to the deployment of us nmd system by expanding its military capabilities and its offensive missile forces one russian analyst alexander pikayev has stated that china has already adopted 10 billion package for new nucl ear buildup in reaction to us plans to deploy an nmd system together with tmd system in the western pacific and that china would have to significantly increase the size of its missile force to maintain the credibility of its deterrent in the face of us nmd but according to pikayev and other russian analyts these weapons could pos as much of threat to russia as they could to the united states

several russian officials have declared that if the united states were to follow this path russia would feel compelled to wi thdraw from range of arms control agreements so that it could deploy the

ic bms this would leave russia with an icbm force that consisted of single warhead ss25 and ss 27 missiles and around 100 aging ss19 missiles even without treaty implementation russi is likely to eliminate many of the older multiple warhead missiles the ss18s which have long been considered the backbone of russias strategic nuclear force are likely to reach the end of their servicelives by the end of the decade russia would find it hard to maintain these forces because the missiles were produced at plant in ukraine which is longer making icbms for russia and russia lacks the economic resources needed to build new plant to support these missiles in russi however if it were not bound by the start ii ban on mirved icbms russia coul d deploy its older singlewarhead ss 25 icbm and new

missiles several russian officials have also suggested that russia might abrogate the 1987 inf treaty and deploy new shorterrange and interm ediaterange missiles25 as was noted above russia could pursue this option in an effort to offset any advantages that china might acquire if it expanded its nuclear forces in response to us nmd but the threat to deploy new missiles in this range can also be seen as part of russias attempt to convince us allies in europe to join it in opposing us nmd plans26 in discussing this option vladimir yakovlev the former commander of russias strategic rocket forces noted that in the event of the repudiation of the inf treaty europe once again falls hostage to clash between the nuclear supe rpowers the united states is planning to maintain 100000strong grouping on the continent of europe with command and control posts and the rele vant infrastructure and all this is an extremely worthy target for russian missiles27 russia could reportedly produce new intermediate range missiles in relatively short amount of time according to one offi cial the moscow institute of heat and engineering russias leading design bureau for ballistic missiles has already prepared blueprints and technical documents for the system and could transfer them to the votkinsk missile asse mbly facility as soon as decision was made to begin producing missiles28 nevertheless it is unlikely that it could produce large numbers of these missiles in short period of time the votkinsk missile assembly facility is the same location where russia produced the ss25 missiles and is currently producing the ss27 missile at rate of fewer than 10 per year economic constraints would make it very difficu lt for russia to expand production at this facility hence any increase in the produc tion of intermediate range missiles could come at the expense of the already low production rate for ss27 missiles redeploy shorterrange nuclear delivery systems during the

russia any new capabilities to threaten the united states or to penetrate us missile defenses however it would be consistent with russias new national security strategy which allows for the possible

onventional military capabilities and its growing concern about the military implications of nato enlarg ement in addition the threat of new nuclear deployments near eur ope could be part of russi as efforts to draw support from the united states allies in europe for russias opposition to missile defense according to this school of thought the more threatened the europeans feel by russias

it threatens to redeploy shorte rrange or intermediaterange nuclear forces near its western borders however if russia intends to make these changes anyway in response to its diminis hed conventio nal

technology contro l regime which re gulates the supply side of missile technologies by regulating the behavior of nations that might seek to acquire ballistic missile technologies and would ope rate under auspices it would also provide incentives to nations so that they would forgo their own missile arsenals russian officials said the goal was to present an alternative to nmd that maximizes peaceful diplomatic and politi cal efforts to address concerns about missile proliferation33 specifically russia proposed that the international community create pre launch and postlaunch notification launchmonitoring regime to build transparency into ballistic missile developments nations that participated in this regime would gain an understanding of ssile developments in ne ighboring countries and might feel less threatened and therefore less compelled to develop their own missiles the regime would also include global monito ring system to provide mechanism for detection of missile launches for any purpose this monitoring system which could build on the system under development by the united states and russia might also ease tensions and uncertainties about ba llistic missile developments for nations who agreed to forgo the development of their own ballistic missiles the russian proposal offered security guarantees with the international community coming to nations assistance if it were attacked by ballistic missiles finally the proposal contained incentives for countries to fo rgo the development of ballistic missiles34 the clinton administration responded cautiously to the russian proposal it reportedly saw some positive elements but also had concerns that the discussions might be used as forum to criticize u s nmd plans and undermine us efforts to win support for missile defenses35 furthermore although the united states supported the principle of multilateral launch notifica tion regime it preferred to focus its attention on the bilateral usrussian

require any changes in the abm treaty37 putins initial general proposal was followed by meetings betw een nato officials and russias minister of defense igor sergeyev later in june at that time

boostphase defenses as russia had done in june 2000 the new paper indicated that the defensive system would rely on more conventional rminal defenses in transporta ble units that could be moved to counter specific threats during crisis39 but the rest of the proposal remained essentially the same russia and the eur opean nations would first cooperate in forum that would review and assess emerging ballistic missile threats they could then establish joint early warning center to process data and share information on missile launches these na tions could also jointly develop build and deploy non strategic antiballistic missile system that could be ready for rapid deployment to any area in europe where the threat of missile attack might arise40 according to some reports the plan was long on generalities and short on specifics it provided little technical evaluation and cost estimates development timetables or organizational structures it simply represented the oretical basis for how mobile european based system might be devel oped using russian technology41 russian officials emphasized that russi had the technology industrial base and testing facilities needed to develop and produce mobile nonstrategic ballistic missile defense system they also noted that russia had the early warning network needed to monitor and respond to ballistic missile threats that might emerge from nations to the south of europe42 the paper presented to lord robertson did not identify the technologies that could be us ed in the system but it did contain diagram and analysts who reviewed the

reactions when russia first offered its proposal for european missile defense system the clinton administration said the idea could not serve as substitute for us nmd specifically secretary of defense cohen stated that it would leave the united states and europe vulnerable to attacks from longrange rockets being developed by countries such as iran and north korea therefore it could not protect the united states or its allies from the full range of emerging threats47 to be acceptable to the united states missile defense sytem would have to protect all of the united states territory therefore the russian suggestion for cooperative system w ith europe could supplement but not substitute for the system that the us is developing48 the european reaction to russias initial proposal was also guarded according to european diplomat there is lot of skepticism because this would seem to be another attemp t by moscow to drive wedge between europe and the united states49 many analysts also considered the proposal to be clumsy attempt by moscow to draw the european nations away from the united states and to increase pressure on the clinton administration to defer missile defense deployment and remain within the abm treaty the reaction to russias february 2001 pape r that added details to the june 2000 proposal was not as critical officials from the both bush administration and nato noted that russias focus on theater missile defenses for europe indicated that russia appeared to agree with the united states th at missile proliferation posed threat and agreed that missile defense systems as well as diplomacy and arms control could play role in addressing the threat50 some analysts suggested that change in tone that accompanied russias second proposal and the fact that it came less than month into the bush administration signaled that russia realized that the new president was more committed to the deployment of missile defenses and that russias opposition could be futile instead by offering more details on the russian alternative russia could be seeking to maintain dialogue with the united states on missile defenses51 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30967crs17 51continued times february 22 2001 p 1us response to the russian reaction clinton administration the clinton administration sought to ddress russian concerns about the us plans for missile defense by convincing russia that the abm treaty would remain largely in place that missile defenses would remain relativel limited and that they would be directed against possible smallscale attacks from rogue nations as was noted above the clinton administration agr eed with the russian view that the abm treaty was the cornerstone of strategic st ability it proposed only modest changes to the treaty so that it could deploy limite d ground based site in alaska rather than north dakota and so that it could upgrade radar capabilities it acknowledged that the united states might seek further mo difications in the future but it never suggested that it would deploy robust layered defense that included seabased or spacebased interceptors administration officials also met frequently with russian officials to discuss us nmd plans and to seek russian agreement on changes to the abm treaty although these discussions proved futile nd russia offered little more than simple in response to us initiatives this ffort appeared to indicate that the united states placed high priority on reaching agreement with russia before it proceeded with its missile defense plans administration officials indicated that the united states would consider withdrawing from the abm treaty if russia failed to accept modifications but russia apparently never believed that the clinton administration would take this step this view may have contributed to russias reluctance to accept or even discuss the us proposals bush administration the bush administration has altered sharply the us approach towards addressing russias concerns first the administration does not support the view that the abm treaty remains the cornerstone of strategic stability to the contrary secretaries rumsfeld and powell stated that the treaty is ancient history and not relevant in the current strategic framewo rk in his speech on may 1 2001 president bush said the united states must leave behind the constraints of the abm treaty and instead replace this treaty with ne w framework that refl ects clear and clean break from the past second the bush administration s not accepted the limited approach to missile defenses that had been pursued by the clinton administration although the administration insists that its defensive systems will also be directed against rogue nation threats and accidental launches it has not pledged to keep that system limited to few hundred interceptors based at one or few sites on land instead the administration has pledged to develop layered defense that will include components based on land at sea and in space unlike the clinton administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30967crs18 52see for example biden joseph r jr missile defense will make us less secure wall street journal may 3 2001 john kyl ab m

architecture the bush administration has not yet sought to convi nce russia that the technologies included in us missile defense plans could not intercept deliberate russian attack and would not undermine russias deterrent instead the administration has offered verbal assurances that it does not view russi as an adversary and therefore would not direct us missile defense efforts against russian forces in late july 2001 presidents bush and pu tin agreed that the two nations would hold discussions on their offensive nuclear weapons and missile defenses and seek to reach agreement on new strategic framework these discussions began in early august when russian offici als received detailed briefi ng on us technologies and the bush administration plans for missile defenses but the bush administration did not view these discussions as the opening round in formal negotiating process that might produce new treaty limiting offensive nuclear weapons or missile defenses instead the united states wanted russia to agree to set aside the abm treaty or to have both parties withdraw from it together so that the united states could proceed with missile defense russia on the other hand preferred to keep some form of treaty regime in place it acknowledged that the world has changed and that the relationship with the united states has changed but it continued to place value on the predictability and formality offered by arms control agreements reports indicate that it may have been willing to permit more extensive testing of missile defense systems and to relax the definitions in the agreed statements on demarcation so that the united states can test tmd systems against wider range of ta rgets it also sought details about how the us missile defense program would be constrained by the abm treaty so that the two sides could devise amendments to re lax the relevant cons traints in essence russia approached the bush administrati on with response that would have been acceptable and possibly even effective dur ing the clinton administration when the united states was willing to modify the abm treaty but the bush administration did not offer any proposals fo r amendments because it did not want any constraints to remain on us missile defense plans issues for congress members of congress have expresse d range of opinions about the bush administrations approach to missile defense and arms control52 congress did not vote directly on binding legislation that would address the question of whether the united states should withdraw from the abm treaty it does however have annual opportunities to review the administrations plans for missile defenses when it reviews the administration s budget requests during the annual authorization and appropriations

the arms control process will russia continue to cooperate on offensive rms reductions many critics of us missile defense policy consider russias threat to withdraw from range of offensive arms control agreements as key threat to us security they note that these agreements not only reduce the size of the only arsenal that can threaten us survival but they also in clude monitoring and verification provisions that bring predictability transparency nd cooperation to the usrussian nuclear relationship others however argue that th benefits of arms control are not worth the cost of remaining vulnerable to missile attack they note that russian nuclear forces are likely to decline sharply during the next decade under economic constraints with or without arms control they also note that the united states and russia have signed new treaty that would reduce their offensive nuclear forces so that russias withdrawal from older trea ties would not undermine us security53 finally they contend that the united stat and russia have tablished mature cooperative relationship on nuclear weapons issues and that the transparency and predictability from this relationship could continue even if the countries were not monitoring compliance with arms control treaties will russia continue to cooperate in nonproliferation and threat reduction activities some critics of us missile defense policy argue that russia might cease its c ooperation in range of other policy areas if the united states were to withdraw from the abm treaty they point to russia expanding nuclear cooperation with iran as evidence that russia could do serious harm to us national security if it chose to pursue ss restrained nonprolifer ation policy some also contend that russia might withdraw from participation in the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program wher the united states provides financial and technical assistance in securing and eliminating ru ssian nuclear weapons and materials without us pa rticipation these weapons nd materials might be lost stolen or sold to nations seeking their own nuclear weapons some believe these possibilities could pose greater threat to us security than the emerging missile threats that would be the targ et of us missile defenses others however doubt that russian polic ies in these areas would be linked to us withdrawal from the abm treaty th ey note that russia has been cooperating with iran in nuclear developments and military sales for many years and that these activities are driven more by russias interest in earning hard currency than by russias interest in undermin ing us nonproliferation obj ectives some also argue that russia would not be likely to cut off cooperation under the n unnlugar programs because it recognizes the threats posed by the potential loss of nuclear weapons and materials and it would be unable to safeguard and eliminate aging nuclear weapons without us assistance will russia convince other nations to support

allies in europe by pro mising to cooperate on the development of theater missile defenses for europe it has also issued declarations with many other nations in support of the abm treaty and opposition to us missile defense plans some critics of us missile defense plans argue that the united states might find itself isolated in the international community if it continues to pursue missile defenses and withdraws from the abm treaty they note that mo st countries are at least uncomfortable if not outright opposed to this policy some fear that these nations might interfere with or complicate other areas of us policy if they feel that the united states has upset the international order with its pursuit of missile defenses the bush administration pledged to cons ult with us

although some have expressed concern that the administrations emphasis on these consultations could leave us polic vulnerable to the objections of other nations and many do not think these objections will affect the us international position they argue that us missile defenses will enhance not degrade international security and that other nations will realize that they will benefit in the long run if the united states pursues this course some also not that international criticism will not in the long run affect u s policy objectives finally as is noted below the international reaction to the us withdrawal from the abm treaty was relatively quiet in large part b ecause russias reaction was so mild russias reaction to us abm withdrawal during the first months of the bush administration analysts and observers debated how russia would react if and when the united states withdrew from the abm treaty they questioned whether russi would continue to press its objections to us policies on missile defense and the abm treaty or whether it would try to reach an accommodation with the bu sh administration on new framework for strategic stability many members of the bush administration believed that the united states would gain russias coopera tion when russia realized that the us was committed to withdrawing from the abm treaty they noted that russia remained extremely interested in reductions in offensive nuclear forces and that the bush administrations plans to reduce us forces would ease russias concerns about us intentions others however argued that russia had outlined wellreasoned and complex objections to us policies on missile defe nse and the abm treaty and that it was not likely to change its views in the near term instead they believed that russia could follow through on its threats to wi thdraw from range of arms control agreements and its plans to augment its nuclear forces they argued that the united states might eventually become less secure even if it
