authorized within the united states constitution article i section 5 clause 2 to discipline or punish its own members this authority of the institution of the house to discipline member for disorderly behaviour is in addition to any criminal or civil liability that member of the house may incur for particular misconduct and is device or procedure designed not so much as merely punishment of the individual member but rather ultimately as measure to protect the institutional integrity of the house of representatives its proceedings and its reputation congressional discipline of member by the house of representatives is done by the house itself without the necessity of senate concurrence and may take several forms the most common forms of discipline in the house are now expulsion censure or reprimand although the house may also discipline its members in others ways including fine or monetary restitution loss of seniority and suspension or loss of certain privileges in addition to such sanctions imposed by the full house of representatives the standing committee in the house dealing with ethics and official conduct matters the house committee on standards of official conduct is authorized by house rules to issue formal committee reproach in the form of letter of reproval for misconduct which does not rise to the level of consideration or sanction by the entire house of representatives additionally the committee on standards of official conduct has also expressed its disapproval of certain conduct in informal letters and communications to members the house may generally discipline its members for violations of statutory law including crimes for violations of internal congressional rules or for any conduct which the house of representatives finds has reflected discredit upon the institution thus each house of congress has disciplined its own members for conduct which has not necessarily violated any specific rule or law but which was found to breach its privileges demonstrate contempt for the institution or which was found to discredit the house or senate when the most severe sanction of expulsion has been employed in the house however the conduct has historically involved either disloyalty to the united states government or the violation of criminal law involving the abuse of ones official position such as bribery the house of representatives has actually expelled only 5 members in its history but number of members believing that they were facing certain congressional discipline for various misconduct resigned from congress

states congress is expressly authorized within the constitution to punish its own members for misconduct in imposing legislative discipline against its members the house operates through its rule making powers1 and the express provision for legislative discipline is set out along with congress rulemaking authority in article i section 5 clause 2 of the constitution each house may determine the rules of its proceedings punish its members for disorderly behaviour and with the concurrence of two thirds expel member the underlying justification for legislative discipline has traditionally been to protect the integrity and dignity of the legislative institution and its proceedings rather than merely to punish an individual2 and such internal legislative process is additional to any potential criminal or civil liability that member might incur for any particular misconduct3 members of congress like any other persons in the united states are subject generally to outside law enforcement and criminal prosecution if their misconduct constitutes violation of federal state or local criminal law unlike members of the legislatures or parliaments of many foreign nations there is general immunity from all criminal prosecution for members of the united states congress during their tenure in office rather members of congress have fairly limited immunity from outside prosecution for speech or debate in either house of congress 4 members of the house of representatives are subject to internal congressional discipline for any conduct which the institution of the house believes warrants such discipline the express constitutional authority drafted by the framers of the constitution was drawn from the british parliamentary practice as well as from our own colonial legislative

of congress were intentionally kept to minimum to allow the voters the broadest discretion in sending whomever they please to represent them in congress5 the institution of the house has the right to

member may take several forms the most common forms of discipline in the house of representatives are now expulsion censure or reprimand although the house may also discipline its members in others ways including fine or monetary assessment loss of seniority or loss of certain privileges7 an expulsion is removal of member from the house of representatives by tw othirds vote of the house censure or reprimand is legislative procedure where the full house by majority vote on simple resolution expresses formal disapproval of the conduct of member in addition to these punishments or disciplines by the entire house of representatives the house committee on standards of official conduct is authorized to i ssue on its own accord letter of reproval to member when the committee disapproves of conduct but makes recommendation for legislative sanctions to the full house of representatives the committee has also from timeto time expressed its disapproval of particular conduct in informal letters and other communications to members there is precise listing or description in the rules of the house of representatives of the specific types of misconduct or ethical improprieties which might subject member to the various potential disciplines the rules adopted by the house committee on standards of official conduct provide simply that with respect to the sanctions that the committee may recommend reprimand is appropriate for serious violations censure is appropriate for more serious violations and expulsion of member or dismissal of an officer or employee is appropriate for the most serious violations recommendation of fine is appropriate in case in which it is likely that the violation was committed to secure personal financial benefit and recommendation of denial or limitation of right power privilege or immunity of member is appropriate when the violation bears upon the exercise or holding of such right power privilege or immunity 8 the house may discipline its members for violations of statutory law including crimes for violations of internal congressional rules or for any conduct which the house of representatives finds has reflected discredit upon the

of action by which the house of representatives after member has taken the oath of office removes that representative from membership in the body by vote of two thirds of the members present and voting 11 an expulsion is considered disciplinary matter and matter of selfprotection of the integrity of the institution and its proceedings and as such is substantively and procedurally different from an exclusion which denies memberelect his or her seat by simple majority vote of the body prior to the memberelect being seated or after being seated without prejudice pending investigation and resolution of the matter because of failure of the memberelect to meet the constitutional qualifications for office ie age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state from which elected or because of failure to have been duly elected exclusion is now understood not to be disciplinary procedure 12 member is expelled by twothirds vote however precis ely for issues of misconduct and expulsion is generally taken against member after the member has been sworn into office members of the united states congress are not removed by way of an impeachment procedure in the legislature as are executive and judicial officers but are subject to the more simplified and expedited legislative process of expulsion13 removal through an impeachment it should be noted requires the action of both houses of c ongressimpeachment in the house and trial and conviction in the senate an expulsion however is accomplished merely by the house or senate acting alone concerning one of its own members without the consent or action of the other body and without the constitutional requirement of trial and conviction 14 g9g155g152g158g151g141g156g561g143g152g155g561g7g161g153g158g149g156g146g152g151g561 there is limitation apparent on the face of the constitution nor in the deliberations of the framers on the authority to expel member of congress other than the twothirds vote requirement one study of the expulsion clause summarized the framers intent as follows from the history of article i section 5 clause 2 and in particular its course in the committee of detail it is clear that the framers did not intend to impose any limitation on congressional power to determine what conduct warranted expulsion nor do the debates 10 see appendix for listing of house disciplinary actions 11 brown supra voting

impose any other substantive restrictions on the expulsion power15 justice joseph story similarly concluded that it would be difficult to draw clear line of distinction between the right to inflict the punishment of expulsion and any other punishment upon member founded on the time place or nature or the offense and that expulsion may be for any misdemeanor which though not punishable by any statute is inconsistent with the trust and duty of member 16 the supreme court of the united states citing justice storys historic treatise on the constitution found an expansive authority and discretion within each house of congress concerning the grounds for expulsion in in re chapman the supreme court noted the senate expulsion case of senator william blount17 as supporting the constitutional authority of either house of congress to punish member for condu ct which in the judgment of the body is inconsistent with the trust and duty of member even if such conduct was not statutable offense nor was it committed in his official character nor was it committed during the session of congress nor at the seat of government18 while each house of congress has broad authority as to the grounds for an expulsion this disciplinary action is generally understood to be reserved only for the most serious violations 19 as noted above expulsions in practice in the house and senate have traditionally involved conduct which implicated disloyalty to the union or the commission of crime involving the abuse of ones office or authority

some members of the house who have been found to have engaged in serious misconduct have chosen to resign their seats in congress or have lost an election before any formal action could be taken against them by the house thus the house committees investigating allegations of misconduct have from timetotime expressly recommended the expulsion of member who then resigned from congress before the expulsion vote could be taken by the full body23 additionally several other members of the house who might have been subject to expulsion or other legislative discipline because of misconduct either resigned from congress before any committee recommendation was made24 or soon after their misconduct became known lost their next election either the primary or the general election before congressional action was completed25 the defeat at the polls of members who had engaged in misconduct was precisely the principal ethics oversight planned by the framers of the constitution who looked to the necessity of reelection to be the most efficient method of regulating representatives conduct james madison explained in the federalist papers that despite all the precautions taken by structural separation of powers in the government or by the institution of the congress or the law the best control of members conduct would be their habitual recollection of their dependence on the people through the necessity of frequent elections 26 although the authority and power of each house of congress to expel appears to be within the broad discretion of the institution policy considerations as opposed to questions of power have generally restrained the house in exercising the authority to expel member when the conduct complained of occurred prior to the time the individual was elected to be member of the continued conspiracy to violate federal bribery laws receipt of illegal gratuities obstruction of justice conspiracy to defraud the united states filing false income

when the electorate knew of the conduct but still reelected the mber to the current congress on occasion this restraint has been characterized such as in dicta by the supreme court as the houses distrusting its own power to expel for past misconduct28 while there has in fact in the past been some division of opinion on the subject of the houses constitutional authority or right to do so29 in modern congressional practice it would appear to be more accurate to say that such restraint has arisen from questioning by the house of the wisdom of such policy rather than formal recognition of an absence of constitutional power to expel for past misconduct the reticence of the house to expel member for past misconduct after the member has been re elected by his or her constituents with knowledge of the members conduct appears to reflect the deference traditionally paid in our heritage to the popular will and election choice of the people30 justice story while noting the necessity of expulsion of one who disgraced the house by the grossness of his conduct noted that such power of the institution of the house to expel duly elected representative of the people is at the same time so subversive of the rights of the people as to require that it be used sparingly and to be wisely guarded by twothirds requirement31 similarly cushing noted that the power to expel should be governed by the strictest justice since in expelling dulyelected member withou t just cause power of control would thus be assumed by the representative body over the constituent wholly inconsistent with the freedom of election 32 the distinction between the power of the house to expel and the judicious use of that power as policy of the house was cogently explained in house judiciary committee report in 1914 in the judgment of your committee the power of the house to expel or punish by censure member for misconduct occurring before his election or in preceding or former 27 deschlers precedents supra

and sound policy and in extreme cases is absolutely essential to enable the house to exclude from its deliberations and councils notoriously corrupt men who have unexpectedly and suddenly dishonored themselves and betrayed the public by acts and conduct rendering them unworthy of the high position of honor and trust reposed in them but in considering this question and in arriving at the conclusions we have reached we would not have you unmindful of the fact that we have been dealing with the question merely as one of power and it should not be confused with the question of policy also involved as matter of sound policy this ex traordinary prerogative of the house in our judgment should be exercised only in extreme cases and always with great caution and after due circumspection and should be invoked with greatest caution where the acts of misconduct complained of had become public previous to and were generally known at the time of the members election to exercise such power in that instance the house might abuse its high prerogative and in our opinion might exceed the just limitations of its constitutional authority by seeking to substitute its standards and ideals for the standards and ideals of the constituency of the member who had deliberately chosen him to be their representative the effect of such policy would tend not to preserve but to undermine and destroy representative government 33 the power to expel is thus used cautiously when the institution of congress might be seen as usurping or supplanting its own institutional judgment for the judgment of the electorate as to the character or fitness for office of an individual whom the people have chosen to represent them in congress34 as noted the principal manner of dealing with ethical improprieties or misconduct of representative was intended by the framers to be and has historically been reliance upon the voters to keep their members virtuous through the restraint of frequent elections35 g5g152g151g156g142g154g158g142g151g140g142g156g561g152g143g561g7g161g153g158g149g156g146g152g151g561 expulsion from the house of representatives carries with it further automatic penalties or disabilities beyond removal from congress although the constitutions of some states provide that members expelled from their state legislatur are ineligible to be

for that seat or for another position in congress the three qualifications for congressional office age citizenship and inhabitancy in the stateare established and fixed in the united states constitution are the exclusive qualifications to congressional office and may not be added to or altered by the congress via statute or internal congressional rule or by state unilaterally36 member

each house of congress to discipline its members under its own chosen procedural standards generally without established right to judicial review the act of disciplining members is carried out through the rulemaking authority of the house and the preme court in describing the congressional disciplinary process in united states v brewster has noted in dicta the process of disciplining member in the congress is not surrounded with the panoply of protective shields that are present in criminal case an accused member is judged by specifically articulated standards and is at the mercy of an almost unbridled discretion of the charging body from whose decision there is established right of review 39 currently in the house of representatives re solution to expel member would most likely be

timetotime has instructed the committee by resolution to investigate particular matter or member while it had been common practice in the past to wait until all appeals were exhausted in criminal conviction of member before the house would proceed on matter concerning that member42 the more modern practice has been for the house to take cognizance of the underlying factual findings regarding the conduct that was the basis for the members conviction regardless of the potential legal or procedural issues which might be resolved on appeal43 the rules of the house committee on standards of official conduct specifically provide in fact for automatic jurisdiction of the committee when member has been convicted in federal state or local court of felony44 moreover in one instance committee disciplinary proceeding concerning member indicted for bribery was begun after the members trial even though it ended in hung jury and before second trial was to commence 45 the current rules of the house of representatives provide that the house committee on standards of official conduct is authorized to investigate allegations of violations of any law rule regulation or other standard of conduct applicable to the conduct of such member in the performance of his duties or the discharge of his responsibilities and after such investigation the committee is to report to the house its finding of fact and recommendations if any 46 the standards committee has promulgated detailed procedural rules to implement fairness in the disciplinary process specifically providing the requirements of notice the specification of charges and by providing opportunities for the charged member to be heard and to examine witnesses and evidence after an investigation by an investigatory subcommittee the taking of evidence and an adjudicatory hearing if the member is found by the majority of the committee members to have committed the specific offenses charged the full committee will then consider the appropriate discipline 47 if the committee finds that expulsion is warranted recommendation for such discipline is made in report to the full house of representatives which may be

behaviour censure reprimand or admonition are traditional ways in which parliamentary bodies have disciplined their members and maintained order and dignity in their proceedings48 in the house of representatives censure is formal vote by the majority of members present and voting on resolution disapproving members conduct with generally the additional requirement that the member stand at the well of the house chamber to receive verbal rebuke and reading of the censure resolution by the speaker of the house g9g155g152g158g151g141g156g561 the constitution in providing that either hous of congress may expel member by two thirds majority does not specify the reasons for such expulsion but does in that same provision state that either house of congress may punish its members for disorderly behaviour some early commentators thus felt that the authority to punish member by way of censure or some other condemnation was thus expressly limited unlike expulsion to cases concerning disorderly or unruly behavior or conduct in congress that is conduct which disrupts the institution 49 the authority to discipline by way of censure reprimand or other such rebuke however has come to be recognized and accepted in congressional practice as extending to cases of misconduct even outside of congress which the house finds to be reprehensible andor to reflect discredit on the institution and which is therefore worthy of condemnation or rebuke the house of representatives has taken broad view of its authority to discipline its members in the 63 rd congress for example the house judiciary committee described the power of the house to punish for disorderly behavior as power which is full and plenary and may be enforced by summary proceedings it is discretionary in character restricted by limitation except in case of expulsion the requirement of the concurrence of twothirds vote 50 similarly in its report on member house select committee in 1967 stated censure of member has been deemed appropriate in cases of breach of the privileges of the house there are two classes of privilege the one affecting the rights of the house collectively its safety dignity and the integrity of its proceedings and the other affecting the rights reputation and conduct of members individually most cases of censure have involved the use of unparliamentary language assaults upon member or insults to the house by introductions of offensive resolutions but in five cases in the house and one in the senate as of 1967 censure was based on corrupt acts by member and in another senate case censure was based upon noncooperation with and abuse of senate committees this discretionary power to punish for disorderly behavior is vested by the constitution in the house of representatives and its exercise is appropriate where member has been guilty 48 may the law privileges proceedings and usage of parliament supra at 103 blacks law dictionary at 224 6th edition 1990

past misconduct thus house select committee in the 90 th congress noted that the right to censure member for such prior acts is supported by clear precedent in both houses of congress 52 in more recent years the house has adopted in its rules statute of limitations on actions restricting the standards committee from investigating alleged violations of conduct standards when such violations go

and used together in resolution in 1921 for example resolution adopted by the house instructed the speaker to summon representative blanton of texas to the bar of the house and deliver to him its reprimand and censure59 the more formalized distinction in the house whereby it is considered that reprimand expressly involves lesser level of disapproval of the conduct of member than that of censure and is thus less severe rebuke by the institution60 is of relatively recent origin the term reprimand was used to explicitly indicate less severe rebuke by the house in 1976 in the reprimand of member for his failure to disclose certain personal interests in official matters and for the apparent use of his office to further his own personal financial interests 61 procedurally in the house censure resolution will generally involve verbal admonition such as reading of the resolution to be administered by the speaker of the house to the member at the bar of the house in the case of reprimand however the resolution is merely adopted by vote of the 56 see footnote 22 supra other members have also lost their next election before any house action is completed see footnote 23 supra

representatives as an institution has the authority to levy fine against member of the house concerning disciplinary matter this authority appears to be incidental to the express constitutional grant of power to the house to determine the rules of its proceedings and to punish its members for misconduct deschler s precedents states expressly that under the constitutional authority of the house at article i section 5 clause 2 fine may be levied by the house against member pursuant to its constitutional authority to punish its members 64 the house committee on standards notes expressly in its committee rules that sanctions that it may recommend to the house concerning member may include expulsion censure reprimand denial or limitation of any right privilege or immunity of the member or fine65 the authority for each house of congress to fine one of it s own members was recognized by the supreme court in dicta in kilbourn v thompson 66 where the court noted that either house of congress has the power of punishment by fine or imprisonment relating to areas where congress has been expressly granted authority such as where the constitution expressly empowers each house to

senate68 have been relatively infrequent occurrences69 the precedents in the house have demonstrated that the house fined member in 1969 the sum of 25000 to be repaid by automatically withdrawing certain amount regularly from his pay for various conduct offenses including the misuse of official committee appropriations payroll and expenses70 member of the house who was censured in 1979 was required to make restitution of substantial amounts by which he was unjustly enriched that is the member was expressly ordered within the resolution of censure to pay to the house specific amount by executing an interestbearing mand promissory note for 4003166 made payable to the treasury of the united states 71 at other times the house pursuant to disciplinary actions required certain monetary assessments of members of congress which were not expressly or necessarily characterized as fines member of congress pursuant to formal reprimand was required to make restitution to the district of columbia of certain monies and fine s concerning which he had improperly used his influence to have fixed or reduced 72 in 1997 monetary assessment or penalty which was not characterized by the committee as fine was imposed upon the speaker of the house to pay for some of the costs of an ethics investigation which resulted in the reprimand of the speaker73 the fines andor monetary assessments ordered in the disciplinary cases appear to involve the repayment or restitution of funds misused or wrongfully received as opposed to fines merely or strictly for punishment purposes and not necessarily connected to the wrongful conduct this is consistent with the current guidance in the house committee on standards of official conduct rules concerning the recommendation of fine which the committee notes is appropriate in case in which it is likely that the violation was committed to secure personal financial benefit 74 there does not appear to be however constitutional or institutional requirement for such fines to be so connected with unjust richments or misuse of funds and the committee on standards has noted in its rules that the guidance concerning fines and other sanctions recommended to the house sets forth general guidelines and does not limit the authority of the committee to recommend other sanctions75 68 in the senate in 1990 disciplinary matter in which nator was denounced by the full senate for example the senator was ordered to reimburse the senate specified amount in connection with questionable expense reimbursements received from the senate and

suspension is traditionally listed as one of the possible disciplinary actions that legislative body may take against one of its members76 the house of representatives has in recent years questioned its authority to disqualify or mandatorily suspend member by simple majority vote77 such suspension would most likely involve prohibition on member of the house from voting on or working on legislative or representational matters for particular time although not addressing suspension specifically the house has generally considered decision of member not to vote on matter as within the discretionary purview of the member individually under house rule iii1 even when legislative matter may involve possible conflicting personal interests as noted by the house its authority to require member to disqualify himself or herself from voting has traditionally been questioned and such recusal has therefore been traditionally left to the discretion of the member jefferson s manual and rules of the house of representatives at 658 states the weight of authority also favors the idea that there is authority in the house to deprive member of the right to vote v 5937 5952 5959 5966 5967 viii 3072 in one or two early instances the speaker has decided that because of personal interest member should not vote v 5955 5958 but on all other occasions and in the later practice the speaker has held that the member himself and not the chair should determine this question v 5950 5951 viii 3071 speaker albert d ec 2 1975 p 38135 speaker oneill mar 1 1979 p 3748 and the speaker has denied his own power to deprive member of the constitutional right to vote v 5956 speaker albert dec 2 1975 p 38135 speaker oneill mar 1 1979 p 3748 78 as to refraining from voting and committee work specifically the house of representatives in the 94th congress adopted rule which stated sens of the house that members who have been convicted of crime for which sentence of two or more years may be imposed should refrain from participation in the business of each committee of which he is then member and should refrain from voting on any question at meeting of the house or of the committee of the whole house until there has been judicial or administrative reinstatement of his or her presumption of innocence or until the member is reelected 79 the supporters of the provision noted that the rule was worded in the discretionary way it was because they believed that if the provision were mandatory then it would have been unconstitu tional because it would have deprived the district which the member was elected to represent of representation80 although the rule on refraining from voting is couched in what can be considered advisory terms of guidance to members the rules of the house so provide in the code of official conduct that members of the house shall adhere to the spirit and the letter of the rules of the house81 members are thus expected to conform to and abide by the

the house of representatives letter of repr oval is an administrative action of the house committee on standards of official conduct authorized under the rules of the house of representatives to establish or enforce standards of official conduct for members officers and employees of the house83 the issuance of letter of reproval by the committee is made public as it is issued as part of public report from the committee to the house on an investigation that the house committee on standards of official conduct has undertaken 84 letter of reproval may be sent by the committee on standards of official conduct on its own accord by majority vote of the committee without any approval or action by the full house of representatives85 as such letter of reproval is clearly distinguishable from legislative discipline punishment or sanctions that the full house may invoke against member such as censure reprimand fine or expulsion 86 it appears that letter of reproval is intended to be an action by the committee which is an alternative to the recommendation of sanctions to the house and is an action which is used for infractions of rules or standards which because of the nature of the infractions or because of mitigating circumstances do not rise to the level of requiring action by the full house of representatives the committee on standards of official conduct rules provide after setting out procedures when majority of the committee does not vote in favor of the recommendation that the house of representatives take action that the committee may also by majority vote adopt motion to issue letter of reproval or take other appropriate committee action 87 the committee may issue such letter if the committee determines letter of reproval constitutes sufficient action 88 the committee procedural rules appear to indicate that such letter of reproval may be sent only after an investigation by an investigatory subcommittee has resulted in the issuance of statement of alleged violations at least one count of which has been proved by an adjudicatory subcommittee and upon completion of sanction hearing 89 continued congressional record supra

standards as rebuke of members conduct issued by body of that members peers acting as the committee on standards of official conduct on behalf of the house of representatives90 the committee on standards of official conduct has issued several letters of reproval to members of the house including letters of reproval for the improper use of campaign accounts for personal loans91 for members borrowing of campaign funds for personal use and subsequent inadequate disclosure of such transaction92 and concerning allegations of sexual harassment of female employee and the use of ones office for political campaign activity93 in october of 2000 after lengthy investigation of member the committee issued letter of reproval for actions for which the member was found to have brought discredit to the house of representatives including relationship with former chief of staff which gave the appearance that official decisions might have been improperly affected violations of the house gift rule misuse of official congressional resources misuse of official congressional staff for campaign purposes and the appearance that certain expenditures of the members campaign committee were not for bona fide campaign or political purposes 94 in june of 2001 the committee issued letter of reproval to member for the improper expenditure of campaign funds to benefit businesses in which the member and his family had personal stake and for the improper conversion of campaign funds to personal uses95 in addition to formal public letter of reproval the committee has addressed ethical issues before it concerning allegations of misconduct by members by way of other appropriate committee action upon agreement of majority of the committee when an investigation is undertaken by subcommittee but the recommendation of sanctions to the full house is not made96 such actions by the full committee have included writing letter to member concerning necessary corrective action that should be taken by the

the members conduct99 in 2004 after an investigation by an investigatory subcommittee the full committee issued report which will serve as public admonishment by the committee of three members100 the house committee on standards of official conduct has characterized actions such as these generally by stating that the committee has noted infractions not meriting sanctions 101 such informal notifications public reports public admonishments or letters for corrective action thus may be distinguished from those instances when the committee formally and publicly reproved member by way of formal letter of reproval 102 although it may be argued that these other committee actions are to some degree comparable since they are all administrative actions taken by the committee itself pursuant to an investigation that had been conducted by an investigative subcommittee of the committee on standards of official conduct103 the committee has also sent socalled letter of admonition to member against whom complaint was filed by another member of the house104 which was apparently different from and was not technically an action to provide letter of reproval or even any other administrative action pursuant to an investigation by an investigatory subcommittee of the committee105 the letter of admonition in this case was rather method of disposing of complaint by the committee upon the recommendation of the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee for resolution of the complaint by letter to the member against whom the complaint is made 106 without
