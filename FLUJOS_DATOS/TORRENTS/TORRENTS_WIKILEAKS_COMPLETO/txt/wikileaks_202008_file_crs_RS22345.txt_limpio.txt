geoffrey s becker specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary the appearance of bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease in north america in 2003 raised meat safety concerns and disrupted trade for cattle and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22345 beef producers major issue for congress has been how to rebuild foreign markets for us beef other issues include whether additional measures are needed to further protect the public and cattle herd and concerns over the relative costs and benefits of such measures for consumers taxpayers and industry this report will not be updated1 what is bse bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease is fatal neurological disease of cattle believed to be transmitted mainly by feeding infected cattle parts back to cattle more than 187000 cases have been reported worldwide 183000 of them in the united kingdom uk where bse was first identified in 1986 the annual number of new cases has declined steeply since 1992 humans who eat contaminated beef are believed susceptible to rare but fatal brain wasting disease variant creutzfeldt jakob disease vcjd about 160 people have been diagnosed with vcjd since 1986 most in the uk and none linked to any canadian or us meat consumption bse in north america bse has been reported in 11 north americanborn cattle 12th case was uk import into canada the first native case was an alberta canada beef cow reported in may 2003 seven more cases have been found on canadian soil five of them in 2006 most recently in august 2006 the first us case was in canadianborn dairy cow found in washington state in december 2003 the other two us cases were 12year old texasborn and raised beef cow found in november 2004 but not confirmed until june 2005 and 10yearold alabama beef cow found in late february 2006 1 this report summarizes and updates information in other crs reports listed on page 6 sources for facts and citation to reports and studies can be found in these crs reports crs2 in epidemiological investigations of the three us cases the us department of agriculture usda was unable to track down all related animals of interest but those that were located tested negative for the disease despite beef recall some meat from the first us bse cow may have been consumed usda said adding however that the highestrisk tissues never entered the food supply materials from the other two us cows entered the food supply usda also said in the recent alabama case authorities were unable to determine the cows herd of origin animal health officials initially indicated that all of the north american cases were caused by the consumption of bse contaminated feed however usda reportedly now believes that the two nativeborn us cattle had atypical bse which differs from other cases if these cases are determined to be spontaneous that may affect future control strategies usda had asked an expert international review team irt to assess its response to the first december 2003 us case and to comment on the adequacy of existing bse protections the irt generally concluded in february 2003 that the investigation had conformed to internationally accepted scientific standards but urged additional actions including an intensive surveillance program to measure the magnitude of the bse problem in north america the irt had concluded that other infected animals probably httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22345 were imported here some of their parts rendered into ingredients fed to cattle and amplified within the cattle herd indigenously infecting some of them while agreeing with some of the conclusions usda also responded that the irts recommendations were based on the premise of higher incidence of bse in the united states than was indicated by current studies usda officials have continued to rely heavily on the findings in detailed quantitative analysis using computer simulation conducted for them by the harvard center for risk analysis and tuskegee center for computational epidemiology this work concluded that bse was very unlikely to become established or spread in the united states us safeguards import restrictions usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis is charged with protecting us agriculture from foreign pests and diseases in 1989 aphis began to implement increasingly restrictive import controls on ruminants and associated meat products from countries where bse has been found in 2003 the agency refocused its policy to allow imports of lower risk products from bse countries as long as they could show they had effective bse controls canada was first to qualify this approach parallels new bse guidance supported by the united states and adopted in may 2005 by the world animal health organization oie for its french acronym testing and surveillance aphis has tested cattle deemed of highest risk for bse for example those that display suspicious neurological symptoms that are nonambulatory or that die on farms this program tested about 20000 cattle in each of fy2002 and fy2003 out of about 35 million slaughtered annually following the first us case usda in june 2004 launched an enhanced surveillance program to determine the extent of bse in as many higherrisk cattle as possible after more than two years through august 2006 nearly 788000 of these cattle had been tested about 5000 weekly on average all but those cited above were negative for bse also as part of its enhanced surveillance aphis tested more than 21000 clinically normal adult animals crs3 in late 2005 by late 2006 usda had ended enhanced testing and transitioned to an ongoing program to test approximately 40000 cattle yearly meat safety on january 12 2004 usdas food safety and inspection service fsis responsible for inspecting all live cattle and beef products destined for human food published several meat plant regulatory changes these included declaring as specified risk material srm which are tissues where the bse agent can accumulate brains spinal cords and other nerve tissues from cattle 30 months of age and older and the tonsils and distal ileum part of the small intestine of all cattle effectively banning such tissues from the meat supply fsis also prohibited the slaughter of downer nonambulatory cattle and restricted certain meat plant mechanical procedures that could spread bse infective material into meat products feed restrictions bse is thought to have first spread and magnified by feeding rendered byproducts of infected cattle to other cattle as protein supplement since august 7 1997 the food and drug administration fda has banned most mammalian including cattle proteins from cattle feed fda also registers and monitors renderers feed mills pet food manufacturers and others in january 2004 fda promised to tighten httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22345 this rule by also banning poultry litter plate waste and bovine blood from cattle feed instead on october 6 2005 fda published proposed rule banning some srm mainly brains and spinal cords from cattle 30 months of age and older and from all cattle not passed for human food from all animal feeds including pet food the agency said its rule would remove those cattle parts responsible for 90 of potential bse infectivity the public comment period ended on december 20 2005 final rule was pending in late 2006 views on safeguards both the adequacy and enforcement of these government safeguards have been criticized for example the government accountability office gao has reported weaknesses in enforcement of the current fda feed rule number of consumer groups and others have asserted that fda should have been moving much more quickly to implement stricter animal feed rules than now proposed separately usdas inspector general ig has questioned both the sampling and reporting aspects of the departments bse surveillance program usdas efforts to reopen the us border to canadian beef also have been sharply criticized see below others including many cattle and meat industry leaders generally have been supportive of the usda and fda safeguards which the administration has argued meet and often exceed oie guidelines at the same time some of these same cattle and meat industry leaders have expressed concern regarding the need for and costs of some of the newer safeguards such as the usda ban on all downer cattle regardless of the reason for their inability to stand or walk and the fda proposal to expand animal feed controls industry and trade impacts exports cattle production is the largest single segment of us agriculture accounting for 20 of the value of us farm sales exports of us beef and other cattle products are viewed as critical to longterm market growth the value of beef and beef variety meat exports was estimated by usda to exceed 3 billion in 2003 or about 10 crs4 of the farm value of cattlecalves four countries bought approximately 90 of these exports japan 37 south korea 24 mexico 20 and canada 10 most countries halted imports of us beef and cattle soon after the december 23 2003 us bse announcement many but not all of these countries are again accepting at least some us beef and other products usda reports that us beef and veal exports globally reached 461 million pounds in 2004 and 689 million pounds in 2005 compared with 2003 level of 2523 billion pounds the us share of the world beefveal export market declined from 18 in 2003 to about 3 in 2005 the 2006 export estimate was approximately 1112 billion pounds and 7 of world market share cattle prices domestic cattle and beef prices had reached record highs in 2003 due to tight supplydemand situation immediately after the first us bse case in december 2003 these prices dropped sharply but then recovered substantially decline in us cattle supplies due in part to widespread drought conditions in cattle country along with strong domestic demand for beef kept farm prices relatively high during much of 2004 and into 2005 usda has reported that annual average us prices for fed steers ie slaughterready cattle were 8475 in 2004 near the lower end of usda forecast httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22345 of 8491 per cwt 100 pounds that had been made just before the bse case the 2005 price was 8728 and the 2006 estimate was 85 in 2005 study of the impact of the bse situation kansas state university estimated that total us beef industry losses due to the loss of beef and offal exports in 2004 ranged from 32 billion to 47 billion the national cattlemens beef association earlier in 2005 had placed cattle producers exportrelated losses at 175 per head japan situation in october 2004 the united states and japan had announced framework for restarting beef trade among other things japan where more than two dozen bse cases have been found promised to ease its domestic policy of universal bse testing and to admit lower risk us beef if the united states could verify that it had come from cattle under 21 months old and that all srm from the cattle regardless of age had been removed at slaughter however the market did not reopen until december 2005 when the japanese finalized their decision to permit such us imports on january 20 2006 the japanese again halted all us beef imports after finding vertebral column bones prohibited material in several boxes of veal shipped by new york processor despite us apologies and promises of stronger oversight measures japan did not reopen its market until july 27 2006 japanese safety inspections of us certified beef plants were among number of new concessions made by the united states meanwhile japanese consumers have been substituting other proteins and other beef sources notably australia and new zealand for us beef which once accounted for 2530 of japanese beef consumption korea situation koreas prohibition on us beef which had been in place since december 2003 was lifted on september 11 2006 resumption of us beef exports to korea the united states second largest export destination for beef in 2003 was expected to proceed slowly for the same reasons that will slow japans resumption of beef imports strict quarantine inspection requirements in korean ports have already resulted in the rejection of three shipments of us beef because of the presence of bone fragments crs5 canada situation usda banned all imports of canadian cattle beef and other ruminants and products in may 2003 in august 2003 usda announced without publishing formal rule that it would issue permits to import some lowerrisk canadian products notably boneless beef usda soon began expanding the types of permitted beef imports in late 2003 and early 2004 in response to montana cattle groups lawsuit federal judge temporarily blocked this effort largely on the grounds that usda was expanding product eligibility outside of the prescribed rulemaking process on january 4 2005 usda published formal final rule to reopen the border to additional canadian products including cattle 30 months and younger the judge again blocked implementation but federal appeals court overruled this decision in july 2005 since then canadian cattle have been entering the country in 2006 usda was preparing proposed rule that also would permit imports of canadian cattle over 30 months of age in february 2005 report usdas ig had earlier concluded that the departments actions on canada were sometimes arbitrary and undocumented policy decisions were poorly communicated to the public and between aphis and fsis and controls over the regulatory process were inadequate usdas defenders countered that canadas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22345 safeguards are at least equivalent to those of the united states and that restoring all cross border trade is critical for the united states to convince other countries that us beef is safe they asserted in congress major issue for congress has been how best to regain lost markets like japan and korea among other issues have been whether expanded federal actions are needed to further protect the public and the cattle herd the validity of the evolving science behind such actions and the costs and benefits of such actions for consumers taxpayers and industry besides the safeguards discussed above congress has also examined such bse related issues as the need for improved labeling andor traceability of livestock and livestock products and funding for the governments bse activities japan and korea the sluggish progress on japan and korea has frustrated the beef industry and many lawmakers several of whom have proposed retaliatory action for example several bills introduced in 2006 would have required trade sanctions against japan if the market did not soon reopen in 2005 senate floor amendment to the fy2006 usda appropriation hr 2744 which would have blocked new us rule to permit some japanese beef imports unless japan lifted its own ban was deleted from the final conference agreement hrept 109255 pl 10997 number of lawmakers in late 2006 urged suspension of negotiations with korea for bilateral trade agreement until the beef situation was corrected cool under the 2002 farm bill mandatory country of origin labeling cool for fresh beef among other commodities in supermarkets was initially slated to take effect on september 30 2004 but congress has twice delayed implementation most recently under pl 10997 until september 30 2008 in the 109th congress bills were offered to replace the mandatory program for meats with voluntary program or conversely to reinstate an earlier implementation date for mandatory cool crs6 animal identification id some members have complained that lack of nationwide animal id system has hindered investigations into the us bse cases usda state animal health authorities and industry groups have been working to create such program for several years but progress has been slowed by differences over such issues as whether it should be publicly or privately run if and how to protect the privacy of producer records and who should pay in the 109th congress bills were offered to require usda to establish nationwide electronic animal identification system to protect the information provided by producers from unauthorized scrutiny and use and to create livestock identification board with voting members from industry to oversee national program bse funding total usda spending for bse in fy2005 was estimated at 123 million of which 69 million was for bse testing and most of that for the special surveillance program noted above 49 million to launch the animal id effort and 3 million for research for fy2006 the administration requested 66 million for usdas bserelated activities including 33 million to continue work on an animal id program 21 million for bse testingsurveillance and 12 million for research fdas bse request for fy2006 was for nearly 30 million the fy2006 usda appropriation pl httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22345 10997 generally covered these requests for more information crs reports crs report rl32199 bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease
