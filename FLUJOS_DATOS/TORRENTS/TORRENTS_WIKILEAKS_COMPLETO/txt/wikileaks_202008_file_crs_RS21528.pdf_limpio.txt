their main physical effect is contaminating an area terrorist group could create an rdd much more easily than nuclear weapon radiation most atoms are stable they remain in their current form indefinitely unstable or radioactive atoms disintegrate or decay into other elements mainly by emitting an alpha particle two neutrons and two protons or beta particle an electron or positron emission

the body called the absorbed dos higher doses produce direct clinical effects including tissue damage radiation sic kness and at very high levels rapid death with chronic lowlevel exposure clinical effects are observed but the exposed individual may have an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer absorbed dose depends on several factors some are straightforward such as source strength distance shielding time of exposure and energy per particle or photon othe rs are more complex type of radiation layer of dead skin or few inch of air stops alpha particles more material is needed to stop beta particles and much more is needed to block gamma rays which are more penetrating form of material alpha and beta emitters do little harm outside the body because they are easily stopped inside the body they can do much damage one can with few ill effects pick up lump of plutonium239 an alpha emitter because the dead skin layer stops alphas but speck of the same material deep in the lungs bombards tissue with alphas and can cau lung cancer an rdd thus poses greater health threat if its material is finely powdered and thus more readily dispersed and inhaled rather than granular

tiny fraction of curie such as household smoke detectors do not pose terro rist threat but s ource with even few curies may be of use for an rdd while hundreds of radioactive isotopes exist only few

little use because the ra diation could decay to low levels before the material could be used while those with long halflives millions of years emit radiation very slowly and would do little damage unl ess inhaled there is leg itimate global commerce in radioactive mate rials of concern but also potential for fraudulent purchases and theft during shipment or use and problem s of disposing of sources longer wanted4 radiological di spersal devices alternative designs the term dirty bomb may have led the media to focus on device in which powdered radioisotope rrounds chemical explosive many terrorist groups would have the skill and materials to make the explosive part of the device it would be somewhat harder for them to obtai n the radioactive mate rial and convert it to powdered form terrorists could also scatter radioactive material without an explosive effectiveness an rdds effectiveness depe nds on many factors 1 some isotopes do more harm than ot hers and some elements inc luding their radioisotopes such as cesium bond strongly to concrete and asphalt 2 smaller pa rticles disperse more easily and are more readily inhaled but may be harder to make 3 using more material increases physical effects 4 more explosive would disperse the material more widely 5 weather would play large role higher wind speed would disperse the material more widely and wind direction woul d determine where it would fall thermal currents more prevalent on summers day than winters nigh t would also disperse material rain or snow would wash material out of the air but concentrate it in rivers lakes and seacoasts greater dispersion would increase the number of people affected while reducing the effect on each less dispersion would inflict more effects but on fewer people several estimates have appeared on radiation levels from dispersal of radioactive material for example the federation of american scientists calculated that the cesium 137 in medical gauge small amount detona ted in an rdd at the national gallery of art in washington would cover about 40 city blocks with radiation that would exceed environmental protection agency epa contamination limits one in 10000 chance of getting cancer this area might dependi ng on wind direction include the capitol supreme court and library of congress i f decontamination were not possible these areas would have to be abandone d for decades by one estimate5 others feel that such scenarios exaggerate the effectiveness of r dds by assuming that material disperses well and by downplaying the ability to decontaminate affected areas epa guidelines magnify rdd effectiveness steven koonin provost of california institute of technology stated that 3 curies of an appropriate isotope fraction of gram dispersed over square mile would make the area uninhabitable according to the maximum dose currently recommended for the general population ho wever the health effects of such contamination would be minimal for ev

support their existence7 terrorists could try to achieve several goals with rdds in the following sequence most depend on public fear of any radiation rather than actua l levels of radiation 1 deaths and injuries any prompt casualties would most likely come only from the explosion of dirty bomb many experts believe these would be few in numbers8 2 panic small amounts of radi oactive material might cause as much panic as larger amounts 3 recruitment the worldwide dia coverage of an rdd attack would be powerful advertisement for terrorist gr oup claiming responsibility 4 asset denial public concern over the presence of radioac tive material might lead people to abandon subway system building or university for m onths to years 5 economic disruption if port or the central area of city were contaminated with radioactive material commerce there might be suspended 6 longterm casualties inhalation of radioactive material or exposure to gamma sources could lead to such casualties probably in small numbers prevention and response securing radioactive sources prior to september 11 2001 safe handling of sources was the chief concern they were us ed worldwide in medical equipment oil well gauges etc with little security some were abandoned becoming orphan sources after the attacks attention shifted to securing them various measures seek to control us radioactive materials the nuclear

through its megaports program19 detecting rdds though is not simple material might be sm uggled across unguarded stretches of coasts or borders or obtained within the united states so system to detect rdds inside this nation might be needed to complement border detection efforts th difficulty of finding rdd material emphasizes the value of eliminating or securing it advance steps to minimize effects of an rdd attack as noted earlier most such effects flow from fear of radiation larges cale public education program available for use in the event of attack could help quell panic20 other steps might include deploying radiation detectors in large cities and developing and applying coatings to prevent radioactive material from bonding to streets and buildings though it is not clear that the benefit of coatings would merit the cost response to an attack the initial response would likely involve detecting an attack evacuating areas that might receive radiation or keeping people indoors until respirable material had dispersed treating people who might be ex posed and sheltering evacuees the federal radiolog ical emergency response plan21 would come into play does nuclear emergency support team s among others could assist22 harry vantine of lawrence livermore national laboratory suggests having the prompt ability to predict dose to the population from an rdd attack nd exercising decontamination procedures23 public education program c ould be implemented promptly longerterm responses would include monitoring radi ation levels defining and d econtaminating affected areas and decontaminating or demo lishing affected buildings promulgating standards that permitted exposure to somewhat higher levels of radiation while having few adverse health effects as noted bove w ould greatly reduce the area to be abandoned and the decontamination required public acceptance of such standards would be uncertain
