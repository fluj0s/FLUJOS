through the crs web georgias pankisi gorge russian concerns and us interests jim nichol analyst in russian and eurasian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319 georgia has faced difficulty in asserting control over its pankisi gorge area bordering russias breakaway chechnya region during 2002 russia increasingly threatened to intervene in the gorge claiming that chechen rebels and international terrorists based there were making forays into russia us interest in the gorge was spurred by evidence that terrorists there might have been linked to qaeda and the united states provided training and equipment to help georgia reassert control over the area this report may be updated related products include crs issue brief ib95024 armenia azerbaijan and georgia and crs report 97727 georgia republic recent developments and us interests background in late 1999 soon after sending troops into chechnya president putin made the first of repeated demands that georgia permit russian troops to pursue rebels escaping into georgia and that it cooperate in joint policing of its border and the elimination or extradition of rebels frustrated by continued separatist fighting in its chechnya region russia in 2002 stepped up these demands arguing that georgias pankisi gorge area near chechnyas border provided major sanctuary and source of support for the rebels as fighting in chechnya intensified in late 1999 up to 6000 chechens fled south of the russiangeorgian border about 25 miles into georgias elevenmile long pankisi gorge area many of these refugees had kinship and other ties to the gorges population of 7500 mainly ethnic chechens termed kists who had long resided in the area the georgian government helped the fleeing chechens to settle in the gorge it tended to tolerate the presence of former chechen rebel fighters in the gorge as long as they remained inactive and lived there in peace some in georgia also may have considered congressional research service the library of congress crs2 support for the refugees as leverage for reducing russias support of separatism in georgias abkhazia and south ossetia regions in any event the georgian government had little control over the povertystricken gorge us interest in the presence of international terrorists in the pankisi gorge was spurred when reportedly during the 911 attacks phone call was made from bin laden operative in afghanistan to georgia announcing the success of the first phase of attacks president bush in late february 2002 explained the decision to launch the gtep by emphasizing that there were some qaeda in the gorge the state departments patterns of global terrorism for 2001 stated that georgia contended with international mujahidin using georgia as conduit for financial and logistic support for the mujahidin and chechen fighters1 recent developments georgiarussia tensions escalated in july 2002 after sixty chechen guerrillas attacked russian forces just north of the georgian border in the face of the heightened tensions and pressure from russia georgia announced in midaugust 2002 that police httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319 and security forces soon would be deployed to the gorge and that military exercises would commence near the gorge the deployments began on august 25 with the setting up of checkpoints sealing off the gorge some guarded by tanks and armored vehicles russian and georgian officials reported that many or most chechen rebels and terrorists left the gorge either after the announcement of the gtep or just after the announcement of georgias deployments with some moving across the border into chechnya and others scattering along georgias borders with other areas of russia according to some reports us military planners and fbi cia and dea personnel advised or participated in the operation putin sent letter to shevardnadze on september 4 2002 demanding that georgian authorities neutralize terrorists in the pankisi gorge rather than simply let them leave the area the state department condemned russian airstrikes into georgias pankisi gorge area bordering russias chechnya region and stressed that russia should cooperate with georgias efforts to combat the terrorists putin increasingly attempted to frame the issue of chechen rebels in the pankisi gorge as part of the unbacked effort led by the united states against international terrorism maintaining that russia had the right to counterattack or preempt terrorists in states harboring them on september 11 2002 putin asserted that while russia had eliminated qaeda and other international terrorists within chechnya they continued to threaten russia and the world from neighboring georgia he called on his defense border and security agencies to prepare plans for an incursion georgianrussian tensions seemed to reach new heights the next day when putin addressed letters to president bush and other security council unsc and osce members condemning georgias police action in the pankisi gorge as duplicitous in part because georgian leaders were conniving with the terrorists he warned that russia might exercise its right to selfdefense under the charter or the unscs antiterrorism resolution 1373 to counter the terrorist menace the united states responded swiftly 1 the white house remarks by the president to the travel pool feb 27 2002 see also statement by charge daffaires philip remler ap feb 11 2002 the alleged national security agency phone intercept was reported on cbs evening news sept 4 2002 crs3 expressing unequivocal opposition to unilateral military action by russia inside georgia and offered its good offices to mediate the russiangeorgian dispute seeking to further address russian concerns president shevardnadze on september 16 ordered stepped up efforts in the gorge to capture terrorists arrest criminals and free hostages on september 25 2002 group of several dozen chechen rebels that allegedly infiltrated from georgia clashed with russian forces ominously russian defense minister sergey ivanov asserted that this new attack might well finally tip russias hand toward military incursion into lawless georgia moving to quell such threats georgia inaugurated air patrols of the border area on september 27 while russian forces were clashing with these rebels the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace to which russia and georgia belong strongly denounced russias threats to intervene and formed factfinding mission to visit the gorge2 marking an significant easing of tensions between russia and georgia the two presidents met in moldova on october 6 2002 and agreed on border cooperation including the designation of their security ministers as border emissaries and the establishment of an earlywarning joint communication system in followup meetings httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319 in midoctober and midnovember border officials of the two states signed accords reportedly setting up parallel border checkpoints and providing for some reconnaissance and patrolling cooperation georgian officials in late october reported that their forces had apprehended over dozen foreign terrorists linked to qaeda and had handed them over to the united states though us sources would not verify such reports allegedly one prisoner was saif islam masry an qaeda officer involved in several terrorist attacks on us personnel and facilities new revelations major shift in georgias view of chechnya and the pankisi gorge occurred in early december 2002 when an armed group from russia crossed into georgia to commit crimes reportedly the group had earlier left the pankisi gorge following georgias crackdown shevardnandze asserted that the group constituted the spearhead of terrorists planning to carry out wideranging terrorist acts in tbilisi and announced nationwide anticrime operation stating that i made big mistake when i failed to pay attention to the terrorist threat he also alluded to georgian press reports that prominent chechen rebel leaders had threatened the georgian government he stated that the anticrime operation would not be aimed against peaceful chechens residing in georgia responding to shevardnadzes announcement putin commended shevardnadze for decisive action in the struggle against terrorism3 international observers appeared in recent weeks to be also reassessing the threat posed by international terrorism in the pankisi gorge as more potent than previously supposed seemingly lending greater support to some of russias arguments at variance with some earlier reports that qaeda members had mainly appeared in georgia after 911 having fled from usled fighting in afghanistan this new information suggested 2 the mission reported in nov 2002 that it appeared that georgia had achieved great success in asserting control over the pankisi gorge the georgian and russian delegates to pace in jan 2003 agreed to set up joint working group to deal with disputes over pankisi gorge and other issues 3 fbis dec 7 2002 doc 20 dec 9 2002 doc 152 crs4 that chechen rebels assisted by 80100 qaeda and other international terrorists had established at least two training camps in the pankisi gorge in late 1999 by 2002 they controlled the gorge the camps contained sophisticated communications equipment and supplies training included hostagetaking shooting down airplanes and use of chemical weapons and explosives although the international terrorists focused on funneling money and fighters into chechnya to fuel the chechen rebel fighting they were also node of support for worldwide terrorism4 such support may have included the development of toxins and bombs for use against us and other targets in the middle east western europe and russia5 among the most sensational new evidence was surveillance camera footage allegedly shot in march 2002 of qaeda presence in the gorge released by the georgian security ministry in midjanuary 2003 the ministry reported that among the international terrorists on camera was the jordanian abu hafs better known at amzhet who led the 80100 international mujahidin in the gorge other evidence showed more potent chechen rebel presence than previously acknowledged by georgia including ruslan gelayev with band of 200250 rebels doka umarov also called khasanov with band of 130150 rebels hussein esambayev with band of 130140 rebels and rebel httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319 called batya with band of 100120 rebels6 many or most of these rebels and terrorists quietly left the gorge by mid2002 and were not apprehended the security ministry reported that its antiterrorist operation was virtually finished in the gorge by late 2002 the release of the camera footage and announcement that operations were winding down prompted russias presidential spokesman to warn on january 16 2003 that terrorism may not have been eradicated in the gorge and that international attention should remain focused on the area russian military officials also announced further efforts to fortify the georgiarussia border us ambassador to russia alexander vershbow too responded on january 17 that much remained to be done to completely eliminate the threat in the area perhaps heeding such warnings in march 2003 the government reportedly sent extra military and police forces into the gorge to prevent chechen rebels from reentering during the spring thaw georgian national security council secretary tedo japaridze in february 2003 was critical of assertions that many qaeda remained in the gorge which he said plays into the hands of those russians wanting to intervene the georgia train and equip program the georgia train and equip program gtep grew out of request for counterterrorism aid made by president shevardnadze during his us meeting with president bush in october 2001 us officials were receptive to this request in the face of evidence of links between the 911 attacks and the gorge they stressed that the gtep complemented other multinational 4 according to one report after usled forces eliminated qaeda bases in afghanistan qaeda operations chief khalid shaikh mohammed major planner of the 911 attacks directed that pankisi become major center of qaeda operations cnn mar 3 2003 5 time oct 28 2002 p 32 angeles times nov 29 2002 in his address to the security council on feb 5 2003 on the situation in iraq secretary of state colin powell stated that colleagues of islamic terrorist abu musab alzarqawi who was an associate of bin laden have been active in the pankisi gorge secretary powell presented slide depicting zarqawis alleged colleague abu atiya adnan muhammad sadik as active in the gorge 6 amzhet controlled the distribution of funds including some from us sources to finance the training camps and operations in chechnya and elsewhere financial times jan 17 2003 p 7 crs5 counterterrorism aid to georgia and similar us efforts in the philippines and yemen they emphasized that the training aimed to help georgia deny safe haven and transit for chechen arab afghani alqaeda and other terrorists who infiltrated georgia and otherwise to help georgia gain control over its pankisi gorge protect its sovereignty and enhance regional stability the 64 million 21month train the trainer program formally began in may 2002 up to 150 us special operations forces marines and other army and air force personnel are training up to 2000 georgian military security and border officers and troops the first phase completed in august acquainted 120 officers with us military doctrine and tactics regarding military staffing decisionmaking budgeting and civil military relations second phase involves training four battalions and company in marksmanship communications first aid reconnoitering human rights and offensive and defensive operations and mountain and helicopter tactics the first 558man battalion to undergo training was envisaged as commandotype unit composed of contract soldiers it completed its training in middecember 2002 and reportedly some troops would be deployed in the pankisi gorge7 marines began training the sachkhere mountain rifle battalion in counterterrorism operations in january 2003 equipment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319 provided includes uniforms fuel small arms and ammunition and medical supplies and some military facilities were extensively refurbished but us officials stressed that there are plans to establish permanent us military presence in georgia the us military also reported that 350000 was used to provide advanced equipment for new national command center ncc at the georgian defense ministry operational in late july 2002 to coordinate operational intelligence and plan emergency operations implications for us interests deputy assistant secretary of state lynn pascoe in congressional testimony on september 24 2002 stressed that stable and democratic georgia will have geostrategic importance for us international relations far into the future he suggested that russias threats against georgia reflected its real concerns about the presence of chechen rebels and terrorists in georgia visceral dislike by some in russia to shevardnadzes prowestern stance and perhaps displeasure that an oil pipeline being built across georgia will loosen its nearmonopoly control over caspian energy those who view the pankisi gorge through the lens of russian politics also have argued that president putin and the military were attempting to justify the failures of the russian campaign in chechnya by attributing them to georgian officials and international terrorists president putins letter of september 11 appeared designed largely to convince the united states to encourage georgia to be more cooperative in addressing crossborder incursions according to some observers however other commentators and russian media asserted that the letter represented an attempt to trade russias support of unsc resolution on iraq in exchange for us acquiescence to russian incursion addressing this assertion undersecretary of state john bolton rejected any us willingness to consider such an exchange of concessions some observers have raised concerns that as the united states focuses more on possible conflict with iraq russia might again consider crossborder forays into georgia in spring 2003 when chechen rebels may step 7 washington times dec 17 2002 crs6 up their activities8 the united states in february 2003 designated three chechen groups as terrorist organizations major endorsement of russias stance on the groups but stressed that the designation did not give leave to russia to violate georgias sovereignty reflecting major concern of many observers senator nighthorse campbell has warned that russian military incursion into georgia could complicate the closer us russia ties that emerged post9119 cooperative policies that might be jeopardized by cooling of bilateral relations might include russias cooperation on global counter terrorism nuclear arms reduction and the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction perhaps indicating the primacy of such bilateral interests on both sides foreign minister ivanov during his september 2002 us visit stressed that ties were strengthened and secretary powell stated that the united states was pleased with the relationship perhaps also indicative secretary powell on september 24 stated that the united states would not lecture to the russians on selfdefense but argued that brief military force by russia in the gorge would not resolve the problem he also partly blamed georgia for border violations stating that theres an obligation both on the georgian side as well as on the russian side to stop terrorism at the same time administration sources indicated that the united states was willing to step up trilateral httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21319 talks with russia and georgia to help ease their tensions senator john mccain after visiting the gorge also endorsed holding trilateral talks10 the gtep assistance was widely viewed by us and georgian officials as bolstering georgias ability to defend itself without outside intervention from russia there were major concerns in both the united states and georgia that georgian crackdown on chechen rebels and terrorists in the gorge could trigger attacks by these forces on georgia itself russias escalation of rhetoric during 2002 provided an impetus to the us gtep effort to put forces in place that could prevent and counter such attacks some us officials also pointed to the establishment of the ncc as an effort by the united states to bolster stability in georgia during its upcoming political succession reports that members of qaeda and other terrorists were in pankisi or elsewhere in georgia created dilemmas for us policy that holds governments responsible for terrorists operating on their territories however georgias attainment of central government control over its territory will likely take some months or years and cannot extend to breakaway regions such as abkhazia and south ossetia that also might contain terrorists at the same time russia georgia and the united states continue to face the larger dilemma of distinguishing chechen separatists from terrorists with the united states calling for georgia to combat the latter and advocating that russia open peace talks with the former that lead to the settlement of the conflict 8 interfax sept 13 2002 washington post sept 14 2002 p a14 eurasianet sept 17 2002 9 us congress
