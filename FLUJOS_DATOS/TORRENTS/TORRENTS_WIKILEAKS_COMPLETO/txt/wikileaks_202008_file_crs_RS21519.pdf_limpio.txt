authority operate within their own borrowing limits established separately in law for years the public debt limit has been codified in section 3101b of title 31 united states code periodic adjustments in the debt limit take the form ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21519crs2 2 for example pl 455 of the 79th congress 60 stat 316 june 26 1946 reduced the debt limit from 300 billion to 275 billion as budget surpluse s reemerged following world war ii and pl 101461 104 stat 1078 oct ober 25 1990 extended the current debt limit level of 3195 trillion for three days as part of series of shortterm extensions while budget summit was underway 3 see the discussion on pages 16 and 17 of crs report rl31399 the origination clause of the us constitution interpretation and enforcement by james v saturnoamendments to 31 usc 3101b usually by striking the current dollar limitation and inserting new one while most adjustments to the debt limit have been increases in some instances the debt limit has been reduced or extended at its current level for specified interval2 the congressional budget act of 1974 p l 93344 2 usc 601688 requires the house and senate to adopt concurrent resolution on the budget each year before considering revenue spending and debtlimit legislation in addition to recommending the appropriate levels of total revenues spe nding and the deficit or surplus the budget resolution also specifies the ppropriate level of the debt limit for each fiscal year covered by the measure inasmuch as budget reso lution does not become law congress and the president must enact legisla tion implementing budget resolu tion policies including any needed adjustment in the debt limit even if budget resolution is not adopted by the house and senate as occurred in 1998 2002 2004 and 2006 legislation must be enacted to raise the debt limit whenever it becomes insufficient under current legislative procedures the house and senate may develop and consider legislation adjusting the debt limit in any one of three ways 1 under regular legislative procedures in both chambers either as freestanding legislation or as part of measure dealing with other topics 2 pur suant to house rule xxvii the socalled gephardt rule or 3 as part of the budg et reconciliation proce ss provided for under the congressional budget act of 1974 while the constitution requires that revenue measures originate in the house this requirement is not considered to apply to debtlimit measures3 over the years however most debtlimit legislation has originated in the house in 2002 and 2004 senateoriginated b ill was the vehicle for the debtlimit increase the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee exercise jurisdiction over debtlimit legislation it is extremely difficult for congress to effectively influence fiscal and budgetary policy through action on legislation adjusting the debt limit the need to raise or lower the limit during session is driven by many previous decisions regarding revenues and spending stemming from legislation enacted earlier in the session or in prior years nevertheless the considerati on of debtlimit legisl ation often is viewed as an opportunity to reexamine fiscal and budgetary policy and is marked by controversy consequently house and senate action on legislation adjusting the debt limit often is complicated hindered by political difficulties and subject to delay as shown in figure 1 total of 88 debtlimit measures were enacted into law during the period from 1940 to the present the num ber of laws rose steadily from the decade of the 1950s through the decade of the 1980s from 6 to 24 but dropped to 13 in the 1990s six of the 13 laws enacted in the 1990s were temporary extensions over

rule did not apply or was not us ed due to its suspension or repeal or budget resolution was not finally agreed to in most cases the house suspended the rule because legislation changing the stat utory limit was not necessary at the time the senate has comparable procedure if the senate chooses to consider house joint resolution originated pursuant to th gephardt rule it does so under the regular legislative process the senate sometimes has considered such debtlimit measures for days and amended them in 1985 for ex ample the senate added extensive budget enforcement procedures the

subject to expedited consideration in both chambers in the senate in particular debate on reconciliation legislation is limited amendments must be germane and extraneous matter is barred while the
