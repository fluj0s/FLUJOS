repair of r212 lecture given on 13 december 1962 okay this is saint hill special briefing course lecture number two 13 december ad 12 well theres nothing much to talk to you about now you know everything and i noticed at the end of the last lecture you looked little bit disheartened and there is direct law concerning your disheartenment theres law that embraces this its the more you goof the more disheartened you will get thats law were now not dealing with aan area ofwe hope the process can be tailormade for the pc we hope the process works on the pc were not dealing with that type of material right at the present moment were dealing with open and shut material and its always very dismaying for an auditor to fool around with something like that because theres only one person that shows up and thats the auditor now for little while an auditor whos being shown up has tendency to try to kick back against the material hesnot producing result he thinks or hes goofed up so he doesnt know that the material will produce result so on technique such as 212 it is necessary that somebody be shoved hard through to win actually it requires subjective and an objective win on the part of the auditor if he wins on pc and he gets win on it himself he consistently gets some more wins showing that it wasnt fluke now he knows very definitely that it is the matter of his auditing and it is not the technique now this is hard thing to confront its something like somebody saying to you suddenly be responsible and hehhehhehheh thats kind of nervewracking situation you could always lay it off on something else now r212 has the characteristic however of producing results if it is done right now oddly enough itll produce results when its not done absolutely right and therefore is fairly hard material you will at first regard it as very critical material and you will hearhave people around in organizations and so forth telling everybody that it is very very difficult and that they have to study very very hard and they have to this and they have to that and after theyve passed 115 checksheets and run around the block on their hands and so forth then they will be permitted to sit in and watch session in which an item is being found you see youll get this kind of stuff actually that is not the approach which i advocate at all the approach i advocate is take the guy by the scruff of the neck throw him into the session say produce result make sure hes getting audited on it at the same time so he gets subjective and objective reality then his interest is piqued he sees something is happening around here and then he wants to know why its happening around here and therefore he studies it not just as grind or rote but he studies it as something that will do something and thats lot different than the attitude of well if i study this very hard i will get class iv see or if i study this very hard ill get class ii or something like that its if ithere is something here and if i study this why i will be successful with pcs therefore the pcthe auditor wants to know all about it he willhow does this thing work you know and obviously it just has an unlimited number of variables its just obviously when you first look at it youll say oh my hehhehheh ohohoh this thing must have hundreds of laws you know and theres all kinds of special cases and special conditions and theres all kinds of this and theres all kinds of that and how devastating you know and nevertheless he still stays fairly willing and just like i did on you in the last lecture i throw something brandnew in your lap and say get clean needle before you start nulling thats pretty grim and itll be grim right up to the moment when in your next session you get clean needle then you take look at the thing and you say hey what do you know whahahaha heres one of the damn things and you say to the pc look look i cleaned your needle goes tick tock thud but the process the routine r212 is specially designed in training and its training is based on that walk before you read book about walking and then you want to know how to walk read book in other words get the auditing done get auditing done now this only has one liability youve got to have somebody around who has to know how to untangle case and thats the subject of this lecture if youre going to let all these people sit there in coaudit and audit why theyve got to have somebody there whos backing it up and who can untangle all these wild goofs that are being made because these goofs are going to be made man and this of course is all part of it this person is sitting there and its kind of rock slammy kind of auditor anyhow and hes sitting there and he says now look haha heh heh look look ii opposed it just like you said item pc looks like hell haha you got to know the right answer you say you do so andso and soandso and soandso and then hover over him like ä dark vulture shadow make sure that he does just those things and he finds himself sitting there looking at result this kind of surprises him and when this happens to him and so forth fine but supposing several of these goofs got by as in any large group doing coaudit supposing several of these goofs got by and youve got case thats hanging its head well now the basis of the training of 212 is use it see that it produces result and let that auditor get subjective reality on it that modus operandi is totally defeated by one muckedup case well r212 wont muck up one case and be beneficial to fifteen more providing somebody knows how to untangle them well as many of you right at the present moment are in the stage of getting good solid reality on r212 youre not yet up to the stage of untangling case and i threw you an awful bomb in the last lecture saying youve got to clean up needle and thats what clean needle looks like and in fact it laid you out cold i might as well do the same thing in this lecture and say well you think youre going to know all about r212 well theres special technology on top of r212 of how do you straighten out case thats been goofed by r212 see so it isnt enough to know how to do r212 you got to know how to straighten out case that has been goofed on r212 so youd be very interested that this whole technology consists of simply then doing r212 right and the only crime that is irreparablethere is one irreparable crimeis to lose the guys papers and reports tih you cant do very much about itif you do that so that becomes the one thing you have to safeguard and one of the ways of losing reports is careless labeling you dont have the pcs initials and the date and the page number and the question being asked on separate sheet of paper see this piece of paper then can drift heres long sheet of paper and its got all kinds of names on it and items on it and it goes down to the bottom but it joins up with nothing else and you dont know where it came from one fine day somebody drops the folder hehhehhehhehhehhehhehhehheh thats all that can wash up case in r212 take my word for it thats all that can wash it up so it doesnt become just weird idea to label each separate sheet see its not the top of every page its just lets make sure that every sheet see every separate piece of paper has the pcs name the date and the question even in shorthand lets suppose hes opposing roses its at leastsays ww op roses see and maybe thats fourway sheet one of these big folds well actually it only has to be on that sheet once because nobodys going to tear that sheet in half thatsmakes it an identifiable sheet and you can get the folder back into some kind of shape now its very interesting that in the last two or three daysoh not the last two or three days in the last weekive sorted out several eases two of them very noteworthily mary sue was sorting out one last night or night before last rather and let tell you if it hadnt have been for those labeled sheets why we just would have been from nowhere see but because those labeled sheets existed and the thing could be assembled back into sequence which it had fallen out of we could find out what the devil had gone on from the lists and in one of them there was demonstrationhad actually picked up slamming item the item had never slammed since and that was what the case was hung on hehhehhehhehheh see just fluke that was right there in that demonstration there it was rs slant rs slant rs and then out all right so it went out in demonstration that doesnt mean very much because the case had several dead horses one right after the other so looking for list one item which was rsing so in patching them up you want the papers and whenyou let anybody do r212 as long as theyll keep the papers but theyve got to keep the papers that you got to impress people with because you can really goof case irreparably if you havent got the papers this compares to goals one case has gone on and on and on and on and on and on and on went on and on and on i dont know the case must have written twothree thousand goals i finally got very very curious about it and sent cables everyplace and i finally picked up the terminal that gave the pcs goal and that was the pcs goal see finally managed to run down in other words the piece of data in folders that delivered the pcs goal into our hands it was on another list see you will run into that too youll be looking for the pcs goal and the pcs goal and it isnt on any other list you start going back and nulling lists looking and looking and looking and looking then you remember there was goals list in handbook for preclears pcs goal appears as number one on it see you get kind of nervy when you realize that most of those handbook for preclears that people have been filling out over the years have been thrown away and theyre not any longer available there was little goals list but with r212 it is even more important we now have the techniques that if you did them long enough on the pc and followed down along the track long enough the goal would finally dump out in your lap he isnt totally stopped but supposing somebody has stopped r212 r212 then becomes in its papers and administration becomes more important than goals list now i was down digging through folderssome of your foldersin the last few days i was very very very impressed with the near possibility of not putting the ease back together again and in one of these cases the key list was only two pages long heh the auditor had called it complete list see we didnt know what it was or what question had been asked it didnt appear on the auditors report and that list had been picked out of the pcs folder by the auditor and had been put in his own papers we were tearing the place apart trying to find that one sheet of paper now when you figure out the number of sheets of paper that go through your hands on r212any one of them you see might contain that one piece of data and we found out what we had to know that that list was only two pages long and that two items had been found on it neither one of which rsed the list was not complete and we had found where the bypassed item was very very interesting case had hung up there that wasnt what we immediately started to work over the case with we started earlier than that on another bypassed item which we got record of which i myself had remembered i remembered it it was not part of the pcs record thats how touchy this sort of thing can be mark down what happens mark down what rses i dont care how many notes and scribbles that you add to sheets of paper and listshow much data there is there the key data that you want is did it rs were things rsing when they were written down in other words was it rock slamming list was there one rock slam on it at least pain and sen isnt as important in listing or nulling it isnt as important to note pain or sen because you can make special test for that but its sure important to note down when what which rses dr is not as important as an rs but dr tends to become important on list that youre going to represent but what this list came from what was being listed how many pages does it consist of you know numbering those pages as you go down the line and what did you do with it what did you do with that item that becomes very important the tiger drilled items and this in almost every case auditors dont make enough notations on when they tiger drill it what happened did it rs during cleaning buttons of the tiger drill and then not rs when they said it you know littlelittle pieces of data the observation of what happened while they were tiger drilling this thing can be of considerable benefit the auditors report is not as important as the list because you always confirm the auditors report by finding the list to which it relates my auditors reports on 212 are rather sketchy im usually going very fast and tootoo much on the fly to get very much down on the auditors reports so i tend to put it down on the lists but i sure try to put lots of data down on lists and then ill go back and summate the session as to what the results of everything was and put any piece of data that i had on the auditors report in other words the auditors report doesnt become long column of ta reads matter of fact ta reads are relatively unnecessary we dont much care what happened during theduring the listing or during the nulling we really dont care whether the ta moved or didnt move its relatively insignificant but what is significantthe needle behavior thats very important and go back at the end of the session ive got the ta at the beginning of the session ive got the range of the ta during the nulling and i just make note of that kept it on the list see just say well it was high and low and it was moving fast or something like this any kind of notation and then very detailed results of the session results the auditors report then does not become an action report which is blow by blow during the session it becomes summation report which is just what it is it says report meaning this is what i did during the session and he writes it up with great rapidity and he said we tiger drilled wedding bells and it all came to nothing i guess the list is incomplete we had four items in cat whiskers catfishes and wedding bells and tarts pc couldnt add any of them up i dont care what he says in the auditors report this is the final conclusion of the session and then some hint as to where it should go from there in the auditors opinion future tomorrow i ought to see case needs wedding bells tiger drilled or the list completed case has got to have scientology organizations opposed and even if he isnt going to do it tomorrow this has become obvious that this has to be done in other words what should be done with case should appear on the auditors report and the results of what the person did should appear on the auditors reports in other words that auditors session either added up to nothing or it added up to maybe or it added up to win and it doesnt matter what it added up tothe auditor shouldnt be sitting there trying to give anybody sales talk all you want to know is did you get anything done and the pc says of course youve got your goals you got your lol life and livingness you got your gains you got these things noted on the report youve got couple of cognitions the pc had something like that generally they give you some horrendous cognition or another generally enough to give the cognition that they recall in their gains thatif its that big itll last over to gains you see not interested in the little tiny cognitions but basically what did we get done in this session see we nulled three quarters of the list and had hell of time keeping in the mid ruds list looks like its incomplete now that isnt anything more than guess hell find out tomorrow the list was complete or he wont find it out in other words it doesnt have to be proven fact what his guesses were on the thing in other words he doesnt have to be right in these reports but the report consists of basically what was accomplished and what should be done and if you get those into the reports youll save lot of pcs bacon also an instructor looking it over can say hey dontyou know that thats bum one you say this ought to be represented its slamming man its slamming you never represent slamming ri you just never do that and he can catch this up dont you see on marking reports those are the important things the list itself stays as an integral part of the session of course and usually when im through with list ill pin the report to it you know give it staple or something i know you dont have many staplers available but thats when im all through with list ill keep list im using floating on forward in the folder its perfectly safe for that to happen dont you see but the point im trying to make here is the first point of repairing case is having the data with which to repair the case and you look back an auditors report if you say what should be done with the case by end of session youve made up your mind what you should do with case the auditors reports of that period say i dont care if somebodys d of ping it see the directorsomebody issomebody is saying now now the thing for you to do is youve got to represent these three additional items which you found on list one and that sort of thing if the auditor thinks something else should be done well put it down it doesnt come as source of argument nobody will be insulted about it its on the basis of well go ahead and represent the remaining items on list one but i think personally that cat whiskers should be opposed at least somebody trying to put the case back together again goes back through that thing and he says hey that auditor there thought cat whiskers ought to be opposed at that time it must have been quite slamming item at that time so he goes on in and investigates eat whiskers dont you see and he says aha see you could pick up point there with which to put the ease back together again but now lay aside the idea as of now that there are endless rules in r212there are not if you got the idea that there are tremendous numbers of special cases and awful variables and all kinds of things like that and there are special things that you do here and there and so on youllyoull be in state of defeat about putting case back together again because you say look at all the tremendous variables which could be done with this case first thing you start out with is there are only well the chief thing that will louse up case really louse case up is to take rock slamming item and represent it now i can tell you from experience that that will louse case up it wont louse all cases up it wont louse them up every time you understand but everyevery few cases the thing that should have been opposed was actually represented and you get the roof coming off 1 particularly if its list one item and thats peculiarly true of list one items you want to make your pc look like hes eighty and the roof has fallen in why you just take something thats slamming like mad and say well make the pc look good and well represent it yaoww you just done him in see thats the tensionthe attention factor see the pc should be watching at this fist coming toward his nose and somebodys saying dear do you want your coffee splits his attention up he has kind of feeling like hes going nuts all the time hes doing this represent list he knows he shouldnt be representing it he knows he should be staying in there with the fixed bayonets you know and hell go along with it and do it the idiot hell betell you hes feeling fine you know and hell look older and older and rougher and rougher so then naturally if thats one of the things you mustnt do at the highest level then thats the thing you should look for as having been done in patching them up did we represent something we should have opposed thats your first question opposing things is senior to representing them and that will account for great deal you find that somewhere along the line itll stand out like sore thumb you look on the auditing of the second of the month and the auditing says checked out list one hgc rsing or you find that old assessment and it says hgc rs and on the auditing of the third of the month we get the piece of paper and it says who or what does hgc represent to you you see wrong wording messed up whats this oh my god see should have been opposed man see so you say thats it now in repairing case always take the first list one mistake as your first repair action list one that has priority not because were trying to safeguard scientology but just because it doeshas more bearing on an auditing session than any other single list so it has priority you patch up the list one goofs before you patch up some other goof and youll find out that someday this guyoh youll find folder that will look something like this its almost impossible to even estimate the number of goofs numerically the combinations of goofs you see combinations can just be infinite auditor plunged found something rsing see found something going rs so just took this and represented it well you dont quite know what it is and it was his mothers aunt mothers aunt well you say thats hell of mistake see it rsed if he found it he didnt find it on any list whered he get it well he probably got it in the rudiments oh well so thats highly suspect item already and actually will have very little goofup for the case as result we dont know whether it was right so on but we find out that the following monday somebody got on the auditors neck and said list one list one assess out list one and we find out that we had dr on scientology books and we look over the next folder you know the next list and it says who or what would scientology books oppose that dr scientology booksoppose pwt nuts it may say scientology books sen and then who or what would scientology books oppose see now thats nice basket see of errors drwell you dont oppose drs the thing had sen on it so it would who or what would oppose scientology books would be right you see how you can patch it up again but youve still got my mothers aunt back here rock slamming well just brush her off return her to the poorhouse or wherever she came from because its your list one your list one goof takes priority thats the first one you put together the first goof you correct is list one goof and the biggest goof on list one is to represent when you should have opposed now oddly enough you can oppose anything with less damage than reverse way to in other words you could oppose dr with less damage than representing an rs quite interesting but you dont even have to know refinement of that particular character you know that rses should be opposed thats just rule the thing rsed so you opposed it now theres yourtheres your first rule of patchup is take the first goof you can find on scientology list now how many of these goofs can there be there could probably be an infinite number of goofs but there are fortunately just few things to do right rulehead light rule is if it rsed you oppose it now which way you oppose it has some bearing on it and if you cant make up your mind which wayif it was opposed right just tell the auditor to oppose it both ways till one is going well and then just keep on opposing it that way pcs often tell you fibs or they cant tell the difference between pain and sen or something like this now the closer things are to present time the more possibly they will be coterms see now coterm is opposed both ways who or what would it oppose who or what would oppose it and youll find one of them after little while will run smoother than the other one so you use the one that runs smoother and seems to be producing more interest and action opposing coterm is quite tricky and therefore r212 has more of this trouble than 3ga criss cross because you get more coterms the guys knees are in sen and his skull is in pain and its rock slamming all right which way do you go about it this is the commonest goof im giving you right now didnt complete the list that is the commonest goof and will probably be the commonest goof to the end of r2 12s days and tried to figure out some way to make it oppose without completing the listactually spend more time on trying to match it all up than in completing the list now one of the reasons the list doesnt complete is this coterm thing opposition lists must be completed because theres the perfect way to leave bypassed item you could actually keep on dumping represent lists without much liability dont worry about how many represent lists got dumped just dont worry too much about it because the pcs attention is not very thoroughly fixated on them theres lots of rses to be found in the bank theres lots of items to come up and that item will probably come up again on some other list but the opposition when you start to oppose something you key it in and the commonest goof on that on r212 is the auditor didnt hit it both ways toim talking about the commonest goof is incomplete listbut the auditor didnt hit it both ways to see he didnt say oppose it and it oppose and sort out which one was slamming best but just went at the thing in reverse because the pc said he had pain in his back and neglected to mention all this sen on his skull for the excellent reason that he always has that so your patchup action so farlet trace this for you againis to find the earliest goof you can find on list one thats yourthat takes priority and get your opposition listtakes priority over representget your opposition list completed and one of the reasons it didnt get completed is that it was coterm and it was being opposed wrong way to and the remedy for that of course is just to continue the list swapping it around the other way and you can actually swap it back and forth you can do half page on opposeit and another half page on it oppose you all of sudden find that thing is just running like hot butter on itoppose so just dont bother to turn it around the other way again just let it run thats not infalliblethat is not infallible because the item may be by this time has deaded down so you cant tell whether its rsing or not or if it ever rsed and it might be wrong source dont you see but if its wrong source it never becomes nullable thats your infallible test for wrong source never becomes nullable nullable is different than find an item on it actually list which is from wrong source if its goofedup list you cant getyou cant get ten items down it you just cant just dirty needle comes on and it just all starts going to hell in balloon youre lucky if you can get three thats nonnullable list so extend that list thats high priority and you must remember that theres trick in extending an opposed list and that is you reverse it the other way to and if the thing has gone for thousand items of opposition and was nullableif it was nullable on opposition it was not wrong source dont you see you can null anything that is an opposition list if it was going up against ä rock slamming item and you get on down the line its gone thousand items into this auditors hands and it hasnt produced any ri well you can just bet your bottom dollar its been opposed reverse way to in other words you were saying who or what would oppose scientology books and the pc is scientology book it should have been who or what should scientology books oppose now what do you do with that list do you tell somebody to null it all over again heres rule never re null i see on your papers you occasionally do why if the commonest error is an incomplete list why dont you just extend it and null what youve now got dont say that well the guy just missed the item now lets get over into another department now id finish up what theextend that oppose list represent lists dont pay much attention to them remember were patching this case up so were going to specialize in scientology list first were going to specialize in opposition lists and the commonest thing wrong with the opposition list is somebodys got it going backwards so thats not very much we have to patch up here is it well look it over canyou got those little points i just sketched over thats actually not very much to look for and not very much to patch up thats what youre going to look for next thing youre going to look at is another type of case id better tell you the rest of the patchup on this other case you just keep doing just what i said you take the next list one goofup and the next opposition goofup from it see the guy had long represent list he had rockhe had reliable item on that and nobody opposed it see so theres goofups and you just keep doing this see finding the list one items that had been neglected or list one phenomena that have not been properly reported or cited or something of this sort and then patch up the opposition lists that go along with it see all those opposition lists get those all patched up thats actually the basic fundamental of patching up case just doing those things more than that its not very complicated lets take now different type of case you take any new group on r212 youll have aseveral members of that group who will become charging in to you telling you that it doesnt work in one phraseology or another and this is another type of case to be patched up you understand this is another type of auditor that its not going right this is the not goingright now in actual fact you dont have to do too much to trace this one back the ease that isnt going right is simply not going right because one of two things have happened an rs has been missed on list one and has not been opposed or somebody shifted the cycle of action its just those two things that can be wrong with it just those two things rs has been missed and the other one is of course that somebody has knocked off cycle of action now opposition cycles of action are always more important than represent cycles of action so if you want to put the case back together again in hurry you specialize in opposition cycles of action which opposition cycle of action was not completed first and you simply go back and complete that cycle of action then take the next one consecutively and complete that cycle of action take the next one consecutivelyyou get the idea in other words somebody wrote up an opposition list of twenty and it should have been two thousand something wild like that see and you get those cycles of action completed consecutively the only thing that falls out of sequence of course is your list one maybe the guy didnt get onto list one until the fifth list was done some reason or other yeah well youre going to find all kinds of things didnt do list one said that well were only doing raw meat and theyve never heard of scientology so therefore well omit list one see something like that and then finally deeded to get onto list one just to make clean job of it and then you see great big goof you see you see scientology rs and then you see represent list well you push that one back to the first action which you undertake and then from that one come forward with all the other incomplete cycles of action see its just list one that spoils this rule of take the cycles of action which havent been completed from the first cycle of action to the that was incomplete till now see its just list one that pushes this out of order if you ever get one like that youll be scratching your head saying i wonder which one i take up first well you answer it with list one and if youve got it answered on list one which goof on list one was first and you do that one see its list one first or the first goof on list one first and thats the way you put it together now youre going to see the deadhorse case see this case has beenthis is dead horses dead horses dead horses nobody can see an rs nobody can find an rs on this case and this just about drives everybody daffy well this already is an incompletecycleofaction case possibly youre getting lot of dead horses look for that failure to oppose particularly on list one that is the big exclamation point blunder not because i say so and not because the gods say so and not because of any other authority it just so happens actually in this very room there were about four cases that were laying lots of dead horseshighway was just getting stacked up with them it was getting so the sanitary commission was going to complainuntil the rsing item on list one was found and opposed and at that moment the deadhorse phenomenon ceased see that wastheres at least four cases that i know of right in this room that did just that so that shows you thats fairly important so important that on one case we simply just picked it out of the hat and said all right so the list at some time or another must have rsed were just going to write an opposition scientology list and we did and it rsed and its the first rses ever seen on that pc hah this was done very indelicately by the way if i myself had been doing it as an auditor i would have gotten ahold of the pc and i would have sort of tiger drilled some of the key things on list one see and so forth but decided wed just do this one blundersomely and i said well just oppose scientology and they did and its now rock slamming like mad interesting huh now so it isnt because anybody has said so that this is true if you can actually get these deadhorse cases now oddly enough the only dead horse cases which we have are all under that category rsing item on list one which wasnt opposed thats every one we have but then remember were kind of special group youve had lots of auditing and lots of this and been around scientology and orgs lots so this is notthis is not pure proof so we can extend it over to saying that case that is now laying dead horses has an rsing item which hasnt been opposed this is rawmeat case he was member of the 137th infantry and he was just sent in by his commanding officer to be processed and hes never heard of you or anything else you see and youre trying to patch up this case after hes been run in coaudit or something like that all youre going to do is look for the rsing item that was goofed it must be in restimulation must be in restimulation remember this is patchup lecture its not what you do with this guy whatever was done with him there must have been an rsing item that wasnt opposed and the case has hung up ever since this case is just laying dead horses now so if ease is doing nothing but dead horses one of two things is true first and foremost is an rsing item has not been opposed or if opposed was not completed and the other one is the auditor needed white cane this actually happened right here that an auditor who was reporting rses was getting them and wasnt seeing them didnt know what the rses were its happened twice here that sounds pretty impossible but it has happened so its something that in case patchup has to have some allowance made for particularly in coaudit where you dont have highly trained people youd have to watch for that one and the question you ask is the case laying dead horses now what you do you have to do an observation of this one you let him extend one of the dead lists and see if it rses if youre auditing the case to get it patched up why nothing is easier lets take one of these socalled deadhorse lists lets sort it out this way we find evidence of any kind that the case has rsed on list one we cant pick up anything with regard to that weve even opposed something on list one and told them to nothing seemed to happen and were just getting rses then we assume that the auditor cant see an rs thats sort of simple isnt it now how you catch up with that one to patch it up thats something else because it takes observational time and it takes this but this nevertheless can exist now you mustnt overlook that as point needle is falling off the pin you can hear it hitting both sides of theof the meter clear across the room the case hasnt rsed see you also will get complaints about cases rsing too much rs so much you cant get the rudiments in now i just answered question on this sort would case continue to rs while you represented something they werent rsing on and the answer is fastest way in the world to turn off an rs is just start representing on something that would become dead horse by the time youve asked the pc for three items youll have rs in other words the rule is that case will only continue to rs when the subject from which the rs is coming continues to be addressed by the auditor in other words you have to stay on that subject to keep up with the rs phantom slam doesnt do this you have to be listing the right list to have the rs on it ill give you that security in other words there arent whole bunch of cases whereby somebody just continues to rs forever even though youre listing peanuts the case actually is rsing simply because theyre protesting listing on peanuts by the time youd gotten the third item on peanuts the rs would be off you see what i mean in other words your rudiments wont continue to rs just because they are out while youre listing on something else in other words if there is an rs on the list as youre coming down the line you havent got an rs from something else which is lousing up your list if its nice continuous rs do you understand there isnt too much rs in other words people dont talk about peanuts and rs on chimneys now even the phantom slam tends to behave this is whats peculiar also you dont ever get phantom slam on an uncharged list which should be very heartening to you the list has to be hotter than pistol to turn the slam on and the phantom slam may turn on however and louse you up here and there on the list as to which item is rock slamming while you are trying to straighten them out but phantom slam always comes on and goes off and comes on and goes off and phantom slam has this characteristic that it never obeys the auditor the phantom slam never obeys the auditor your basic impatience with this type of case is theyll never do what you tell them also thats completely aside from the phantom slam you say has anything been suppressed and they dont think about suppressing something they think about something else and so forth but right along with this phantom slam never obeys the auditor youve got rock slamming item catfish and you say catfish phantom slam does not turn on when you say catfish but catfish turns on when you say catfish see you say catfishcatfish is slamming item it slams it startit keeps on slamming until the pcs mind shifts attention shifts and the pc does suppress and you pull the suppress and the careful of off and it slams again but because youre working with present time items you can overtiger drill your items you can tiger drill an item to death tiger drilling must be brief on 212 thatsthats good one to remember you can kill an item with tiger drill ive given you most of the data now on case patchup not very painful was it audience now you want to get fancy youre going to get fancy now and youre going to go back and youre going to try to patch up this ease case isnt doing too badly youre going to look for list one oppositions failures to complete cycle of action incompletes and the case that has dead horses youre going to assume something must have slammed at some time or another on list one has been missedthats your primary source of dead horsesor to some slight degree that the auditor needs white cane now thats patch up thats not very tough now you in running case are different situation entirely thats how you patch one up how can you misrun case well i wont give lecture on the subject we havent got enough time and we havent got enough tape tape costs money time youve bought forty fifty reels of tape you feel it we just would have scratched the top of the subject so its very lucky that case patchup is so simple because the number of things that you can do wrong in 212 im sure have not been estimated im sure that nobody could possibly do it because therell be variations variations variations variations and ive long since ceased to try to outguess the number of variations there could be of simple procedure theyre almost infinite i have had loses on this man my youmy selfconfidence in my imagination has been staggered by this i think ive dreamed up all the reasons why all the variations that can be done and my god im always outcreated i dont say that sarcastically but its just little game that i sort of play well i keep my eye open somebodys going to dream up new one and they always do but itll be something is real in crosswise you know like opposition lists actually should dirty read shouldnt they now if opposition lists consistently dirty read why then shouldnt you represent what dirty reads on the biggest dirty read that you get in order to establish whether or not it had any rock slam on you couldyou could get these things without count youll have all of these things pulled on you so you better not get an idea that there are infinite numbers of special cases to 212 otherwise you will feel like youre drowning because there are infinite numbers of things that can be done wrong this is one of them and this is by the way the commonest somebody goes on representing and representing and representingand this is also mentioned because this is part of case patchuprepresenting and representing and representing and representing and they get some slams doesnt null they go on representing and they never check what they are representing and they will leave list one particularly item slamming like crazy it didnt slam when they did the assessment it just got little tiny scrub and they never never never go back to find out if the item that theyre representing is now slamming because it will being unburdened of course doing thata listing represent list from an item if the items ever going to slam that will make it slam better than tiger drilling if you wanted to make somethingif you wanted to make something fire better it was firing yesterday it isnt firing todayit wouldnt louse up the pc if you got ten or fifteen items off of it on represent i dont advocate that im just saying it would do that instead of tiger drilling it get ten or fifteen items off youll find out it produced the same effect this thing is now slamming again sobut thats just ignoring slamming item they never check it nothing is ever checked out another thing that happens sometimes and this is something that you should do with 212 well lets see its part of the rules is when youre doing represent list on something well check the item to find out if it is now slamming you very often will find that the item that youre representing is now slamming quite often find this youve gotyouve got situations where the auditor has just gone totally knuckleheaded about anything and everything in the book but normally false reports will give you the least difficulty false reports theyyou very seldom get false report theres only one thing the pc says that has been found out to be not too accurate pcs will tell you the truth in all cases but pain or sen and theyll do big sell on pain or sen they can have that dull pressure against their forehead and say its pain and knowingly lie about it see they dont even make mistake i mean theres been too many of that and pcs will tell the auditor lies and also will tell the auditor lies about the fact that theyre invalidating items we found pcs doing that they dont want to list on the thing so they invalidate the items as they hand outthe auditor well they can only do that to somebody who was not demanding clean needle before he started nulling or something because all that material would have to be pulled up but in final essence the repair of 212 activity is very simple it just follows the exact materials ive given you doing 212 of course follows that same thing in order of importance the more items you bypass the more gummy the case is going to be thats for sure the more times you try to represent rock slamming items the foggier the case is going to get the more incomplete cycles of action you stack up on the case why the less luck youre going to have so running the case parallels repairing the case that is the same rules of running the case its fantastic how an auditor will sell himself on the completeness of list try to put together items how the pc will go along with him there are only six items left in each of them were dring and we finally packaged them up you did wheres the ri it never occurred and that of course you know right there was an incomplete list you never had rock slamming item come off the list well that rock slamming item never came off the list because the pc never put it on the list very simple explanation list is incomplete which all comes under the heading of the patchup i gave you this is relatively simple once you break yourself down on the amount of randomity and importances which you think you see around in it and actually groove it down to exactly what it is its process of opposing rock slamming items and represent those that dont in order to get rock slamming items so as to oppose them and so take apart the gpm the closer you enter to the auditing session the less ptp the pc is going to be audited over the top of so you have r212 there are other things you can do with r212 and youre going to get into an embarrassment someday horrible horrible embarrassment and that embarrassment will be this is you keep getting rocket reads on items supposed to be doing 212 dont get rock slams you get rocket reads and sooner or later somebodys going to come to you with this terrible problem well the first thing you do is establish whether or not it was rocket read and if it was rocket read rocket read is superior to rock slam thats all there is to that so the item rocket read so you oppose it simple and then you do that and youre very very embarrassed by the whole thing because the pc keeps continually intruding his goal into the session what do you do with that well the best thing to do then is to get the goal checked out and tell the pc whether it is or isnt and then go on running 212 thats your best repair for that embarrassing situation if you find rocket reading item your first action is to oppose it of course and then use it to find goal with if the pc hasnt already laid his goal in your lap or if you find goal get it checked out dont leave it in doubt dont have the pc sitting there for the next seven days wondering if thats his goal because it acts just like wrong goal all the way get it checked out get it checked out right now and if you cant check it out why fine clean it up little bit more and check it out then the pcs got his goal and youll find out hell do 212 better remember that even though you do have his goal is reason he can run on his goal weve had case after case that couldnt go clear mostly because they had too much 212 bricabrac sitting in the session and they were trying to clear across the top of ptp and you know that they could be forced all the way to free needle but it never quite stays free and that can go on for hundreds of hourswe already knowjust because actually theres ptp connected with the sessions ptp connected with scientology they cant get across it and its always still there and it never blows clear and its sort of like trying to empty pot with the lid on cant be done weve seen case after case after case in fact about 80 percent of all eases that have tried to go clear are hung up on that exact one right there thats how important r212 is it isnt case of something that an hpa can do or simple thing or simple way to produce good result on pc it is simply that people will never go clear unless 212 is run right okay audience mmhm thank you very much
