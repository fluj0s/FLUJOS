the 2001 c onflict and its immediate aftermath see crs report rl30900 macedonia country background and recent conflict introduction macedonia is small landlocked country in southeastern europe formerly part of yugoslavia its population of about 2 million people include s approximately 64 slav macedonians large et hnic albanian minority representing about 25 of the population according to the 2002 census as well as some ethnic turks roma gypsies and serbs for nearly decade after gaining independence in 1991 macedonia managed to avoid the kind of bl oody ethnic conflict that engulfed other former yugoslav republics and even appeared to serve as sort of model for ethnic coexistence in the region nevertheless the international community remained concerned about the possible consequences of any spillover of fighting into macedonia since it was feared that conf lict once sparked in macedonia could spread beyond its borders and lead to regional war in early 2001 an ethnic insurgency threatened to derail macedonias fragile stability and lead to another extended conflict in the balkans ethnic albanian guerrillas calling themselves the national liberation army nla many with ties to the former kosovo liberation army cla imed responsibility for series of attacks on macedonian police units the incidents sparked an eightm onth armed conflict between the insurgents who claimed to be fighting for improved rights for the ethnic albanian community and macedonias poli ce and armed forces the conflict spread from the border region with kosovo to areas around the capital skopje in august 2001 european and us peace envoys achieved an agreement among macedonias main political pa rties both slav and ethnic albanian to resolve the crisis the ohrid framework agreement outlined package of political reforms to expand the rights of the ethnic albanian minority that was to be implemented as the rebel force disbanded and disarmed unde r nato supervision key aspects of the agreement are outlined below implementation of the framework agreement at first progressed slowly and unsteadily but cons istent internationa l support and pressure have encouraged greater stability and political normalization2 macedonias current multiethnic govern ment remains committed to the ohrid process its surrounding region has remained relatively calm with all western balkan states seeking closer association with and membership in nato and the european union regional tensions could grow in the coming months and years as deliberations begin over the disputed st atus of neighboring kosovo at the international level since september 11 2001 us and in ternational attention and resources have shifted away from the balk ans and toward other troubled regions of the world especially in the middle east the united states continues to support multilateral efforts to stabilize macedonia but has increasingly looked to the european union to play larger international role in the balkans starting with macedonia the growing eu role include s both operational elem ents and broader integration strategyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32172crs3 ohrid framework agreement summary the ohrid framework agreement was signed by macedonias four main political parties on august 13 2001 and provides for staged reshaping of interethnic relations and powersharing arrangements the document lists some basic principles of the macedonian state and includes provisions on the cessation of hostilities and the voluntary disarmament of ethnic albanian armed groups devolving centraliz ed power to local administration and reforming minority political and cultural rights among other things the provisions create double majority requirement in parliament including majority of representatives from minority populations for passage of certain cons titutional amendments and laws affecting minority rights local governments are granted enhanced competencies including the right to sele ct local heads of police but with some centralized controls the agreement names ma cedonian as the official language of the country but says that any language spoken by 20 of the population is also an official language state funding for universitylevel education in minority languages is to be provided where that language is spoken by 20 of the population annexes to the agreement outline fifteen detailed amendments to be made to the constitution and several legislative modifications to be adopted by the national assembly some within designated deadlines most of which were not met another annex invites the international community to assist in the implementation of the framework agreement help to train and restructure the police or ganize new census observe parliamentary elections and convene donors conference full text of the agreement can be found at httpfaqmacedoniaorgpolitics us interests the united states has long maintained that peace and security in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is important for balkan stability and us interests during the 1990s the united states remained actively engaged in multilateral efforts to prevent the spread of ethnic conflict to macedonia bolster m acedonian independence and state viab ility and manage b ilateral disputes between macedonia and greece us and other international leaders feared that any prolonged violent conflict involving macedonia could swiftly become inte rnationalized and implicate neighboring states including nato allies they therefore frequently expressed support for m acedonias s overeignty and territorial integrity the multiyear deployment of small contin gent of us military forces to macedonia as part of mission in the early 1990s the first engagement of us military ground forces in the balkans further demonstrated the us commitment to the macedonian piece of the regional stability puzzle when violent interethnic incidents threatened to embroil all of macedonia in early 2001 us representatives played key role in international efforts to defuse the conflict formulate the ohrid framework agreement for peace and ove rsee postconflict stabilization and peace implementationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32172crs4 the united states and its european allies share the same broad goals for macedonia which foresee its full integration along with other western balkan states into euroatlantic institutions and whol and free europe at peace toward this end successive us administr ations have worked to achieve sustainable peace in the region and have promoted the opene nded enlargement policies of nato and the european union at the same time the united states has s upported the gradual but steady process of shifting greater interna tional responsibility for the balkan region to the european union the eu and its member states have provided the bulk of international financia l assistance to the former yugo slavia and currently account for most of the international military forces in the region the bush administration has given greater emphasis to accelerating and supporting this process especially with us attention and resources intensely fo cused on the global war on terrorism iraq and other issues in 2005 the bush ad ministration announced renewed focus on the region as international processes to manage the i ssue of kosovo get under way however most observers believe that the united states must still work in concert with the european union since the eu re presents the ultimate stabilizing prospect for countries in the region unfinished business notwithstanding significant changes to the global environment in recent years the fate of macedonia is of ongoing us interest for several reasons first the united states remains committed to follo wing through on processes underway in macedonia that have come about in part due to substantia l prior us engagement and investment of political ec onomic and military resources the united states shares with the rest of the international community an interest in preventing reversal of progress in macedonia relapse into conflic t or weakening of the states longterm viability related goal is to stem illicit trade in drugs armaments and persons through the region while downturn in developments in macedonia may not pose any strategic threat to the united states as compared to global terrorism or weapons proliferation it woul d run counter to us goals for greater stability in the region and its peaceful integration into the re st of europe europe whole free and at peace including macedonia and the rest of the wester n balkan region remains us policy objective until irreversible progress in macedonia is secured the united states will likely remain involved in closely monitoring developments and f acilitating progress in macedonia in conjunction with the international community the united states continues to enjoy unparalle led influence and credibility throughout the balkans even as its share of international res ponsibilities there is steadily reduced and its visible role diminishes recognizing this us officials have repeatedly rejected the notion that the united states might cut and run from the balkans lest the perception of us disengagement have destabilizing impact the united states has also solicited and receive d political and military s upport from the m acedonian government for usled operati ons in iraq and afghanistanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32172crs5 kosovos future second reason why macedonia continues to be relevant to us interests is that its fate is widely perceive d to be integrally tied with that of neighboring kosovo whose final political status has remained unresolved since the 1999 kosovo conflict kosovo represents focal concern of stra tegic interest in the region and beyond 2005 has been dubbed the year of decision for kosovo and process to determine kosovos unresolved status is expected to begin later in the year the bush administration has expressed strong support for moving forward in this process without favoring predetermined outcome whatever outcome eventually emerges resolution to kosovos final status is lik ely to have major impact on the entire region macedonias leaders have neither played nor sought direct role in kosovos governing situation or final status deliber ations nevertheless many observers believe that what ultimately happens in kosovo c ould have particular ly strong impact on macedonia certain scenarios for kos ovos final status instill concerns about macedonias security and vi ability some observers f ear that independence for kosovo for example may inspire breakaw ay aspirations by macedonias ethnic albanian communities and lead to the creation of greater albaniagreater kosovo others are concerned that effort s to partition kosovo could be repeated in macedonia and lead to the c ountrys dismantling there is also the concern that compromise proposals on kosovos status ma prompt dissatisfied ethnic albanians to turn to extremist militant groups in kosovo southern serbia and macedonia an inability to resolve kosovos status in th next few years or at least prolonged uncertainty about any final outcome could ve the same effect the fact that many possible outcomes in kosovo theoretically remain on the table contributes to an unsettled and insecure security environment macedonia is deeply affected by day today events in kosovo on account of its shared borders crossborder ethnic albanian community ties including links with ethnic albanian insurgent groups and commercial and illicit trade routes test case for eu ropean defense third area of interest for the united states has been the role macedonia has played as test case for the development of the european unions common foreign and security policy cfsp and european security and defense policy esdp to date macedonia has served as an exam ple of constructive us european partnership in the balkans us nato and eu coordinate d diplomatic activity helped to bring about the 2001 ohrid agr eement us and european officials continue to advance shared goals of stabilizing mace donia and promoting its

governing power from the center to local authorities and redraw adminis trative boundaries at the local level this effort reflected critical element of the ohrid process since it would address the ability of ethnic albanian communities to exercise greater rights in local areas where they are concentrated however the decentraliza tion process also invol ved base territorial issues that would
