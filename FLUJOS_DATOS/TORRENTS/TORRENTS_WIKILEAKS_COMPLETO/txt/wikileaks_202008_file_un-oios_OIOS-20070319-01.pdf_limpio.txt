on drugs and crime unodc in vienna the exercise included followup on recommendations of an earlier inspection of programme management and administra tive practices in the office for drug control and crime prevention a5683 as well as review of progre ss in implementing the operational priorities guidelines for the medium term whic h framed the reform process launched by the executive director oios observed progress in the integration of drug and crime issues and in developing counterterrorism programme as mandated by the general assembly to promote peace security and sustainable development in order to achieve integration as well as to improve governance operations staffmanagement relations and funding unodc engaged in reform efforts that have resulted in management improvem ents restructuring and more fficient support and delivery of services through innovative it tools and solutio ns however coherent and realistic planning is necessary to align the differen t mechanism and tools used and c onsolidate them by way of the regular budgeting process and the finalization of the strategy oios noted that project management was in need of further improvemen t rbm was not yet fully implemented and made use of the ieu needed strengthening and that clar ification of the roles and functions within the different organizational units were required in demanding complex and challenging environment unodc has been called to operate three main areas would help strengthen the field office network these are knowledge manageme nt stable and predictable funding as well as efficient and effecti ve support from hq oios will closely monitor how the envisaged changes evolve and to what extent they will sustain in unodc contents paragraphs page i introduction 1 5 ii

responsible for implementing the programme of work under section 162 of the programme budget and is guided by the commission on crime prevention and criminal justice the commission on narcotic drugs the international narcotics control board the conference of the parties to the united nations convention against transnatio nal organized crime the conference of the parties to the united nations convention against corruption and by the united nations congress on crime prevention and criminal justice 3 the unodc was established to implement the organizations drug programme4 and crime programme5 in an integrated manner addressing their interrelated issues and international terrorism in the context of sustainable development and human security 2 in january 2001 oios conducted review of programme management and administrative practices of the then office of drug control and crime prevention odccp 6 the inspection report a5683 contained 14 recommendations aimed inter alia at decentralizing decisionmaking in stitutionalizing the mechanisms to ensure that programmes and projects are properly conceived effi ciently executed and results are assessed strengthening planning fundraising and the communication between staff and management and gave rise to unodcs reform initiatives set out in the document operational priorities guidelines for the medium term7 ops 3 oios decided to conduct review of programme management and administrative practices in unodc to assess the status of implementation of previously issued recommendations to ascertain their outcomes and their sustainability as well as to assess the effectiveness relevance and efficiency of the reform initiatives the inspection assessed the effectiveness and soundne ss of policy formulation planning management practices guidance and support of unodc hq to the fos as well as the extent to which th ey help in advancing the goals and objectives of unodc 1 prior to 1 october 2002 the office was called office for drug control and crime prevention which was established by the secretarygeneral in accordance with his reform programme described in part two section v of document a51950 paras

httpimdisunorgtextfilesis_13949_2554dockey9538 4 the united nations international drug control programme was established pursuant to general assembly resolution 45179 of 21 december 1990 as the body responsible for coordinated international action in the field of drug abuse control the authority for the fund of the programme was conferred on the executive director by the general assembly in its resolution 46185 c of 20 december 1991 5 the crime prevention and criminal justice programme was established by the general assembly in its resolution 46152 of 18 december 1991 since 1997 the programme has been implemented by the centre for international crime prevention which was established in accordance with the secretarygenerals reform programme described in part two section v of document a51950 dated 14 july 1997 6 united nations office for drug control and crime prevention odccp was an umbrella entity that included the united nations drug control programme undcp and the centre for international crime prevention cicp common managerial structure was put in place under an executive director and functions and organization of odccp were defined year later through stsgb199817 of 30 october 1998 7 this can be accessed with the following link httpwwwunodcorgpdfed_guidelines_mediumtermpdf the ops were issued in 20 january 2003 44 oios reviewed whether appropriate mechan isms were in place to manage monitor and evaluate projects and programmes and whethe r best practices and lessons learned were shared among national and subregional offices to improve on them as part of the repositioning process which aimed at aligni ng the management structure with unodcs strategic vision the inspection assessed procedural technical and governance issues including the application and consolida tion of resultsbased management 5 the comments of unodc management were sought on the draft report and are reflected as appropriate in its final vers ion oios greatly appreciates the cooperation extended to it by the staff at various levels during this review ii methodology 6 oios used multimethod approach which included review of programme planning and performance data through imdis and other sources b review of official documents budgets reports websites and public ations dealing with unodcs areas of work including information on the implementation of oios recommendations and resolutions and decisions of the relevant intergovernmental bodies c survey was sent to 461 staff of unodc including 49 programme managers and 268 staff at odc vienna as well as all 144 professional staff members in the fiel d offices and 40 followup queries oios received 140 responses 28 response rate in vienna oios held d 38 interviews and 12 focus groups discussions with management and staff of unodc c 3 consultations with odc stakeholders and beneficiaries including interviews with representatives of member states accredited in vienna and members of the committee of narcotics and drugs cnd the commission on crime prevention and criminal justice cpcj and international narcotics control board incb iii background 7 unodc launched ops in response to oios recommendations8 in an effort to reform and as strategy to reposition itself with the aim to improve governance funding operations staff management relations and communication the repositioning process which began in 2002 concentrated on integrating drugs crime and terrorism into the global agenda for peace security and development by means of advocating united nations systemwide response to organized crime and corruption addressing the issue of hivaids in the multiple contexts of drugs human trafficking and prison populations integrating drug and crime issues in technical assistance programmes and working more closely with the private sector the ops were unanimously endorsed by permanent representatives in vienna in january 20039 8 the repositioning process was officially unched with the restructuring of unodc that was formally concluded in march 200410 fully integrating the previous centre for 8 oios report a5683 9 commentary on unodcs new organizational structure is available by following the link httpwwwunodcorgpdfunodc_commentary_orgstructurepdf additionally some of the initiatives raised in the operational priorities where specifically endorsed by cnd resolution 468 10 as reflected in secretarygenerals bulletin stsgb20046 5international crime prevention and united na tions international drug control programme into single organizational entity 9 conceptualization of the new organigram was guided by the desire to improve coordination produce synergies and generate sa vings reallocate resour ces to fieldoffices create new functions especially in the area of research and institutional development introduce structural flexibility in employment at unodc by offering further career opportunities to staff who have assumed the same functions for more than 5 years through rotation and facilitate staff crosslearning by promoting more exchanges between field offices and headquarters oios reviewed these commitments and others that were made in the ops as well as in subsequent unodc reports to the cnd and the cpcj11 and provides its relevant findings below iv findings operational priorities mandates and resources 10 six key themes shaped the ops for the medium term the office committed itself to pursue an integrated approach to drug and crime issues place them in the context of sustainable development balanced prevention and enforcement activities select operations on the basis of knowledge and strategic vision establish institutions that promote international best practices and leverage resour ces to exploit the power of partnership five areas of management were singled out for improvement governance funding operations staff management relations and communication 11 oios noted the significant progress in integrating the drug and crime issue and in developing counterterrorism assistance programme as mandated by the general assembly 12 to promote peace security and sustainable development this was only possible through consistent efforts to enhance the quality and quantity of services provided to member states by providing research and analysis on global drug trends and crime challenges continuous support to the normative functions of governing bodies and technical and legal assistance to help member states deliver their commitments to control drugs and prevent crime and terrorism as result unodc has become the centre of the united nations fight against uncivil society 12 unodc is the custodian of five international conventions and three protocols on drugs transnational organized crime and corruption as well as number of united nations standards and norms on crime prevention and criminal justice including the thirteen counterterrorism instruments still not yet widely adhered to as result member states are increasingly turning to it for specialized technical and legal assistance on their ratification and implementation oios noted that the 2005 world summit identified organized crime corruption and terrorism as major threats that need to be addressed in facing the global challenges of development security and huma n rights core to the millennium development goals and world leaders commitment to strengthen unodcs capacity to provide technical 11 see ecn720029 ecn7200314 ecn720057 and ecn720068 and unodced1 cnd resolutions 469 473 482 12 ga resolution 6043 of 8 december 2005 and in the context of security council resolution 1373 2001 6assistance13 the unodc resources from the regula r programme budget of the united nations to support these challenges stands at 33 million which represent less than 1 of the total regular budget resources14 more recently the adoption by the general assembly of global strategy against terrorism has assigned to unodc significant ta sks that need to be addressed within the same remit 13 unodcs most immediate concern was an expanding mandate and the apparent insufficient regular budget rb resources provided to it for its implementation 11 of unodc total budget for 20062007 is rb funded15 oios noted that while the amount of rb resources grew minimally from 20022003 to 20042005 there was increase in real terms for the current biennium16 the rb share of unodcs to tal resources decreased from 15 in 20022003 to 13 in 20042005 to its current level this was mostly due to increased extrabudgetary earmarked contributions oios attempted to obtain clarity on the amount and complexity of the new mandates given to unodc and some resource estimates to cover the needs for those mandated activities including core functions which are claimed to be implemented with extrabudgetary xb resources however unodc did not have such information and analysis available and it wa s unclear what core functions or additional mandates did not have enough resources oios not ed that additional initiatives started at unodcs discretion were not always supported by additional funding while unodc might indeed be stretched to implement and deliver on new mandates within existing resources it needs to be prepared to support its position with facts and figures exercise caution whenever new mandates are accepted without appropriate analysis of resource implications and have prioritization scheme to effectively deliver on the approved programme of work oios noted that unodc was in the process of redefining its strategic plan with the preparation of the strategy which should support this effort 14 while progress has been made in the past five years to ensure that unodc becomes trusted source to provide advice on drug cr ime and terrorism issues oios believes that some improvements are needed to allow unodc to realize it s full potential of being the clearing house for collecting analyzing promoting and sharing information and good practices within the and to its stakeholders oios noted that out of the 14 recommendations issued in a5683 seven recommendations were either implemented or superseded by events 17 and the remaining seven were either not fully implemented or had transformed into new issues that need to be addressed to achieve the above goals18 13 world summit outcome resolution adopted by the general assembly ares601 of 1692005 paragraph 115 14 unodc regular budget is approximately 33 million while the total budget of the regular budget is approximately 42 billion thus the percentage of resources dedicated to drug crime and terrorism from the regular budget is less than 1 07 percent to be exact 15 a606 section 16 table 164 page 5 16 according to a606 section 16 table 164 page 5 rb resources grew from 25 million in 20022003 to 31 million in 20042005 to an estimated appropriation of 33 million in 20062007 after recosting before re costing the figure of 31 million for which means that there was increase in real terms 17 recommendations 1378 10 12 and 13 of oios report a5683 the recommendations related to integration of cicp and undcp evaluation on the tajikistan drug control agency quality control of publications and enhancement of research strengthening of financial oversight conclusion of undcpundp working arrangement guidelines and modalities of project execution 18 recommendations 2 4 5 6 9 11 and 14 of oios report a5683 these recommendations relate to project planning clarity of functions ppc project cycle training programme oversight gpf and human resources management 7b strategic planning 15 as opposed to the commitments made in the ops19 that priorities would be selected on the basis of knowledge and strategic visi on unodcs operations were mostly demand driven and seldom selected on the basis of strategic objectives of the organization there was limited coherence between the different planning documents field offices specific strategic programme frameworks spf and project planning documents were not fully aligned with overall subprogramme logical frameworks some programmes and projects were seen as ad hoc and uncoordinated done in hurry withou t the necessary internal consultation there was clarity in the use of terms and the use of planning nomenclature varied depending on the document this generated confusion and frustration among unodc staff unodc presented consolidated budget to the cnd 20 that was not clearly aligned to the regular budget presented to the ga21 which further exacerbated confusion and complicated the budgeting process adding layers of commitments and goals22 without reporting back on results oios also noted with concern the limite d staff awareness of the roles of the multiple strategic documents how they support and supplement each other and how best to use them in particular the budgeting process as approved by the general assembly 16 to alleviate some of the current confusion and in an effort to improve coherence in planning have sharper profile and make more efficient use of its resources oios noted that unodc engaged in the preparation of strategic plan titled towards security and justice for all which aims at laying out st rategic medium term plan to be implemented through biennial business plan this new stra tegic plan is promising endeavor provided that it is aligned with the regular budgeting process and will not be duplicative layer to it single integrated and resultsoriented plan which includes all unodcs activities and expected results regardless of the source of funding as mandated by the general assembly has to be pursued 23 in this line there must be uniformity in the use of terms methods and approaches to bring further coherence to th planning process as well as decisionmaking24 consequently the new strategic plan must include the geographic components as the operative arms of unodc including the administrative and management components25 as the enablers to effective and efficient programme implementation to be fully complete c fund raising 17 one of the main concerns of unodc was the dwindling of the general purpose funds gpf26 despite unodc efforts to sustain its funding level it has not surpassed 20 19 this document is available by following the link httpwwwunodcorgpdfed_guidelines_mediumtermpdf 20 ecbn7200512add1 21 see pages 1315 1821 and 3034 of a606 sect 16 and the budget presented to the cnd ecbn7200512adds pages 2855 22 ecbn7200512add1 see the specific commitments by branches and sections 23 stsgb20008 paragraph 2 24 the reliance on xb funding and fragmented approach to planning has brought occasional overlap and disparity to operational modalities that has affected decision making 25 these include advocacy cofinancing and partnerships management human resources it etc 26 gpf are unearmarked voluntary contributions which finance unodcs infrastructure costs at headquarters vienna and in the field in 2006 these are estimated at 132 million for the drugs programme and 17 million for the crime programme and those core programmes that do not attract sufficient earmarked contributions information technology systems for member states 06 million laboratory and scientific services 04 million illicit crop monitoring programme 06 million 16 million estimated for the 8million of contributions annually and in the pa st two years contributions have fallen by 20 from 185 million in 2004 to 149 million in 2005 on the other hand due mainly to higher salary costs expenditures have increased from 163 million in 2002 to 201 million in 2004 but these were recently reduced to 179 million as result of savings applied by unodc management this has put the gpf in precarious situation as its balance of approximately 11 million in 2003 went down to 9 million in 2004 and to only 6 million in 2005 proposals to provide sustainable funding to the gpf as opposed to the current adhoc method of funding were presented to major donors in june 2005 hoping to commit them to certain level of core funding however donors were not able to reach consensus to support the proposals oios noted that unodc had prepared series of briefing documents on the gpf situation and noted that the proposed way forward was mostly related to saving measures to not deplete the fund balance re cently unodc implemented additional saving measures with the freeze of 17 posts which was still considered not to be enough for the sustainability of the gpf under the current trends of increasing expenditures and diminishing contributions the gpf could be depleted by the end of 2007 table 1 18 unodc efforts to generate savings are to be commended however more strategic analysis should have been considered when implementing them oios believes that focus on decreasing expenditures is not enough to reve rse the current trend efforts should be revitalized in mobilizing stakeholders and partners to increase gpf contributions oios noted that there is fundraising strategy the current pool of major donors has shown reticence to increase its support for gpf due to inter alia unclear reporting on the funds use and its results thus more fforts should be invested in improving the clarity and details of the reporting on fund utilization and results at tained global approach to fundraising drugs programme in 2006 of which 08 million pertains to advances deemed unrecoverable because the earmarked funding originally expected is longer forthcoming 9coupled with mechanism to increase transparency and consultation between unodc donors and beneficiaries of its services should be explored through the establishment of consultative committee to ensure that the fundi ng priorities are in line with the strategy and report periodically on the progress made on its use to the cnd and cjcp 19 while cofinancing and partnership section cps is trying to improve the fundraising efforts these were often adhoc an d not systematic branches and sections as well as fos were in continuous search for project funding without clear guidance or coordination which resulted in branches competing rather than cooperating fos could also be more effective if their fundraising effort s are supported by clear guidelines on how to approach it locally d organizational efficiency structure and internal coordination 20 despite the best intentions of the restructuring exercise27 and its four pillars operations treaty affairs research and ma nagement oios noted that competition uneven coordination and cooperation were three recurrent issues fettering the working environment and implementation of the work programme while the organizational structure was identified by some as the source of the problem oios explored different alternatives but was unable to recommend new structure that would lead to more cooperative set up it noted however that there were plenty of areas where responsibility of functions were not clear and where duplication existed the first challenge in improving cooperation and diminishing competition would be to clarify those functions and the division of labour between the different organizational entities below the divisions and their comparative advantage and value added vis√†vis the objectives and priorities of unodc where necessary and useful thematic teams should be created to work ac ross sections deliver agreedon projects and products while also clearly identifying the leading organizational entity deadlines and deliverables 21 oios noted that coordination was to be the responsibility of the office of the executive director oed as per the unodc tor however this function has not led to any discernible improvement important management initiatives such as rbm 4rs project cycle management pcm were not given appropriate followup as result of the lack of fulltime office manager naturally the ro of deputy the unodc deputy executive directors functions were not cl early defined at the time of the reorganization and they are usually assigned to divisional director position which has other substantive responsibilities this might be good opport unity for unodc to consider following the best practices from comparable programmes in appointing formal and dedicated ded who will take on some of the managerial responsibilities that rest with the ed allowing the latter to fully concentrate on more strategic and policy oriented goals and results of the organization crosscutting functions such as strategic planning programme performance assessment advocacy funding and coordination could be so of the main areas of responsibility of such post transitionally and given the funding situation those management initiatives to institute change could be initiated by the change management core group cmcg which was created to promote the implementation of crucial projects that were lagging behind such as rbm pcm strengthening monitoring and reporting 4rs etc field offices 27 the operational guidelines called for restructuring based on recommendation 4 of oios report a5683 10 22 unodc has network of 21 fieldoffices which vary considerably in programme size and content and are mostly staffed by extra budgetary or project personnel more than two thirds 70 of unodc staff 791 are currently deployed in the 21 fos including the ny liaison office only 13 of those fos posts 105 are administered by unodc in many instances support received from headquarters was hampered by the fact that the remaining 87 of fos staff are administered by unops or undp especially regarding human resource support and training fos have unclear expectations on the type of services they should receive from headquarters guidance and training provided to fos concerning regulations rules and procedures were sketchy nd disjointed guidelines for new fo staff as well as comprehensive methodological tools fo r operating fos or other reference manuals were not available 23 oios noted that one of the main concerns in the fos is capacity building and skill diversification programme for its staff which is currently not available oios believes that an important component of having motivated co mpetitive and effective staff delivering technical assistance to countries in need is the ability to exchange talent and knowledge as envisaged in the ops this has not been addressed effectively and can only be done by providing the fos with the appropriate tools to be competitive training for fos staff and the development of field presence manual to in stitute comprehensive dissemination of best practices success stories and procedures to deal with the most pressing issues would be good starts 24 as normative and service provider organization it is essential that unodc keeps its resources balanced with substantive critical mass in hq able to support and ensure that the fos operate efficiently and effectively at the country and regional level while redeployment and reprofiling were two of the 4r initiatives aimed at strengthening the operations and provision of assistance of member states oi noted that decisions on how to implement them were at times ad hoc without the necess ary consultation based on limited criteria or short term developments and not comprehensive study of the situation in the regions oios noted for example proposals to decentralize regional section which had only 6 staff in hq backstopping 160 in the region without full review of the backstopping needs 28 more recently unodc decided to close the regional office for the caribbean affecting 29 countries based solely on its funding situation in this particular case oios noted with concern that while the funding situation was precarious prior to 2004 not enough efforts have been made to redress the situation oios beli eves that any reprofiling decisions should be based on strategy the regional needs wider consultation and analysis of the strategic and programmatic variables necessary to achieve unodc goals in order to avoid gaps in support to member states requests while the last and only reprofiling effort did set out typology for fos based on its size and profile the study was based mostly on resources and level of post deployed in fos oios believes that co mprehensive reprofiling study that includes programmatic criteria and is ba sed on approved strategic priorities would be timely and appropriate once reviewed and formalized the new configuration of fos should be presented to intergovernmental bodies 28 excom minutes of 30 january and 8 february 2006 figures provided by do on the resources available as at april 2006 oios noted that currently 27 posts are substantively backstopping 708 in the fos this represents 3 of hq staff backstopping 97 1125 considering that fos represent more than half of unodcs staff oios noted that consultation with the fos for decision making was limited coordination between fos and hqs as well as amongst fos was not optimal while knowledge sharing was improved with the project financial management system profi its use was limited to accessing project information sharing of lessons learned and best practices were the exception rather than the rule while an important benefit to be achieved from fo network is the availability exchange and use of information oios noted that horizontal information exchange among fos was sporadic and unstructured it was mostly driven by individual initiative oios believes the next step is to systematize knowledge sharing and allow fo networks to manage it enhancing virtual interaction by way of di scussion forums and thematic eworking groups to facilitate consultation amongst fos and with hq the annual fo representatives seminar that facilitates discussions on how to improv the work of the fos network is to be commended however there is mandatory requirement to implement their recommendations there is periodic followup on their implementation and the sharing of best practices case studies and performance assessment are not established items on the agenda resource centre initiative was discussed recently but at the time of the inspection this had not materialized 26 oios noted that in an effort to enhance fos oversight management reviews were introduced and undertaken on the operational and financial aspects of fos work by the division for management in collaboration with the division for operations while oios had difficulty identifying the criteria used to determine the need for management review and the appropriate periodicity eight reviews were undert aken to date the results and impact of the reviews were difficult to distinguish as well as their use as an instrument for the fos to learn lessons as there was little distinguishable followup oios noted that the independent evaluation unit ieu was not part of providing methodological support or guidance to the management reviews and that the recommendatio ns issued were not systematically followed up 27 oios noted that fos are required to produce 20 reports annually at different periods between quarterly project progress reports bi annual reports on countryregional profile monthly substantive reports covering more or less the same issues in addition to project progress evaluation reports oios believes that these should be rationalized and streamlined to keep few that would be comprehensive and useful by for example having quarterly programmeproject progress assessment reports th at would cover progress status of outputs and activities achievement of results at the project and programme levels and financial information all based on the commitments made at the planning stage other necessary elements such as major political developments that have an impact on drug crime and terrorism issues could also be reported as additional subheadings finally fo progress evaluation report could be prepared every year covering all aspects of fos implementation including lessons learned reports on financia l expenditures and forecast should be prepared upon request this would help to avoid duplications and generate savings on time and resources that could be invested improving the reports quality by including lessons learned and areas in need of improvement such information should help to build up common repository of best practices nd lessons learned amongst fos f management practices 1228 while improvements in staffmanagement relations were noted wider consultation with the staff council through the joint advisory committee is required in contrast to the previous inspection a5683 oios noted improved transparency in decision making through the executive committee the use of extrack tracking mechanism to monitor the implementation of eds decisions following exco m consultations has further enhanced their followup and management accountability however wider access and dissemination of the excom decisions implementation would improve transparency further 29 in oios view the excom does not lend itself to focused and indepth discussion of substantive issues the multiprogramme composition and sometimes ad hoc nature of meeting scheduling suggests that meetings could be organized more efficiently and effectively including periodic reviews of decisions not implemented 30 oios noted that the approval process of authoritative documents such as the needed to be reviewed so that clear guide lines on what constitutes approved valid and compulsory instructions are applied 31 oios noted that while four mechanisms for internal communication and coordination are promulgated only the excom and the divisionsbranchessection meetings with few exceptions are operational the senior st aff meeting sst and management review committee mrc are irregular and have limited impact one recurrent complaint noted by oios was that middle management was seldom consulted prior to decisionmaking this undermined their role as the link between staff and senior management oios noted with concern that the information sharing coordinating and programme direction role of the sst was not being achieved the minutes of meetings were not available on the intranet or profi and participation from the fos was nonexistent oios is of the view that fos suggestions and perspectives need to inform decisionmaking if coordination is to be bolstered and performance improved g project management 32 effective project implementation requires or ganized processes and clarity in roles and responsibilities as well as adequate followup monitoring and assessment of results in response to oios recommendation and in an effo rt to improve project management in all its aspects unodc established the programme and project committee ppc and launched the programme and project cycle management p cm aiming at enhancing capacities and skills in these areas progress so far has been limited while the ppc established certain parameters and procedures for project approval the pro cess was still fragmented and uncoordinated there were clear and uniform criteria for project development and the alignment between new projects regional and country needs an d unodc strategic objectives was not easily discernible in some cases project implemen tation was slow and protracted monitoring of commitments and results were inadequate ppcs semiannual review of the project portfolio was based on analysis of financial implementa tion without any assessment of achievements the fact that ppc has not yet assessed the results of the project portfolio seems symptomatic that oversight monitoring and reporting have been restricted to financial performance monitoring 33 considering that more than twothirds of unodcs work is dedicated to the implementation of projects oios noted with co ncern that only one of the four phases of the 13pcm have been completed since 2004 the normative training and computerbased training phases have been stalled pending the revi ew of the diagnostic phase since then29 oios could not find any evidence of the implementa tion of the recommendations of the diagnostic phase report however it did note wide agreement among staff in that pcm should be implemented as matter of priority h rbm and programme performance management 34 the proper use of existing mechanisms and tools to monitor commitments and to manage the programme of work are key components of an effective resultsbased and well governed organization oios called for st rengthening of oversight and evaluation of projects and programmes financial oversight and rbm30 while unodc strengthened its financial oversight and certain aspects of its programmatic performance through profi it has not yet fully embraced rbm as management tool monitoring and reporting as well as performance assessment was partial and adhoc fos did not follow the strategic programme frameworks structure to monitoring their pe rformance resultant re ports were completed using parameters different from those set in the commitments made at the planning stage while profi reports did follow uniform standard s their quality and comprehensiveness was uneven oios noted with concern that there was limited coordination to provide leadership and guidance on the implementation of rbm and the respective monitoring and reporting efforts 35 unodc initially committed to rbm in 2003 31 however at the time of this review subprogramme level monitoring and reporting were not yet fully operational while oios noted recent initiative to revamp the implementation of rbm action plan was approved and immediate measures were taken to redr ess the situation an essential component of ensuring the realization of rbm for it to take root in the organization and be credible driver of good governance is the full commitment from senior management to its implementation by establishing responsibilities making subprogramme managers accountable for achieving results encouraging monitoring and followup on every aspect of its implementation and undertaking periodic review s of performance at the senior level 36 one of the hindrances to full realization of rbm is the limited knowledge of staff and management of the different approaches and mechanisms of rbm implementation in the secretariat contrary to the ppbme rules and regulations that all outputs and results must be reported to the ga regardless of their source of funding unodc was only reporting on 10 of their projects through imdis 37 oios noted solid knowledge and expertise in the terrorism prevention branch of the division for treaty affairs to promote rbm effo rts and provide any necessary guidance on it other organizational units were not fully familiar with rbm implementation or imdis use as comprehensive tool for programme performance information oios noted that while recent initiative to produce an annual report on its activities was to be commended this was 29 the report was released in november 2005 30 recommendations 8 and 9 of a5683 further called for managers to be kept abreast of all aspects of programme evolution problems encountered cost involved and results achieved 31 paragraph 10 of ecn7200314 14output oriented and not based on the results committed to member states this is not in line with rbm i independent evaluation 38 an operationally independent evaluation function reporting directly to the head of the organization andor the governing body has been recognized and endorsed by the evaluation group uneg as norm that ensure s the production of credible objective and transparent assessments to help inform decisionmaking on results attained and areas that need improvement unodc has been at the forefront of establishing such function through the creation of the independent evaluation unit ieu however its independence has been compromised by its organizational setup its reporting lines and the conflict of interests between its evaluation mandate and those of the division it reports to division for policy analysis and public affairs in line with the established norms and standards for evaluation in the system the ieu should have operational independence in order to ensure the credibility objectivity and impartiality of its evaluation findings this has not always been the case in unodc in addition to revising its tor the ieu should review its operating mechanisms as well as clarify its role as provider of advice to the different organizational entities in unodc 39 ieus work is becoming essential to the enhancement of programme efficiency effectiveness and oversight by way of themat ic and programme evaluations and support to project evaluations its consolidated annual evaluation report is particularly useful in identifying crosscutting areas for improvement and its recommendations have initiated change in several fronts this has been supported by the cnd32 however the implementation of change is usually hindered by the lack of followup and monitoring of the recommendation issued and the timely update on their status to the intergovernmental processes in oioss view this would help ensure accountability and transparency oios noted that while there has been some effort in establishing clear roles definitions and guidelines on the use of evaluation the polic ies instructions and methodologies are not consistently defined or used j information communication and knowledge management 40 it tools and initiatives have improved unodcs efficiency in line with unodcs reporting oios noted that profi facilitated project management and financial monitoring thereof in hq and the fos other it initiatives such as electronic office and remote access have led to more efficient operations and fos integration into the communication flow and access to information the informat ion technology service its now operates and manages 36 lotus notes emailworkflow servers in 27 countries this represented great enhancement regarding data security system wide stability and uniform computerbased work methods antimoney laundering and financ ial crimes software among other services have also been provided for the use of memb er states all this progress notwithstanding oios noted that thorough guidelines on the util ity and comparative advantages of profi and other webbased applications besides the faq nd userguides are not available the use of the various workflow applications is still source of confusion amongst unodc unov and oosa staff all of which are serviced by its the intranet pages were not periodically 32 resolution of cnd 482 paragraph 4 took note of the findings of the ieu and encouraged ed to implement its recommendations 15updated and its structure was not sufficiently us erfriendly the roles between the intranet and profi were not clearly defined and this cr eated further confusion and duplication oios noted that the logical programmatic connection between different planning elements such as project documents fo spfs and subprogramme logframes that would give unodc strategic coherence were not supported by it tools 41 oios noticed with concern that periodic revi ews on the usefulness or effectiveness of webbased applications not used for some time were not undertaken differences between the fos websites with uneven quality and outdated information were also evident guidelines established at unodc headquarters were not cons istently applied in the field in spite of previous oios recommendation to that effect 33 oios noted that one of the downsides of it management is the lack of formal mechanism to assess their performance track client satisfaction at all levels and report their ach ievements to the intergovernmental bodies 42 given the diverse and complex fos structure and sensitive issues such as crime drugs and terrorism and their imp lications oios noted with concern that unodc lacks communications strategy that would guide information sharing public awareness and outreach this was identified as one immediate concern and work in this area can bring about more coherent public image of unodc to further support the goals and needs of unodc while oios noted the efforts of ttracting goodwill ambassadors to promote unodcs work as commendable public relations in itiative this is currently done in an ad hoc fashion and without any clear guidelines or analysis on how they can support unodcs objectives more effectively 43 knowledge management km was noted to be priority as early as 200434 while unodc has made substantial progress in knowledge sharing it still needs coherent approach to it and full realization of the in ternet as tool for organizing processing and sharing information on substantive issues as well as vehicle for sharing best practices between hq the fos and amongst stakeholders oios noted that there was strategy or action plan on how to manage and disseminate knowledge at the different levels of the organization as catalyst in the drug crime and terrorism debate unodc must be able to identify and map intellectual assets within the office in order to be able to create knowledge for comparative advantage and full utilization of such information as unodc recently recognized km strategy is essential to ensuring coordinated approach in the implementation of projects and programmes km should help to optimize the internal flows storage and dissemination of information safe guard institutional memory and facilitate its use and access to it by promoting immedi ate and virtual knowledge sharing through communities of practice networks on drug crime and terrorism issues within and outside the and the creation of thematic modules of information accessible through km portal k human resources management 44 one of the key components of unodc reforms was to improve the human resources hr management to ensure that it conforms to the regulations and rules for 33 audit of united nations office on drugs and crime information and communications technology management ae200432102 report e05r05 04 may 2005 paragraph 34 34 paragraph 159 recommendation 13 of the ieu 2004 annual evaluation report 16fairness transparency and objectivity35 oios noted significant improvements in the efficiency of staff administration recruitment and other hr request processing as result of automation however as service oriented unit major downside to hr management was the lack of client satisfaction feedback to fe ed its performance assessment as noted above hr services and guidance to the fos needs improvement by way of guidelines induction manuals and prompt response to their request for services 45 while the majority of staff considered the webbased forms and information available useful there was very little material regarding capacity building and career development in substantive areas oios noted improvements in the training management in hq including the developments of actual plans however further monitoring of their implementation more staff involvement and information as well as real focus on substantive training to enhance staff capacities on crime drugs and terrorism related issues is ne cessary for it to be effective 46 oios noted that transparency in the select ion process was partly flawed by way of exceptions 36 in cases where they did not seem necessary unodc should restrict the application of exceptions only where and when they are justified and clearly necessary for operational efficiency improvements to the hr action plan process such as achieving the targets on vacancy management and geographical distribution as well as on the establishment of an accountability panel related to the hr compliance in accordance to ares59266 would also help to improving transparency the appointment of the ombudsman which had been vacant for close to two years needs urgent attention v conclusions 47 while unodc reforms are on the right track oios is of the opin ion that some areas require urgent attention and followup for fu ll realization of their potential the reforms geared towards improving governance opera tions staff management relations and communication have certainly yielded some benefits and improvements in overall delivery nevertheless there is still need for fu rther improvements including qualitative enhancement and methodological approach to funding and budgeting the finalization of coherent overarching strategy the strengthening of the ieu and the presentation of comprehensive picture of the difference it has actually made to the global drugs and crime challenge 48 despite the enormous challenge to fight the uncivil society achieve security and justice for all and make the world safer from drugs crime and terrorism unodc needs to be realistic about where its work can achieve the greatest impact along these lines unodc must use the tools it has within its reach to do so in an even more efficient and effective way this means firstly in terms of tools fully realizing the potential of rbm km coherent and aligned planning as well as strengthening monitoring and evaluation as well as transparency through ensuring that its governance of xbfunded activities is scrutinized by the ga review and oversight secondly regarding ambitions in order for unodc to become centre of 35 this was in line with oios recommendation in a5683 in its report on commitment to good governance unodced1 unodc contemplated the full implementation of the 4rs 1 at the field offices level study on their reconfiguration 2 at the level of management the reorganization of the office including the application of hr management including gender balance 3 recruitment of young and international staff among other initiatives 36 specifically the application of paragraph 24 of stsgb20024 and annex iv of stai234 rev1 17excellence on drugs crime and antiterrorism issues it needs to clarify its internal roles and comparative advantages as well as support strengthen and where necessary rationalize the fos network to deliver the technical assistan ce programme lastly regarding resources it needs predictable and stable funding so that it is able to attend to member states request to build their capacity to face these colossal challenges vi recommendations
