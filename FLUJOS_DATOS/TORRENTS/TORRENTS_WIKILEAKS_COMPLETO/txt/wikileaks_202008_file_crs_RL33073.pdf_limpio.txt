heavily indebted poor countries issues for congress summary in recent decades the rapid growth in poor country debt has emerged as key foreign policy concern many analysts belie ve that this debt burden is an impediment to economic growth and poverty reduc tion others contend that for the poorest countries other factors such as weak po litical and economic institutions are greater impediment to growth than the debt burden there have been many efforts to help reduce poor country debt in 1988 group of major creditor nations known as the pari s club agreed for the first time to cancel debts owed to them instead of refinanc ing them on easier terms as they had done previously in 1996 the international monetary fund imf the world bank and the regional development banks agreed to allow portion of debts owed to them by select group of countries to be cancelled this effort is known as the debt relief initiative for heavily indebted poor count ries hipc in june 2005 the group of eight g8 nations agreed to furthe r deepen debt relief and proposed 100 cancellation of all mu ltilateral debt for countries th at have finished the hipc program several pieces of legislati on hr 1130 and s 1320 also have been introduced that could extend debt relief to an even larger group of countries as introduced the g8 proposal rais four possible concerns scope of debt cancellation the proposed agreement is limited to the imf the world bank and the african development bank several other development banks are major creditors and are not included in the proposal net new assistance the proposed agreement specifies that hipc countries that receive debt reduction will have their total assistance flows reduced by the amount of debt forgiven this money will then be reallocated among all lowincome countries funding is not assured the agreement promises that g8 countries will compensate the deve lopment banks for any debt relief they provide however future contributions to the development banks are not guaranteed future commitments are unspecified the agreement commits g8 members to cover the cost of debt relief for countries that may later enter the hipc process pending on which if any countries are added the potential cost of bt relief may rise significantly congressional appropriations are required at this time to implement the g8 proposal however additional us funds may need to be appropriated in the future to fund higher levels of hipc debt relief this report will longer be updated for information on the current status of the g8 debt relief proposal see crs

has emerged as key foreign policy concern as early as 1967 the united nations conference on trade and development unctad argued that debt service payments in many poor nations had reached critical situations2 since then and notably in the last ten years there has been pressure exerted on national bilateral creditors and multilateral lenders such as the international m onetary fund or the world bank by non governmental organizations ngos and veral western nations for creditors to cancel all debts owed to them by the poor est and least developed countries in speech to the united nations in 2002 uk chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown challenged developed na tions to help build virt uous circle of debt relief poverty reduction and sustaina ble development for the l ong term for the worlds poorest countries3 according to us secretary of the treasury john snow debt has been locking these poorest countries in to poverty and preventing them from using their own resources for development requiring repayment of the debt is he added morally wrong4 much of the recent debt relief momentum has been spurred by the jubilee formerly the jubilee 2000 debt campaign initially launched in 1996 the jubilee campaigns mission is to convince major creditor nations to cancel the unpayable debts of the poorest countries under fair and transparent process5 the international campaign is spearheaded primarily by vari ous catholic and prot estant organizations that have had longstanding involvement in debt relie f issues and includes numerous highprofile supporters such as sir bob gel dof an irish rock singer and activist and bono lead singer of the irish band u2 debt relief proponents often maintain that poor country debt is illegitimate or according to bono immoral and unjust6 this claim rests on the socalled odious debt argument odious debt is normally c onsidered to be debt which benefits ruling elites in borrowing country through graft and corruption but s little or benefit for the general population debt critics question whether successor regimes should be obligated under internati onal law to repay money th at was stolen wasted or otherwise used in ways having little benefit for their people although the odious debt concept has gained popularity in th ngo community it has not been endorsed by any international legal or financial body moreover there is almost likelihood that debts incurred through world bank or imf projects could be legally determined to be odious since they were undertaken for nominally developm entrelated

countries hipc at the meeting of the g8 finance ministers on june 11 2005 member nations extended debt relief and committed themselves to cancelling permanently all remaining multilateral hipc ex

face value countries that are in the ddle of the program or have not yet begun would receive total debt relief upon completion of the pr ogram if the remaining 20 countries complete the hipc program tota l debt relief could exceed 55 billion there are several root causes of th hipc debt burden 1999 imf study concluded that the rise in hipc debt had its origins in weak macroeconomic policies lack of economic structural reform and poor debt mana gement practices on the part of debtstressed countries as well as adverse trade shoc ks and political factors such as war famine and social strife11 the debt problem was compounded by the willingness of credito r nations and multilateral institutions to provide loans and accept risks that the private sector woul d not william easterly formerly world bank economist and currently professor at new york university points out that between 1979 and 1997 the imf and world ba nk provided more financing to hipcs than other countries of their income level despite hipc countries often poor economic policies12 the economic debate over debt relief among economists the likely success of debt relief in spurring meaningful economic reform or make s ubstantial inroads against poverty is often questioned critics maintain that money to fund debt relief must be transferred from other resources and there is risk that donors will take all or some of these resources from other parts of their foreign assistance budget s if this occurs overall resources for promoting development may not increase or may increase by less than the amount of debt relief provided more over many analysts argue that there are foreign aid activities such as additional investments in the legal fi nancial education or public health systems that may have greater impact on promoting economic growth and providing resources for pove rty reduction activities than debt relief second problem is determining whether the actual debt load is itself so big as to impede growth and development advocates of bt relief argue that such debt overhang must be relieved if count ry is to resume growth debt overhang theory most debt relief is grounded in the debt overhang theory which holds that the accumulation of large stock of debt will frighten off potential lenders nd investors it originated in the 1980s and was basedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33073crs5 13 walter molano from bad

external debt affects growth imf working paper 0415 january 1 2004 on the largely positive economic growth th at several heavily indebted countries experienced following 1989 debt relief in itiative known as the brady plan named after thenus treasury secretary nicholas brady13 the theory suggests that if investors expect countrys debt level to imp air its ability to repay its loans they will not invest out of concern that the govern ment may resort to distortionary measures such as expanding the money supply which promotes inflation or raising taxes on their profits to finance debt payments14 even if the debt is not being serviced the theory suggests that it is still an impediment to economic growth because of the effect the large debt stock s dissuading private investors when large stock of external debt is present creditor countries could continue to lend at concessiona l rates in the hope that conti nued aid will spur economic growth and that the recipient country will one day be able to repay its debts according to the debt overhang theory however it is better to forgive the debts either entirely or to some reduced sustainable level so that investor confidence will be restored it is presumed that at sustainable level debtor nations would be able to make some debt payments to their creditors without sacrificing economic growth debt overhang evidence 2002 study of 93 developing countries between 1969 and 1998 and fo llowup study of 61 countries over the same time period were cited as strong support for the debtoverhang theory the first study found that external debt began to have negative impact on growth when its net present value15 exceeded 160 to 170 of exports and 35 to 40 of gdp study simulations suggest that doubling the average stock of external debt in these countries would slow down annual per capita growth by Â½ to 1 the second study found that doubling countrys average exte rnal debt level would reduce growth of both per capita physical capital and produc tivity by almost 1 the studies concluded that large debt stocks nega tively affect growth by slowing both the accumulation of physical capital and productivity often at the expense of investment16 although the debt overhang theory may be true in general several new studies have argued that it does not hold for hipc countries one study points to two

significant am ount of private investment in the hipc countries and the hipc countries have never suffered negative net flow of resources because inflows of foreign aid are typically more than sufficient to cover debt payments18 moreover debt relief that th hipc countries have received has not been sufficient to allow them access to private sector credit markets thus rather than debt overhang some argue that lack of institutional capacity legal political educational health etc are the hipcs major impediments to economic growth and that in the absen ce of additional funds dedicated for debt relief other forms of targeted assistan ce may be more effective in boosting economic growth than debt relief if the economies of countries grew they argue the debt would not be problem

paris club does not exist as formal in stitution it is rather set of rules and principles for debt relief that have been agreed on by its members five principles and four rules currently govern paris

decisions are reached by full consensus among creditor nations 3 debt renegotiations are applied only for countr ies that clearly need debt relief as evidenced by implementing an internati onal monetary fund imf program and its requisite economic policy conditionality 4 solidarity is required in that all creditors will implement the terms agreed in the context of the renegotiations and 5 the paris club preserves the comparability of treatment between different creditors this means that debtor country cannot gran t to another creditor treatment on more favorable terms than the consensus

indebted poor countries program for much of their history the international financial institutions ifis argued that since they were lenders of last reso rt providing assistance to poor countries that could not borrow money from the global fina ncial markets they required preferred creditor status this means that the worl d bank and the imf would be paid first in the event that borrowers ran into financial difficulties and that debts owed to them would not be reduced under an circumstances forgiving their debts they argued would diminish their resources available fo r other poor and developing countries and set bad example for other i ndebted countries as they undertook often painful albeit economically crucial reforms this is the socalled moral hazard problem with debt relief some creditors argue that by providing debt relief they are creating moral hazard by convincing borrowers th at they need not worry about repayment despite initial reservations and at the g8s request the world bank and the imf created the hipc debt relief progra m in 1996 to reduce so multilateral debt in conjunction with bilateral debt forgiveness according to the imf and the world bank the goal of the hipc program would be to help the poorest and most indebted countries meet their current and future external bt service obligations in full without recourse to debt rescheduling or the accumulati on of arrears and without compromising growth27 in 1999 the program was expanded to pr ovide deeper faster and broader debt relief initially the hipc program determined that debt servicetoexports ratio28 of 250 was determined to be sustaina ble moreover it took minimum of six years for borrowers to qualify for debt relief critics charged that this ratio was too high and the timeframe too long

countries discussion of 100 debt relief began in earnest among the g8 nations at the february 5 2005 finance ministers meetin g in london at the meeting ministers announced their willingness to provide as much as 100 multilate ral debt relief39 moreover ministers intended to work w ith the african development bank and the world bank to bring forward proposals to achieve this additional debt relief without reducing the resources available to the poorest countries through these institutions40 central to the multilateral debt cancellation debate was whether to compensate the international fina ncial institutions for the amount of debt they would write off us officials had reportedly argued that the cost of multilateral debt relief could be borne by the institutions themselves w ithout compromising new assistance the world banks ibrd resources have increas ed steadily over the past several years and many argued that some of this mone could be diverted to provide ida debt relief without harming the banks financia l situation41 other creditors including great britain believed the institutions should be compensated for their debt forgiveness so as not to possibly weaken the credit standing of the world bank and force it to raise borrowing rates to ibrd borrowers42 on july 11 2005 g8 finance ministers compromised on plan to cancel all remaining hipc multilateral debt43 the compromise was that the multilateral development banks would receive new money from creditor nations to offset their debt reductions and the imf would absorb the cost of debt relief using internal resources principally the remainin g proceeds of the 1999 offmarket gold transactions with brazil and mexico ne w gold sales had been proposed during the 2005 discussion but like earlier proposals

either among the nine countri that have not yet reached the decision point or any new countries that the program accepts potential concerns since the proposal was released severa l critiques of it

have their gr oss assistance flows reduced by the amount of debt forgiven many woul d prefer that any debt relief be additional to current assistance this is based on the belief which is supported by some that according to recent research oneforone changes in debt service payments and official aid flows have net effect on ec onomic growth in this view any potential economic growth due to the increased re sources provided by debt relief may be negated by decrease in total net assistance55 limited debt cancellation as proposed the agreement only covers one regional development bank the african velopment bank although the majority of hipc countries are african several ar not and many owe debt to the other regional banks such as the interame rican development bank or the asian

on the transfer of real re sources to developing countries september 29 2004the amount of funding that the multila teral development banks would normally receive the world bank has expressed two add itional concerns over the proposed debt relief terms these are contained in an internal world bank presentation that was leaked to the press56 first although the world bank will write off the debt owed it immediately promised donor contributions to cover the cost of this debt relief will be spread out over the next decade since the agreement includes binding future commitment to cover donor contributions during this period the world bank is concerned that donor countries may not be committed to compensating the world bank for all of the debt payments it would have received from the debt relief recipients second many concessiona l loans from the development banks have terms lasting up to forty years but the propos only specifies repayment of lost debt payments for ten years theoretically the bank would lose 30 years worth of repayments under the proposal in response the world bank has suggest ed donor countries either make legal commitments now for the extra money needed to finance the debt relief or allow creditor countries to receive debt relief ove r time by relieving payments as they come due rather than wiping out the entire stock of debt immediately this would have the same effect on net flows to debt relief recipients without the world bank assuming potentially unfunded liability by cancelling ll debts owed to it immediately for the united states making legal commitment to finance additional debt relief would require congressional action future cost may rise depending on which countries are added the cost of hipc may increase when the hipc program was designed in 1996 twoyear sunset clause was included to limit the countri eligible for debt relief to those that have reached decision point as well as to prevent hipc from becoming permanent facility since then the sunset clause has been repeatedly extended in september 2004 the world bank and imf boards agreed again to extend the sunset clause by two years through 200657 the boards also
