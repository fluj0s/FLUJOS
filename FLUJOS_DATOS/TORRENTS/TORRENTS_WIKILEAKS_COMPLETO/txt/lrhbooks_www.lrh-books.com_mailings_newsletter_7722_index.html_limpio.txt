bridge publications inc newsletter date the power of an individual and the power of the individual alone is going to set him free not his symbols his power and that power has nothing whatsoever to do with setting up machine to give him power it has to do with his native abilitywhich is very nativeto create space to create energy and do the exact things which you are doing on sop 8c and those things when all added up give him force and power and when we get down to it finally its the power of knowing postulate is going to stay where he put it l ron hubbard excerpted from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lecture series sop 8c abbreviation for standard operating procedure 8 the goal of this system of operation is to return to the individual his knowledge skill and knowingness and to enhance his perception his reaction time and serenity being cause and predicting the future an article by l ron hubbard from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lectures so knowingness doesnt happen to depend upon the time stream and it doesnt happen to depend upon data and it doesnt depend upon geographical location and it just doesnt have any dependency because highestlevel knowingness and highestlevel causativeness are the same statement the best way to know any future is to cause one and thats why you see when you start consulting the oracle at delphi youve taken step downhill youve assigned cause to the futurefor the future elsewhere and when you get down so mean and impoverished imaginatively that you start to assign prediction of the future to dataoh boy is that debased you see you dont even give it the color and aesthetic of an oracle at delphi you see you dont have this beautiful girl standing over the volcanic fumes and consulting with the gods and getting drunk over the fumes and going and quoting some sort of riddle and the oracle doesnt get big costly present of ivory and gold or something of the sort and there arentoh and see theres color to it at all the fellow says now im going to be logical you know he sits down and chews on cigarette or something of the sort and he says now lets see let figure this out what conceited fellow he is anybody thatll sit down and say let figure this out admits hes trapped somewhere well cause must be all around himhe must be surrounded he is tooright in close hes right there in very very narrow piece of space he cant figure it out if he said all right now lets see now im going to know about it and im just going to know what all these factors are going to amount to he actually will come up with something like solution matter how strange the solution may sound thats probably whats going to happen but now lets go little bit higher and instead of saying now lets see how can i figure this out so i know whats going to happen supposing he says now lets see im going to accomplish end goal see he says this im going to accomplish end goal and thats all he does and he accomplishes end goal and thats very simple then he really has predicted the future hasnt he or he says im going to undo end goal so he does hes really predicted the future then so one predicts the future as much as one is cause the future isnt pattern laid out to abuse and bully you the future is beautiful playground that nobody happens to be combining you talk about virgin territorythe most virgin territory there is is the future you can do anything you want with it nobodys doing anything with it l ron hubbard from the lecture techniques which do or do not assign cause excerpted from the rehabilitation of the human spirit lectures
