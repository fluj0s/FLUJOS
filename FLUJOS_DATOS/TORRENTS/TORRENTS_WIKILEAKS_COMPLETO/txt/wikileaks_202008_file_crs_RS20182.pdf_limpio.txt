procedural mechanism suspended during declaration of war is the sequestration process under the 1985 act which enforces the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requirement during the years that these suspension provisions have been available the united states has been involved in several instances of armed hostilities abroad including the persian gulf war but budget enforcement procedures were not suspended in any of these instances because declaration of war was enacted congress and the president met the additional spending needs associated with these hostilities largely by using procedures that allow such spending to be declared emergency requirements thus freeing it from budget enforcement constraints this report will be updated as developments

federal budget process include within them provisions under which the procedures may be suspended because of low economic growth or war with regard to low economic growth the suspension of procedures occurs only if suspension resolution directed toward that purpose is enacted into law1 in the case of war the procedures are suspended automatically upon the enactment of declaration of war budget enforcement procedures federal budget policies are enforced under two major statutesthe congressional budget act of 1974 and the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 19852 budget enforcement procedures under the 1974 congressional budget act are for the most part permanent and ongoing whereas budget enforcement procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act are schedule d to expire at the end of fy20023 in his budget for fy2002 president bush proposed extending procedures under the 1985 act for several more years but congress has not yet acted on the proposal4 congressional budget act of 1974 the 1974 congressional budget act provides for the adoption by congress of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget the budget resolution recommends the total level of revenues spending the surplus or deficit and the public debt for each year covering at least fiveyear period spending for each fiscal year is distributed among the functional categories of the budget such as national defense agriculture and transportation in addition total spending is allocated to each of the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over discretionary or direct spending the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations by subcommittee if the house and senate wish to compel their committees to develop legislation conforming existing revenue direct spending or debtlimit law to budget resolution policies they may include reconciliation directives in the budget resolution so instructing the appropriate committees reconciliation submissions from committees usually are consolidated into an omnibus bill that is considered under expedited procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20182crs3 5 for more information on points of order under the 1974 act see us library of congress congressional research service points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturno crs report 97865 washington june 1 2001 15 pages 6 the current text of section 258b also references two other provisions of law but inappropriately 1 title vi of the 1974 act which was repealed by section 10118a of the budget enforcement act of 1997 pl 10533 111 stat 695 and 2 31 usc 1103 which generally states congresss commitment to the goal of avoiding deficits another provision of title 3131 usc 1105frequired the presidents annual budget submission to comply with the deficit targets established in the 1985 balanced budget act this requirement was terminated several years later when the use of deficit targets was abandoned presumably the drafters of section 258b had intended to refer to section 1105f not section 1103 in any event section 1103 does not contain any enforcement mechanism merely policy exhortationenforcement of budget resolution policies occurs as individual revenue and spending measures including any required reconciliation legislation are considered points of order established in different provisions of the 1974 congressional budget act allow members to object to legislation that would violate budget resolution policies unless the points of order are waived or set aside5 balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the 1985 balanced budget act as amended in 1990 and later years establishes adjustable limits on discretionary spending and subjects direct spending and revenue legislation to payas yougo paygo requirement under the paygo requirement direct spending and revenue legislation enacted during session may not in the net incur deficit on multiyear paygo scorecard the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement are enforced by sequestration procedure involving largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs sequestration is triggered shortly after the end of congressional session if the director of the office of management and budget omb estimates in sequestration report that one or more of the discretionary spending categories will be breached or the paygo requirement will be violated section 254 of the 1985 act requires the president to issue sequestration order carrying out any spending reductions identified by the omb director as being necessary to eliminate spending limit breach or paygo violation mechanisms automatically suspended six enforcement mechanismsfive in these two acts and one in the fy2002 budget resolutionare suspended automatically if declaration of war takes effect see box 1 for the most part the authority to suspend these mechanisms is provided in section 258b of the 1985 act but such authority is provided elsewhere as well as noted below6 four of the mechanisms involve points of order under the 1974 act against legislation that violates 1 the spending ceilings or revenue floors in the budget resolution 2 committee allocations and subdivisions of spending made under the budget resolution 3 deficitneutral requirement for amendments offered to

1985 balanced budget actbox 1 budget enforcement mechanisms automatically suspended if declaration of war is in effectthe section establishes point of order in the senate against legislation violating specified limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending for that fiscal year the remaining procedural mechanism suspended during declaration of war is the sequestration process under the 1985 act which enforces the discretionary spending limits and the paygo requirement these six enforcement mechanisms and the specific suspension provisions are discussed in more detail below section 302f of the 1974 act section 302 of the act provides for the allocation to committees of the aggregate spending levels in the budget resolution the house and senate appropriations committees in turn subdivide their total spending allocations among their 13 subcommittees this process allows the spending policies in the budget resolution to be enforced as individual bills particularly the annual appropriations acts are considered section 302f generally prohibits the consideration of legislation that would violate committee spending allocation or subdivision although section 302 of the act is silent regarding the suspension of the prohibition section 258b of the 1985 balanced budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20182crs5 act suspends the requirements of section 302f upon the enactment of declaration of war sections 310d1 and 2 of the 1974 act section 310 of the act sets forth budget reconciliation procedures under reconciliation budget resolution may include directives to house and senate committees to recommend changes in direct spending and revenue laws in order to bring direct spending and revenue levels into conformity with budget resolution policies the recommendations of the instructed committees usually are incorporated into an omnibus reconciliation bill which is considered under expedited procedures sections 310d1 and 2 generally prohibit amendments to reconciliation measures considered in the house and senate respectively that are not deficit neutral section 310d3 states that these requirements shall not apply if declaration of war by the congress is in effect in addition section 258b of the 1985 balanced budget act also suspends the requirements of section 310d upon the enactment of declaration of war section 311a1 of the 1974 act section 311a of the act generally prohibits the consideration of budgetary measures that would violate the aggregate levels in the budget resolution ie total budget authority outlays and revenues violations would occur if the legislation was expected to cause spending to exceed the ceilings or revenues to fall below the floors section 311a1 sets forth specific enforcement procedures that apply in the house except when declaration of war by the congress is in effect in addition section 258b of the 1985 balanced budget act also suspends the requirements of section 311a upon the enactment of declaration of war section 312b1 of the 1974 act section 312b1 of the act provides for point of order in the senate against the consideration of any measure that would cause the discretionary spending limits established under section 251 of the 1985 balanced budget act as adjusted to be exceeded section 312b2 suspends the application of the point of order provision if declaration of war by the congress is in effect section 258b of the 1985 balanced budget act does not refer to section 312b1 section 203c of the fy2002 budget resolution the discretionary spending limits currently in effect for fy2002 do not distinguish between defense and nondefense spending as had been the case for some prior fiscal years for purposes of enforcement only in the senate section 203c establishes separate defense and nondefense limits of new budget authority for fy2002 under firewall the separate limits are enforced by point of order under section 203c2a which requires three fifths vote to waive section 203c2b

discretionary spending limits the paygo requirement or both would occur shortly after the final omb report is issued in addition withinsession sequester under the discretionary spending limits could be required during the following session but prior to july 1 if the enactment of supplemental appropriations measure caused violation of the discretionary spending limits section 258b would preclude the subsequent issuance of any sequestration report or any sequestration order the enactment of suspension resolution would not however cancel sequestration order that already had been issued record of experience some of the provisions to suspend budget enforcement mechanisms originated in 1985 as part of the 1985 balanced budget act and others were added in later during the years that these suspension provisions have been available the united states has been involved in several instances of armed hostilities abroad including the persian gulf war7 budget enforcement procedures were not suspended in any of these instances however because declaration of war was enacted the last time the united states declared war occurred during world war ii when war was declared on japan germany and italy in december 1941 and on bulgaria hungary and romania in june 1942 one of the main purposes of the suspension provisions is to allow the federal government to respond to the sudden and urgent need for additional spending that arises when armed hostilities occur abroad current budget enforcement procedures however contain an alternate procedure for dealing with such needs most if not all spending for such activities is considered to be discretionary spending which is controlled by the appropriations committees rather than direct spending which is controlled by the legislative committees current budget enforcement procedures allow any spending designated as an emergency requirement by the president and congress in statute to be provided free of the constraints of the statutory discretionary spending limits and the associated procedures under the congressional budget process further under the budget enforcement act of 1990 spending for the persian gulf war automatically was deemed to be emergency spending without requiring any further action by the president and congress the president and congress have used this procedure over the years to designate billions of dollars in spending as emergency requirements for both military and nonmilitary activities8
