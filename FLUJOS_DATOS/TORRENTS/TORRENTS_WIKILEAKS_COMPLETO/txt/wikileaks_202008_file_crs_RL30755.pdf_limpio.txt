forestry practices funding levels and the federal role in wildland fire protection recent fire seasons have been by most standards among the worst in the past half century national attention began to focus on wildfires when prescribed burn in may 2000 escaped control and burned 239 homes in alamos nm president clinton responded by requesting doubling of wildfire management funds and congress enacted much of this proposal in the fy2001 interior appr opriations act pl 106291 president bush responded to the severe 2002 fires by proposing healthy forests initiative to reduce fuel loads by expediting review processes many factors contribute to the threat of wildfire damages two major factors are the decline in forest and rangeland health and the expansion of residential areas into wildlandsthe urbanwildland interface over the past century aggressive wildfire suppression as well as past grazing and logging practices have altered many ecosystems especially those where light surface fires were frequent many areas now have unnaturally high fuel loads eg dead trees and dense thickets and an historically unnatural mix of plant species eg exotic invaders fuel treatments have been proposed to reduce the wildfire threats prescribed burningsetting fires under specified conditionscan reduce the fine fuels that spread wildfires but can escape and become catastrophic wildfires especially if fuel ladders small trees and dense undergrowth and wind spread the fire into the forest canopy commercial timber harvesting is often proposed and can reduce heavy fuels and fuel ladders but exacerbates the threat unless and until the slash tree tops and limbs is properly disposed of other mechanical treatments eg precommercial thinning pruning can reduce fuel ladders but also temporarily increase fuels on the ground treatments can often be more effective if combined eg prescribed burning after thinning however some fuel treatments are very expensive and the benefit of treatments for reducing wildfire threats depend on many factors it should also be recognized that as long as bi omass drought and high winds exist catastrophic wildfires will occur only about 1 of wildfires become conflagrations but which fires will blow up into crown wildfires is unpredictable it seems likely that management practices and policies including fuel treatments affect the probability of such events however past experience with wildfires are of limited value for building predictive models and research on fire behavior under various circumstances is difficult at best thus predictive tools for fire protection and control are often based on expert opinion and anecdotes rather than on research evidence individuals who choose to build homes in the ur banwildland interface face some risk of loss from wildfires but can take steps to protect thei r homes federal state and local governments can and do assist by protecting their own lands by providing financial and technical assistance and by providing relief after the fire

various ecosystem health problems has substantially increased the risks to life and property from wildfire wildfires seem more common than in the 1960s and 1970s with the last three years being the most severe since 19602 national attention was focused on the problem by an escaped prescribed fire that burned 239 houses in alamos nm in may 2000 issues for congress include oversight of the agencies fire management activities and other wildland management practices that have altered fuel loads over time consideration of programs and processes for reducing fuel loads and federal roles and responsibilities for wildfire protection and damages funding for wildfire protection programs is also significant congressional issue but is covered separately in crs report rl33990 wildfire funding by ross w gorte many discussions of wildfire protection focus on the federal agencies that manage lands and receive funds to prepare for and control wildfires the forest service fs in the department of agriculture is the big brother among federal wildfirefighting agencies the fs is the oldest federal land management agency created in 1905 with fire control as principal purpose the fs administers more forestland in the 48 coterminous states than any other federal agency receives about twothirds of federal fire funding and created the symbol of fire prevention smokey bear the department of the interior doi contains several landmanaging agencies including the bureau of land management blm national park service fish and wildlife service and bureau of indian affairs doi fire protection programs are coordinated and funded through the blm despite the substantial attention given to the fs and doi agencies the majority of wildlands are privately owned 3 and states are responsible for fire protection for these lands as well as for their own lands this report provides historical background on wildfires and describes concerns about the wildlandurban interface and about forest and rangeland health the report discusses fuel management fire control and fire effects the report then examines federal state and landowner roles and responsibilities in protecting lands and resources

north america for millennia many fires were started by lightning although native americans also used fire for various purposes wildfires were problem for early settlers major forest fires occurred in new england and the lake states in the late 1800s largely fueled by the tree tops and limbs slash left after extensive logging one particularly devastating fire the peshtigo commonly cited as the

jan 18 2008 fire season severity is commonly assessed by acres burned but larger fires may not be worse if they burn less intensely because their damages may be lower however fire intensity and damages are not measured for each wildfire and thus cannot be used to gauge the severity of fire seasons it is uncertain whether acreage burned might be reasonable approximation of severity 3 in 1997

following several large fires that burned nearly 5 million acres in montana and idaho in 1910 the desire to control wildfires was founded on belief that fast aggressive control efforts were efficient because fires that were stopped while small would not become the large destructive conflagrations that are so expensive to control in 1926 the agency developed its 10acre policy that all wildfires should be controlled before they reached 10 acres in sizeclearly aimed at keeping wildfires small then in 1935 the fs added its 1000 am policy that for fires exceeding 10 acres efforts should focus on control before the next burning period began at 1000 am these policies were seen as the most efficient and effective way to control large wildfires 4 in the 1970s these aggressive fs fire control policies began to be questioned research had documented that in some situations wildfires br ought ecological benefits to the burned areas aiding regeneration of native flora improving the habitat of native fauna and reducing infestations of pests and of exotic and invasive species in recognition of these benefits the fs and the national park service initiated policies titled prescribed natural fire colloquially known as letburn policies under these policies fires burning within prescribed areas such as in wilderness areas would be monitored rather than actively suppressed if weather or other conditions changed or the wildfire threatened to escape the specified area it would then be suppressed these policies remained in effect until the 1988 wildfires in yellowstone national park because at least one of the major fires in yellowstone was an escaped prescribed natural fire the agencies temporarily ended the use of the policy today unplanned fire ignitions by lightning or humans that occur within site and weather conditions identified in fire management plans are called wildland fires for resource benefit and are part of the agencies fire use programs 5 aggressive fire control policies were abandoned for federal wildfire planning in the late 1970s the office of management and budget challenged as excessive proposed budget increases based on these policies and subsequent study suggested that the fire control policies would increase expenditures beyond efficient levels6 concerns about unnatural fuel loads were ra ised in the 1990s following the 1988 fires in yellowstone congress established the national commission on wildfire disasters whose 1994 report described situation of dangerously high fuel accumulations7 this report was issued shortly after major

calls for action to prevent future severe fire seasons the clinton administration developed western forest health initiative9 and organized review of federal fire policy because of concerns that federal firefighting resources had been diverted to protecting nearby private residences and communities at cost to federal lands and resources10 in december 1995 the agencies released the new federal wildland fire management policy program review final report which altered federal fire policy from priority for private property to equal priority for private property and federal resources based on values at risk pro tecting human life remains the first priority in firefighting concerns about historically unnatural fuel loads and their threat to communities persist in 1999 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office issued two reports recommending cohesive wildfire protection strategy for the fs and combined strategy for the fs and blm to address certain firefighting weaknesses 11 the clinton administration developed program called the national fire plan and supplemental budget request to respond to the severe 2000 fire season in the fy2001 interior appropriations act pl 106291 congress enacted the additional funding and other requirements for the agencies during the severe 2002 fire season the bush administration developed proposal called the healthy forests initiative to expedite fuel reduction projects in priority areas the various elements of the proposal were debated but none were enacted during the 107 th congress12 some elements have been addressed through regulatory changes while others were addressed in legislation in the 108th congress especially the healthy forests restoration act of 2003 pl 10814813

the average annual acreage of fs protected land burned declined nearly every decade until the 1970s but rose substantially in the 1980s and 1990s concurrent with the shift from fire control to fire management furthermore the acreage of fs protected land burned did not exceed million acres annually between 1920 and 1986 since then more than million acres of fs protected land have burned in each of at least six years1987 1988 1994 1996 2000 and 2002 statistics on acreage burned by federal agency of jurisdiction have not been available from the national interagency fire center since 2002 in contrast the acreage burned of wildlands protected by state or other federal agencies has declined substantially since the 1930s and has continued at relatively modest level for the past 40 years as shown in table 1 there are still occasional severe fire seasons with more than 6 million acres burned nine times since 19601963 1969 1996 2000 2002 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 15 nonetheless even the worst of these fire seasons 2006 saw only slightly more acres burned than the annual average in the 1950s it should also be recognized that only small fraction of wildfires become catastrophic in one case study for 19861995 in colorado less than 1 of all wildfire ignitions grew to more than 1000 acres but these larger fires accounted for nearly 79 of the acreage burned16 more than 95 of the fires were less than 50 acres and these 12608 fires accounted for only 3 of acreage burned thus small percentage of the fires account for the vast majority of the acres burned and probably an even larger share of the damages and control costs since the large fires conflagrations burn more intensely than smaller fires and suppression costs per acre are higher for conflagrations because of overhead management costs and the substantial cost of aircraft used in fighting conflagrations t able 1 average annual acreage burned by decade since 1910 in acres burned annual ly decade average ann ual acres

valuable timber to fire and about the effects of fire on soils watersheds water quality and wildlife in addition the loss of houses and other structures adds to wildfire damages historically wildfires were considered major threat to people and houses primarily in the brushy hillsides of southern california however people have increasingly been building their houses and subdivisions in forests and other wildlands and this expanding wildlandurban interface has increased the wildfire threat to people and houses also century of using wildlands and suppressing wildfires has apparently significantly increased fuel loads at least in some ecosystems and led to historically unnatural combinations of vegetation and structures exacerbating wildfire threats17

meet combustible vegetation18 this interface includes wide variety of situations ranging from individual houses and isolated structures to subdivisions and rural communities surrounded by wildlands while this situation has always existed to some extent subdivisions in wildland settings appear to have grown significantly over the past two decades standard definitions of the interface have been developed by the federal agencies19 but have not been used to assess the changing situation one particular aspect is that the growth of the interface has also increased the roads into wildland settings increased road access has both benefits and costs for protecting resources and people from wildfires increased human access generally increases the frequency of wildfire ignitions 88 of the fires from 19881997 were caused by humans with only 12 caused by lightning while humancaused fires can be catastrophic they are typically in accessible areas and thus can often be controlled more

fire crews can find their way and are sufficiently wide for firefighting equipment increased access can allow for faster control efforts and probably reduces the risk of structure being burned however poorly marked or unmarked narrow twisting roads exist in some wildland subdivisions in part because homeowners want to minimize nonlocal traffic in and through the subdivision in such situations the poor access may exacerbate the wildfire threat to homeowners most observers agree that protecting homes and other structures in the interface is an appropriate goal for safeguarding the highest values at risk from wildfire however there are differences of opinion about how to best protect the wui fs rese arch has indicated that the characteristics of the structures and their immediate surroundings are the primary determinants of whether structure burns in particular nonflammable roofs and cleared vegetation for at least 10 meters 33 feet and up to 40 meters 130 feet around the structure is highly likely to protect the structure from wildfire even when neighboring structures burn 20 others propose reducing fuels in band surrounding communities in the wui many proposals for fuel reduction suggest treatments within halfmile sometimes quartermile of wui communities still others suggest that reducing fuels on wildlands re moved from the wui can nonetheless protect communities by reducing the danger of uncontrollable conflagrations21 g8g152g155g142g156g157g561g138g151g141g561g20g138g151g144g142g149g138g151g141g561g10g142g138g149g157g145g561 the increasing extent of wildfires in the national forests in the past two decades has been widely attributed to deteriorating forest and rangeland health resulting at least in some cases directly from federal forest and rangeland management practices ecological conditions in many areas particularly in the intermountain west the rocky mountains through the cascades and sierra nevadas have been altered by various activities beginning more than century ago livestock grazing affected ecosystems by reducing the amount of grass and changing the plant species mix in forests and on rangelands this reduced the fine fuels that carried surface fires allowed them to spread encouraged trees to invade traditionally open grasslands and meadows and allowed nonnative species to become established all of which experts believe induce less frequent but more intense wildfires 22 in addition first to support mining and railroad development and later to support the wood products industry logging of th large pines that characterized many areas has led to regeneration of smaller less fireresistant trees in some areas23 roads that provide access for logging grazing and recreation have also been implicated in spreading nonnative species24 the nature extent and severity of these forest and rangeland health problems vary widely depending on the ecosystem and the history of the site in rangelands the problem is likely to be 20 jack d cohen

in others eg southern pines and western mixed conifers the problem may be dense undergrowth of different plant species eg palmetto in the south and firs in the west in still others eg ponderosa pine stands the problem is more likely to be stand stagnation eg too many little green trees because intraspecies competition rarely kills ponderosa pines one fs research report has categorized these health problems for wildfire protection by classifying ecosystems according to their historical fire regime 25 the report describes five historical fire regimes i ecosystems with lowseverity surface fires at least every 35 years often called frequent fire ecosystems ii ecosystems with stand replacement fires killing much of the standing vegetation at least every 35 years iii ecosystems with mixed severity fires both surface and stand replacement fires at 35 100 year intervals iv ecosystems with stand replacement fires at 35100 year intervals and v ecosystems with stand replacement fires at 200 year intervals it is widely recognized that fire suppression has greatly exacerbated these ecological problems at least in frequent fire ecosystems fire regimes i and iimost grass and brush ecosystems and many forest ecosystems eg southern yellow pines and ponderosa pine that evolved with frequent surface fires that burned grasses needles and other small fuels at least every 35 years depending on the site and plant species surface fires reduce fuel loads by mineralizing biomass that may take decades to rot and thus provide flush of nutrients to stimulate new plant growth historically many surface fires were started by lightning although native americans used fires to clear grasslands of encroaching trees stimulate seed production and reduce undergrowth and small trees that provide habitat for undesirable insects eg ticks and chiggers and inhibit mobility and visibility when hunting 26 eliminating frequent surface fires through fire suppression and other activities has led to unnaturally high fuel loads by historic standards in frequent fire ecosystems these historically unnatural fuel loads can lead to stand replacement fires in ecosystems adapted to frequent surface fires in particular small trees and dense undergrowth can create fuel ladders that sometimes cause surface fires to spread upward into the forest canopy in these ecosystems the frequent surface fires had historically eliminated much of the understory before it got large enough to create fuel ladders stand replacement fires in frequentfire ecosystems might regenerate new versions of the original surfacefire adapted ecosystems but some observers are concerned that 25 kirsten m schmidt james p menakis colin c hardy wendel j hann and david l bunnell development of coarsescale spatial data for

contain the big old ponderosa pines and other traditional species of these areas stand replacement fires are not however an ecological catastrophe in other ecosystems perennial grasses and some tree and brush species have evolved to regenerate following intense fires that kill much of the surface vegetation fire regimes ii iv and v aspen and some other hardwood tree and brush species as well as most grasses regrow from rootstocks that can survive intense wildfires some trees such as jack pine in the lake states and canada and lodgepole pine in much of the west have developed serotinous cones that open and disperse seeds only after exposure to intense heat in such ecosystems stand replacement fires are normal and natural although avoiding the incineration of structures located in those ecosystems is obviously desirable some uncertainty exists over the extent of forest and rangeland health problems and how various management practices can exacerbate or alleviate the problems in 1995 the fs estimated that 39 million acres in the national forest system nfs were at high risk of catastrophic wildfire and needed some form of fuel treatment 27 more recently the coarsescale assessment reported that 51 million nfs acres were at high risk of significant ecological damage from wildfire and another 80 million acres were at moderate risk see table 2 the coarsescale assessment also reported 23 million acres of department of the inte rior lands at high risk and 76 million acres at moderate risk all other lands calculated as the total shown in the coarsescale assessment less the nfs and doi lands included 107 million acres at high risk and 314 million acres at moderate risk of ecological damage g8g158g142g149g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g561 fuel management is collection of activities intended to reduce the threat of significant damages by wildfires the fs began its fuel management program in the 1960s by the late 1970s earlier agency policies of aggressive suppression of all wildfires had been modified in recognition of the enormous cost of organizing to achieve this goal and of the ecological benefits that can result from some fires these understandings have in particular led to an expanded prescribed burning program the relatively recent recognition of historically unnatural fuel loads from dead trees dense understories of trees and other vegetation and nonnative species has spurred additional interest in fuel management activities the presumption is that lower fuel loads and lack of fuel ladders will reduce the extent of wildfires the damages they cause and the cost of controlling them numerous ontheground examples support this belief however little empirical research has documented this logical presumption as noted in one research study scant information exists on fuel treatment efficacy for reducing wildfire severity 28 this study also found that fuel treatments moderate extreme fire behavior within treated areas at least in frequent fire ecosystems others have found different results elsewhere one study reported evidence that 27 enoch bell david cleaves harry croft susan husari ervin schuster and dennis

may be helpful31 wildfires are typically spread by fine fuels32needles leaves grass etcboth on the surface and in the tree crowns in standreplacement crown fire these are known as 1hour time lag fuels because they dry out lose twothirds of their moisture content in about an hour small fuels known as 10hour time lag fuels are woody twigs and branches up to quarterinch in diameter these fuels also help spread wildfires because they ignite and burn quickly larger fuelsparticularly the 1000hour time lag fuels more than 3 inches in diametermay contribute to the intensity and thus to the damage fires cause but contribute little to the rate of spread because they are slow to ignite one researcher noted that only 5 of large tree stems and 10 of tree branches were consumed in high intensity fires while 100 of the foliage and 75 of the understory vegetation were consumed 33 finally ladders of fine and small fuels between the surface and the tree crowns can spread surface fires into the canopy thus turning surface fire into standreplacement fire g18g155g142g156g140g155g146g139g142g141g561g4g158g155g151g146g151g144g561 fire has been used as tool for long time34 native americans lit fires for various purposes such as to reduce brush and stimulate grass growt h settlers used fires to clear woody debris in creating agricultural fields in forestry fire has been used to eliminate logging debris by burning brush piles and by prescribed burning harvested sites to prepare them for reforestation35 prescribed burning has been used increasingly over the past 40 years to reduce fuel loads on federal lands fs prescribed burning has exceeded 12 million acres annually since fy1998 except for fy2000 when the severe fire season limited prescribed burning to 772000 acres blm prescribed burning has exceeded 10 million acres annually since fy2000 except for fy2001 these burning programs are significant increase from historic levels as recently as fy1995 the acreage in prescribed burns was 541300 fs acres and 57000 blm acres however more than half of fs prescribed burning is in the fs southern region and thus prescribed burning in the intermountain west is still at relatively modest levels typically areas to be burned are identified in agency plans and fire lines essentially dirt paths are created around the perimeter the fires are lit when the weather conditions permit ie when the burning prescription is fulfilledwhen the humidity is low enough to get the fuels to burn but not when the humidity is so low or wind speed so high that the burning cannot be contained this of course presumes accurate knowledge of existing and expected weather and wind 31 see arthur brown and kenneth p davis chapter 4 forest fuels forest fire control and use new york ny mcgrawhill book co

training on the site when the fire reaches the perimeter limits the crews mop up the burn area to assure that hot embers remain to start wildfire after everyone is gone prescribed burning is widely used for fuel management because it reduces biomass the fuels to ashes minerals it is particularly effective at reducing the smaller fuels especially in the arid west where deterioration by decomposers insects fungi etc is often very slow in fact it is the only human treatment that directly reduces the fine and small fuels that are important in spreading wildfires however prescribed fires are not particularly effective at reducing largerdiameter fuels or thinning stands to desired densities and diameters 36 there are several limitations in using prescribed fire the most obvious is that prescribed fires can be riskyfire is not controlled tool rather it is selfsustaining chemical reaction that once ignited continues until the fuel supply is exhausted37 fire control for both wildfires and prescribed fires thus focuses on removing the continuous fuel supply by creating fire line dug down to mineral soil the line must be wide enough to prevent the spread of fire by radiation ie the heat from the flames must decline sufficiently across the space that the biomass outside the fire line does not reach combustion temperature about 550o f minor variations in wind and in fuel loads adjacent to the fire line can lead to fires jumping the fire line causing the fire to escape from control winds can also lift burning embers across fire lines causing spot fires outside the fire line which can grow into major wildfires under certain conditions such as occurred near alamos nm in may 2000 even when general weather conditionstemperature humidity and especially windsare within the limits identified fo r prescribed fires localized variations in the site eg slope aspect 38 and fuel load and in weather eg humidity and wind can be problematic thus prescribed fires inherently carry some degree of risk especially in ecosystems adapted to standreplacement fires and in areas where the understory and undergrowth have created fuel ladders another concern is that prescribed fires generate substantial quantities of smokeair pollution with high concentrations of carbon monoxide hydrocarbons and especially particulates that degrade visibility some assert that prescribed fires merely shift the timing of air pollution from wildfires others note that smoke from preindustr ial wildland fires was at least three times more than from current levels from prescribed burning and wildfire 39 others have observed that fire prescriptions are typically cooler and more humid than wildfire burning conditions and thus prescribed fires may produce more pollution because of less efficient burning than wildfires burning the same area the clean air act requires regulations to preserve air quality and regulations governing particulate emissions and regional haze have been of concern to land managers who want to expand prescribed burnin g programs previous proposed legislation eg hr 236 106 th congress would have exempted fs prescribed burning from air quality regulations for 10 years to demonstrate that an aggressive prescribed burning program will reduce total particulate emissions from prescribed burning and wildfires however owners and 36 see brown and davis fire control and use pp 560572 37 fire can also be halted by eliminating the supply of oxygen as occurs when fire retardant slurry is spread on forest fires from airplanes slurry bombers however reducing oxygen supply usually can only occur in limited area because of the cost to spread the fire retardant 38 aspect is the direction which the slope is facing in the northern hemisphere southfacing slopes south aspects get more radiant energy from the sun than north aspects and thus are inherently warmer and drier and hence are at greater risk of more intense

fossil fuel power plants generally object to such exemptions arguing that their emissions would likely be regulated more stringently even though wildland fires are one of the largest sources of

treatmen t is traditional timber harvesting including salvaging dead and dying trees before they rot or succumb to disease and commercially thinning dense stands in areas where the forest health problems include large numbers of dead and dying trees shift toward an inappropriate or undesirable tree species mix or dense understory of commercially usable trees timber harvesting can be used to improve forest health and remove woody biomass from the forest nonetheless some interest groups object to using salvage and other timber harvests to improve forest health 41 timber generally may only be removed from federal forests under timber sale contracts stewardship contracts allow timber sales and forest management services such as fuel reduction to be combined in one contract essentially as trade of goods timber for services fuel reduction this form of contracting is discussed below under other fuel management tools because timber sale contracts have to be bought and goodsforservices contracts must generate value to provide services the contracts generally include the removal of merchantable trees critics argue that the need for merchantable products compromises reducing fuel loads or achieving desired forest conditions timber harvests remove heavy fuels that contribute to fire intensity and can break fuel ladders but the remaining limbs and tree tops slash substantially increase fuel loads on the ground and get in the way of controlling future fires at least in the short term until the slash is removed or disposed of through burning slash is fire hazard mainly because it represents an unusually large volume of fuel distributed in such way that it is dangerous impediment in the construction of fire lines ie in suppressing fires 42 if logging slash is treated as has long been standard practice following timber harvesting the increased fire danger from higher fuel loads that follow timber harvesting can be ameliorated various slash treatments are used to reduce the fire hazard including lopandscatter pileand burn and chipping43 lopandscatter consists of cutting the tops and limbs so that they lie close to the ground thereby hastening decomposition and possibly preparing the material for broadcast burning essentially prescribed burning of the timber harvest site pileandburn is exactly that piling the slash by hand or more typically by bulldozer and burning the piles when conditions 40 see for example us house committee on resources hearing on the use of fire as management tool and its risks and benefits for forest health and air quality sept 30 1997 washington dc gpo 1997 serial 10545 141 p 41 timber harvesting has variety of proponents and opponents for reasons beyond fuel management some interests object to timber harvesting on variety of grounds including the poor financial performance of fs timber sales and the degradation of water quality and certain wildlife habitats that follows some timber harvesting others defend timber sales for the employment and income provided in isolated resourcedependent communities as well as for increasing water yields and available habitat for other wildlife species the arguments supporting and opposing timber harvests generally have often been raised in discussions about fire protection but are not reproduced in this report see crs report 95364 salvage timber sales and forest health by ross

the sites without additional treatment eg without prescribed burning mechanical fuel treatments alone tend to increase fine fuels and sometimes larger fuels on the ground in the short term until the slash has been treated some critics have suggested using traditionally unused biomass such as slash and thinning debris in new industrial ways such as using th wood for paper or particleboard or burning the biomass to generate electricity 45 research has indicated that harvesting small diameter timber may be economically feasible46 and one study reported net revenues of 624 per acre for comprehensive fuel reduction treatments in montana that included removal and sale of merchantable wood47 however thus far collecting and hauling chipped slash and other biomass for products or energy have apparently not been seen as economically viable by timber purchasers given that such woody materials are currently left on the harvest sites48 another possibility is to significantly change the traditional approach to timber sales stewardship contracting in various forms has been tested in various national forests49 sometimes the stewardship contract payment and performance is based on the condition of the stand after the treatment rather than on the volume harvested this is also known as endresults contracting variation on this theme which has been discussed sporadically for more than 30 years is to separate the forest treatment from the sale of the wood the most common form is essentially to 44 chemical treatments herbicides are also used in forestry mostly on unwanted vegetation but they are not included here as fuel treatment tool because they are used primar ily to kill live biomass rather than to reduce biomass levels on site biological treatments eg using goats to eat the small diameter material are feasible but are rarely used 45 robert nelson university of maryland cited in rocky barker wildfires creating odd bedfellows the idaho statesman aug 14 2000 pp 1a 7a 46

of slash use in contrast to small diameter trees is lacking however this seems reasonable conclusion given that the slash is left on the site by the timber purchaser who could remove and sell the material and that the agencies and various interest groups have been trying to develop alternatives to the traditional contracts eg stewardship contracts to remove thinning slash and other biomass

severe fires in 1994 and the deaths of several firefighters current federal wildfire policy is to protect human life first and then to protect property and natural resources from wildfires 52 this policy includes viewing fire as natural process in ecosystems where and when fires can be allowed to burn with reasonable safety but when wildfires threaten life property and resources the agencies act to suppress those fires despite control efforts some wildfires clearly become the kind of conflagration stand replacement fire or crown fire that gets media attention as noted above relatively few wildfires become conflagrations it is unknown how many w ildfires might become conflagrations in the absence of fire suppression efforts wide array of factors determine whether wildfire will blow up into conflagration some factors are inherent in the site slope fires burn faster up steep slopes aspect southfacing slopes are warmer and drier than northfacing slopes and ecology some plant species are adapted to periodic stand replacement fires other factors are transient changing over time from hours to years moisture levels current and recent humidity longterm drought wind ranging from gentle breezes to gale force winds in some thunderstorms and fuel load and spatial distribution more biomass and fuel ladders make conflagrations more likely whether wildfire becomes conflagration can also be influenced by land management practices and policies historic grazing and logging practices by encouraging growth of many small trees and especially fire suppression over the past century appear to have contributed to unprecedented fuel loads in some ecosystems fuel treatments can reduce fuel loads and thus probably reduce the likelihood and severity of catastrophic wildfires however some policies and decisions may restrict fuel treatmentfor example air quality protection that limits prescribed burning or wilderness designation that prevents fuel reduc tion with motorized or mechanical equipment other practices and policies are more problematic for example timber harvesting can reduce fuel loads if accompanied by effective slash disposal but data on the need for and on the extent and efficacy of slash disposal are not available similarly road construction into previously unroaded areas can increase access and thus facilitate fuel treatment and fire suppression conversely roadless area protection and even road obliteration 53 can impede fuel treatment but may reduce the likelihood of wildfire ignition because humancaused wildfires are more common along roads once wildfire becomes conflagration halting its spread is exceedingly difficult if not impossible dropping water or fire retardant slurry from helicopters or airplanes slurry bombers can occasionally return crown fire to the surface where firefighters can control it and can be used to protect individually valuable sites eg structures however this strategy is not particularly useful in large extended fires54 setting backfireslighting fires from fire line 52 1995 federal wildland fire review 53 road obliteration is closing the road and returning the roadbed to nearnatural conditions 54

conflagration thus halting its spread but can be dangerous because the backfire sometimes becomes part of the conflagration most firefighters recognize the futility of some firefighting efforts acknowledging that some conflagrations will burn until they run out of fuel move into an ecosystem or an area where the fuel is insufficient to support the conf lagration or the weather changes the wind dies or precipitation begins or both g25g146g149g141g143g146g155g142g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 wildfires cause damages killing some plants and occasionally animals55 firefighters have been injured and killed and structures can be damaged or destroyed the loss of plants can heighten the risk of significant erosion and landslides some observers have reported soil glassification where the silica in the soils has been melted and fused forming an impermeable layer in the soil however research has yet to document the extent frequency and duration of this condition and the soils and burning conditions under which it occurs others have noted that even the most intense forest fire will rarely have direct heating effect on the soil at depths below 7 to 10 cm centimeters about 3 to 4 inches 56 damages are almost certainly greater from stand replacement fires than from surface fires stand replacement fires burn more fuel and thus burn hotter more intensely than surface fires stand replacement fires kill many plants in the burned area making natural recovery slower and increasing the potential for erosion and landslides also because they burn hotter stand replacement fires generally are more difficult to suppress raising risks to firefighters and to structures finally stand replacement fires generate substantial quantities of smoke which can directly affect peoples health and wellbeing wildfires especially conflagrations can also have significant local economic effects both short term and longterm with larger fires generally having greater and longerterm impacts wildfires and even extreme fire danger may directly curtail recreation and tourism in and near the fires extensive fire damage to trees can significantly alter the timber supply both through shortterm glut from timber salvage and longerterm decline while the trees regrow water supplies can be degraded by postfire erosion and stream sedimentation but the volume flowing from the burned area may increase if an areas aesthetics are impaired local property values can decline however federal wildfire management includes substantial expenditures and firefighting jobs are considered financially desirable in many areas 57 ecological damages from fires are more difficult to determine and may well be overstated for two reasons first burned areas look devastated immediately following the fire

crown scorched are likely to survive58 second even the most intense stand replace ment fires do not burn 100 of the biomass within the burns perimeterfires are patchy for example in the 1988 fires in yellowstone nearly 30 of the area within the fire perimeters was unburned and another 1520 burned lightly surface fire 5055 of the area burned as stand replacement fire59 emergency rehabilitation is common following large fires this is typically justified by the need for controlling erosion and preventing landslides and may be particularly important for fire lines dug to mineral soil that go up steep slopes and could become gullies or ravines without treatment sometimes the rehabilitation includes salvaging dead and damaged trees because the woods quality and value deteriorate following the fire emergency rehabilitation often involves seeding the sites with fastgrowing grasses while helpful for erosion control such efforts might inhibit natural restoration if the grasses are not native species or if they inhibit tree seed germination or seedling survival finally as mentioned above wildfires can also ge nerate ecological benefits many plants regrow quickly following wildfires because fire converts organic matter to available mineral nutrients some plant species such as aspen and especially many native perennial grasses also regrow from root systems that are rarely damaged by wildfire other plant species such as lodgepole pine and jack pine have evolved to depend on stand replacement fires for their regeneration fire is necessary to open their cones and spread their seeds one author identified research reporting various significant ecosystems threatened by fire exclusion including aspen whitebark pine and ponderosa pine western montane ecosystems longleaf pine pitch pine and oak savannah southern and eastern ecosystems and the tallgrass prairie 60 other researchers found that of the 146 rare threatened or endangered plants in the coterminous 48 states for which there is conclusive information on fire effects 135 species 92 benefit from fire or are found in fire adapted ecosystems 61 animals as well as plants can benefit from fire some individual animals may be killed especially by catastrophic fires but populations and communities are rarely threatened many species are attracted to burned areas following firessome even during or immediately after the fire species can be attracted by the newly available minerals or the reduced vegetation allowing them to see and catch prey others are attracted in the weeks to months even few years following to the new plant growth including fr esh and available seeds and berries for insects and other prey or for habitat eg snags for woodpeckers and other cavity nesters few may be highly dependent on fire the endangered kirtlands warbler for example only nests under young jack pine that was regenerated by fire because on ly fireregenerated jack pine stands are dense enough to protect the nestlings from predators in summary many of the ecological benefits of wildfire that have become more widely recognized over the past 30 years are generally associated with light surface fires in frequentfire ecosystems this is clearly one of the justifications given for fuel treatments damage is likely to 58 see ross w gorte fire effects appraisal the wisconsin dnr example phd dissertation east lansing

interface face some risk of loss from wildfires as noted above catastrophic fires occur despite our best efforts and can threaten houses and other buildings to date insurance companies and state insurance regulators have done relatively little to ameliorate these risks in part because of federal disaster assistance paid whenever numerous homes are burned such as in alamos in may 2000 however landowners can take steps individually and collectively to reduce the threat to their structures research has documented that home ignitability the likelihood of house catching fire and burning downdepends substantially on the characteristics of the structure and its immediate surroundings 62 flammable exteriorswood siding and especially flammable roofsincrease the chances that structure will ignite by radiation heat from the surrounding burning forest or from firebrands burning materials carried aloft by wind or convection and falling ahead of the fire alternate materials eg brick or aluminum siding and slate or copper roofing and protective treatments can reduce the risk in addition the probability of home igniting by radiation depends on its distance from the flames researchers found that 8595 of structures with nonflammable roofs survived two major california fires in 1961 and 1990 when there were clearances of 10 meters 33 feet or more between the homes and surrounding vegetation 63 thus building with fire resistant materials and clearing flammable materialsincluding vegetation firewood piles and untreated wood decksfrom around structures reduces their chances of burning in addition landowners can cooperate in protecting their homes in the wildlandurban interface fuel reduction within and around such subdivisions can reduce the risk and economies of scale suggest that treatment costs for subdivision migh t be lower than for an individual especially if volunteer labor is contributed in addition as noted above narrow and unmarked roads can hinder fire crews from reaching wildfires assuri ng adequate roads that are clearly marked and mapped can help firefighters to protect subdivisions finally communal water sources such as ponds and cisterns may improve the protection of structures and subdivisions

maintaining some separation between suppressing structural fires and wildfires may be appropriate because the suppression techniques and firefighter hazards and training differ substantially nonetheless cooperation and some overlapping responsibilities are also warranted simply because of the locations of federal state and local firefighting forces in addition state and local governments have other responsibilities that affect wildfire threats to homes for example zoning codeswhat can be built whereand building codespermissible construction standards and materialsare typically regulated locally these codes could and some undoubtedly do include restrictions standards or guidelines for improving fire protection in the wildlandurban interface the insurance industry and home fire insurance requirements are generally regulated by states state regulators could work with the industry to increase the consideration of wildfire protection and home defensibility in homeowners insurance road construction and road maintenance are often both state and local responsibilities depending on the road these roads are usually designed and identified in ways that are useful for fire suppression crews state and local governments could further assist home protection from wildfires by supporting programs to inform residents especially those in the urbanwildland interface of ways that they can protect their homes g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g20g152g149g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g146g139g146g149g146g157g146g142g156g561 the federal government has

relief for affected communities such efforts may prevent flooding and debris flows that can exacerbate local economic and social problems caused by catastrophic fires one authorized program fs emergency reforestation assistance can aid private landowners whose land s were damaged by wildfire but the program has not been funded since fy199367 fema is the principal federal agency that provid relief following declared disasters although local state and other federal agencies eg the farm service agency and the small business administration also have emergency assistance programs68 the stafford act established process for governors to request the president to declare disaster and public and individual assistance programs for disaster victims if the risk of catastrophic fires destroying homes and communities continues to escalate as some have suggested requests for wildfire disaster relief would also likely rise this might lead some to argue that federal insurance mechanism might be more efficient and equitable system for sharing the risk federal crop insurance and national flood insurance have existed for many years while federal insurance for other catastrophic risks eg hurricanes tornados earthquakes volcanoes has also been debated69 an analysis of these alternative systems is beyond the scope of this report but these might provide alternative approaches that could be adapted for federal wildfire insurance if such insurance were seen as appropriate some observers however object to compensating landowners for building in what critics identify as unsafe areas 70 g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the severe fire seasons in recent years have raised many wildfire issues for congress and the public there have been spirited discussions about the effects of land management practices especially timber sales on fuel loads broad range of opinion exists on this issue but most observers generally accept that current fuel loads reflect the aggressive fire suppression of the past century as well as historic logging and grazing practices some argue that catastrophic wildfires are natures way of rejuvenating forests that have been mismanaged in extracting timber and that the fires should be allowed to burn to restore the natural conditions 71 others argue that the catastrophic fires are due to increased fuel loads that have resulted from reduced logging in the national forests over the past decade and that more logging could contribute significantly to reducing fuel loads and thus to protecting homes and communities 72 however the extent to which timber harvests affect the extent and severity of current and future wildfires cannot be determined from available data73 some critics suggest that historic mismanagement 67 see crs report rl31065 forestry assistance programs by ross w gorte p 10 68 see crs report rl31734 federal disaster recovery programs brief summaries by mary b jordan 69 see

the fs warrants wholesale decentralization or revision of the management authority governing the national forest system74 research information on causative factors and on the complex circumstances surrounding wildfire is limited the value of wildfires as case studies for building predictive models is constrained because the priori situation eg fuel loads and distribution and burning conditions eg wind and moisture levels patterns and variations are often unknown experimental fires in the wild would be more useful but are dangerous and generally unacceptable to the public prescribed fires could be used for research but the burning conditions are necessarily restricted fires in the laboratory are feasible but often cannot duplicate the complexity and variability of field conditions thus research on fire protection and control is challenging and predictive tools for fire protection and control are often based substantially on expert opinion and anecdotes rather than on documented research evidence 75 concerns over forest and rangeland health particularly related to fuel loads have been discussed for more than decade major conference on forest ecosystem health was held in idaho in 199376 significant funding to address these concerns however was not proposed until september 2000 while higher funding for wildfire protection including fuel reduction has persisted some question whether this additional funding is sufficient to adequately reduce fuel loads in 1999 gao estim ated that it would cost 725 million annually nearly 12 billion through 2015to reduce fuels using traditional treatment methods on the 39 million fs acres that were estimated to be at high risk of catastrophic wildfire77 this is more than three times higher than the significantly increased appropriations for fs fuel reduction since fy2001 the cost of comprehensive fuel reduction program as many advocate would likely exceed the gao estimate of 12 billion because the scope of potential costs and proposed programs has increased the fs estimate of fs acres at high risk of ecological loss due to catastrophic fire increased from 39 million acres in 1999 to 51 m illion acres in 2003 in addition th gao cost figure received from the fs of 300 per acre on average for fuel reduction might be low one might anticipate more careful federal prescribed burning after the may 2000 escaped prescribed fire burned 239 homes in alamos nm more cautious prescribed burning is likely to have higher unit costs than the gao figure also many advocate emphasizing fuel reduction in the wildlandurban interface and treatment costs in the interface are higher because of risks to homes and other structures from prescribed burning and because of possible damage to aesthetics from mechanical treatments gao also addressed subset of the widelyadvo cated comprehensive fuel reduction program by estimating the cost for the initial treatment of fs highrisk acres the fs has estimated that there are 23 million highrisk acres of doi land and 107 million highrisk acres of other land in addition many advocate reducing fuels on lands at moderate risk80 million fs acres 76 continued 20

frequentfire ecosystems retreatment would be needed on the 535 year fire cycle depending on the ecosystem suggesting that fuel management costs would need to be continued beyond the 16year program examined by gao if comprehensive program were undertaken to reduce fuels on all highrisk and moderaterisk federal lands using gaos treatment cost rate of 300 per acre the total cost would come to 69 billion 39 billion for fs lands and 30 billion for doi landsfor initial treatment this would come to 43 billion annually over 16 years whereas the administrations requested budget for fuel treatment in fy2008 was 4943 million 2915 million for the fs and 2028 million for the blm little more than 10 of what some implicitly propose this raises questions about whether comprehensive fuel reduction program is feasible and how to prioritize treatment efforts there is final significant question would it work the answer depends in part on how one defines successful fire protection fuel reduction might help restore more natural conditions to forests and rangelands as many advocate and would likely yield some social benefits eg improved water quality more habitat for firedependent animal species others however advocate fuel reduction to allow greater use of forests and rangelands for timber production recreation water yield etc fuel reduction will cert ainly not reduce the conflict over the goals and purposes of having and managing federal lands reducing fuel loads might reduce acreage burned and the severity and damages of the wildfires that occur research is needed in various ecosystems to document and quantify the relationships among fuel loads and damages and the probability of catastrophic wildfires to examine whether the cost of fuel reduction is justified by the lower fire risk and damage however it should also be recognized that regardless of the extent of fuel reduction and other fire protection efforts as long as there is biomass for burning especially under severe weather conditions drought and high wind catastrophic wildfires will occasionally occur with the attendant damages to resources destruction of nearby homes other economic and social impacts and potential loss of life g20g142g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g156g561 agee james k fire ecology of pacific northwest forests washington dc island press 1993 493 p brown arthur and kenneth p davis forest
