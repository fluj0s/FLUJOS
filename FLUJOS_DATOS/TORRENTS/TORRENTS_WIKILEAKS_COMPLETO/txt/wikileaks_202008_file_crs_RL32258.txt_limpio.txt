to the child support enforcement cse program hr 4 was passed by the house in february 2003 the senate finance committee reported substitute version of the bill in september 2003 srept 108162 on march 29april 1 2004 the senate debated hr 4 disagreement arose regarding amendments to the bill and republicans failed to pass motion to limit debate hr 4 was not passed by the senate although not identical both versions of hr 4 were similar in focus direction and content with respect to the cse provisions both versions of hr 4 included provisions that sought to improve the cse program and raise collections so as to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent both versions of the bill provided incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf of families to the families themselves thereby reducing the amount that state and federal governments retain often referred to as familyfirst policy under both bills families currently receiving tanf benefits as well as former tanf recipients would have potentially received larger share of child support that was collected on their behalf the approach used by the bills differed significantly however with regard to how states would help tanf families receive more child support under the house passed bill states would have been given federal cost sharing incentives to encourage states to increase or establish the amount of child support payments they pass through to tanf families and disregard in determining tanf benefits the senate finance committee version of the bill provided federal costsharing for the entire amount that the state disregards and passes through to families moreover the housepassed bill provided more limited amount of federal cost sharing for state passthrough and disregard policies than the senate finance committee bill both versions of the bill would have revised some cse enforcement tools and added others increased funding for the federal parent locator service fpls increased funding for federal technical assistance to the states required states to review child support orders of tanf families every three years and required that report be submitted to congress on undistributed child support collections the housepassed bill included provision that would have established 25 annual user fee for individuals who had never been on tanf but received cse services and who received at least 500 in any given year

the 108th congress the house of representatives and the senate finance committee approved two different versions of bill that would have reauthorized and revised the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant this legislation hr 4 also included many changes to the child support enforcement cse program component of the governments social safety net in 1996 congress passed significant changes to the cse program as part of its reform of welfare hr 4 was passed by the house in february 2003 the senate finance committee reported substitute version of the bill in september 2003 srept 108 162 on march 29april 1 2004 the senate debated hr 4 disagreement arose regarding amendments to the bill motion to limit debate was overruled and the senate did not vote on passage of the bill overview of the child support enforcement program background the cse program part d of title iv of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ocse in the department of health and human services hhs and funded by general revenues all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds the following families automatically qualify for cse services free of charge families receiving or who formerly received temporary assistance to needy families tanf benefits title iva foster care payments or medicaid coverage collections on behalf of families receiving tanf benefits are used to reimburse state and federal governments for tanf payments made to the family other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes to the family usually through the state disbursement unit between fy1978 and fy2003 child support payments collected by cse agencies increased from 1 billion in fy1978 to 212 billion in fy2003 and the number of children whose paternity was established or acknowledged increased by crs2 1274 from 111000 to 1525 million however the program still collects only 18 of child support obligations for which it has responsibility and collects payments for only 50 of its caseload moreover ocse data indicate that in fy2003 paternity had been established or acknowledged for about 77 of the nearly 10 million children on the cse caseload without legally identified fathers total expenditures for the cse program were 5213 billion in fy2003 of this total the federal share of state and local administrative costs of the program was 3448 billion and the state share was 1764 billion the cse program is estimated to handle at least 50 of all child support cases the remaining cases are handled by private attorneys collection agencies or through mutual agreements between the parents services the cse program provides seven major services on behalf of children 1 parent location 2 paternity establishment 3 establishment of child support orders 4 review and modification of support orders 5 collection of support payments 6 distribution of support payments and 7 establishment and enforcement of medical support enforcement techniques collection methods used by cse agencies include income withholding intercept of federal and state income tax refunds intercept of unemployment compensation liens against property security bonds and reporting child support obligations to credit bureaus all jurisdictions also have civil or criminal contempt ofcourt procedures and criminal nonsupport laws building on legislation pl 102 521 enacted in 1992 pl 105187 the deadbeat parents punishment act of 1998 established two new federal criminal offenses subject to twoyear maximum prison term with respect to noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support children who reside with custodial parents in another state or who flee across state lines to avoid supporting them pl 104193 required states to implement expedited procedures that allow them to secure assets to satisfy an arrearage by intercepting or seizing periodic or lump sum payments such as unemployment and workers compensation lottery winnings awards judgements or settlements and assets of the debtor parent held by public or private retirement funds and financial institutions it required states to implement procedures under which the state would have authority to withhold suspend or restrict use of drivers licenses professional and occupational licenses and recreational and sporting licenses of persons who owe pastdue support or who fail to comply with subpoenas or warrants relating to paternity or child support proceedings it also required states to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions in the state in order to identify and seize the financial resources of debtor noncustodial parents pl 104193 authorized the secretary of state to deny revoke or restrict passports of debtor parents pl 104193 also required states to enact and implement the uniform interstate family support act uifsa and expand full faith crs3 and credit procedures pl 104193 also clarified which court has jurisdiction in cases involving multiple child support orders financing the federal government currently reimburses each state 66 of the cost of administering its cse program it also refunds states 90 of the laboratory costs of establishing paternity in addition the federal government pays states an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective programs pl 104193 required the hhs secretary in consultation with the state cse directors to develop new cost neutral system of incentive payments to states pl 105200 the child support performance and incentive act of 1998 established new costneutral incentive payment system1 the statutory limit of cse incentive payments for fy2004 is 454 million hr 4 major provisions related to child support enforcement background over the years the cse program has evolved into multifaceted program while costrecovery still remains an important function of the program other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility even when one of the parents is longer living in the home the cse program has helped strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services child support payments now are generally recognized as very important income source for singleparent families on average child support constitutes 17 of family income for households that receive it 2001 data among poor families who receive it child support constitutes about 30 of family income 2001 data2 both versions of hr 4 sought to improve the cse program and raise collections so as to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent although both versions of the bill shared identical objectives with respect to simplifying cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthening the familyfirst policies started in the 1996 welfare reform law the approaches used differed both versions of the bill revised some cse enforcement tools and 1 before fy2002 child support incentive payments were paid out of the federal share of child support collections made on behalf of tanf families as of oct 1 2001 child support incentive payments are paid with appropriated funds 2 elaine sorensen child support gains some ground urban institute snapshots of americas families iii 11 oct 2003 crs4 added others the senateapproved version of hr 4 included larger list of cse provisions than did the housepassed bill this section of the report does not discuss all of the cse provisions included in hr 4 for description of all of the cse provisions in hr 4 as passed by the house and approved by the senate finance committee see table 1 in the last section of this report which provides sidebyside bill comparison assignment of child support rights as condition of receiving tanf benefits family must assign their child support rights to the state assignment rules determine who has legal claim on the child support payments owed by the noncustodial parent the child support assignment covers any child support that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits as well as any child support that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits assigned child support collections are not paid to families but rather this revenue is kept by states and the federal government as partial reimbursement for welfare benefits nonwelfare families who apply for cse services do not assign their child support rights to the state and thereby receive all of the child support collected on their behalf an extremely important feature of the assignment process is the date on which an assignment was entered if the assignment was entered on or before september 30 1997 then preassistance and duringassistance arrearages are permanently assigned to the state if the assignment was entered on or after october 1 1997 then only the arrearages which accumulate while the family receives assistance are permanently assigned the familys preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and the right to those arrearages goes back to the family when it leaves tanf unless the arrearages are collected through the federal income tax refund offset program hr 4 as passed by the house did not make any changes regarding the child support assignment rules in contrast under hr 4 as approved by the senate finance committee the child support assignment would have only covered any child support that accrued while the family received tanf benefits this meant that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits would not have to be assigned to the state even temporarily and thereby any child support collected on behalf of the formertanf family for preassistance arrearages would have gone to the family distribution of child support distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid in accordance with the assignment rules in other words the distribution rules determine which claim is paid first when child support collection occurs the order of payment of the child support collection is of tremendous importance because in many cases pastdue child support ie arrearages are never fully paid crs5 tanf families while the family receives tanf benefits the state is permitted to retain any current support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which has been paid to the family the 1996 welfare law pl 104193 repealed the 50 required pass through3 and gave states the choice to decide how much if any of the state share some all none of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families to send the family states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family while states have discretion over their share of child support collections pl 104 193 required states to pay the federal government the federal governments share of child support collections collected on behalf of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government bears the entire cost of any child support passed through to and disregarded by families as of august 2004 21 states were continuing the 50 or higher in several states passthrough and disregard policy that had been in effect pre19964 both versions of hr 4 would have provided incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to the families themselves as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal coffers for welfare benefits paid to the families often referred to as familyfirst policy however the approaches of the bills differed with respect to the limitation on the federal costsharing and whether to help states pay for the current cost of their cse passthrough and disregard policies or to encourage states to establish such policies or increase the passthrough and disregard already in place hr 4 as passed by the house would have allowed states to increase the amount of collected child support they pay to families receiving tanf benefits and would not have required the state to pay the federal government the federal share of the increased payments the subsidized child support passthrough payments would have been the amount above any payments the state was making on december 31 2001 in other words the housepassed bill intended to increase the amount of child support that was passed through to tanf families and disregarded by the state the housepassed bill would have limited the new payments to the greater of 100 per month or 50 per month more than the state previously was sharing with the family in order for the federal government to share in the cost of an increase in the child support passthrough the state would have been required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefit 3 under old law the first 50 of current monthly child support payments collected on behalf of an afdc family was given to the family and disregarded as income to the family so that it did not affect the familys afdc eligibility or benefit status 4 the 17 states with the 50 passthrough and disregard policy are ak ca ct il ky ma nj nm ny pa ri tx vt and va three states ga sc and tn pass though and disregard some or all child support for purposes of their fillthegap budgeting policies wisconsin passes through and disregards all child support payments west virginia passes through and disregards up to 25 per month crs6 unlike the housepassed bill under the bill approved by the senate finance committee the federal government would have shared in the costs of the entire amount of current passthrough and disregard policies used by states hr 4 as approved by the senate finance committee would have allowed states to pay up to 400 per month in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family 600 per month to family with two or more children to the family and would not have required the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments in order for the federal government to share in the cost of the child support passthrough the state would have been required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefit former tanf families pursuant to the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104 193 beginning on october 1 2000 states must distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed this is often referred to as the familyfirst policy 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits5 any child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on tanf belong to the state and federal government one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls thus generally speaking under current law child support that accrues before and after family receives tanf goes to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf goes to the state this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf hr 4 as passed by the house would have given states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child support arrearages including arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program under the house passed bill the federal government would have shared with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages accrued while the family received tanf as well as costs associated with passing through to the family child support collected through the federal income tax refund offset program if the state chose the familyfirst option similarly hr 4 as approved by the senate finance committee also would have given states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf further the senate finance committee version of the bill would have simplified the cse distribution process and eliminated 5 as mentioned above these rules do not apply to child support collections obtained by intercepting federal income tax refunds if child support arrearages are collected via the federal income tax refund offset program the law stipulates that the state and federal government are to retain those collections crs7 the special treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program like the housepassed bill the federal government would have shared with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family first expansion of collectionenforcement tools both versions of hr 4 included identical or similar provisions with respect to 1 allowing states to access information in the national new hires database to help detect fraud in the unemployment compensation program 2 lowering the threshold amount for denial of passport to noncustodial parent who owes pastdue child support 3 facilitating the collection of child support from social security benefits 4 easing the collection of child support from veterans benefits and 5 allowing states to use the federal income tax refund offset program to collect pastdue child support for persons not on tanf who are longer minors additional provisions that would have expanded andor enhanced the ability of states to collect child support payments were contained in the senate finance committeeapproved version of hr 4 they included 1 authorizing the hhs secretary to act on behalf of states to seize financial assets held by multistate financial institution of noncustodial parents who owe child support 2 authorizing the hhs secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents who owe pastdue child support with information maintained by insurers concerning insurance payments and to furnish any information resulting from match to cse agencies so they can pursue child support arrearages and 3 authorizing the hhs secretary to compare information obtained from gambling establishments with information on noncustodial parents who owe pastdue child support and direct the gambling establishment to withhold from the customers net winnings any child support that is owed other provisions both versions of the bill included provisions that would have 1 required states to review and if appropriate adjust child support orders of tanf families every three years 2 required the hhs secretary to submit report to congress on the procedures states use to locate custodial parents for whom child support has been collected but not yet distributed 3 established minimum funding level for technical assistance and 4 established minimum funding level for the federal parent locator service the housepassed version of hr 4 included provision that would have established 25 annual fee for individuals who had never been on tanf but received cse services and who received at least 500 in any given year the senate finance committeeapproved version of hr 4 included provisions that would have 1 increased funding for the cse access and visitation program 2 designated indian tribes and tribal organizations as persons authorized to have access to information in the federal parent locator service and 3 required states to adopt crs8 later version of the uniform interstate family support act uifsa so as to facilitate the collection of child support payments in interstate cases detailed comparison of cse provisions of the house and senate finance committee bills table 1 provides detailed and comprehensive comparison of the cse provisions of the housepassed and senate finance committee reported versions of hr 4 the welfare reauthorization bill with current law the table specifies the section number in each of the bills in which the provision is found as noted earlier hr 4 passed the house but not the senate during the 108th congress there is some concern that the widely favored cse provisions that were in hr 4 were not debated as separate standalone bill nevertheless it seems likely that the 109th congress will consider the substantive and numerous cse changes that were included in hr 4 as part of any new tanf reauthorization bill crs9 table 1 comparison of current law with hr 4 personal responsibility work

rights to child support that in addition the committee bill would have given was in effect on september 30 1997 must states the option to discontinue preassistance remain in effect this means that any child assignments in effect on september 30 1997 if support collected as result of the assignment state chose to discontinue the child support is owed to the state and the federal assignment the state would have given up its legal government claim to collections based on such arrearages and the state would have distributed the collections to the family states also would have been given the option to discontinue preassistance arrearage assignments in effect after september 30 1997 and before the implementation date of this provision if state chose to discontinue the child support assignment the state would have given up its legal claim to collections based on such arrearages and the state would distribute the collections to the family section 301c crs10 current law hr 4 housepassed hr 4
