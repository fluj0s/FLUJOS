old outofprint seforim recently republished by copy corner of boro park yechezkel goldenberg proprietor of copy corner made available to hebrewbooksorg all of the 3500 seforim that he reprinted some of which are several hundreds of years old ungvarer rav all of the seforim were carefully examined by several highly regarded rabbis who reviewed each sefer to ensure that none were from authors whose orientation was other than torahtrue judaism and that religious or secular copyright privileges were violated registered owners of the friedberg ryzman edition of the collection will receive updates from the society with the scan files of additional works as they become available thereby keeping their collection complete and uptodate seforim and the internet the internet is under constant attack in observant communities though the dark side of the internet is acknowledged by all segments of society religious and secular the categorical benefits of the internet are often negated harvey blitz esq esteemed former president of the orthodox union in his presidents message in the ous fall 2003 jewish action magazine while conceding that the internet has sexually explicit antisemitic and other objectionable material he glowingly described the vast amount of torah information that is available and transmitted over the internet entire collections of seforim on chassidishe dynasties are available free on the internet as are all the seforim of some of todays leading poskim jewish law decisors thus they seem to be giving their approval of internet use for torah learning purposes albeit passively the friedbergryzman edition on external hard disk was designed for those who have limited access to computers hebrewbooksorgs work continues it will shortly introduce unit that is completely selfcontained without needing computer for those who do have access to the internet the fruits of the friedbergryzman edition are free and accessible 246 though the external hard disk has much faster search engine than that available on the hebrewbooksorg website the precious access to 11000 seforim is stupendous true harbotzas torah we anxiously wait for hebrewbooksorgs continuous expansion of their 11000 seforim database as well as their next innovations in computer search capabilities pshevorsker udvary wedding on shabbos parshas bo january 2627 the aufruf of moshe menashe leizer took
