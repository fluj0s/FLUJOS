from michael mann mannvirginiaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk phil jones pjonesueaacuk raymond s bradley rbradleygeoumassedu subject re ice coreschina series fyi date tue 24 jun 2003 140625 0400 cc mannvirginiaedu thanks keith i just read your email after reading the others we actually eliminate records with negative correlations this is mentioned breifly in the grl article and we investigated variety of weighting schemes to assure the basic robustness of the compositebut i certainly endorse your broader point here many of these records have some significant uncertainties or possible sources of bias and this isnt the place to get into that the uncertainties get at this at some level and other places eg the reviews of geophysics paper phil and i are drafting will provide an opportunity to discuss these kinds of issues in more detailwe will certainly be seeking advice either officially or unofficially from each of you once we have finalized the draft of that now back to my honeymoon mike at 0238 pm 6242003 0100 keith briffa wrote to keep you informed here is reply to tom wigley re his request to deal with rays comments re the china series in eos piece tom tim has just told of your message expressing concern about the china series and your statement of the necessity to deal with rays comment and add in the small adjustment to the figure caption we i and tim decided to get this off as soon as possible to ellen agu as we had been asked to do and as requested by ellen hence it went off earlier today and before your message arrived mike was aware of rays comment and was happy to leave any amendment to the text until the proof stage in my opinion it is not practical or desirable to try to qualify any one record in this limited format it was majority decision to leave the mann and jones 2000year series in the figure 1 as it was to remove the briffa and osborn treering based one and the details of the logic used to derive the mann and jones series is to be found in the cited text of their paper signing on to this letter in my mind implies agreement with the text and not individual endorsement of all curves by each author i too have expressed my concern to phil and ray over the logic that you leave all series you want in but just weight them according to some sometimes low correlation in this case based on decadal values i also believe some of the series that make up the chinese record are dubious or obscure but the same is true of other records mann and jones have used eg how do you handle series in new zealand that has 025 correlation further serious problems are still see my and tims science comment on the mann 1999 paper lurking with the correction applied to the western us treering pc amplitude series used and shown in figure 2 there are problems and limitations with all series used at this stage singling out individual records for added and unavoidably cursory added description is not practical we were told to cut the text and references significantly and further cuts are implied by ellens messages to us if you wish to open this up to general discussion it may be best to wait til the proof stage and then we can all consider the balance of emphasis but we had also better guard against too selective choice of data to present if you want to get somewhat wider discussion of this point going in the meantime feel free to forward this to whoever you wish along with your disagreement while we wait on the response from agu best wishes keith professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of virginia charlottesville va 22903 _______________________________________________________________________ email mannvirginiaedu phone 434 9247770 fax 434 9822137 2httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa 2 httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml
