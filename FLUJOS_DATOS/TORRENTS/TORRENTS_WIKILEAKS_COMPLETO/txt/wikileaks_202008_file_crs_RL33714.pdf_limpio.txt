2006 summary the energy information administration eia in its short term energy and winter fuels outlook stewfo provided good news for residential natural gas consumers eia projected that natural ga s winter home heating costs might decline by as much as 13 from last years reco rdsetting levels even though consumption is expected to increase this winter the stewfo sees prices for natural gas lower than last year as result of weak market fundamentals analyses of natural gas market mand and supply cond itions seem to be consistent with the eia stewfo aggr egate consumption of natural gas over the first seven months of 2006 has declined compared to 2005 us production as well as imports have also declined over the same time period likely in response to the decrease in consumption on sectoral level the decline in consumption has included all consumer groups except electri c power generators whose consumption rose storage of natural gas the factor th at balances yearly demand and supply is at an all time record high level and is approaching the maximum physical capacity of the system there does not appear to be any fundamental imbalance between demand and supply in the 2006 natural gas market maki ng stable or even declining price level likely the price of natural gas is actually many prices small resi dential consumers typically pay the highest prices per unit of natural gas and large industrial and electric power consumers pay the lowest prices per unit taken in this context the 2006 price outlook may be less favorable than the eia suggests across different sectors residential pri ces had not responded to fa lling wellhead prices as of july 2006 the past several years of high ga s prices have yielded 14 decline in industrial consumption and that dema nd may not return to the market risk factors including weather conditions movements in the price of crude oil and developments in the futures markets all could affect the market balance in the natural gas market because these factors have caused price volatility in the past the eia outlook may best be considered as conditional on outcomes in these areas this report will be

to march 3 large worldwide lng spot market could reduce these price differentials at present most lng is traded through longterm contract s that have the effect of perpetuating the regional character of the marketsnatural gas markets in 2006 the energy information administration eia in its october 2006 shortterm energy and winter fuels outlook stewfo provided encouraging news for residential natura l gas consumers1 their 20062007 winter heating bills were projected to decline by an average of about 119 per household or 13 from 2005 2006 levels2 this anticipated decline in consumer costs is related to market conditions in 2006 that have been quite different from those observed year ago this report analyzes the key factors affecting prices in the us natural gas market including consumption production re serves and storage levels the current environment of declining prices is compared to last year as well as nearterm future projections that continue to show tight market and high prices background the us natural gas market is regional market drawing supplies from domestic sources as well as imports via pi peline from canada in addition small part of domestic supply is imported in the form of liquefied natural gas lng which is part of small but growing world ma rket as result of the regional nature of natural gas markets around the world prices may differ across the various regions3 within the us market different groups of consumers pay different prices for natural gas residential commercial industrial and electric power consumers are the largest groupings with transportatio n uses the newest category cost of distribution as well as scale of quan tity purchased determine price paid alt hough in some cases state regulatory commissions can determine some prices in general residential consumer s constitute the largest custom er base over 62 million in 2004 purchase the smallest quantities per customer and pay the highest prices electric power generators consume large quantities and pay the lowest per unit price historically industrial consum ers were the largest consumers of natural gas although their aggregate consumption has declined in recent years on the supply side in 2005 domes tic production provi ded about 83 of consumption imports via pipeline from ca accounted for approximately 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33714crs2 4 total does not add up to 100 because of rounding 5 the reserve to production ratio measures the number of years then current production can be sustained if this ratio is increasing more natural gas is being added to the reserve base through discovery than is being drawn down due to production and consumption however the new gas added to the reserve base may be more expensive to produce 6 recently however because of the increasing use of natural gas in electric power generation summer use rates have increased as air conditioning demand increasesand lng mostly from trinidad accounted for about 24 production represents draw from the reserve base in the us the reserve base measured by the reserve to production ratio has been growing in creasing from 88 years in 1997 to 104 years in 20045 storage is an important component of natural gas supply because while production tends to be relatively constant throughout the year consumption tends to peak during the winter heating season november through march as home heating use rises and tends to moderate in the other seasons6 for this reason the industry injects gas into storage facilities to prepare for winter heating season demand peaks in recent years the industry has established target of over 3 trillion cubic feet tcf of gas in storage for this purpose while price is an important determinan t of consumption and production in the market at the aggregate level the weather is perhaps even more important in consumption decisions by residential consum ers the primary use of natural gas by residential consumers home h eating tends to be quite price inelastic consequently the onset of cold temperatures causes dema nd peaks largely independent of the level of prices market conditions 2006 consumption aggregate consumption of natural gas in the united states for the first seven months of 2006 was 41 or 551 billion cubic feet bcf lower than the comparable period in 2005 table 1 shows how this decrease in consum ption for comparable time periods was divided between the consuming market segments reside ntial consumption declined by the largest amount in both pe rcentage and volume terms commercial demand also decreased by more than the average for the market industrial demand decreased by more than the average for the market but this decline may be part of long term fall in indus trial demand of pproximately 19 over the period 2000 to 2005 consumption by electric power generato rs is derived demand in the sense that their demand for natural gas is pendent on and derive d from consumers demand for electric power which has been growing the use of natural gas in transportation vehicles is very small but growing portion of the total markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33714crs3 the key factors in explaining the observed reductions in natural gas consumption over the past year are price nd the weather although these two factors affect all market segments their relative effects vary across the market segments table 1

1464 per thousand cubic feet mcf in the winter of 20052006 peak price for the decade 57 above the average residential price for the peri od 20002005 and an increase of 32 over the previous winter heating season probably more important the winter heating season in 20052006 was also warmer than normal for the united states as whole as measured by population weighted heating degree days these two factors warm weather coupled with high prices likel accounted for large portion of the reduced demand observed in the residential sector commercial demand is like residential demand largel used for space heating as result this sectors consumption is also likely to be relatively insensitive to changes in price and quite sensitive to weather variations industrial consumption of na tural gas is likely to be more sensitive to price variations and less sensitive to weather variations than residential or commercial consumption natural gas is used in produc tion processes both as raw material for example in the nitrogenous fertilizer industr and as source of process heat as in the steel industry many of the domestic i ndustries that use larg quantities of natural gas cannot easily pass cost increases on to final consumers because they face competition from overseas producers who have access to cheaper sources of natural gas as result of this inability to remain competitive in the face of increased natural gas prices in the united states some fi rms have either ceas ed domestic production or moved their facilities overseas accountin g for the decrease in us industrial natural gas consumption the electric power sectors consumpti on of natural gas pends on the demand for electricity which itself is dependent on the price of electricity and the weather in the short term consumption is also aff ected by the primary fuel choice for the mixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33714crs4 of power generators in the supply base fuel switching capability and how production is divided between baseload and peak power generation the use of natural gas in transportation vehicles is largely for commercial purposes for example city bus fleets as such this sectors consumption might be expected to be relatively insensitive to the price of natural gas as well as weather conditions production and imports aggregate dry natural gas production in the united states for the first seven months of 2006 was 28 or 307 bcf lower than in the comparable period in 2005 production data for the first seven months does not however provide complete picture of the 20052006 winter fuels market from the producers side because the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita were felt largely in the fourth quarter of 2005 and into 2006 the hurricanes disrupted natural gas production and deliveries from the gulf coast region by about 67 bcf per day or about 11 of average daily us consumption the effect of the hurricanes on natural gas production continued to be important during the first quarter of 2006 and persisted through the summer of 2006 imports of natural gas come mainly from canada through pipelines comparing the period january to july 2006 and 2005 imports from canada declined by about 35 smaller decline than that of us consumption of natural gas lng imports into the united states come mainly from trinidad which supplied almost 70 of us consumption as well as nigeria geria and other nations however the quantities are small in the aggregate l ng supplied only 28 of total us natural gas consumption in 2005 over the first seven months of 2006 imports of lng have declined by 27 storage consumption of natural gas is govern ed by two weather related cycles one somewhat predictable the other less so the first cycle is yearly average consumption rises during the winter hea ting season november to march and is lower in the spring and fall seasons the second pattern less predictable as to timing is that extremely cold weathe r conditions yield sharp increases in consumption taken together with rela tively constant rate of production these patterns create the need for natural gas storage capacity the typical yearly pattern is that stored gas is withdrawn during the winter heating season and replenished with storag injections during the following spring summer and fall seasons relatively new development in this process is that summer storage injections can be interrupt ed by periods of extremely hot weather as peak electric power generating capacity has become fired by natural gas to greater extent the summer gas injection season can become disrupted by peak electricity demand conditions the industry ideally plans to carry an average natural gas storage inventory of approximately 33 to 35 tcf at the start of the winter heating season the estimatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33714crs5 7 energy information administration shortterm energy outlook december 12 2006maximum storage capacity in the united states is 36 tcf on december 1 2006 the amount of natural gas in storage was 3406 tc f which was 232 bcf more than at the comparable time in 2005 and 282 bcf above the five year average quantity in storage at the end of november 2006 the eia timates that stored natural gas will amount to 169 tcf by the end of the 20062007 winter heating season this level of stored gas is above the five year average7 the high levels of stored gas attain ed as the winter 20062007 heating season begins suggests that the market is well supplied unlikely to experience physical shortages and is likely to ex perience moderate price levels prices number of prices are monitored by analys ts of the natural gas industry there is spot market price set at the henry h ub in louisiana and futures market price set at the new york mercantile exchange nymex in new york city the wellhead price is paid to producers of natural gas while various classes of consumers residential co mmercial industrial and ectric power generators each have their own pricing structure the city gate price reflects the delivered price of natural gas to various major consuming markets as it is delivered to large distributors the import price of natural gas is paid to those suppliers who deliver natural gas to the united states either by pipeline or in the form of lng historically the ratio of the price of barrel of crude oil to the price of one thousand cubic feet mcf of natural ga s has been 61 based on equivalent heat content during the last three years of elevated crude oil prices the ratio has risen as high as 131 suggesting that customary linkages between the two markets may have weakened as factors such as political risk affected the world oil market table 2 shows the comparative wellhead price of natural gas from january to july for 2006 and 2005

material in production processes nitrogenous fertilizer industry and as process heating fuel some primary metals indus tries many indus trial consumers face an internationally competitive market for their products and fi nd it difficult to pass cost increases along to consumers because the natural gas market is not worldwide but regional in scope different prices for natural gas can coexist in different parts of the world without market forces that might tend to qualize them as result an industry that faces high natural gas prices and for whom natural gas is large element in the cost structure of their products could ultimate ly face the choice of keeping prices at competitive levels and suffering reduced profits or even losses or closing domestic plants and moving production capacity overseas once an industrial consumer of natural ga s makes decision to either go out of business because of low profits resulting from high costs or decides to move production capacity overseas to take advantage of lower co sts it is not likely return to the domestic production base if natural gas costs merely decline it is likely that the relative price structure of natural gas woul d have to invert befo re the firm decided to return to producing in the domestic ec onomy although us natural gas prices have risen and fallen over time the north american market has been and

industrial consumption of natu ral gas in the united states has declined by total of 22 over the period 1997 to 2005 this decline may have been accompanied by decline in us jobs and tax base and an

to measure the sensitivity of the relationship between price and consumption demand is said to be inelastic when specified percentage change in price leads to smaller percentage change in demand 10 inelastic consumer demand for electricity is thought to exist because consumers consider electricity to be an essential good its price per unit is low relative to income and because of lack of real

natural gas by electric power generators is derived demand dependent on electricity demand in the s hort term and depende nt on investment in generating capacity and technology in the l onger term consumers are likely to have an inelastic demand for electricity in the short term9 this insensitivity of electric power demand translates into an insensitivity in generators demand for natural gas to produce the electric power10 electric power generators to the extent that market forces are able to work in the market are likely to be able to pass cost increases on to consumers electric power generators are also not as readily subject to the possible entry of new foreign competitors into the market as result of cost differentials nor can they move thei r production facilities outside the north american region in the longer term electric power capacity investment decisions could be determined by the price of natural gas that electric power generators face if the relative price of natural gas increases sufficiently new capacity in the form of coal fired power plants could become an economically viable competitor to gas even though coal is not as clean burning as natural gas and requires higher emission control expenditures in summary price increases in the natural gas market have likely had an effect on the relative demand structure for natural gas while most sectors eg

generators are likely to exhibit inelastic demand which supports their consumption in times of rising prices the industrial sector has greater price sensitivity to natural gas price increases and reduces its consumption in the face of higher prices as result the aggregate decline in us natural gas consumption only gives partial pictur of the effect of high prices shortterm forecast the eia projects tightening natural gas market in 2007 aggregate consumption is expected to increase by 29 compared to 2006 residential and industrial consumption are expected to increase by 87 and 27 consumption by electric power generators is expected to decline by 23 from 2006 levels us production of natural gas is project ed to increase by 08 in 2007 as the disruptions in production due to hurricanes katrina and rita ar repaired imports of lng from africa are expected to rise by 41 in 2007 risk factors analyses in this report are consistent with the eia base case in the stewfo that consumers might expect to see lower natural gas prices and heating costs during the winter 20062007 heating season howeve r the eias projection is dependent on conditions which may or ma not materialize this section of the report analyzes risk factors in the 20062007 market outlook weather weather is key factor in determining na tural gas consumption in the residential and commercial sectors and to lesser extent in the electric power sector the industrial sector generally is unaffected by weather the eia stewfo baseline weather case is from the national oceanic atmosphere administration noaa and assumes winter that is 59 colder compared to last winter but 21 wa rmer than the average from 1971 to 2000 periods of cold weather can have effects on natural gas prices for example it was reported that november 2006 na tural gas future prices rallied on the news of cold weather pattern that devel oped in late october even though gas storage was approaching an alltime high level and most analysts saw downward pressure on price11 if the noaa weather forecast sign ificantly overestimates the average temperatures this coming winter na tural gas prices could move upwardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33714crs10 12 villar jose and joutz frederick l the relationship between crude oil and natural gas prices energy information administration ffice of oil and gas october 2006 13 long position is one where the trader owns the right to buy the co mmodity in the future contrasted to short position where the trader has the right to sell the commodity in the future 14 see energy information administ ration office of oil and gas an assessment of prices of natural gas futures contracts as predicto r of realized spot prices at the henry hub october 2005 the eia found that futures prices are poor predictors of realized spot prices for any given month and that futures prices ar relatively poor at anticipating realized spot prices 15 lammey alan opcit p2oil prices recent research carried out by the eia finds that there is significant relationship between oil prices measured by the west texas intermediate wti crude oil price and the price of natural ga s at the henry hub the researchers found that onemonth temporary increase in the price of wti of 20 leads to 5 contemporaneous increase in natural gas pri ces which declines to 2 in two months if the 20 price increase of wti is permanen t this is found to lead to 16 increase in henry hub natural gas one year out12 the wti crude oil spot price reached its 2006 peak of 7441 per barrel in july by september 20 06 the price had declined to 6380 per barrel decline of over 14 this decline in oil prices likely c ontributed to the declining prices in the natural gas market however contributor to the decline in oil prices was thought to be the lessening of political tensions in the middle east following the withdrawal of israeli forces from lebanon and the potential for decline in tensions with the iranian government concerning nuclear wea pons development as in the past the middle east and the persian gulf regions remain politically volatile making volatile oil prices likely futures markets although the effect of futures prices for natural gas traded on the nymex on commodity prices traded on the henry hub is uncertain an increased interest in long positions by financial traders is likely to affect the futures price of natural gas13 depending on the perspective an increasin g long position by traders could translate into an increasing price for natural gas consumers14 however in late october it was reported that the market wa s overbought and it was mo re likely that selloff might emerge and put further downwar d pressure on the natural gas price15 conclusion the eia stewfos conclusion that reside ntial consumers might expect to see reduced natural gas heating costs during the winter of 20062007 sees consumption rising but price falling by greater proporti on indeed some analysts see the pricehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33714crs11 of natural gas already having peaked for the winter season th market fundamentals of consumption production and storage reserves are likely to be consistent with weakening market price however cont ributor to the overall reduced consumption in the market is falling industrial consumption because the natural gas price has been so volatile in recent years there is chance that the stewfo s over or underestimated the natural gas price for the winter heating season
