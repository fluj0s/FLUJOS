gradients lecture given on 29 september 1964 how are you today audience fine you alive audience yes lets see if theres anybody who isnt doesnt seem to be all right this is the what of the what audience 29 september ad 14 what date audience 29 september ad 14 ah yes youre more certain about that twentyninth of september ad 14 saint hill special briefing course all right going to talk to you today about rundown of levels and classifications and give you some kind of an idea on how this is all packaged together and also give you couple of elementary actions about auditing pcs this seems to be scrambled sort of lecture to give you all at one and the same time but believe its the same lecture and you could call this lecture gradients gradienta gradient is an extremely interesting concept very interesting idea and it has bypassed great many scientologists the idea of gradient whenever i see you sit down in session and have difficulty pulling withhold i know what youre up against youre not up against the fact that you havent got nerve enough to pull withhold thats what you think you see youre just up against gradient when youre up against that thats all whenever you have trouble auditing youre having trouble with gradients its the only thing and if you knew gradients like crazy and you knew what gradient was and you had it straight youd never have any trouble with any pc you ever had anything to do with clich√©s such as you have to learn to walk before you can run thats gradient you cant enter the hundred and fifth story of the empire state building without going into the ground floor thats gradient you cant climb vertical hill but you might climb one of ten percent grade thats gradient and if you really had this one mastered youd never have any trouble with any pc you ever had anything to do with and you notice my lectures tend to go toward definitions basics very definitely notice i was talking to you about clears and clearing well we got the clearing technology its the first thing ive been trying to straighten out is what is this thing called clear and what is clearing and what does clear mean all right now lets get into the fundamentals of an auditors auditing and we find were up against this word called gradient and you havent got that thing grasped so that you can wrap both arms around it and say buddy youre going to have trouble and every student on the saint hill spbriefing course and ive seen them down the time when we werefrom the basement of the manor and so forth on forward and theyre sweating and screaming and having horrible time trying to pull somebodys overts he wasnt having any trouble with overts he was just having trouble with gradients thats all havingnot having trouble with it he just had never learned what gradient was thats all thats the principle that was missing in his auditing gradient it wasnt there so he couldnt pull any overts elementary so whatwhat you have trouble with is usually not what youre having trouble with apparently it works in training the same way it works with the pc the pc says oh im having terrible trouble with my wife well you know and my wife and i well you process it and so forth and the next session why im having terrible trouble with my wife and so on and you process it and next session im having terrible trouble with my wife and so on you say whats the matter here well youreone youre not advancing his case i call to your attention that its stuck the main trouble that youre having in this particular case isthis particular caseis the fact that youre not auditing whats wrong otherwise something would happen now there could also be gradient error here in pc isnt having trouble with his wife man hes just having trouble on such broad line so that he cant possibly orient himself and hes just merely blaming it on his wife or something like this and he isnt then attacking that part of his life he can do something about so hes foisting off on you the fact that hes having trouble with his wife well all right so hes having trouble with his wife great but if you processed it for session or two and nothing resolved in this particular direction then that isnt whats the trouble thats one of the things that could be there that isnt the trouble the trouble must be something else because this trouble isnt folding up and you see you cantyou cant get somebody over trouble he isnt having is the point im making its very hard to do and youre up against the problem of gradient there and its the gradient of confront what can he confront about his existence and so on and he claims he can confront his wife see but he claims this but his analysis of his case and his difficulties is just too high for what the thing is see now you ask himif you were to ask himlets apply gradient to this ive given you the other ramification he isnt having trouble with his wife so therefore you cant do anything about it hes just blaming his wife for all the trouble hes having you see theresbe difference here of some kind or another he may have attacked his case on the wrong gradient now theres this foolish gradientand this is silly one but its very good exampletheres certain rural parts of farming districts will always breed this particular joke and that is if you took calf and you lifted him every day from the time he was tiny calf up to the time he was totally grown why you would eventually be able to lift fullgrown bull of course theres that joke and then theres the wrong way gradient and so forth is that theyre trying to cure this horse of eating by reducing his feed one straw per day and by golly before they taught him not to eat he starved to death you know i mean silly jokes of this particular character nevertheless they do have something to do with gradients even though theyre wrong way to and impossible dont you see but theyre still gradient now someplace in this fellows existence he would be able to put his feet on the road of something he could do something about or some direction he could go and this is something he could do and then having accomplished that he would then find the little more that he could do and then that we would find little more that he could do and having found that little more that he could do and find that now thats built in as an automaticity into many processes what can you confront would be builtin automaticity here youd saywell automatically if you assess the pc what he could confront youll find out that he eventually will be able to confront more and more and more see do you see that you have some fellowwell you can see this you can say what in this room can you see the fellow says well the whole room yes yes the whole room well what particular point of the room could you see well that and that and that and that and that and that and that and all of sudden hell brighten up and he will see the whole room dont you see so youve seen that work as gradient and the mind just goes in this direction so of course it very rapidly lends itself to being an automatic process see automatically if the fellow starts becoming familiar with something he will become more familiar with more well because it happens anyway and because the mind goes in this direction is reason that you must go on leaving it on automatic do you see i know im using some gpm terminology there but youre up to it the pointthe point im making is here that yeah automaticity is one of thea word of that character is one of the items in the gpms which is probably why you become very devoted to it but here isheres the point if you ask somebody to confront something they will confront little bit and then will confront more and confront more and confront more and confront more and more and more and more and more and then hell be able to confront whole lot see thats gradient but just because he does that without you doing anything more about it than utter the repetitive process is reason why you can just abandon yourself following the gradient see youve got to follow this gradient youve got to make this come about not with that particular process that will happen anyway dont you see im talking about the fact that your address to the case has to be planned on gradient you cant just say well all these processes automatically follow gradients see youve got to plan the gradient now hes saying well im having lot of trouble with my wife and lot of trouble with my wife and trouble with my wife and trouble with my wife and trouble with that well this is gradient well what part of all that trouble have you felt you could do something about what part of it and he comes down to some part that he actually can confront and he can do something about and then hell move further on into it and be able to confront the whole problem and then youll be able to audit the whole problem you got that in other words you could take some little section of this pie and address this section and then move on into other sections well you normally regard that not as gradient but as taking part of the whole thing actually it is part of the whole thing but its also gradient youre taking little bit and going on to little more and little more and little more and little more and little more and more and more and then youve got the whole thing processes are all designed on the basis of starting in with little bit and winding up with lot all processes are designed that way classification which i said i was going to say something about is also designed that way this fellow can handle little bit or little piece of auditing and little bit of pc or aor kind of routine pc he can sort of handle pianola pc you know pianola an old term plays itself so he can handle this pcpc wouldthis pcill give you the gradient of pcs you see this pc say well i have headachewell its gone see well guy at class 0 you see well he could handle that says anything wrong with you person says yeah i got headache well how do you feel now its gone you see he could handle very easy pc well the gradients as they go up the line progress into tougher pcs but nottheyre not graded against tougher pcs theyre graded against more of the case dont you see but along with this you also get the tougher pcs so as he goes upstairs in his classes as he starts walking up the grade of his classes he of course can handle more difficult pcs and he can also handle more of the pcs case and this is what is being asked of an auditor in an advanced classification very early classification we dont expect him to handle very much of pcs case and we dont expect him to handle very difficult pc see the way we handle that is we dont try to train this fellow up instantly and immediately and give him full hcs course in the next three or four minutes as were coaching his auditing we just say well he just isnt getting anyplace on this pc at all wed have to figure out what kind of pc is he running here well hes running tough one man ithisimi remember this pc because this pcs given us tough time in instruction and this pcs given us tough time here and there and weve got this fellow and whats hiswhats his class well his class is that if hes trained very very hard and puffed his cheeks up very hard and got very red in the face he would be able to push grain of sand one millimeter see well we cant demand this of him we handle the situation actually by saying somewhat offhandedly and grandly we just simply saywe dont try as the has coaudit instructor to handle this case and so on we just say well the best thing for you to do we say to the pc is get some hgc auditing easy way to solve it or field auditing or the best thing if were running field pe and so forth best thing for you to do is get some auditing over the weekends and weve got auditors who can audit you because youre difficultmore difficult case and so forth than this particular level of training calls for youll find out very amazingly this guyll say oh im something special im called difficult case well go ahead remember some auditor somewhere along the line will have to run out the fact that you told him he was difficult case but if you knew your gradients and you knew this then you wouldnt bang your head up against this thing of saying well joe class 0 you certainly arent handling this pc mr mountain you certainly arent doing good job of itsa there because mr mountain is just getting arc broke and hes just ablowing and hes having an awful time so you just arent doing good job hes doing fine job of class 0 auditing hes doing exactly what hes supposed to do but class 0 auditing just doesnt happen to be up to handling mr mountain you see that all right now supposing we ran into the has coauditthats the difficulty of the casenow supposing we ran into the has coaudit the fact that they were only going to run gpms well that would be complete psychosis because ityoure saying to the beginning of the gradient handle the whole total case at one fell swoop well of course nobodyd get anyplace nobodyd do anything every once in while you see this ambition come out all the time somebody wants this oneshot clear you take twentytwo grade horse needle or something of the sort and shoot it into the gluteus maximus and this guy goes spung and hes instantly ot and so on actually it is very nutty but it is not unusual because practically every psychiatrist in the world is walking around in this delusion and theres some little outfitive forgotten its name harvard harvard some little schoolthat sends out demands for contributions all the time because theyre trying to find this magic ingredient in biochemistry and theyve got big biochemical project going and they want lots of money in order to find the perfect biochemical thing thatll put everybody back to battery instantly with one shot in the gluteus maximus and of course theyre getting that straight out of our early rumors of the oneshot clear this sort of thing they probably read that and they said well theyve got something called oneshot clear so therefore that would be shot in the gluteus maximus there and therefore their thinkingness if we could just get together enough money and put enough people to work on it why then the problem would solve why i think thats marvelous idea they have in modern science anyway that if you put enough money on anything and enough people on anything that it would solve i call to your attention that it doesnt work in government governments are now hiring one government official per citizen i mean thats about the ratio and thats enough people working on something isnt it and talk about enough money well theyre getting something like 105 percent of everybodys paycheck and they still havent solved mankind or war or anything else so it doesnt necessarily hold true that if you put enough money on something and enough people on something that itll solve see what is true however is if you tackle the first fundamental that needs to be approached and handled you could probably eventually handle the whole thing providing you were content to walk this grade if you go up this gradient step by step take little more in stride if you figured out whats missing well i did an interesting one the other day i got long involved letter from the british color council the whole world of photography is on its ear on the subject of color and theyve got it all planned out color harmony and color this and color that theyre having an awful time theyve got some new toy called highspeed ectochrome or something of the sort and itll take color so right away they all figure they have to know more about color well of course the designers and the architects and the paint companies and everybody else these people are all interested in color and then there must be something mysterious or peculiar that they havent known yet about this subject so theyre hammering and pounding along this line and then in addition to that big advertising agencies that wish to compel more sales on the part of more citizens are interested in color from the standpoint of ads and packages and so on so color is big money these days and its big problem these days and youve got lot of bumsi mean lot of chaps lot of fellowsstanding around making an awful lot of money producing nothing in the line of color research see but what they havent done is attack the fundamental problem that has to do with color and the fundamental problem that has to do with color is color is essentially light wavelength and light wavelength cant be looked at by anything else well go into this slowly you cannot look at light with something else now let give you an analogy you can look at sound you can look at sound electronically you can take electronics and examine the living daylights out of sound and as matter of fact sound engineers of recent times can synthesize put together just out of drawing sound waves in electronic patterns can produce sound that sounds just like piano and sounds just like guitar sounds just like anything in other words they can resynthesize the harmonics of any instrument and produce the instrument and i heard record the other day whereby they had just worked and fiddled around with electronic waves until theyd produced whole orchestra and somebody had really had ball you see they just kept playing this tape through and adding new electronic vibrations to the thing till they had whole symphony going on the thing there was an earlier one called nola they had piano going there playing ragtime music and that sort of thing and of course there wasnt any piano and there hadnt been any piano what they did was just calculate the harmonics of the sound electronically and then feed those things through an electronic recorder and mix them and at the other end the thing sounded like piano you get the idea but you were looking at sound with electronics well now the wavelengths of light and the wavelengths of electronics are the same thing see what are we going to do here how can wesee what are we going to look at color with see sound thats very gross vibration thats big vibration its very easy to use light to look at sound but you couldnt use sound to look at light there isnt anything smaller than light with which to examine light so of course then they cant determine what are the harmonics of light they can measure wavelength they can measure this and that but what are its harmonics what are its dissonances you know if you thoughttalked of light in the same form as music youd say well music has clashes and it has counterpoint it has this it has that well obviously the same things exist in light but how are you going to measure them you dont have anything smaller with which to measure them theres nothing to look at light with if you dont believe it turn out the light and try to see something but there is something that can observe color there is something that can observe color and can react to dissonances and clashes and smoothnesses and chords if you want to put it into music and thats you see theres thetan now he can inspect color so when they try to work out color harmony or what color should you paint the walls it then comes down to taste something we call taste person feels some particular way about seeing red with green polka dots you see he feels in some peculiar way about this and so therefore somebodyand because he felt this way then he decides there must be law about it so he said red with green polka dots wont do see so then if you set up an authority like this then the authority passes law and it says there shall be green polka dots mixed with red but you see they dont know and yet the amount of money thats being spent in this area of research is fabulous but nobody is attacking the basic problem of it because youve got to have something with which to look at color which can be measured or which is capable of measuring beyond the idea of mere opinion and then you could put together science of color ah but there are billions being spent on this right now tremendous quantities of money being spent on color and there are more authorities walking around saying well its very complex of course only an expert could understand this you see you want to be aware of these subjects where only an expert can understand them you see you say all right ill tell you how to throw them all right im an expert get to understand it well they say well you dont know this and you dont know that and you dont know something else well im perfectly willing to learn your vocabulary and your terms and understand it this outfit will of course veryget very fast driven to the wall then they will have something else they will say well you havent gone to the right school you may know all the subject but you havent gone to the right school so therefore of course you couldnt understand it where are we winding up here see were just winding up into the old hedge see this guy is backing up the more you say look im willing to understand it lets try to understand this situation lets try to get grasp on this situation and so forth well if theyif he doesnt immediately lead forward and try to give you the understanding that is there on it well you can assume then that there probably is understanding but great deal of fakery connected with it i was giving you color i hope i didnt miss any words theyre very unimportant if i did but the whole point is the world has craziness about this sort of thing and they will go for ages and ages and ages studying the upper story of something theyre always skipping the gradient see and theyve got engineers that theyre training right this minute that theyre training how to fix up bridges and how to supertest the high tensile strength of supersteels you see all of that justyou know theyre just training them within an inch of their lives you know that sort of thing and theyve neglected to train them such little fundamentals as what does two plus two equal what iswhat is the basic idea of stress and strain why do you have stress and strains in the first place what do these things mean you know whats the vocabulary of engineering you know i mean littlethese thingsthese are the things these guys have hard time with there they are up there see oh were going to build it were going to do that and so on ruh ruh ruh they couldnt even bend pin see they just jumped this zooom see theyre way up on top and in the world of color here theyre building this fantastic structure and they have not studied this basic area what are you looking at color with what could look at color how could you look at color so as to produce constant record of reaction see i mean theyre really closer into our department than they are into the department of engineering because the only thing i know of that can look at and record color is the thetan he has taste he has feeling about it he says this room is very harmonious these dark green walls with the light green striping and so forth that makes feel very nice see so hes measured the color harmony of the room he says color harmony of the room very good see he goes into this room and its orange its got orange walls and the room has got an ultramarine floor and the thing is bright shade of lime all over the ceiling you see and theres magenta or purple carpets and he walks into this room and he sayshe says i dont like this i dont like this now thats as close as they come to it of course they have certain mechanics they find out that certain colors cancel out certain colors and interact one way or the other in pigment so as to make gray and in light so as to make white so they think theyre onto something and theyve found some of the harmonics of the wavelength but i never even heard the word harmonic used amongst them they say these are complementary and theyre this and that as thoughas though band of waves which begins with and winds up with b is always circle well it couldnt be circle because its just stretchedout band of waves thats all i mean one wave islets not use the color termsbut you say is one inch long and the othernext waves up the line are two inches long and the waves up the line we get on up the line in the thing and the bands are one mile long well we wouldnt then be able to join the one mile into the one inch so it cant be circle i mean these are the things that have not been examined it isnt huge complications and millions and billions and that sort of thing they haventthey havent taken look at this thing and said you know this thing we call color wheel doesnt always produce immediate and direct results so therefore there might be something wrong with it lets see if we cant work on this color wheel little bit more see well they go off into these terrific terms you read book on this subject now and itd just crack your brains you could just feel them crack right down the middle im not kidding you ooh mireds and greek letters and densities and percentages of transmission and you get to looking at this thing after while and you say boy there must be something known here its so impressive something very impressive well im afraid its that impressive because somebody has skipped they havent ever tried to come in the front door of this thing theyre still trying to get in the top of the building see now how is it that you can join up linealthat is to say straight lineseries of wavelengths which would runas im giving you the wrong measurements just to give the ideafrom one inch to one mile and then say the one mile one then joins up at the one inch one that theres one mile one right next to the one inch one well youd have to do that you see in order to make color wheel theres some place on that wheel where the wavelength is one mile joined up to one inch and that is supposed to be the progressive point of the wheel the wheel wouldnt go that way dont you see you couldnt possibly have this little tiny wave right next door to this great big wave and say well those are the adjacent waves couldnt be done stretch of the imagination but that is such fundamental observation that its never been made they dont make that fundamental type of an observation dont you see so the reason theyre in trouble and the problems theyre having is because they have never started to walk that path where it starts they never tried to clarify what problem are we having theyve never tried to clarify what are we doing theyve never said well what are we working with see just that fundamental whats got to be licked around here you know this sort of thing instead of that theyve invented this fantastic amount of balderdash you see which has got all kinds of signs and symbols and laws and rules and authority and you cant read book by zuck because its in contradiction with book by the nameby zack you see and he is big authority because he studied monet well monet didnt know anything about these things he was good thetan he knew what was agreeable and what was disagreeable dont you see just good thetan on the subject of color and he also was capable of hitting an average he not only knew what he liked but he had feeling for what would be liked see so he could register color like lot of people could register color dont you see so therefore his work was pleasing thered be point in studying monet youd have to study scientology then you might get someplace what was monet now wed have to take monet apart and wed have to admit the fact that there must be something else there besides some meat you can take an awful lot of meat and put it up against an awful lot of color and it wont register anything you see where im getting to so heres topheavy subject now you probably missed lot of that but i dont care because its unimportant you can get as stupid as you like on this subject because youd just get stupid as everybody else is on it but heres where you join up when you dont know this thing called gradients you get into the same condition and you try to build castle on top of palace on top of complication that you call the pcs case because you never walked up the gradient then you never see the case dont you see you arrive instantly at the totality and of course you cant get any right answers to this case you might have the theoretical right answers in scientology but to this particular case you never get the right answers and the reason you never get the right answers is because you never picked up anything that was fundamental that the person could confront you never picked up anything that the person could start with and so of course neither he nor you ever observed his case and you wind up with psychoanalysis or you wind up with some squirrel process but you certainly wind up with fantastic notion of the horrible complexities of existence its overpowering i mean you say my god that poor fellow hes got all these problems with his wife and hes got all these problems about his job and he has all these psychosomatic difficulties and the best thing for him is some paraglutenous magnoid shot into the rectabulous skootum doctor hand the flit you see your answersobservations are nonsense so therefore the solutions are going to be nonsense and you can put those things together any day of the week and you see bunch of nonsense solutions then you know darn well that the observation has been nonsense those two go hand in glove so you sit and look at this pc and you say ron said we should observe this pc all right ill sit and observe this pc my god problems about his wife problems about this problems about this isnt he confusion yeah confusion to him too but if you keep trying to observe the totality of the case without ever once finding one little thing you could observe about that case youll never get gradient youll never get on the track youll never get the gradient that leads toward an observation of the ease lets just look at it from the standpoint of observation lets takesit andjust look at somebody for while whats this guy doing that i can understand lets take the poor auditor not the complexities of the case whats he doing that i can understand and you actually have to take that before you can remedy case you see hes sooooo wwaahhll and so on and its all oh dear and trouble with my wife and so forth and then theres my sciatica and of course if i get rid of my sciatica ill lose my bonus and ill lose all of this other stuff you see but actually it was my mother and father they fought like cats and dogs you see and my father was circus animal trainer and he used to beat all the time and so life has been very complicated and when i was psychoanalyzed before i got the electric shocks and you say woooow now if your observation of this case is based on the fact that youve got to grasp all of this then you havent started gradient observation and youll never really be able to remedy ease the book of remedies when it comes out will be nonsense to you what have you got to do to start to remedy this case well you have to notice something that you can understand about the case and then youll find something more that you can understand about the ease and then having found that that you can understand about the case youll now find something else you can understand about the case and the next thing you know this ease well actually you never do get up to understanding the complexities of the case because if you understood it that far the ease starts to fall apart and you havent got this complex case sitting in front of you any longer do you follow this now in other words this person is in terrible trouble this person is an awful state this person is very complex this person is all messed up you give him solution you see well you say well actually if you get divorce wouldnt it be mu oh i couldnt do that you see because my mother is dead against divorce shes catholic you say well are you catholic what could you do about your mother and so forth and he says heh uhum youre lost hes had you well youre trying to understand the incomprehensible youre trying to understand the totality youre trying to reach out and grab everything and youre just going to get loses all the way along the line if you do that well what could you understand about this case and you look this case over very very hard and you look over your situation and if you remember what im telling you about this selfdiscipline on the subject of gradients you wont make this mistake youll say what can i observe about this case well he isnt getting any tone arm action good all right well lets look it up in the book of remedies tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action and ingrown toenails thats it hes also got ingrown toenails therefore we run this and you run that and the case starts falling apart see you got the idea youre always setting yourself to climb the whole road thats because the pc is always giving you this well what state actually is the pc in pc is in the top of gradient he hadnt climbed so of course hes always inviting you to be at the top of gradient that isnt climbed and you get suckered in on it every once in while you get pulled right in and you say all right we will solve the whole case in the next two days well in the next two days if you found something about the case that could be resolved you would be making progress wouldnt you but if you tried to solve the whole case in the next two days you wouldnt would you so the road of the gradient leads to big permanent wins and jumping all the gradients leads to total loss now lets take up this whole subject of overts and lets take up the whole subject of overts at one fell swoop and wind them up on the subject of gradients you sit down and you say to the pc you say all right pc have you ever committed any crime that would land you up in jail if it were found out about i guess thats the end of that overt pulling we fly at once to the top of the building ask for something that we might conceivably get after maybe fifteen or twenty hours of auditing we ask for it right now we dont get it but we restimulate it arc break the pc nicely upset the thing then we decide that we cant pull overts you see all the nonsense that proceeds from jumping the gradient see well whats the first thing necessary for the pulling of an overt whats the first point of the gradient well we have to consider the line that the overt is going to be pulled on and that is normally called communication line from the pc to the auditor now if it consists of little wire which is tenthousandth of an inch in diameter and you say ten thousand volts must now go over this wire its going to blow and break and thats going to be the end of that wire so there are two things you can do here actually the thing is very susceptible to solution you can get yourself stronger and stronger wire pc is more and more willing to talk to his auditor thats because its building up good strong communication line see and then we start feeding on this communication line some little overts that easily carry on it and then well find quite wonderfully that bigger overts will follow on this and bigger and bigger overts will follow on bigger and bigger communication line see and all of sudden why were sitting there looking at somebody whoseall of whose overts are pulled and we say well that wasnt very tough see do it by gradient now there are two gradients involved one is the gradient of the pcs willingness to talk to the auditor thats one gradient had nothing to do with overts its just the fact that its got to be there before you can pull any overts and the other is the gradient of what overt is he willing to talk to you about now lets go into this little bit further did you ever notice that there were people around that you were willing to say good morning to but not to discuss how good it was and then there were people that you could discuss how good the morning was to that you would not discuss personal plans with and then there are persons that you would not discuss personal plans with you see or say good morning to or anything else in other words there are different degrees of willingness to communicate now heres this bloke he sits down in the session hes in the state of willing to say good morning to you hes not willing to communicate any further than that to you the auditor all right so now lets pull big overt then we have the auditor practically in tears saying i cant pull overts well of course hes given us the wrong analysis of the situation the analysis is incorrect entirely incorrect he hadnt got communication line to pull overts on and he isnt trying to pull the overts that the guy can confront so there are two things wrong here this is communication line and gradient of overts so theres gradient of communication gradient of overts so of course he cant pull overts elementary now if you merely built up the pcs communication line to the auditor and never did anything with it the pcd feel much better and think you were great fellow this perhaps could be profession in itself but is not where auditing ceases having done that then you can do things with this line the pc along this line is then willing to communicate but what is the pc actually willing to communicate the pc is now willing to communicate what he himself is willing to confront it isnt whether you feel odd about it or not its whether he would feel strange about it or not you see its the datum in his own reaction to his own data see weve now got it pretty well straight that hes willing to talk to you but now weve got the factor of his own reaction to his own data in other words what could he confront in his own bank what of his own misdeeds is he willing to confront well thats the first overt that he will give you and of course having given you that one then hes willing to confront greater misdeed and having given you that one then hes willing to confront greater misdeed see so we build up the gradient of communication hes willing to say good morning to you hes willing to discuss his personal problems with you hes willing to discuss his very intimate problems with you see we build that up along that gradient and then we get what he could confront that he has done he himself and then we get little bit more that he could confront then we discover some things hes done that he didnt even remember or know hes done this stuff starts to fall out of the hamper and if we handle all these things well and maintain the communication line while were doing it the guy unloads all of his overts see well itstherefore you can arrive with this thing accomplished providing you follow gradient and of course you get nowhere by not following gradients its the difference between being able to walk and the difference of beingand not walking at all ever and thats what gradients mean unless you walk the gradient with auditing unless you attack the thing on gradient scale unless you approach these auditing activitiesa little bit is followed by little more is followed by little more and little more and little more and more and more and lot and lot and lot more than that and the big lot and so forthwhy nobody will go up through the grades training similarly is arranged on what could the person confront as an auditor what could the person accomplish or do as an auditor and you cant just say well all right get in there and pull all of the gpms well my god thatwe have enough trouble with class iv auditor whos been in the snake pit for many year confronting pcs and so forth and you should see the green look around his gills when he first starts to run some gpms out of pc he looks pretty pale his hands are pretty nervous he starts in with this and these tigers are awfully big tigers and he then of course gets belted in the brisket few times gets restimulated himself you see and knocked in the head and so forth and he is definitely of the opinion that hes handling tiger well this is somebody whos walked the trail somebody who has had successes in auditing somebody who is in pretty good condition to be able to confront and if this is his reaction on confronting what do you suppose it would do if you started to run them on an has coaudit what would happen well they wouldnt know what they were confronting they wouldnt know anything about it their mystery on it would be total and youd have people curled up in ball and chucking their cookies and winding up in the local hospital and being operated on by the local brain shrinker wow see i mean youd just be confronting total catastrophe youd just wind up people in the hospitals and mortuaries and so forth just left right and center bang bang bang you wouldnt miss somebody gratuitously the other day on the west coast of the united states from here gave lecture on clay table well now you say well come off of it clay table i mean couldnt possibly do anything on clay table he managed somebody went home woke up the next morning lips all swollen up terrible condition so forth clay table he just showed them how you symbolize something in clay see well it was too restimulative for his audience now thats interesting because it would never occur to you that this would be too restimulative for anybody not at your state of training not at your ability tolevel to confront at this particular stage never occur to you that this would knock people in the head yeah well i invite you ithatat this low level you say well you represent stuff in clay you just take piece of clay you see and you draw up mountain in clay you see and isnt that nice and so forth and thats the persons present time problem have somebody quietly keel over in the audience you know well youre dealing withyoure just dealing with the ability of people to confront and approach things well you get around some peopleyou get around some people just discuss some mild locks think yourself of the least you know what you do is think of the least possible restimulative thing that would still have something to do with the bank not the least restimulative subject you could think of but the least restimulative thing that you could have to do with with the bank and then say something about this to green fresh new group of people and exert your power of observation and look them over somebody there is going to turn green around the gills if not all of them you say well all right theres locks person has operations and so forth and later on every time they see knife or every time they see white basin or every time they see somebody in white cap hes giving little examples see why they feel that their heads being operated on or drilled into so forth well now that is lock and youll see well youre so accustomed to this line of thought that it would never occur to you that somebody would come dreadfully ill over this see thats your gradient see thats why on pe you must attack the gradient of definitions dont talk aboutmuch about the thing that is being defined but talk about the definition define life you know what do we mean by life take up dictionary definitions dont even take up scientology definitions you find out youd get along fine but youd still be stretchingnot overreachingbut youd still here and there in thein an audience that you are addressing be stretching the gradient life and somebodyd be sitting there life you say whats the matter god i just realized im alive well you actually have seen things like this happen in pes and things like this you see thesewhat appear to you to be totally nutty cognitions and you look and you say what how could this be you know well on broader basis youve probably had this experience yourself in the early days just spot three spots in the room three spots in the body all of sudden recognize that you had body sitting there in the chair ive had somebody emit piercing scream they suddenly found out that they were in body and that there was body there and so forth well this isyou say wait minute thats the most ordinary type of aof an action you could think of and of course everybody in life considers it ordinary well whats ordinary about it is nobody pays any attention to it and nobody confronts it thats whats ordinary about it and now all of sudden you start to actually pick apart the pieces of life and you start showing these things up on gradient of just this is the name of this is the name of see the thing which you have there the arms and legs and so forth thats body body body body and youright away youd have some girl thinking well you know theyre pretty nasty things and somebody else will be saying something or other and so on somebody else will be saying you know its this body and theyre awful heavy and get in the road and so on i have lot of trouble with my body these days body body you know brrrhh locks flying off i know it doesnt seem likely to you see but you blow whole chain of locks and somebody goes out the door he feels wonderful what the hell does he feel wonderful about he realized all those people around him had bodies and you look at this and you say how could he be so far out that that would be terribly significant that this would be an upscale walk for him well its just how far out he is see what is the gradient youve got to start with in addressing people or addressing subject and of course the top gradient thati mean thepardon methe gradient that you could approachabout the bottom gradient that you could approach is thought people can confront thought oddly enough more easily you know they can confront think or significance to give you some other words for it they can confront that more easily than they can confront masses or things so if you give them definitions about think then these will be the easiest things there are to confront and that will gradually walk forward to definition about mass and they can get definition about mass but the reason they dont grasp definitions about masses is theyre actually upscale you start telling somebody this is an emeter this is table this is floor you can get them to notice and ask them where these things are and so forth but this is the definition now why do you suppose this is called an emeter and so forth and start concentrating their attention on that sort of thing you can get much further by saying now worry is the condition you see by which an individual becomes and feels confused his survival is threatened he conceives his survival is threatened and he worries and you will very often see people worrying and they worry for various reasons but actually nobody worries unless he isfeels that his survival or the survival of something that he is very interested in is threatened and people say wow what youwhat youve done there is youve entered upclose as you came to mass is the survival of things you see but they kind of brushed off theyre just all whole masses you know theyre all indefinite they dont have to be real and that sort of thing but youve got this thing called worry hes very accustomed to worrythis worry and he right away says tsk tsk three cheers you know worry i know what worry is hell go out of that course thinking beautiful beautiful absolutely beautiful i know what worry is somebody thinks hes threatened somethings threatening him therefore he worries about it he is seeking to figure out what to do about something that is threatening him so that is worry and when somebody is worrying then he feels he is being threatened or that something else is being threatened in his vicinity yes theyll go in the next morning to their boss and theyll see the boss sitting there you know worried like that and they will say to the boss quite brightly what do you think is threatening is it you or the organization that you think something is threatening you or the organization now what do you think the threat would be and the boss says well soandso and soandso and of course it isnt very steep gradient it isnt very much theres not very much relief to be gotten out well he says well if you think of it that way thats prettythis blitzen company with that new machine that they put on the market man thats going to cause us lot of marketing and so on yeah yeah ive been worried about blitzen company i feel better fellow will say yeah because heswhat hes done is make the person perceive what the persons action in this particular department was you see and so hes had win you get the idea in other words he can then see how to apply the data that youre giving him because he himself can see the data youre giving him but when he cant see the data youre giving him he cant apply it and he flies up into the top floor of the building and adds bunch more complexities to this data and considers that its very complex and that theres fundamental there dont you see so he invents whole bunch of nonsense with regard to this thing and misses it entirely and never gets any result with it do you see that so you have to be very careful about gradients when youre training now in auditing pc if you ask pc well what in life do you think you couldhave been successful in handling youre liable to get yourself an hour or two comm lag because the idea of having been successful at handling anything is quite foreign this he has never had as cognition he has never thought of himself as having been the successful in handling anything and he gets long comm lag and he goes over this and over this and over this and hell finally give you an answer and hell very often feel lots better for having given you the answer and for having asked the question im not saying thats too steep gradient dont you see but that gradient would just be an upper border it takes him long time to answer it dont you see he has to grapple with this thing for quite while before it comes home to him then finally why he comes to conclusion about it or he gives you an answer to it well thats not bad when you run into that what you want to be afraid of is glibidity you havent had any new words lately ive been very nice and that isnt new word ive used it before he gives you very glib answers and you very often run into this in pcs and you wonder well this fellow is so good that i couldnt possibly process him upstairs any place because hes there you get glib you say well what could you do oh well i could build the empire state building well what could you do well i could move earth well what could you do well i could turn the sun off and on at will ah what could you do well i could collapse the universe and so forth comm lag and hed explain to you also quite glibly if you ask him ifwell all right if you can do all of these things why are you getting audited ah well trying to teach you how to audit or something like that youll getyoull get various responses all unreal its nowhere now trying to find gradient for that fellow to enter in on because hes already stuck on the top floor now trying to find gradient that he can enter in upon approach and go forward in life i mean in processing and so forth is fantastic because itll be the size of the reduced image of the shadow of grain of molecule small see tiny you actually have to fight around for while before you can find your first gradient in because obviously nothing is real to this person you sometimes find out guy walks in hes only got one leg his ambition is to be ballet dancer youll run into this once in while in clay table clearing its not for you man its not for you to question this ambition but you certainly better recognize that your gradient on this must be very slow low approach so right away theres something to understand about the case if you listen why you can always find something to understand about the case and enter in on gradient of solution to the case your gradient of solving the case of course is finding something about the case that you can grasp yourself see not try to find something the pc can grasp lets not be so introverted asand transferred or whatever you call it and then go ahead along the line and see some progress sometimes you undercut case too far and the case is insulted but thats only when you undercut it on the basis of sanity or some other unreal measure youre not undercutting on the basis of sanity youre undercuttingor insanityyoure undercutting on the basis of ability lets find out what the guy can do and then lets get him to do it better that was the old line but that first one lets find out what he can do thats easily missed because if you listen to the pc very often he can do everything you see but he cant do any of these things and so we really miss were thrown all right now the only time you really have to start investigating case and looking it over real hard is when the case isnt making an expected line of advance case isnt going along and getting better and feeling happier and more cheerful and so forth well about that time youd better start looking youd better start looking and youd better find something about the case that you can grasp and along about that moment youll say well he isnt getting any ta i can certainly understand that about him all right well lets solve that one before we go on doing something else obviously ta got present time problem or something of the sort next time you start to pull an overt on somebody and you feel queasy about asking this person for overts and so forth well just sum it up where are you entering the gradient one have you got communication line with this person is he in state of being able to say good morning to you is he in state of telling you about his personal affairs would he naturally and promptly confide to you some of his deeper secrets well if the answer to all of those things is you certainly had better build yourself communication line when you havent gotdo anything else but build communication line thats the only thing youre going to do youre not going to pull any overts what you going to pull them on theres line what are they all going to do magically and mystically develop because you think thought in some yogi position you got to have communication line then nownow that youve got that one licked recognize that youve now got your next stages which is what can the guy himself confront now you got to start there and that might be very small indeed and you start asking what have you done and theres various ways of approaching this sort of thing what have you done well he cant confront having done that so you can ask the reverse question like justifications dont you see well why wasnt that an overt hes got it all explained well that youdthatyou got that one from him in the first place you got that done what he said he did that he then had justifications for showed you that he himself was not capable of confronting what he had done so therefore you gotwhat youve got to find out is something he will tell you that he has done that he can confront having done so that is your next action in the pulling of overts you not only get line to pull them on and that itself is long gradient but now youve got the next line and so forth what does he confront that he can tell you about now that youve got nice line there then you have to keep the line in andwhile youre pulling overts and how do you do this how do you do this well that again is very elementary it is problem of overtsjust problem of gradients gradient overts youre sitting there and youre saying well you say you upset cup of coffee all right thank you very much now tell this have you ever tortured animals for the fun of it there goes your communication line man you can just hear it snap why well the first place youhe may have and you restimulated the living daylights out of him youve arc broke him he doesnt consider you real his reality drops and everything else well it isnt anything that youve asked him thats socially incorrectis you just asked him for more than he himself could confront if he had done it see thats the problem so it actually isnt problem of being polite or holding your finger right or smiling in certain way while youre asking the emeters or being pleasant to the pc or that is not the problem at all its just simply the problem of asking the guy for overts that he can confront on the gradient that he can confront them and you ask him for these things and youll find out that itll build up on nice smooth gradient and hell give you more and more and more overts and youll find out as long as youre doing that your communication line doesnt snap and your actual attitude has nothing to do with it and the communication line itself wont even quiver as long as you dont jump this thing but you instantly having given him some very easy ones to answer you all of sudden ask him something that he has been hiding from himself for very long time and you ask him for it suddenly quickly without any gradient whatsoever with approach and so forth communication line itself will snap too now youve really got job on your hands youve got whats known as an arc break and thats either session arc break or its something of that sort and you get ahold of it but youve restimulated some bypassed charge and however you get it off you get it off or you get somebody around that can do it to get it off now the point im making here i mean thats only for very lowerscale auditor he shouldnt be permitted to handle arc breaks because of course his gradient of training is such that he hasnt got the data of how you handle arc breaks so he starts handling arc breaks and all he does then is rearc break the pc so now he has two arc breaks where he only had one now he starts to handle these two dont you see and hes going to have four and then hes going to have eight and hes just heading for the long chute so he should find somebody who knows how to handle an arc break and get them to do the arc break assessment and then he can go on with it do you see its matter of gradients male voice yes this is where it goes now in training similarly you start pushing too much in on person too fast and too suddenly that they cannot confront or have anything to do with you also have jumpeda gradient on learning and they get very very confused the fastest way to jump gradient on learning is to for instance teach somebody to read foreign language which you havent taught them to read the alphabet of i think that would be marvelous way to jump gradient not let them define any of the letters that mean any of the words you havent taught them any abcs you see and just say well theres that squigglewop with curly tail and so forth now explain to what that word is explain to what the word is oh i cant pronounce it i dont know what word it is well you should know the word youve been studying arabic now for month hell miss very often miss and not see how the gradient is being shoved see hell not see how were jumping the gradient and he just arc breaks on it he thinks were being terribly unreasonable were actually not being unreasonable were just being out of gradient we didnt teach him the alphabet we donthe doesnt know how those words sound because he doesnt know how those symbols that represent the sounds are he doesnt know how theyre pronounced so therefore he cant add it up to the sound of word now if he could add it up to the sound of word he might possibly then remember having heard the word or knowing what letter comes first he could at least look it up in the englisharabic dictionary see he could do something about it if he had the alphabet but lets take some poor bloke and lets teach him german and never point out to him that the german language which looks very very similar to english in itsvery similar but it isnt the same and not point out to him that that particular type of use of letters and that sort of thing are different and let him get familiarity with these letters and how theyre formed and how theyre pronounced and then all of sudden start taking up hausfrau and this sort of thing with him then we wonder why he can never make any progress in german well youre never going to make any progress in german hes going tohe could go to school for years without making any progress in german then if nobody came along and pointed out the fact that he had never learned the german alphabet he would simply be telling you the rest of his life well i tried to understand german once but i wasnt good at it this is as close as he got to understanding what was wrong between him and german see i wasnt good at it well i dont know he can learn new word out here somebody drives up and says this is new spitzburgen type super snap you know drives it up new spitzburgen type super snap its got twelve roarers inside and he says roarers what the hell are those well thats new capping device that goes on the cylinder it presses the fuel down hard and it actually injects solid fuel and thats what they call roarers you know some crazy word like this roarers is that so and you find him next day using it like that but he tells you i couldnt understand german well what was german but whole bunch of roarers see see so there must be something peculiar going on here that he cant get on to ahe cant speak german and the only thing peculiar about it is is he never walked the gradient necessary to learn german he didnt walk that gradient and not having walked the gradient he then walkwerwounds up in the upper story with the conviction that he cant speak german he never analyses it so we have this person out here who is having an awful time in life and hes never walked gradient toward livingness see he went in over his head someplace and he never passed that point of the gradient man hes still there and when we pick up those points of the gradient he has bypassed and get him to understand them and so forth we call this clearing because at those points of the line he had wrong answers or he had omissions or something of the sort and when weve got those cleared up of course then he can live life because he has wound up on the gradient to the point where life can be handled and confronted very easy now that doesnt mean that you always have to approach things slowly you very often will find student in school and hell say oh this is arithmetic and youre gettingopening your mouth to say well you see thats 2 and thats 2 and when those two things are added together you get 4 and hes already been scanning the textbook while you were talking and so forth and he says yeah its also the square root now we mustnt become so dedicated to the gradient that we say youre not ready for that yet he just happened towhat throws us in education why we have very little good experience on the subject of education i mean we have very little purelyviewed data on the subject you seewe have in scientology now but i mean the world at largeis because they never recognized that people have been educated before people are up against all sorts of backpattern jams on the subject of education and also backpattern educational things for instance weve got carpenter out here now he was raising chickens and having an awful time one day he picked up tools and all of sudden found out that he couldhe could make most anything he laid his hand to and he could use all the tools and it was all very simple so he went on using tools and he has been carpenter ever since gradient of exactly nothing well the way life explains thispeople explain thisthey say he had talent for it he didnt have any talent for it they had staff auditor here one time old robin she was auditing him busily and so forth and my god they picked up more deaths as ships carpenter than you could shake stick at and they even found his last grave down here and few little things like this very unacceptable data to society at large because it restimulates them but nevertheless heres this fellowsthis fellows accidental talent you see and ship carpentry was based upon well probably ages and ages and ages of carpentry he had also must have been based on the fact that he had walked smooth gradient on the subject of carpentry he hadnt done many other subjects but carpentry he at one time or another whether in the roman republic or some place had learned carpentry right somebody had said now this isthis is hammer and you hold it and you bang it down and so forth and thats what that is for and this is well go back earlier piece of flint and this flint when rubbed over stick will cut shavings off of it now lets see if you can do that see they didnt come in to him and say all right now weve got new palace to be built out of sandalwood hereand youve just started in on this job and so forthweve got this new palace its all supposed to be carved and gilded and so forth and theres very careful joisting and fitting that goes into this place and i want to make sure youve got it right now finish it up tomorrow the usual gradient run in life there he would stand you see and that would have been the end of his carpentry but gradient started right is running right now youve noticed that if you start auditing pc with some little wins and the gradient is correct and so forth the pc goes on up the line and you keep that measured well you keep the pc winning little wins as he goes along and so forth you notice the pc just gets better and better and better and everything seems to run all right and you dont run into any trouble next pc he didnt get started right started by somebody else of course and he has just been running wrong ever since well if you straightened out his auditing its notthis is why you get education mixed up with auditing he thought something about session which wasnt right in other words he thought something was true of auditing which wasnt true or he had auditing added up in some way that had nothing to do with auditing and as elementary thing as that could prevent him from ever going into session considerations he has had about auditing almost an itsa process might straighten these things out wham and all of sudden put him right straight back in the groove of course hes had enough experience since to learn that what he thought earlier wasnt true but hes never reanalyzed what he thought earlier hed never collided with this so all of sudden you can turn pc from fast progressfrom slow progress pc to fast progress pc now what is the total thing youre using in any one of these cases youre just using gradients whether youre training somebody whether youre processing somebody on routine approach to auditing whether or not youre trying to remedy or straighten out ease fix up ease that wasnt running well whether you are trying to pull overts whether you are trying to get ptps and so forth theyre gradients its what can be done that will be real what can be accomplished what can be confronted what part of this fundamental situation do we have to know about in order to resolve the rest of the situation how do we take this problem apart so that it can be approached this is the wholethe whole think on the subject of gradients and if you havent got that pretty well taped sooner or later youre going to say oh my goodness i cant pull overts or something is wrong with my auditing in this particular quarter or that particular quarter and so forth and i think you almost inevitably find that it would boil down to failure on gradients either your own gradient of training was jumped too quick at some point or another or youre jumping this pc too quick or you had several pcs that youve made gradient mistakes on so you began to get new notion about what pcs are like whereas actually you just keep making the same gradient mistake see you try to pull overts before the pc is in communication with you you see if you kept making that pc after pc youd only audit four or five pcs to suddenly decide that you couldnt pull overts see youd have new false conclusions and those false conclusions come into being only because you had jumped gradient the early training somebody gets in scientology is doublytrebly important to what it ever was before but we havent actually done too badly in this we have made few mistakes here and there inevitably but i think we have done pretty well and mary sue was going overas far as gradients are concerned in this society at largemary sue was going over founding scientology reports and letters from people and so forth last night and she was quite astonished at the tremendous number of wins and so forth on the part of people who had only read textbook or who had only read this or read that they had approached the thing at the proper gradient those people who didnt approach it at proper gradient or werent steered on proper gradient into their studies didnt make it didnt have those successes you see and so forth and theyre longer with us so in the future all we have to do to swell up the ranks of scientology and so forth is just remember that in training auditing and the introduction of the work and so forth to hit it on proper gradient and weve got it made all the way thank you very much
