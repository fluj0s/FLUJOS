lobbyists supervise office staff speak on the floor conduct investigations interact with the news media and attend to various electoral duties including fundraising planning or campaigning for reelection given that precise definition exists for the role of member upon election to congress each new member is responsible for developing an approach to his or her job that serves wide range of roles and responsibilities one observer of congress notes that the first job of member is to come to grips with the dimensions of their role and develop personal approach to their tasks given the many challenges the overall conclusion is readily apparent the key to effectiveness in congress is the ability to organize well within framework of carefully selected priorities it is not possible however to construct grand master plan such that priorities and the time devoted to each will neatly mesh for legislative life is subject to sudden and numerous complications5 observers note that after identifying and organizing priorities member typically carries out some of the resulting duties personally and delegates others to congressional staff who act on his or her behalf the staff may work in the members individual office on committees to which the member is assigned in offices connected to leadership posts the member may hold and to the separate political and reelection operations the member may maintain in this understanding the member sets broad policies to fulfill his or her duties and the appropriate staff act to carry them out the distribution of responsibility will vary according to the preferences and priorities of the member at the center of the effort nevertheless the work carried out by staff is typically attributed to the effort of the member6 many scholars of congress see these member choices and delegation arrangements as dependent in part on their goals generally these observers suggest that members pursue three primary goals making good public policy securing influence within congress and gaining reelection the relative priority member may assign to these goals can affect wide range of choices regarding congressional career including 1 the emphasis given to different roles and duties 2 activities in the washington dc and district or state offices 3 staffing choices in member and committee offices and 4 preference for committee assignments it can also affect members approaches to legislative work constituent relations media relations party issues and electoral activities7 given the dynamics of the 5 gerald d sturges the

practices in the mid 1970s8 the house commission on administrative review surveyed members of the house and asked them to describe the major jobs duties and functions that they believed they were expected to perform at the same time the commission hired the research firm louis harris and associates to conduct survey of the public to gauge its expectations of congress and its members the member survey found that the three most frequently mentioned duties and activities were the drafting and introduction of legislation helping constituents solve problems and representing the interests of their districts and constituents other expectations included position taking and constituent education9 table 1 summarizes the responses received by role categories established by the commission according to the public survey conducted by the commission the most common expectations of members were to represent the people and district according to the wishes of the majority to solve problems in the district and to keep in contact with the people in the district through regular visits and meetings in the district and polls or questionnaires other public expectations included regular

and regular contact between the member and the district the differences between member and public expectations may reflect the different perspectives on the work of member of congress where members are daily confronted with representational legislative and institutional duties the public focus on representational legislative and service responsibilities apparently without recognizing broader underlying institutional procedural and operational framework in which members of congress operate some observers suggest that this 10 percentages are based on 146 responses by members of the house to

nov 1970 pp 648666 crs6 roles of members of congress the responses to the member and public surveys suggest that the roles and duties of member of congress can be identified in part as an outgrowth of congressional and public expectations these congressional roles may be described by focusing on some of the underlying tasks typically required to carry them out because some of the duties are complex and some of the underlying tasks often overlap some of the roles may overlap the roles described below are derived from congressional duties mentioned in the constitution responses to the house surveys of members and the general public and scholarly studies representation broadly system of representative government assumes that the will of the people is consulted and accommodated when making public policies that affect them consequently representational activity is present in all of the roles of member of congress representational activity is seen in the legislative process constituent service oversight and investigation duties that members carry out in congress members are elected to represent the interests of the people in their congressional district or state in addition they represent regional and national interests in matters which might come before congress on the local level members of the house represent congressional districts of populations ranging approximately from 500000 to 900000 constituents12 senators represent states that range in population from 509000 wyoming to more than 361 million california13 in the nations capital members serve as advocates for the views and needs of their constituents as well as stewards of national interests representational work may involve legislative activity such as analyzing the provisions of proposed legislation for their potential impact on the area represented or constituent service activity such as assisting individuals local governments and organizations in obtaining federal grants and benefits styles of representation differ some members might view themselves as responding to instructions from their constituents sometimes called the delegate style others might prefer to act upon their own initiative and rely upon their own judgment sometimes called the trustee style in practice when considering new 12 more information on apportioning seats in the house is available in crs report rs20768 house

existing law the opinion of their constituency often may be uppermost in members mind constituent views however may vary in intensity from issue to issue or fall on several sides of an issue and the member would typically take into account opinions from other sources as well consequently most members typically balance or reconcile these competing viewpoints with their own judgement when casting their votes providing constituent service or conducting oversight14 another facet of representation involves presenting view of government activity to constituents and the broader american public members of congress regularly draw attention to policy issues and federal government activities in order to educate constituents and other citizens and to encourage more robust citizen participation in public affairs this educational function is typically performed through newsletters and special mailings sent to residents in the district or state or through variety of media outlets which may include member website and appearances and interviews on local television and radio programs legislation in developing and debating legislative proposals members may take different approaches to learn how best to represent the interests of their district or state together with the interests of the nation this may require identifying local national and international issues or problems which need legislative action and proposing or supporting legislation which addresses them throughout the legislative process members of congress routinely attend committee hearings and briefings hold meetings and conversations with executive branch officials and with lobbyists representing various interested groups and have discussions with congressional colleagues in addition many members receive staff briefings based on broad range of sources including congressional support agencies local and national media outlets specialized policyoriented literature and background material on legislative issues among others an important venue for congressional activities is the committee through which much of the work of congress is organized committees typically are the first place in which legislative policy proposals receive substantive consideration members of congress are assigned to number of committees and subcommittees simultaneously and are expected to develop issue expertise in the policy areas that come before these panels typically each senator is assigned to three committees and at least eight subcommittees with the exception of members who serve on committees that their party has designated as exclusive each representative is typically assigned to two 14 see lee hamilton what i wish political scientists would teach about congress ps political science politics vol 33 december

witnesses and engage in markup sessions to draft amend and refine the text of legislation and to vote on whether to send specific measures to the floor of their chamber members also testify before other congressional committees on matters of interest to their district or state or on matters in which the member has developed expertise in addition to these duties senate committee membership involves review of executive and judicial nominations and may include consideration of treaties some members generally those with more seniority also participate in conference committees conference committees are convened to work out differences when the house and senate pass different versions of the same bill members of conference committees participate in the final resolution of policy disputes legislativeexecutive bargaining and significant policy decisions members generally participate in floor debate most fully when measures of importance to their home district or state are involved or when matters reported from their legislative committees are under consideration floor activity might include preparing statements conducting research to defend or deter provisions of bill and offering amendments it may also mean debating other members in an effort to persuade the undecided and engaging in extensive informal political negotiations to advance legislative goals15 constituency service the constituency service role is closely related to the representative and educational roles of member of congress frequently when constituents or local firms or organizations need assistance from the federal government they contact their representative or senators members then act as representatives ombudsmen or facilitators and sometimes as advocates in discussions with the federal government the constituency service role may be highly varied and involve several activities provided to individual constituents including outreach in which members introduce themselves and inform constituents of the services typically provided gathering information on federal programs 15 discussions of the debate and informal negotiating process in congress can be found in joseph bessette deliberation in american lawmaking philosophy and public policy vol 14 winterspring 1994 pp1823 for discussion of different types of deliberation and their use in the legislative process see

federal benefits or in solving constituents problems with agencies16 providing nominations to united states service academies17 and arranging visits or tours to the capitol or other washington dc venues assistance on behalf of firms and organizations may involve providing letters and other communication in support of grant or other applications for federal benefits the constituency service role also allows member the opportunity to see how government programs are working and what problems may need to be addressed through formal oversight or legislation18 oversight and investigation in addition to its legislative responsibilities congress is responsible for seeing that the laws are administered according to congressional intent while some members receive feedback on the success of public policies through constituency service and the experiences of constituents who seek casework assistance most of the oversight and investigation duties of members are carried out through committees committees and members can review the actions taken and regulations formulated by departments and agencies through hearings studies and informal communication with agencies and those affected by program or policy oversight and investigation can take several forms in addition to casework activity the process of authorizing and appropriating funds for executive branch departments and agencies in committee hearings also affords members and committees the opportunity to review the adequacy of those agencies organization operations and programs investigatory hearings are often conducted in response to an emerging crisis or scandal at various points in the oversight and investigative process of congress individual members can participate in the proceedings for example by questioning executive branch leaders or reporting the experiences constituents have had with particular programs or agencies19 16 see john r johannes casework in the house in cooper and mackenzie the

appointive federal office federal judicial nominations and to ratify treaties negotiated by the executive branch with foreign nations individual senators typically participate in hearings to determine the suitability of candidates nominated for executive office and the adequacy of the provisions of treaties20 senators are also expected to participate in the floor debate on these matters congressional leadership some members of congress hold leadership positions within their chamber leadership responsibilities include leading negotiations within the party to formulate party positions on legislative issues mediating political conflicts among members of the same party persuading members to join in voting coalitions keeping count as voting blocs form participating in decisions to set the legislative agenda for the chamber and negotiating agreements on when to schedule and how to consider specific bills on the floor representatives and senators may also hold the position of chairman or ranking minority member on committee or subcommittee and have responsibility or participate in the process of scheduling of that committees business and selecting the issues that will compose the committee or subcommittees agenda some representatives and senators also participate in leadership capacity in their respective party caucus or conferences leadership duties may be carried out both by members who hold formal leadership positions and those who do not issues on which individual members have recently taken informal leadership roles include campaign finance reform planning for the continuity of congress and lobbying and ethics reform personal office management members of congress are supported by personal office in which staff perform legislative research prepare materials for the member to study provide constituency service manage constituency correspondence handle media relations and perform administrative and clerical functions staff and office facilities are provided through funds appropriated annually and allocated to members according to the procedures of each chamber21 the precise duties and tasks carried out in member office will vary with the members personal preferences which are typically informed by seniority committee assignment policy focus district or state priorities institutional leadership and electoral considerations 20 in addition senators on the appropriate committees are sometimes asked to advise on the terms of treaty as it is being negotiated they do so by consulting with executive branch officials and by observing and sometimes participating in the treaty negotiations in progress between the us and foreign delegations 21 see crs report rl30064 congressional salaries and allowances by ida brudnick crs11 each member is allocated public funds to maintain office payroll and expense accounts and typically supervises work carried out in washington dc and state or district offices22 every representative is authorized to have up to 18 fulltime and four halftime positions to assist them in their duties in the senate the number of authorized staff varies according to the population of the state senator represents electoral and political activity an integral part of the work of members of congress their reelection plans is separate from their official congressional duties for those members of congress running for reelection activities may include organizing and maintaining personal campaign staff campaigning and raising funds for reelection or election to another office members may also be significant political leaders of their party as public spokespersons and as fund raisers for themselves and other congressional candidates at the state or district level they may also aid and influence the candidacies of state and local government officials in addition some members also hold leadership posts within their national political parties such as serving on their partys congressional campaign committee house and senate rules mandate that with very limited exceptions political and campaign activities must be conducted outside of federal facilities including congressional offices23 conclusion with formal or definitive requirements each member of congress is free to define his or her own job and set his or her own priorities although elements of each of the roles described can be found among the duties performed by any senator or representative the degree to which each is carried out differs among members as they pursue the common goals of seeking reelection building influence in congress and making good public policy each member may also emphasize different duties during different stages of his or her career as other conditions of the members situation change for example some may focus on outreach constituent service and other state or district activity others may focus on developing influence in their chamber by developing policy expertise or advancing specific legislation member however is likely to focus on any one role or duty at the exclusion of another because the extent to which member successfully manages all of those roles is the basis on which his or her constituents may judge the members success 22 see steven s smith the american congress pp102111 susan webb hammond the management of legislative offices in
