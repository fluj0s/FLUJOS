6201c10 shspec98 sec checks withholds the process 2010 is used to handle psychosomatic difficulties using class ii skills and sec checking 2010 is process where ten minutes of havingness is run for every twenty minutes of sec checking this is run for 75 to 200 hours before attacking routine 3dxx see hcob 11jan62 security checking twentyten theory there is danger in sec checking by ritual you should do it by fundamentals heres what happens because you dont quite grasp the fundamental someone stiffens up the ritual then it stiffens again and you become ritualist and can depart from effective auditing the thing to do is to get the job done auditing is what you can get away with with the pc because you cant get away with everything ritual gets set down circumscribing what you should try to get away with model session is good thing to use except with few pcs who would never get past the third question see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised7 you can imagine case that is so critically poised that you have to find out what the mind is doing in order to parallel it if you tried to do model session to find out you would be in culdesac because the case doesnt have that much attention concentrated for instance take madman who could still be handled with basic sec checking he is insane because he keyed in an insane valence by withholding its not this lifetime that aberrated anyone people say that you cant understand the mind because this lifetime doesnt explain why people are aberrated someone who is insane got that way by keying in implants that he gave to drive enemy troops insane to prevent them from coming back plus some similar overts which developed an insane valence insane people can go in and out of valences very easily it is the notknow they have run on other people that results in the withhold on themselves so what basic question could you ask this fellow which he could answer to start keying out the insanity you could ask what dont people know about you he would answer it it is so fundamental that he couldnt help answering it case could be so attentive to its difficulties that it is already in session to try to fly ruds would be to distract the pcs attention from his case with deranged person the dont know question works well it crosscuts the ow questions when case does not consider something an overt he will still answer up to notknow and will come up to recognizing his withholds you can use such questions as what dont i know about you what dont you know about your condition what dont others know about you your condition what you are doing auditing by fundamental would be to restore the pcs communication with society or the group with which he is connected you would expect person who is having hard time with the social structure he is in to have withholds from that social structure you see this in vignette all the time you missed withhold and the pc got upset with you its reversed comm line he has ptps because he has withholds from people withhold is withhold whether the pc considers them withholds or not for instance if the pc withholds losing his temper with people its laudable but it is still withhold if in finding withholds you dont look for such withholds or for simple withheld communications you will have devil of time keeping ruds in the pc is busy little beaver sitting there thinking and withholding critical thoughts etc withholds are not confined to crimes the magnitude of the crime does not establish the magnitude of the withhold it is the force with which he is withholding so anything the pc is withholding is withhold anything he is not communicating is withhold when you realize this you will get ruds in with clank and be able to assess just fine and sec checking will go fine sec checking will fail if you expect the magnitude of the withhold to give you the magnitude of the recovery it is the magnitude of the restraint of the withholding that does it the way to find what the case is withholding is to get what any part of the eight dynamics doesnt know about him the way you have gravity is by withholding self from space most of your sec checking will be on the third dynamic since it is the most complicated and there have been so many groups on the track but you might do well to look at the others too the second dynamic is of course loaded with mores to violate withhold is restraining self from communicating the corresponding overt is restraining another from communicating when someone is withholding some action he gets into the valence of someone who would do the action moral codes are patterns of behavior on all eight dynamics that means you are triggering those moments when the pc was not communicating perforce he should have been talking and he wasnt thats what it amounts to the ability of thetan in this universe is expressed along the lines of reach and withdraw in various directions when person should be reaching and is withdrawing that is withhold then there are overts of omission he should be reaching and he is not for instance there may be times when soldier should have attacked and he ran these are overts of omission if they are the reverse of nowimsupposedto it all amounts to failure to communicate with the environment or restrained communication with the environment which ends up as not being here in the environment which ends up with the environment pulled in on oneself you could ask what should you have communicated and get some marvellous results where should you have been gets off effort withholds withholding is worse than just not reaching very withholdy pc will stack up withholds on subject the tiniest impulses to withhold will remain as withholds if the pc has set of withholds on subject this pc will have loads of critical thoughts if you are not sec checking its valid to ask pc what are you withholding and if you dont get fall dont press it but dont think he is not withholding because he is you dont have missed withhold to contend with but the pc has at least some laudable withholds thats ok he can be in session but he still has withhold you only have to do something about it if he gets upset and goes out of session then you will have to find it ruds in merely means in condition to be audited you can always find the ruds out if it is your purpose to audit the case by rudiments when you sec check you try to restimulate the withholds so you can clean them up this has an opposite purpose from ruds the auditors mission in sec checking is to stir up things the pc doesnt feel ok about communicating so that the withholds can be gotten off because that is what aberration is made of so be suggestive knowing fundamentals use eg what doesnt _______ know about you what have you done that _______ wouldnt like and dont miss withholds the fourth dynamic is whole species not just mankind
