nations security interests the 2008 2009 election marks the first presidential tr ansition in the post911 era and is of concern to many national security observers while changes in administration during us involvement in national security related activities are not unique to the 2008 2009 election many observers suggest that the current security climate and recent acts of terrorism by individuals wishing to influence national elections and change foreign policies portend time of increased risk to the current presidential transition period whether the enemies of the unite d states choose to undertake action that may harm the nations security intere sts during the 20082009 election or the new president experiences rela tively peaceful period during the transition many foreign and domestic policy and secur ity challenges will await th new administration how the new president recognizes and responds to these challenges will depend heavily on the planning and learning that occurs prior to the inauguration actions can be taken by the outgoing president and presidentelect that may ameliorate decision making activities in the new ad ministration whether an in cident of

based on the severity of an incident and its proximity to the five phases of the transition period 2 the law of presidential transitions boston school of law working paper william p marshal and jack m beerman 2005 the outgoing president retains all the formal legal powers of the presidency yet his last electo ral success is four years removed and his political capital is at low ebb the outgoing president will want to protect his policies or accomplishments from being reversed or undermined and may also want to create obstacles to prevent his successor from too quickly achieving political and policy success the incoming president on the other hand will be focused on beginning her own initiatives and may desire to expeditiously reverse the polic ies of the previous president when the incoming and outgoing presidents are from opposing political parties the conflicts during the transition period may be even more acute 3 enemies that pose risk to the united states may emanate

options introduction presidential transition the period from campaigning through placement of new administration personnel is unique time in american politics and holds the promise of opportunity as well as real or perceived vulnerability1 to our nations security interests on given day the outgoing administration has the ability to change the policies of nation and possibly affect the international security environment yet the following day the president and the national security leadership team are replaced by new set of leaders who may have very different strategy and policy goals2 this political dynamic coupled with the inherent uncertainty accompanying presidential transfer of power may provide target of opportunity that may be too enticing to resist by those who wish to harm us security interests unlike other manmade incidents that may occur with little warning the presidential transition offers broadly defined time frame in which an enemy of the united states3 may decide to undertake an incident of national security significance4 with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34456crs2 3 continued groups or individuals that pledge allegiance or undertake action adverse to us interests 4 while an incident of national security significance could entail catastrophic natural disaster this term for purposes of this paper is used to describe foreign and domestic

transitioning the new administration into power shortly after the election of dwight eisenhower president truman invited him to meeting at the white house to discuss among other concerns national securityrelated issues prior to president trumans actions and the subsequent enactment of the pres idential transition act of 1963 presidential continuedaware that vulnerabilities exist but our enemies are as well9 as observed by frances townsend former homeland secu rity and counterterrorism advisor to president george w bush10 i worry about the period of vulnerability between the time we have nominees for each party through and just after the inauguration of new president i think thats particular period of vulnerability because of what we know about qaedas attempts to influence the elections in spain weve seen the attacks after gordon brown took over as prime nister in the uk we see in the 2004 election where they were issuing videos days before the united states election including bin laden talking about the st reets in the united states running with blood we know from their history that qaeda wants to influence elections and have political influence the executive branch is not alone in ttempting to ensure the country passes power from one administration to the ne xt in safe and thoughtful manner11 however the outgoing and incoming administrations are viewed as primarily responsible for addressing risks to the nation and taking actions to prevent and respond to any incident that may affect th electoral process whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action that may harm national security interests during this period of transition or the new president experiences relative peaceful period shortly after entering offi ce many national security issues will be awaiting the new administration how the newly elected presid ent recognizes and responds to these challenges will depen d heavily upon the planning and learning that takes

ical presidential transition processes and activities see crs report rl30736 presidential transitions by stephanie smithcongress have traditionally undertaken num erous activities to facilitate smooth transfer of executive branch power so of the actions often taken during presidential transitions include consulting with government and private sector experts who have presidential transition expertise providing information to the presidentelect after the election andprior to the inauguration offering operational briefings on ongoing national security matters to prospective presidential nominees and their staff preparing briefings books and polic memos detailing the issues of most concern to the current administration and expediting security clearances for presidentelect transition teammembers other activities that the current and incoming administrations and congress may wish to consider undertaking during th presidential transition period include undertaking public outreach efforts to discuss possible risks to the nation involving the national security representatives of presidential hopefuls in all transiti onrelated discussions establishing joint advisory council s responsible for addressing all transitionrelated risks requiring the director of nati onal intelligence dni to undertake efforts to support the nati ons awareness of risks reflecting the national security priorities of the new administration in the 2009 budget passing the fy2009 appropria tions without undue delay quickly assigning newly elected and existing members of congress to committees focused on national security holding hearings comprised of na tional security experts to gather ideas on prospective us national security policies and goals and holding hearings soon after the inauguration of the new president to determine the administrations na tional securityrelated priorities national security issues the next administration is likely to encounter the next administration

law of presidential transitions boston school of law working paper william p marshal and jack m beerman 2005 for numbe r of reasons there is now greater need than any time in our nations history for in coming and outgoing administrations to work cooperatively during transitions periods to begin with government is more complex and an incoming administration faces an inestimab learning curve in

the 2000 election 2001 continuedrisks confronting the nation the incomin g administration is likely to face three distinct types of national security challenges that could translate into short and long term national security risks for purposes of this report the national security challenges the next administration might face include the following current us military engagements iraq afghanistan and other military support or training activitie s related to the global war on terrorism and counterp roliferation efforts risks posed in countries and regions of concern iran north korea russia china republic of serbia venezuela cuba and the middle east and risks associated with contemporary issues the role of us foreign policy in international security matters the role of the military in

elected president to make well reasoned decisions on assuming office the presidential transition period many presidential historians argue th at during the early days of the new administration the knowledge and decisionma king activities will in part be based on information provided by the outgoing administration with the presidential transition period running from the formal announcement of candidates for the office of the presidency to long past the inauguration14 members of the current administration and potential incoming administration may wish to initiate substantive transition

opportunities may be pres ented to the incoming and outgoing administrations even under the be st of circumstances the sitting president and presidentelect may encounter unexpect ed issues that can lead to decision making perils however many observers argue that the national securityrelated collaborative efforts of the current administration and members of the potential new administration

homeland and internationally19 some national security observers are convinced that terrorist group will take action against united stares interests during the presidential transition period20 it is argued that enemies of the us may see the nation as physically and politically vulnerable and that disseminating threatening propaganda or undertaking an incident of national security significance during the election period would likely result in change in the election results or future policies statements or inci dents may be undertaken with the desire to demonstrate groups ability to

nagourney january 31 2005 senator john kerry said on sunday that the attacks of sept 11 were the central deciding thing in his contest with pres ident bush and that the release of an osama bin laden videotape the weekend before elec tion day had effectively erased any hope he had of victory 23 for example while the terrorist attacks of march 2004 did appear to have an affect on the election outcome and the spanish governments support of military actions in iraq the new prime minister actually increased spains co mmitment to counterterrorism military efforts in afghanistan it is speculated that while the tactical operation may have been success the longterm results of the attack were counter to the strategic desires of the terrorist group it may also be worth noting that an incident occurring during the transition period may have relatively shortterm minor effect on targeted country based in sound principle and engendering resilient societal behavior while the shortterm affects of an attack may change the outcome of an election or current policie s the attack may have little longterm impact on countrys societal mores and desire fo r customary transfer of national

action just prior to the presidential election date however such acts at anytime during the presidential transition period c ould have desired nd unintended effects on the presidential election and resulting policies23 conversely while many national security experts speculate that qaeda other extremist groups and some foreign powers may see the presidential transition period as desirable time to undertake action against us interests the mere fact that such activity occurs may not necessarily indicate that the act was committed with the desire to manipulate the results of the election the timing of such acts may be solely based on the convergence of an entity attaining sired capability with perceived best opportunity to successfully complete its objective post 911 national securityfocused organizations one factor complicating the 20082009 transition is the recent establishment of numerous new national security agencies with responsibilitie s for preventing future terrorist attacks or harms to us interests24 these organizations have not undergone presidential transition and may see many political appoint ees depart federal government service prior to the inauguration of the next presid ent also the organizations that existed during the last presidential transition and the new agencies may have employed many new personnel who are not wellversed in

current dhs secretary on matters related to homeland security the report did not focus on issu of possible concern to the incoming administrations nominee for secretary of th dhs and does not address

issue areas be addressed during the departments transition thr eat leadership congressional oversight policy operations succession and training56 while many national security observers found the report to be good effort at addressing tran sition related issues that require the focus of dhs others argue that the report fell short of meeting the needs of all facets of the transition period57 specifically some national security observers argued that the options put fo rth were to narrow in scope and found the report lacking in the following areas too much focus on outgoing administration efforts and too little attention given to the activities related to preparing the incoming administration for the challenges it will likely face too much emphasis on the administrative process of

senior administration officials also stated that after election day and prior to the inauguration the cu rrent administration plans to offer the incoming administrations nati onal security team the opport unity to attend exercises focused on understanding and testing na tional security c oordination capabilities61 while this idea may have merit some argue that in order for such an activity to be useful to the incoming administration ear ly participation by members of the prospective presidentelects national secu rity team should be included in initial discussions of designing the parameters of these exercises some national security observers are concerned about the sel ection of the issues that the current administration decides to use as the basis for the incoming administrations exercise activities some suggest that the exer cises should focus on catastrophic issues nuclear terrorism at home or abroad majo r natural disaster major offensive against deployed military forces or some other significant national security incident others opine that the most likely noncatastrophic scenarios should be used as basis of these exercises increased threat environment detonation of an improvised explosive device in the homeland or some less signifi cant incident regardless of the scenario it does not appear that the goals of the ex ercises are to convey sense of subject matter expertise on topic or design the perfect prevention or response plan for each possible incident that might affect united states interests rather the training appears to be focused on assisting the

presidentelect clinton addressed these concerns by stating president bush is to be viewed as the sole voice of united states policy and that the greatest mistake any adversary could make would be to

shifting from campaigning to governing and create problems for the congress120 should the new administration not make an effort to avail congress of its foreign and domestic security po licy

confirmation hearings soon after the president takes the oath of office as noted by recommendation of the 911 commission report of 2004123 since catastrophic attack could occur with little or notice the federal government should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments we 911 commission think the process could be improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as quicky as possible consistent with recommendations c ontained in the 911 commission report irpta of 2004124 provides sense of the cong ress regarding an expedited consideration of individuals nominated by th presidentelect to be confirmed by the senate the act further holds that the senate committees to which these nominations are referred and the full sena should attempt to comple consideration of these nominations within 30 days of submission by the newly elected president in undertaking this responsibility many secu rity observers see healthy tension between congress desire to act quickly to hold confirmation hearings and the need to ensure that individuals with the relevant national security background and experience have been put forth by the presidentelect in many cases highly qualified career senior executive service pe rsonnel will be in an acting capacity for some of these senate confirmed positions thus the perceived urgency to fill these positions quickly may be negated while congress ensures individuals capable of meeting the demands of the position are lected and confirme d congress may also work with the new administration to understand its national security priorities and where applicable have the changes in policies and programs reflected in the 2009 budget pass fy2009 appropriations without undue delay quickly assign new and exis ting members of congress to

national secur ityrelated challenges upon ta king office whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action counter to the nations security interests or the new president experiences relatively peaceful period during the transition the new administrations r ecognition and response to these challenges will depend heavily on the preparation and education activities that have

knowledge services group crs february 28 2008appendix b representative examples of incidents of national security interest occurring during periods of governmental transition126 appendix b provides representative listing of incidents of terrorism that have occurred during times of transitions of heads of state the criteria for inclusion in this chart was based on the aggressors real or perceived intent to change the course of an election or affect future policy of the country during time of transfer of presidential authority it should be noted th at barring relatively few examples there is little evidence that incidents of national security significance were planned for specific date prior to an election while vary ing levels of planning occur prior to an incident as with most criminal acts the leader directs or the individuals act when opportunity for the best possible outcome is presented with respect to times of presidential transition the most optimal time for an attack for variety of reasons may not present the best opportunity for th aggressors to attempt an incident as such the potential time frame for risk is present during any phase of the transition with the effects of an incident differing based on the location of the event the proximity to the election date and the r eaction and actions of the us national security enterprise many security experts believe that some of the incidences noted below had significant impact on the outcome of the countrys national ection or subsequent policies national security observers are fearful that terrorists groups may see some of the incidences as successes and feel embol den to attempt to affect future national transfers of power by launchi ng attack just before the election these groups may see the timing of such an action as viable st rategic opportunity to further the goals of their cause however it should be note d other security experts suggest that incidences of national significance taken
