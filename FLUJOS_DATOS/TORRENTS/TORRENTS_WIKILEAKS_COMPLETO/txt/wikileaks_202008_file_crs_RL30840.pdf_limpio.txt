established by statute in 1947 to create an inter departmental body to offer confidential advice to the president on all aspects of national security policy currently statutory members of the council are the president vice president the secretary of state and the secretary of defense but at the presidents request other senior officials participate in nsc deliberations the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence are statutor advisers in 2007 the secretary of energy was added to the nsc membership the president clearly holds final decisionmaking authority in the executive branch over the years however the nsc staff has emerged as major factor in the formulation and at times in the implementation of national security policy similarly the head of the nsc staff the national security adviser has played important and occasionally highly public roles in policymaking this report traces the evolution of the nsc from its creation to the present the organization and influence of the nsc have varied significantly from one administration to another from highly structured and formal system to looseknit teams of experts it is universally acknowledged that the nsc staff should be organized to meet the particular goals and work habits of an incumbent president the history of the nsc provides ample evidence of the advantages and disadvantages of different types of policymaking structures congress enacted the statute creating the nsc and has altered the character of its membership over the years congress annually appropriates funds for its activities but does not routinely receive testimony on substantive matters from the national security adviser or from nsc staff proposals to require senate confirmation of the security adviser have been discussed but not adopted the postcold war world has posed new challenges to nsc policymaking some argue that the nsc should be broadened to reflect an expanding role of economic environmental and demographic issues in national security policymaking the clinton administration created national economic council tasked with cooperating closely with the nsc on international economic matters in the wake of the 911 attacks the george w bush administration established homeland security council both of these entities overlap and coordinate with the nsc but some observers have advocated more seamless organizational arrangements this report will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30840g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561

security council nsc has been an integral part of us national security policymaking since 1947 of the various organizations in the executive office of the president that have been concerned with national security matters the nsc is the most important and the only one established by statute the nsc lies at the heart of the national security apparatus being the highest coordinative and advisory body within the government in this area aside from the presidents cabinet the cabinet has statutory role but the nsc does this study reviews the organizational history of the nsc and other related components of the executive office and their changing role in the national security policy process it is intended to provide information on the nscs development as well as subsequent usage this study is not intended to be comprehensive organizational history of all components of the national security policy process nor of the process itself as whole moreover the high sensitivity and security classification of the nscs work and organization limit available sources it is also important to keep in mind the distinction between the nscs statutory membership ie the president vice president secretary of state secretary of defens and secretary of energy and its staff ie the national security adviser and his assistants these two groups have very different roles and levels of influence

policymaking is based on careful analysis of the international situation including diplomatic economic intelligence military and morale factors based on comprehensive assessment effective government leaders attempt to attain their goals by selecting the most appropriate instrument of policy whether it is military diplomatic economic based on the intelligence services or combination of more than one although this approach has been an ideal throughout the history of international relations prior to world war ii us presidents focused primarily on domestic matters and lacked organizational support to integrate national security policies they relied instead on ad hoc arrangements and informal groups of advisers however in the early 1940s the complexities of global war and the need to work together with allies led to more structured processes of national security decisionmaking to ensure that the efforts of the state war and navy departments were focused on the same objectives there was an increasingly apparent need for an organizational entity to support the president in looking at the multiplicity of factors military and diplomatic that had to be faced during wartime and in the early postwar months when crucial decisions had to be made regarding the future of germany and japan and large number of other countries given continuing worldwide responsibilities in the postwar years that involved active diplomacy sizable military forces sophisticated intelligence agencies in addition to economic assistance in various forms the united states established organizational mechanisms to analyze the international environment identify priorities and recommend appropriate policy options four decades later the end of the cold war saw the emergence of new international concerns including transnational threats such as international terrorism and drug trafficking that have httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30840g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561

agencies concerned with national security policies g18g138g156g157g561g15g152g141g142g156g561g152g143g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g5g152g152g155g141g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561 coordinative mechanisms to implement policy are largely creations of the executive branch but they directly influence choices that congress may be called upon to support and fund congress thus takes interest in the processes by which policies and the roles of various participants are determined poor coordination of national security policy can result in calls for congress to take actions that have major costs both international and domestic without the likelihood of successful outcome effective coordination on the other hand can mean the achievement of policy goals with minimal losses of human lives while providing the opportunity to devote material resources to other needs throughout most of the history of the united states until the twentieth century policy coordination centered on the president who was virtually the sole means of such coordination the constitution designates the president as commanderinchief of the armed forces article ii section 2 and grants him broad powers in the areas of foreign affairs article ii section 2 powers that have expanded considerably in th twentieth century through usage given limited us foreign involvements for the first hundred or so years under the constitution the small size of the armed forces the relative geographic isolation of the nation and the absence of any proximate threat the president or his executive agents in the cabinet provided sufficient coordinative base however the advent of world war i which represented modern complex military effort involving broad domestic and international coordination forced new demands on the system that the president alone could not meet in 1916 the council of national defense was established by statute army appropriation act of 1916 it reflected proposals that went back to 1911 and consisted of the secretaries of war navy interior agriculture commerce and labor the statute also allowed the president to appoint an advisory commission of outside specialists to aid the council 1 the council of national defense was intended as an economic mobilization coordinating group as reflected by its membershipwhich excluded the secretary of state his inclusion would have given the council much wider coordinative scope furthermore the authorizing statute itself limited the role of th council basically to economic mobilization issues the council of national defense was disbanded in 1921 but it set precedent for coordinative efforts that would be needed in world war ii the president remained the sole national security coordinator until 1938 when the prewar crisis began to build in intensity presenting numerous and wideranging threats to the inadequately armed united states the state department in reaction to reports of axis activities in latin america proposed that interdepartmental conferences be held with war and navy department representatives in april 1938 secretary of state cordell hull in letter to president franklin roosevelt formally proposed the creation of standing committee made up of the second ranking officers of the three departments for purposes of liaison and coordination the president approved this idea and the standing liaison

the chief of staff of the army and the chief of naval operations the standing liaison committee was the first significant effort toward interdepartmental liaison and coordination although its work in the area was limited and uneven the liaison committee largely concentrated its efforts on latin american problems and it met irregularly althoug h it did foster some worthwhile studies during the crisis following the fall of france it was soon superseded by other coordinative modes it was more forum for exchanging information than new coordinative and directing body 2 an informal coordinating mechanism which complemented the standing liaison committee evolved during the weekly meetings established by secretary of war henry l stimson who took office in june 1940 stimson arranged for weekly luncheons with his navy counterpart frank knox and cordell hull but these meetings also did not fully meet the growing coordinative needs of the wartime government in may 1940 president roosevelt used the precedent of the 1916 statute and established the national defense advisory council ndac composed of private citizens with expertise in specific economic sectors 3 as with the earlier council of national defense ndac was organized to handle problems of economic mobilization and by the end of the year it had given way to another organization in succession of such groups during the war there were number of interdepartmental committees formed to handle various issues and while these did help achieve coordination they suffered from two problems first their very multiplicity was to some degree counterproductive to coordination and they still represented piecemeal approach to these issues second and more important these committees in many cases were not advising the president directly but were advising his advisers although their multiplicity and possible overlapping fit roosevelts preferred working methods they did not represent coordination at the top roosevelt ran the war largely through the joint chiefs of staff jcs who were then an ad hoc and facto group and through key advisers such as harry hopkins and james f byrnes and via his own pers onal link with british prime minister winston churchill the weekly meetings arranged by stimson evolved however into significant coordinative body by 1945 with the formal creation of the state war navy coordinating committee swncc swncc had its own secretariat and number of regional and topical subcommittees its members were assistant secretaries in each pertinent department the role of swncc members was to aid their superiors on politicomilitary matters and in coordinating the views of the three departments on matters in which all have common interest particularly those involving foreign policy and relations with foreign nations swncc was significant improvement in civilianmilitary liaison and meshed well with the jcs system it did not however concern itself with fundamental questions of

army navy air force coordinating committee after the national security act of 1947 it was dissolved in 1949 by which time it had been superseded by the nsc the creation of swncc virtually at the end of the war and its continued existence after the surrender of germany and japan reflected the gr owing awareness within the federal government that better means of coordination were necessary the world war ii system had largely reflected the preferred working methods of president roosevelt who relied on informal consultations with various advisers in addition to the jcs structure however the complex demands of global war and the postwar world rendered this system inadequate and it was generally recognized that return to the simple and limited prewar system would not be possible if the united states was to take on the responsibilities thrust upon it by the war and its aftermath g22g145g142g561g5g155g142g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g16g21g5g347g561

military including intelligence efforts as accomplished in the national security act of 1947 thus it is difficult to isolate the creation of the nsc from the larger reorganization especially as the nsc was much less controversial than the unification of the military and so attracted less attention g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 as early as 1943 general george c marshall army chief of staff had proposed that the prospect of unified military establishment be assessed congress first began to consider this idea in 1944 with the army showing interest while the navy was opposed at the request of the navy these investigations were put off until 1945 although by then it was clear to secretary of the navy james forrestal that president truman who had come to the white house upon the death of president roosevelt in april 1945 favored some sort of reorganization forrestal believed that outright opposition would not be satisfactory navy stance he also realized that the state department had to be included in any new national security apparatus therefore he had ferdinand eberstadt leading new york attorney and banker who had served in several highlevel executive branch positions investigate the problem 6 with respect to the formation of the nsc the most significant of the three questions posed by forrestal to eberstadt was 5 one of the best studies on the creation

to enable the military services and other governmental departments and agencies most effectively to provide for and protect our national security eberstadts response to this question covered the military establishment where he favored three separate departments and the continuation of the jcs as well as the civilian sphere where he suggested the formation of two new major bodies to coordinate all these civilian and military elements these two bodies he called the nati onal security council nsc composed of the president the secretaries of state and of the three military departments the jcs in attendance and the chairman of the other new body the national security resources board nsrb eberstadt also favored the creation of central intelligence agency cia under the nsc7 eberstadts recommendations clearly presaged the eventual national security apparatus with the exception of unified department of defense furthermore it was central point in forrestals plans for holding the proposed reorganization to navy desires bringing in the state department as he desired and hopefully obviating the need for some coalescence of the military services the nsc was also useful negotiating point for forrestal with the army as eberstadt had described one of its functions as being the building up of public support for clearcut consistent and effective foreign and military policies this would appeal to all the service factions as they thought back on the lean and insecure prewar years 8 warnavy negotiations over the shape of the reorganization continued throughout 1946

security act and so drew little attention in comparison with the basic concept of single military department around which most of the congressional debate centered the concept of regular and permanent organization for the coordination of national security policy was as widely accepted in congress as in the executive when the nsc was considered in debate the major issues were the mechanics of the new organization its membership assurances that it would be civilian organization and woul d not be dominated by the new secretary of the national military establishment and whether future positions

26 1947 the nsc appears in section 101 of title i coordination for national security and its purpose is stated as follows the function of the council shall be to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic foreign and military policies relating to the national security so as to enable the military services and the other departments and agencies of the government to cooperate more effectively in matters involving the national security b in addition to performing such other functions as the president may direct for the purpose of more effectively coordinating the policies and functions of the departments and agencies of the government relating to the national security it shall subject to the direction of the president be the duty of the council 1 to assess and appraise the objectives commitments and risks of the united states in relation to our actual and potential military power in the interest of national security for the purpose of making recommendations to the president in connection there with and 2 to consider policies on matters of common interest to the departments and agencies of the government concerned with the national security and to make recommendations to the president in connection therewith d the council shall from time to time make such recommendations and such other reports to the president as it deems appropriate or as the president may require11 the following officers were designated as members of the nsc the president the secretaries of state defense army navy and air force and the chairman of the national security resources board the president could also designate the following officers as members from time to time secretaries of other executive departments and the chairmen of the munitions board and the research and development board any further expansion required senate approval the nsc was provided with staff headed by civilian executive secretary appointed by the president the national security act also established the central intelligence agency under the nsc but the director of central intelligence dci was not designated as an nsc member the act also created national military establishment with three executive departments army navy and air force under secretary of defense implicit in the provisions of the national security act was an assumption that the nsc would have role in ensuring that the us industrial base would be capable of supporting national security strategies the chairman of the national security resources board set up by the same act to deal directly with industrial base and civilian mobilization issues was provided seat on the nsc over the years however these arrangements proved unsatisfactory and questions of defense mobilization and civil defense were transferred to other federal agencies and the membership of the nsc was limited to the president vice president the secretary of state and the secretary of defense 12 thus the need for coordinative

had evolved to one that engaged the more permanent themes of what had come to be known as national security policy the creation of the nsc was definite improvement over past coordinative methods and organization bringing together as it did the top diplomatic military and resource personnel with the president the addition of the cia subordinate to the nsc also provided the necessary intelligence and analyses for the council so that it could keep pace with events and trends the changeable nature of its organization and its designation as an advisory body to the president also meant that the nsc was malleable organization to be used as each president saw fit thus its use internal substructure and ultimate effect would be directly dependent on the style and wishes of the president

not attend regularly thereafter thus emphasizing the nscs advisory role in his place the president designated the secretary of state as chairman which also was in accord with the presidents view of the major role that the state department should play truman viewed the nsc as forum for studying and appraising problems and making recommendations but not one for setting policy or serving as centralized office to coordinate implementation the nsc met irregularly for the first 10 months in may 1948 meetings twice month were scheduled although some were canceled and special sessions were convened as needed the hoover commission the first review of nsc operations came in january 1949 with the report of the hoover commission the commissi on on organization of the executive branch of the government which found that the nsc was not fully meeting coordination needs especially in the area of comprehensive statements of current and longrange policies 13 the hoover commission recommended that better workinglevel liaison between the nsc and jcs be developed that the secretary of defense become an nsc member replacing the service secretaries and that various other steps be taken to clarify and tighten roles and liaison 1949 amendments in january 1949 president truman directed the secretary of the treasury to attend all nsc meetings in august 1949 amendments to the national

june 1950 brought greater reliance on the nsc system the president ordered weekly meetings and specified that all major national security recommendations be coordinated through the nsc and its staff truman began presiding regularly chairing 62 of the 71 meetings between june 1950 and january 1953 the nsc became to much larger extent the focus of national security decisionmaking still the nscs role remained limited truman continued to use alternate sources of information and advice 14 as one scholar has concluded throughout his administration trumans use of the nsc process remained entirely consistent with his views of its purpose and value the president and his secretary of state remained completely responsible for foreign policy once policy decisions were made the nsc was there to advise the president on matters requiring specific diplomatic military and intelligence coordination 15

new life to the nsc under his administration the nsc staff was institutionalized and expanded with clear lines of responsibility and authority and it came to closely resemble eberstadts original conception as the presidents principal arm for formulating and coordinating military international and internal security affairs meetings were held weekly and in addition to eisenhower himself and the other statutory member s participants often included the secretary of the treasury the budget director the chairman of the jcs and the director of central intelligence organizational changes in his

integrating arm of the nsc for all aspects of the implementation of national security policy by the end of the eisenhower administration the nsc membership had changed slightly the national security resources board had been abolished by reorganization plan 3 in june 1953 and this vacancy was then filled by the director of the office of civil and defense mobilization in 1956 president eisenhower partly in response to recommendations of the second hoover commission on the organization of the executive branch of government also established the board of consultants on foreign intelligence activities in the executive office this board was established by executive order 10656 and was tasked to provide the president with independent evaluations of the us foreign intelligence effort the board of consultants lapsed at the end of the eisenhower administration but similar body the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab was created by president kennedy after the bay of pigs

structure of the nsc under eisenhower allowed it to handle an increasing volume of matters its work included comprehensive assessments of the countrys basic national security strategy which were designed to serve as the basis for military planning and foreign policymaking the complexity of nsc procedures under eisenhower and its lengthy papers led to charges that quantity was achieved at the expense of quality and that the nsc was too large and inflexible in its operations critics alleged that it was unable to focus sufficiently on major issue areas 18 some observers also held that nsc recommendations were often compromises based on the broadest mutually acceptable grounds from all the agencies involved leading to noticeable lack of innovative national security ideas the eisenhower nsc did nonetheless establish national security policies that were accepted and implemented throughout the government and that laid the basis for sustained competition with the soviet union for several decades it may be that the nsc process became overly bureaucratic towards the end of the eisenhower administration perhaps affected by the presidents declining health hearings by the senate government operations committee in 196061 led by senator henry jackson produced proposals for substantial reorientation of this overinstitutionalized structure and its replacement by smaller less formal nsc that would offer the president clear choice of alternatives on limited number of major problems 19 some scholars have noted that eisenhower himself found the lengthy nsc procedures burdensome and argue that many key decisions were made in the oval office in the presence of 18 some eisenhowerera nsc documents are reprinted in the state departments foreign relations of the united

as one which produced consensus within the administration which would lead to effective policy implementation according to this view the process was largely one of education and clarification20 recent analysis has concluded that nsc meetings brought eisenhowers thinking into sharper focus by forcing him to weigh it against range of alternatives that were presented and defended by individuals whose opinions the president took seriously and whose exposure to requisite information and expertise he assured these individuals in turn were educated about the problems in the same way as eisenhower 21

accepted many of the recommendations of the jackson committee and proceeded to dismantle much of the nsc structure reducing it to its statutory base staff work was carried out mainly by the various departments and agencies and personal contacts and ad hoc task forces became the main vehicles for policy discussion and formul ation the nsc was now one among many sources of advice kennedys national security adviser mcgeorge bundy played an important policy role directly under the president the nature of this position wa s longer that of neutral keeper of the machinery for the first time the

but not in formal nsc sessions studies and coordination were assigned to specific cabinet officers or subordinates in system that placed great emphasis on individual responsibility initiative and action the secretary of state dean rusk was initially seen as the second most important national security official in the presidents plans and kennedy indicated that he did not want any other organizations interposed between him and rusk however kennedy came to be disappointed by the state departments inability or unwillingness to fill this role as the leading agency in national security policy 23 at the beginning of the kennedy administration the nsc was reportedly cut from seventyone to fortyeight and in place of weighty policy papers produced at regular intervals bundys staff would produce crisp and timely national security action memoranda nsams the new name signified the premium that would be placed on action over planning 24 with an emphasis on 20 see anna kasten nelson the

came into use the outstanding example of this was the executive committee excom formed in october 1962 during the cuban missile crisis which orchestrated the us response to soviet moves to introduce missiles in cuba organizational changes kennedy added the director of the office of emergency planning to the nsc replacing the director of the office of civil and defense mobilization it was planned that the new appointee would fill the role originally envisioned for the national security resources board in coordinating emergency management of resources the planning board and the operations control board were both abolished by executive order 10920 in order to avoid the eisenhower administrations distinction between planning and operations the nsc staff was reduced and outside policy experts were brought in bundy noted that they were all staff officers their job is to help the president not to persede or supplement any of the high officials who hold line responsibilities in the executive departments and agencies their task is that of all staff officers to extend the range and enlarge the direct effectiveness of the man they serve heavy responsibilities for operation for coordination and for diplomatic relations can be and are delegated to the department of state full use of all the powers of leadership can be and is expected in other departments and agencies there remains crushing burden of responsibility and of sheer work on the president himself there remains also the steady flow of questions of ideas of executive energy which strong president will give off like sparks if his cabinet officers are to be free to do their own work the presidents work must be doneto the extent that he cannot do its himselfby staff officers under his direct oversight but this is i repeat something entirely different from the interposition of such staff between the president and his cabinet officers 25 evaluation some critics attacked the informality of the system under kennedy arguing that it lacked form and direction as well as coordination and control and that it emphasized current developments at the expense of planning as noted kennedy himself was disappointed by the state department on which he had hoped to rely in retrospect kennedys system was designed to serve his approach to the presidency and depended upon the presidents active interest and continuous involvement some critics both at the time and subsequently have suggested that the informal methods that the kennedy administra tion adopted contributed to the bay of pigs debacle and the confusion

from number of sources other than the nsc and its member departments although he relied heavily on the secretaries of state and defense dean rusk and robert mcnamara the institutional system that evolved under johnson depended heavily on the ability of the state department to handle the planning and coordina tion process this system came about from study headed by general maxwell taylor in 1966 that led to national security action memorandum nsam 341 which concluded that it was necessary to enhance the state departments role in the policy process and to improve country team expertise in washington which was felt to be far below that in the various embassies nsam 341 led to new system of interagency committees the most important of these was the senior interdepartmental group sig whose members were the under secretar of state deputy cretary of defense administrator of the agency for international development dci jcs chairman director of the us information agency and the national security adviser in support of the sig were number of interdepartmental regional groups irgs each headed by the appropriate assistant secretary of state within the nsc itself structure and membership remained what they had been under kennedy with the office of emergency planning changing title to the office of emergency preparedness in 1968 although the title special assistant to the president for national security affairs was shortened to special assistant when walt w rostow replaced bundy in 1966 this reflected the frequent diversion of the occupant of this position away from nsc affairs to more general concerns evaluation johnsons nsc system barely existed as such the role of the nsc staff was more restricted and budget and personnel both declined key decisions those especially regarding the war in vietnam were made during tuesday lunches attended by the president the secretaries of state and defense and few other invited officials johnsons informal system was not wholly successful replacement for the highly structured system developed in the eisenhower administra tion the sigirg system fulfilled neither old functions nor the objectives set forth in nsam 341 although this new structure was dominated by the state department there was little enthusiasm for the system as whole on the part of the departments leadership the state department did not provide decisive leadership and settled for system of consensus opinions vagueness as to authority in the sigirg system reduced its effect on the bureaucracies moreover there was an insufficient allocation of resources for staff support for the new organization by 1969 the nsc existed largely in name johnson conferred constantly with wide number of advisers within and outside government while he respected institutional responsibilities his own decisionmaking was an intensely personal process g22g145g142g561g16g146g161g152g151g561g16g21g5g496g561g343g351g348g351g556g343g351g349g346g561 experience in the

the nsc staff powerful policy role organizational changes while adopting the basic form of the eisenhower nsc nixon streamlined its procedures26 the position of assistant for national security affairs was revived and henry kissinger harvard professor and occasional government adviser was named to fill it nsc meetings were limited to the statutory members with kissinger and the jcs chairman also sitting in and the dci attending for intelligence matters in january 1973 the office of emergency preparedness was abolished along with the nsc seat that originally had belonged to the chairman of the national security resources board six interdepartmental groups similar to johnsons irgs formed the nscs support network preparing basic studies and developing policy options however the influence of the state department was reduced and kissingers influe nce soon predominated four major new bodies were created washington special action group wasag headed by kissinger and designed to handle contingency planning and crises nsc intelligence committee chaired by kissinger and responsible for providing guidance for national intelligence needs and continuing evaluations of intelligence products defense program review committee chaired by kissinger and designed to achieve greater integration of defense and domestic considerations in the allocation of natural resources this committee was intended to allow the president through the nsc to gain greater control over the defense budget and its implications and policy requirements as result of opposition by defense secretary melvin laird its role was however significantly circumscribed senior policy review group chaired by kissinger this group directed and reviewed policy studies and also served as top level deliberative body this system had two principal objectives the retention of control at the top and the development of clear alternative choices for decisionmakers evaluation most of the criticism of the nixon nsc centered on the role played by kissinger his position in number of the key committees gave him control over virtually the entire nsc apparatus leading to charges that the system for all its efficiency now suffered from over centralization and later from domination by one man during nixons first term kissinger competed with the state department for control of foreign policy and soon overshadowed secretary of state william rogers critics felt that kissinger stifled dissent within the nsc and the rest of the national security apparatus kissingers venture into shuttle diplomacy and the unique circumstances of the watergate scandal further emphasized his key role kissingers accession to rogers position in september 1973 while retaining his national security council post brought renewed

precedent that some observers have criticized as undercutting the established responsibilities of the state department and as an attempt to orchestrate national security policy beyond the reach of congressional oversight kissingers predominance derived from his unique intellectual abilities skill at bureaucratic maneuvering and the support of president determined to act boldly in international affairs without being restrained by bureaucratic or congressional inhibitions it was achieved at time of profound political differences over foreign policy in which administration and congressional

the system per although kissinger was replaced as national security adviser by air force lt general brent scowcroft in november 1975 the national security policy process continued to be dominated by kissinger who retained his position as secretary of state an indication of the preeminence he had achieved as well as reflection of fords limited experience in the conduct of foreign policy prior to his sudden accession in june 1975 the commission on the organization of the government for the conduct of foreign policy also known as the murphy commission issued report on ways to more effectively formulate and implement foreign policy its recommendations dealt in part with the executive office of the president and the nsc structure 27 implicitly criticizing the expansive role of the nsc staff under kissinger the commission recommended that only the president should have line responsibility in the white house that staff officials should not themselves issue directives to departmental officials that in the future the national security adviser have other official responsibilities that the secretary of the treasury be made statutory member of the nsc and that the nscs scope be expanded to include major international economic policy issues and that senior officials concerned with domestic policy be invited to nsc meetings when issues with domestic implications were discussed the commission also considered general alternative structures and pointed out their basic advantages and disadvantages it also noted that policymaking is not branch of mechanics ho wever wisely designed or carefully utilized machinery is adequate to assure its results the selective use of various mechanisms and forums in ways which fit the particular issues positions and personalities involved is as much part of the presidents responsibility as is the necessity finally to decide the substantive issues 28 there were immediate steps taken to implement the reports recommendations 27

executive order 11905 reorganizing the intelligence community in response to ongoing investigations in that area this order among other things reaffirmed the nscs overall policy control over the foreign intelligence community some changes were made in the nsc substructure including the abolition of the nsc intelligence committee the socalled 40 committee of the nsc which was responsible for covert operations and certain sensitive foreign intelligence operations was replaced by the operations advisory group this executive order also created the intelligence oversight board in the executive office subseque ntly disbanded in 1993 it was composed of three civilians and was tasked with reviewing the propriety and legality of the intelligence agencies operations in december 1975 ford vetoed bill that would have made the secretary of the treasury statutory member of the nsc saying that the treasury secretary is invited to participate in nsc affairs having significant economic and monetary implications but that there is need to involve him in all nsc activities 29 evaluation these changes did not detract from the central role that the nsc had achieved under president nixon kissingers loss of his dual position did not seem to lessen his influence over the policy process leading critics to charge that this change was largely cosmetic the new national security adviser brent scowcroft had previously served as kissingers deputy on the nsc staff and was unlikely to challenge kissingers preeminence the ford nsc reflected the close relationship between the president and the secretary of state relationship that itself became source of controversy both in the republican primaries of 1976 as well as the ensuing general election critics continued to maintain that the

there were fewer prc meetings evaluation rumored rivalry between brzezinski and secretary of state cyrus vance was not publicly evident during the first year of the carter administration but reports of differences between the two men later increased dramatically as senior administration officials advised different responses to such questions as soviet and cuban activities in africa and the iranian hostage question towards the end of the administration differences between vance and brzezinski became pronounced and were widely perceived as contributing to weak and vacillating policies carters director of central intelligence stansfield turner later wrote national security advisers and secretaries of state and defense had clashed before notably under president nixon when henry kissinger was the adviser but because nixon tended to follow kissingers advice more often than not there was stalemate and foreign policy moved ahead in innovative ways however jimmy carter vacillated between brzezinski and vance and they often canceled each other out 38 vance who had strongly opposed the illfated effort to rescue the us hostages in iran finally resigned and was succeeded by senator edmund muskie in april 1980 brzezinskis outspokenness and his public role in policymaking became an issue and led to calls for senate confirmation of nsc advisers and closer congressional oversight of the nsc staff39 there were also reports of infighting between carter loyali sts on the nsc staff and those who had worked for vice president walter mondale who had been given major policy

role of the nsc system in the wake of the irancontra revelations pointedly noted president must at the outset provide guidelines to the members of the national security council his national security adviser and the national security council staff these guidelines to be effective must include how they will relate to one another what procedures will be followed what the president expects of them if his advisors are not performing as he likes only the president can intervene 43 the reagan administration had total of six national security advisers their history is poignant the first richard allen did not have direct access to the president but reported to him through presidential counselor edwin meese allens tenure was brief after accusations of influence peddling he was replaced in january 1982 by judge william clark longtime reagan associate who had served since the beginning of th administration as deputy secretary of state clark in turn resigned in october 1983 to be come secretary of the interior and his deputy robert mcfarlane became national security adviser mcfarlane was replaced in january 1986 by his deputy vice admiral john poindexter and subsequently pleaded guilty to withholding information from congress poindexter himself wa s relieved in the context of the irancontra scandal in november 1986 and eventually went on trial for obstructing justice an effort was made to restore nsc effectiveness under former ambassador frank carlucci who succeeded poindexter in december 1986 when carlucci was appointed secretary of defense he was replaced by army general colin powell in november 1987 evaluation until the arrival of carlucci the reagan nsc structure lacked strong politically attuned national security adviser that had characterized administrations since 1961 it also lacked the administrative structure that existed under eisenhower nixon ford and carter the absence of either influential nsc advisers or effective administrative machinery has been seen by many critics as major factor contributing to the irancontra misadventures allowing nsc committees to be chaired by cabinet officials tended to reduce the possibility that all sides of given issue would be laid before the full nsc or the president the tower board noted most presidents have set up interagency committees at both staff and policy level to surface issues develop options and clarify choices there has typically been struggle for the chairmanship of these groups between the national security adviser and the nsc staff on the one hand and the cabinet secretaries and department officials on the other our review of the operation of the present system and that of other administrations where committee chairmen came from the departments has led us to the conclusion that the system generally operates better when the committees are chaired by the individual with the greatest stake in making the nsc system work 42 public papers of the presidents ronald reagan 1981

seniorlevel committees of the nsc system44 the reagan administration in its efforts to av oid the dominant influence wielded by previous nsc advisers fell victim to perpetual bureaucratic intrigues the efforts of politically weak nsc advisers especially mcfarlane and poindexter to undertake white house initiatives covertly over the strong opposition of senior cabinet officials and congressional leaders called into question the basic competence of the administration another aspect of the reagan nsc that came under heavy criticism was the involvement of nsc staff in covert actions although nsc staff efforts to manage certain crises such as the capture of the achille lauro hijackers were successful the participation of nsc personnel especially lt col oliver north in operations run apart from the traditional intelligence apparatus including efforts to gain the release of american hostages and to supply nicaraguan insurgents has been widely censured such efforts have been criticized as undercutting the agencies with responsibilities for such operations and which are accountable to congressional oversight committees secondly failing to take full advantage of the professional expertise available to the intelligence community and potentially involving the country in misguided ventures the irancontra committee recommended that the members and staff of the nsc not engage in covert actions 45 reagans final two nsc advisers carlucci and powell brought period of greater stability to nsc operations and both eschewed participation in covert actions after poindexters departure carlucci created senior review group that he himself chaired and that was composed of statutory nsc members besides the president and vice president he also established policy review group that was chaired by his deputy and composed of secondranking officials of nsc agencies president reagans own role in the details of national security policymaking remains unclear his policies on ussoviet relations support for an aggressive struggle against international communism and the need for strong military forces including strategic defenses were well known such positions provided the overall goals for administration officials it is generally acknowledged however that unlike some of his predecessors president reagan did not himself engage in detailed monitoring of policy implementation some maintain that his nsc structure and the absence of strong nsc advisers led directly to bureaucratic gridlock and illadvised involvement of the nsc staff in covert actions others have concluded that the experience of the reagan administration demonstrates that strong and efficient national security adviser and staff has become essential to national security policymaking especially if the president himself does not provide detailed direction the absence of such an adviser it is argued will undermine the development and implementation of effective national security policies some subsequent historians however give reagan higher marks for overall national security policy even if his nsc staff was often in flux 44 ibid p v5 45 us congress senate select committee on secret

scowcroft as national security adviser his tenure was marked by the absence of public confrontations with cabinet officers and close working relationship with the president national security directive 1 nsd1 established three nsc subgroups the nsc principals committee was composed of the secretaries of state and defense the dci the chairman of the jcs the chief of staff to the president and the national security adviser who was the chairman the nsc deputies committee chaired by the deputy national security adviser was composed of secondranking officials there were also number of nsc policy coordinating committees chaired by senior officials of the departments most directly concerned with nsc staff members serving as executive secretaries the bush nsc structure most closely resembled th at of the nixon and ford administrations in providing for national security adviser chairing most of the key committees the key differences lay in the personalities involved and the fact that political divisions over foreign policy while important lacked some of the emotional heat caused by controversies over vietnam and nicaragua secretary of state james baker was powerful figure in the administration and longtime political associate of the president similarly secretary of defense dick cheney himself had white house experience as chief of staff in the ford administration and served in leadership post in the house of representati ves on occasion however bush did formulate policy within narrow circle of white house aides 46 evaluation whether because of the personalities of nsc principals the structure of nsc committees or the determination among political opponents to concentrate on the domestic economy the bush nsc did not come in for the heavy criticisms that were levied against most of its predecessors most observers would probably judge that the bush administration created reasonably effective policymaking machinery and avoided the mistakes of some of its predecessors arguably standard nsc organization had been created the administration successfully addressed most issues that resulted from the breakup of the soviet union and the unification of germany

continued in office until he resigned in march 1997 lakes deputy samuel r berger succeeded him remaining until the end of the clinton administration with the end of the cold war it was widely

and security issues the nec initially headed by robert rubin who would s ubsequently become treasury secretary in 1995 was charged with coordinating closely with the nsc to facilitate coordination some nec staff were doublehatted as nsc officials the close relationship has been credited with enhancing policy coordination at senior white house levels although according to some observers the original promise was not realized as many aspects of international economic and trade policies became parts of major political disputes such as the north american free trade agreement and mostfavorednation status for china 47 some observers would have preferred to include stronger international economic component within the nsc itself but others have raised strong objections to such an approach on the grounds that national security policymaking in significant measure the province of diplomats and military officers is not as closely related to domestic political concerns as international economic policy proponents of the latter view argue that economic issues inevitably involve concerns of various domestic groups and the nsc is illsuited to integrate them into its policymaking processes presidential decision directive pdd 2 organiza tion of the national security council issued on january 20 1993 expanded the nsc to include in addition to statutory members and advisers the secretary of the treasury the us representative to the united nations the assistant to the president for economic policy and the chief of staff to the president the attorney general

strong nsc staff lake in his writings on national security policymaking prior to becoming national security adviser reflected keen appreciation of the disadvantages of bureaucratic infighting he

an important and influential role in shaping policy regarding kosovo carefully attuned to shifts in us public opinion berger who succeeded lake as national security adviser in march 1997 reportedly focused on the political dimension of policymaking and sought to avoid options that might lead to paralyzing debate in this country or other nato states he is reported to have helped the administration steer middle course between those who recommended ground campaign against serbia and those more ready to compromise with the ugoslav leadership and as result the administration maintained strong sense of unity throughout the kosovo campaign one press account suggested that what may be bergers distinctive accomplishment is to have put himself so preeminently at the center of decisionmaking while minimizing the historic antagonisms between national security advisers and secretaries of state and defense 49

undertaking review of us options in iraq in late 2006 that resulted in the changes in tactics and force levels that have come to be known as the surge although senior officials in dod and the state department were known to be skeptical of increasing troop levels nsc staffers are reported to have argued that increased numbers of us forces could provide the security to the iraqi population that would encourage political stabilization according to these reports in the end president bush adopted this approach 50 evaluation although there is little official documentation of the work of nsc

kissinger and brzezinski the position of national security adviser has emerged as central one brzezinski was even accorded cabinet statusthe only national security adviser to be thus designated 51 some observers over the years have argued that the position should be subject to senate confirmation and that the national security adviser should be available to testify before congressional committees as are officials from other government departments and agencies52 others argue that president is entitled to confidential advice from his immediate staff they further suggest that making the position subject to confirmation would create confusion in the eyes of foreign observers as to which us officials speak authoritatively on national security policy this latter argument is arguably undercut however by the practice of recent national security advisers of appearing on television news programs national security advisers have come from various professions not all have had extensive experience in foreign and defense policy the report of the committees investigating the iran affair recommended that the national security adviser not be an active military officer 53 although rationale was given for this recommendation substantial number of nsc staff members over the years have been career military or civil servants with backgrounds in foreign policy and defense issues considerable number have been detailed to the nsc staff from various federal agencies which continue to pay their salaries this practice has been occasionally criticized as allowing the expansion of

argues that the nsc staff should be made up of as many career officials as possible with as much carryover between administrations as can be managed its expert s should be good but not necessarily gray bureaucrats who know how to get things done and how to fight for their views and who are serving the national interest more than the political interests of their president he cautioned that political appointee whose main credential is wo rk on national security issues in political campaigns will have learned to think about national security issues in partisan context the effect of his or

represented on the nsc the nsc as corporate entity rarely testifies before or briefs congress on substantive questions although in some administrations informal briefings have been provided the nsc is an organ devoted to the workings of the executive branch in the broad area of national security its role is basically that of policy analysis and coordination and as such it has been subject to limited oversight and legislative control by congress both in its staff organization and functioning the nsc is extremely responsive to the preferences and working methods of each president and

although some observers believe that the general pattern established in the final years of the r eagan administration and followed by successive presidents is likely to endure there is unlikely to be

appointed chairman of the jcs argued that national policy council should replace the nsc and concern itself with broad areas of international and domestic policy56 william hyland an nsc official in the reagan administration argued in 1980 that bad defect in the nsc system is that it does not have any way of addressing international economic problems the big economic agencies are treasury to some extent omb the council of economic advisers commerce labor and agriculture they are not in the nsc system but obviously energy problems trade and arms sales are foreign policy issues every administration tries to drag them in usually by means of some kind of subcommittee or separate committee the committee eventually runs up against some other committee there is friction and policies are ma on very ad hoc basis by the principal cabinet officers 57 in early 1992 professor ernest may of harvard university testified to the senate select committee on intelligence in the early 1980s the greatest foreign threat was default by mexico and brazil that could have brought down the american banking system despite good cia analysis and energetic efforts by some nsc staffers the question did not get on the nsc agenda for more than two years and then the policy issues did not get discussed the agencies concerned with money and banking had natural connection with either the nsc or the intelligence community we have reason to suppose that agencies concerned with the new post cold war policy issues will be any more receptive 58 in the george hw bush administration there remained strong conviction that defense and foreign policy issues would remain vital and somewhat separate from other interests and that the nsc was the proper forum for them to be addressed before he became president bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft stated at forum on national security policy organization first of all if there is consensus that the nsc net ought to be spread ever wider i am not part of it there are many things that the nsc system can do better and it has enough on its plate now i would not look toward its spreading its net wider 59 as noted above the clinton administration implemented its determination to coordinate foreign and domestic economic policies more closely the national economic council established by executive order 12835 on january 25 1993 was designed to coordinate the economic policy making process with respect to domestic and international economic issues close linkage with the nsc were to be achieved by having the assist ant to the president for economic policy also sit on the nsc supplemented by assigning staff to support both councils the goal was to ensure that the economic dimensions of national security policy would be properly weighed in the white house decisionmaking process observers consider that cooperation between the nsc and the nec was productive and contributed to the enhancement of both national security

postcold war era has seen much closer relationship between traditional national security concerns with international issues that have significant law enforcement component such as terrorism and narcotics smuggling61 the increasing intermingling of national security and law enforcement issues could cause major difficulties for the nsc staff and the national security adviser who is not law enforcement official the justice department will inevitably view with concern any incursion into what is regarded as the attorney generals constitutional responsibilities the nsc also coordinates with the office of drug control policy whose responsibilities also encompass both law enforcement and foreign policy considerations in dealing with international terrorism or narcotics production and transport from foreign countries however diplomatic and national securi ty issues are often involved apprehending terrorist group may require cooperation from foreign government that has its own interests and concerns narcotics production may be entwined in the social and economic fabric of foreign country to an extent that precludes the country from providing the sort of cooperation that would be expected from major ally during the clinton administration the attorney generals representatives have been included in nsc staff deliberations when law enforcement concerns were involved nonetheless observers note public disagreements between justice department and state department for instance regarding cooperation or the lack thereof from saudi arabia or yemen clearly the president has constitutional responsibilities for both national security and law enforcement but the status of any other official to make necessary tradeoffs is unclear observers suggest that in some future cases the need to establish single us position may require different ways of integrating national security and law enforcement concerns todays international terrorist threat can encompass not only physical attacks on us physical structures such as the world trade center but also cyberattacks on critical infrastructures the computerized communications and data storag systems on which us society has become reliant since such systems are in most cases owned and operated by corporations and other commercial entities the role of the nsc is necessarily constrained much depends on law enforcement as well as voluntary cooperation by the private sector the clinton administration created the position of national coordinator for security infrastructure protection and counterterrorism who reported to the presid ent through the national security adviser 62 the intelligence reform act of 2004 however established the national counterterrorism center outside the nsc structure in dealing with policies related to the protection of critical infrastructures the national security adviser will have an important role but one inherently different from the traditional responsibilities of the office 63 the position could involve in coordination of responses to threats 60 james steinberg foreign policy time to regroup washington post january 2 2001 p a15 61 see crs report rl30252

government the states and the private sector it is clear to all observers that such coordination involves much uncharted territory including special concern that the national security adviser might

its membership has been designated and can be changed by statute the nsc has also been subject to statutorily approved reorganization processes within the executive branch as when it was placed in the executive office by reorganization plan in august 1949 nonetheless the nsc has been consiste ntly regarded as presidential entity with which congress is rarely involved the internal organization and roles of the nsc have been changed by presidents and by national security advisers in response to their preferences and these changes have not usually been subject to congressional scrutiny the role of the national security adviser has however become so well established in recent years that congress has been increasingly prepared to grant the incumbent significant statutory responsibilities the foreign intelligence surveillance act and other legislation provides for statutory roles for the national security adviser 64 executive orders provide other formal responsibilities the position has become institutionalized and the exercise of its functions has remained an integral part of the conduct of national security policy in all recent administrations some observers believe that these established duties which extend beyond the offering of advice and counsel to the president will inevitably lead to determination to include the appointment of national security adviser among those requiring the advice and consent of the senate advice and consent by the senate is seen as providing role for the legislative branch in the appointment of one of the most important officials in the federal government another cited advantage of this proposal would be the increased order regularity and formalization that are involved in making appointments that are sent to the senate proponents argue that this would ultimately provide greater accountability for nsc influence and decisions opponents on the other hand might point to the danger of unnecessary rigidity and stratification of organization and the potential that continued nsc the need for national mobilization to sustain global war effort is not considered high priority in the postcold war world see carnes lord nsc reform in the postcold war era orbis summer 2000 pp 449500 the inclusion of such officials did nonetheless reflect the determ ination of the drafters of the national security act that the nsc have wide mandate in protecting the nations security interests and one that could extend into the private sector 64 the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 as amended requires that applications for orders for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes include certifi cation regarding the need fo r such surveillance by the assistant to the president for national security affairs or someone else designated by the president50 usc 1804 a7 similar requirement exists for applications for physical searches 50 usc 1823a7 the assistant to the president for national security affairs is

considerations there is also potential that the nsc staff might become irrelevant if it loses the trust of future president or if its procedures become so formalized as to stulti fy policymaking should the adviser be subject to senate confirmation it is argued that an important prerogative of the president to choose his immediate staff would be compromised in addition the incumbent could be required or expected to make routine appearances before congressional oversight committees arguably undermining the primary purpose of the national security adviser which is to provide the president with candid advice on wide range of issues often on an informal and confidential basis one historian has summed up the role of the national security adviser the entire national security system must have confidence that the national security adviser will present alternate views fairly and will not take advantage of propinquity in the coordination of papers and positions he must be able to present bad news to the president and to sniff out and squelch misbehavior before it becomes problem he must be scrupulously honest in presenting presidential decisions and in monitoring the implementation process perhaps most important he must impart the same sense of ethical behavior to the staff he leads 65 the increasing difficulties in separating national security issues from some law enforcement and international economic concerns has led some observers to urge that the lines separating various international staffs at the white house be erased and that more comprehensive policymaking entity be created it is argued that such reforms could most effectively be accomplished without legislation 66 the project for national security reform pnsr nonpartisan task force that has studied the structure of national policymaking has made number of farreaching proposals for expanding the role of national security director and combining the national security council and the homeland security council67 such proposals raise complex questions including the role of congressional oversight whereas congress has traditionally deferred to white house leadership in national security matters to fa r greater extent than in international economic affairs there might be serious questions about taking formal steps to place resolution of wide range of international policies including economic and law enforcement issues in the hands of officials who receive little congressional oversight congress had little if any role in the evolution of the nsc staff and the emergence of the national security adviser as key figure in national security policymaking however in recent years congress has given increasing recognition to the adviser in statutes thus far however congress has not perceived the need for an effort to subject the nsc staff to routine oversight or to require that the national security adviser be appointed by and with the consent of the senate this approach might however change if the responsibilities of the nsc staff change significantly in the past congressional observers became most interested in requiring confirmation of national security advisers when holders of the position were identified as principal policymakers of an administration proposals such as those of the project on national security reform that have been made to enhanc the role of the national security adviser will probably include consideration of new options for congressional oversight of the national security staff it is likely in any event that congress will continue to monitor the
