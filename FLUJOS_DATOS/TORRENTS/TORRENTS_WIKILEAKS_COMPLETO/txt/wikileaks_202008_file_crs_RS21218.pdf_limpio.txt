appropriate investme nt given the armys ongoing transformation to lighter more mobile force1 the crusader program is still in research and development and was scheduled to undergo milestone b evaluation in ap ril 2003 which would ve decided whether the program would move into the system development and demons tration rd phase prototype howitzer was delivered in early 2000 and has demonstrated the crusaders firing capabilities the plan has been to begin equipping units in fy2008 approximately 2 billion has been spent on th crusader through fy2002 with the total program estimated to cost at least 11 billion this reflects 1999 reduction in the procurement objective from 1138 to 480 vehicl the fy2003 crusader budget request as originally submitted was 475 million the crusader has been frequently mentioned over the last few years as program that could be cut or terminated because it did not fit by some analysts definitions the armys transformation goals and its termination could free up funds for more technologically advanced systems its supporters however have maintained that redesigned lighter crusader could play vital role in both expeditionary and traditional heavy units the controversy inte nsified on may 3rd when undersecretary of defense for acquisition pete aldridge directed the army to prepare an assessment of alternatives to the crusader by june 10 2002 on may 8th however it was announced that secretary rumsfeld with the concurrence of presid ent bush was recommending an amendment to the fy2003 dod budget request terminating th crusader program deputy secretary paul wolfowitz explained that the decision to terminate the crusader without the review of alternatives was determined by the c ongressional schedule for consideration of the dod fy2003 authorization legislation2 press reports indicate that within the department of the army there was consider able opposition to the crusaders cancellation which led to controversy over whether in appropriate steps we re taken to provide congressional supporters with talking points in favor of the program after secretary rumsfeld had made his decision3 the crusader

canceli ng the crusad er program in seeking to cancel the crusader progra m dod officials maintain that it is system originally designed for different st rategic context ie high intensity warfare against soviet forces in europe than currently exists they also assert that it is important wherever possible to invest in tr uly transformational rather than legacytype systems while acknowledging that the re quirement for longrange allweather fire support remains crusader opponents suggest that there are alternatives more in keeping with the armys transformation to more m obile and deployable force and that these could be available in pproximately the same timefra as the crusader on may 13 under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics pete aldridge banned the ar my from spending more mone on crusader and ordered separate review of which cr usader technologies the army wishes to carry forward into the future combat system fcs program due by june 30 200210 deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz has suggested that funds allocated to the crusader in the fy20042009 defense planning guidance could be applied to variety of new longrange fire support technology programs including excaliber guided artillery munition raytheon guided multiple launch rocket system lockheedmartin high mobility artillery rocket system lockheedmartin nonlineofsight future combat system boeingsaic the weight and timing of the crusader are seen as key disadvantages its weight about 40 tons is twice the target weight of all other transforma tional weapons systems planned for the army it is designed to fight with the 70ton abrams tank which will be phased out within 30 years the general ccounting office has noted that the crusader will first be deployed in 2008 and this is th same year that the army plans to begin deployment of the fcs which would eventually replace the crusader11 in his sasc testimony secretary rumsfeld emphasized that crusader was not designed to deliver precision fires and he favored transfor mational investments in precision fires finally cancellation of the crusader is the kind of bold step forward that president bush proposed during his election campaign w ith the concept of skipping generation in weapons deployments to illustrate the importance attached to this principle the office of management and budget stated that the presidents senior

roosevelt op citrecommend that he veto any bill which included statutory restrictions limiting his ability to cancel this program12 arguments for continuing the crusader program many artillerymen believe that the howitzer will continue to occupy an important niche on the future battlefield13 us infantrymen fighting recently in the afghan mountains during operation anaconda had onl manpacked mortars for fire support when combat aircraft were not availabl the excaliber round touted by the administration would still require 155 mm howitz er to fire it and according to crusader supporters the advanced computers and battlefield networking capabilities of the crusader would use excaliber to better dvantage than any other howitzers proposed supporters of the crusader emphasize that it has performed well in its livefiring tests is on schedule and belie ve that with the weight reduc tion efforts the contractor has undertaken has improved its ployability the program mana ger col russell hrdy has also noted that with the crusaders increased rate of fire deployin g 3 units would be the equivalent of deploying 6 m109a56 paladins the armys current selfpropelled 155mm artillery system in other words the 40 tons and 3man crew of one crusader would require less lift than the equiva lent 60 tons and 8 crewmen of two paladins in regards to substituting the two advanced multiple launch rocket systems gmlrs and himars it should be noted that one mlrs rocket weighs about 650 pounds compared to about 100 pounds for one 155 mm artillery round the army believes that crusaders would remain in service until at least 2032 when the transformation to the armys new objective force and full deployment of the future combat systems would be complete14 during that time supporters have said the crusader could provide excellent fire support to the armys interim force in variety of scenarios and invaluable support to the leg acy force of abrams tanks particularly should it face major combat against enemies equipped with sovietstyle artillery eg north korea iraq china and russia15 in his sasc tes timony general shenseki pointed out that precision weapons do not fulf ill one important crusad er requirement the ability to deliver cost effectively masse d suppressive fires against closein and imprecisely located enemy forces also most proposed alternative fire support systems do not provide armored protection fo r their crews as does crusader crusader supporters believe that the program should definitely not be terminated until thorough review of alternatives for longrange fire support is completed they point out that most of the alternatives ggested by dod leadership are all in rd in the case of the fcs indirect fi re variant the technology has not even been
