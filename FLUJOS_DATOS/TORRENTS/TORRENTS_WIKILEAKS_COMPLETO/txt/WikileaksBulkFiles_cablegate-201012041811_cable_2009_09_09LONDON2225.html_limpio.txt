chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling told the ambassador during his september 23 introductory meeting that g20 governments must continue to implement stimulus packages and avoid complacency darling warned that if banks paid out large bonuses in 2010 they could provoke political backlash and draconian legislation that would have unintended consequences governments needed to pressure the banks to exercise restraint the chancellor was cautiously optimistic that the uk economy would return to growth by yearend but worried that the recovery remained fragile darling had sharp words for the conservatives who were campaigning on budget cuts but unwilling to say what they would cut he said that labour was losing hearts and minds more than the conservatives were winning people over the ambassador raised the issue of vat charges on the london embassy project and subsequently briefed us kennedy by phone end summary recovery is fragile and banker bonuses radioactive 2 cnf the ambassador said that the president was committed to strong framework for growth at pittsburgh and asked the chancellor for his expectations from the g20 summit noting he was traveling to pittsburgh early september 24 chancellor darling stressed the importance of continuing stimulus packages and avoiding complacency unemployment levels across the developed economies were high continuing to rise and risks to growth remained real he cited imf predictions that germany could reenter recession and expressed concern about the potential for higher oil prices he noted that high public sector debt levels constrained governments room for maneuver on pay and bonuses darling cautioned that banks needed to exercise restraint with spring uk elections in mind he said that if banks announced large bonuses early in 2010 the pressure for draconian legislation would be politically irresistible he expressed concern that political backlash could produce legislation that had unintended consequences and cited sarbanesoxley as an example he said governments needed to persuade bankers not to do something stupid in the coming months cautious optimism on recovery 3 cnf on the uk economy the chancellor remained cautious but expected return to growth by the end of the year but he cautioned that it would be foolish to announce victory he said that the uks heavy dependence on services and

address climate change 4 cnf the chancellor asked about the prospects for climate change legislation the ambassador referred to the presidents september 22 speech at the climate change summit and highlighted his commitment to address climate change through strong administrative measures and through legislation noting the determination of white house and congressional leaders the ambassador expressed confidence that congress would pass legislation labour losing hearts and minds 5 cnf responding to question on the uk election darling said that the conservatives may think they can run campaign on cutting spending without specifying what they are going to cut but this will become less and less tenable he said it is in the nature of the opposition to criticize without offering up specifics in the meantime he said that labour would fight like hell for reelection darling was sanguine about labours challenge the problem is not that the conservatives are winning hearts and minds rather that we are losing them8 he said that labour needed to regain the confidence of the public that they can win vat exemption on new embassy unlikely 6 cnf ambassador raised the new embassy project at nine elms noting that the usd 12 billion project would spur redevelopment of blighted area and create jobs he said that as matter of principle the uk should not impose valueadded tax on the
