of capital as the weighted average cost of capital wacc standalone and incremental costs for single productservice fi rm standalone costs and incremental costs are equal and refer to the costs of providing the total volume of the serviceproduct however for multiproduct firm standalone and incremental costs diverge because some costs are likely to be shared across productsservices the standalone cost of service is then the total cost of producing the to tal volume of that service if other services are produced on the other hand the incremental costs of the produc tservice are the costs that would be avoided if the total volume of that service was longer produced but all other services are produced static efficiency productive effici ency firms having the appropriate incentives

goods and services that provide the maximum benefit to society 6 appendix regulatory framework for nbn a1 executive summary the rfp requires the panel to assess propos als against the criteri on of the nature scope and impact of any legislative andor regulatory changes that are necessary to facilitate the proposal1 this appendix discusses the re gulatory framework in so far as it relates to competition and economic regulation effective competition drives efficiency which is crucial to maintaining and improving the welfare of australians all australian governments have agreed that legislation should not restrict competiti on unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits of the restriction to the commun ity as whole outweigh the costs and the objectives of the legislation can only be achieved by restricting competition key component of the 1997 telecommunica tions regime was the creation of more open market including by removing rest rictions on the number of licences that could be issued and creating an access regime that covers services to which access is required to compete in the same market as many communications services require anytoany connectivity proposal that seeks statutory monopoly in respect of the nbn is less likely to meet the evaluation criteria and commonw ealths objectives in particular the objective of continuing to promote th longterm interests of endusers2 however some limited forms of barri ers to competition may be justified restrictions that may require further consideration include supplementation of existing competition ws section 46 and part xib of the tpa via an express statutory prohibiti on against overbuild in the rollout and cutover period the australian government providing competitive advantage to the proponent through for example funding the nbn project or awarding government contracts to the proponent an exclusive right to cutover lines in order to facilitate any fttn rollout an access regime is likely to be required to promote competition where facility is natural monopoly and businesses require acce ss in order to compete in upstream or downstream markets the incentive for an nb n provider to negotia with an access seeker depends on the extent to which the nbn provider has market power and operates in market in which the nbn service is producti on input vertical integration competition in related market s is more likely to be achieved if proponent proposes statutor restriction on the proponent and related entities being involved in related business expe rience suggests that other forms of ring 1 rfp clauses 141 and 1031 criterion 3 2 rfp clause 131 objective 8 7 fencing such as business operational or accounting separation do not necessarily eliminate the incentive to discriminate against access seekers if proponent proposes stat utory restriction on vertic integration then the declarenegotiatearbitrate access regime in part xic of the tpa provides an appropriate starting framewor k for the regulation of wholesale access to the nbn however changes could be made to provide greater certainty for the nb n provider and access seekers by allowing the accc to set the values of certain inputs to be used in any future undertakings or arbitrations in respect of the nbn ensure that the regime governing access to facilities in schedule 1 of the telecommunications act 1997 is incorporated into part xic of the tpa if proponent is not vertically separated then proposal that proposes an ex access regime where the terms and conditi ons of access are set upfront is more likely to promote competition in relate d markets than the ex post regime in part xic experience suggests that where an access provider has market power and an incentive to deny access the negotiatearbi trate model is less effective than an ex regime in delivering timely access on reasonable terms and conditions a2 introduction the rfp requires the panel to evaluate proposals agains t six evaluation criteria including criterion 3 the nature scope and impact of any legisla tive andor regulatory changes that are necessary to facilitate the proposal cl ause 1539 of the rfp states3 to the extent that legislative andor regulatory changes are required in rel ation to the development and operation of the nbn these changes will be limited to those necessary to directly facilitate investment in the nbn and will n ot jeopardise the commonwealths other objectives this appendix discusses the regulatory framew ork for nbn in so far as it relates to competition and economic regulation the appendix reviews the regulatory issues in respect of promoting competition in th nbn market and related markets a3 promoting competition in the nbn market this section considers the following issues what is statutory barrier to competition in the nbn market how should such restrictions be assessed the section discusses forms of statutory barr iers to competition that may justify further consideration 3 see also rfp schedule 2 section 3 8 a31 what is statutory barrier to competition market power is the power held by single pplier business to set higher price of good and maintain their market share nece ssary precondition for such power is some constraint on market entry for example due to patents brand or technology advantage which makes it difficult for co mpeting companies to respond to such price rise an nbn provider will have mark et power if it is natura l monopoly where single supplier can more efficiently serve particular market th an two or more suppliers however an nbn provider may also obtain market power through statutory barrier to competition this could be achieved through for example regime that prohibits other businesses from construc ting certain infrastructure overbuild protection or supplyi ng certain services requires businesses to obtain licence to provide certain services and limits the number of licences that may be issued requires consumers to obtain certai n services from the nbn provider prevents other businesses from charging lowe r prices or offering better services than the nbn provider significantly alters the costs of some suppliers relative to the nbn provider allows the nbn provider exclusive use of facility to wh ich other businesses would also require access in order to compete affects the ability of some types of fi rms to participate in public procurement processes a32 assessment of statutory barriers to competition the national competition policy reforms agreed to by australian governments in 1995 and 2007 affirmed the importance of effective competition to maintaining and improving the welfare of australians4 the competitive process encourages firms to produce goods and services at least cost productive efficiency use resources to produce the goods and services that are most valued by consumers allocative efficiency and innovate by developing new products and production processes dynamic efficiency in 2007 all australian governments recommitted to the competition principles agreement 11 april 1995 includi ng the principle that legislation including acts enactments ordinances or regulations should not restrict competition unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits of the restriction to th community as whole outweigh the costs and 4 aust independent committee of inquiry national competition policy report august 1993 hilmer report p 1 9 b the objectives of the legislation can only be achieved by restric ting competition this is reflected in the australian governme nts requirements for the preparation of regulatory impact statement5 which is essentially intended to ensure that regulation is effective in that it addresses an identified problem and efficient in that it maximises the benefits to the community taking account of the costs consistent with this the ma in object of the 1997 teleco mmunications regime is to promote the longterm interests of enduser s of telecommunications services and the efficiency and international competitiven ess of the australian telecommunications industry6 an essential component of the regi was the creation of more open market by removing regulatory barriers to entry including by rem oving restrictions on the number of licences that could be issued and creating an access regime that covers services to which access is required to compete in the same market as many communications services requi re anytoany connectivity proposal that seeks to create statutory re strictions on competition in respect of the nbn is less likely to meet the commonwealths objectives in particular the objec tive of continuing to promote the l ongterm interests of endusers7 however as the hilmer report observed comp etition policy is not about the pursuit of competition per rather it seeks to facilitate effective competition to promote efficiency and economic growth while accommodating situations where competition does not achieve efficiency or conflicts with other social obj ectives this is reflected in the sanctioning of statutory restrictions on competition on public benefit grounds the remaining part of section a3 discusses overbuild protection limited to th rollout and cutover period an exclusive right to cutover lines government financial pport of the nbn project a33 overbuild protection overbuild has been used to refer to the construction of co mpeting alternative facilities although the terminology implies that competing facilities is inefficient this is not necessarily the case number of parties8 have argued that careful cons ideration should be given to ensuring that the regulatory environment for nbn does not encourage economically irrational decisions to invest in compe ting infrastructure andor technologies submissions cite the case of telstra closely duplicating op hfc rollout during the 1990s in order to induce optus to cease further expansion of its rollout 5 australian government best practice regulation handbook august 2007 p 29 6 telecommunications act 1997 s 3 7 rfp clause 131 objective 8 8 for example terria aapt and powertel and acacia 10 firm with market power can unilaterally respond to rivals in two ways it can undertake activities that are efficient and promote lower consumer prices andor improved consumer service alternatively it can engage in activities that undermine the competitive process with efficiency benefits in the former case the regulatory regime s hould not prevent the emergence of efficient facilitiesbased competition such overbuild is in the longterm interest of endusers in the latter case the aim of section 46 in pa rt iv of the tpa is to prevent such action from occurring section 46 prohibits corpor ation that has s ubstantial degree of power in market from taking advantage of that power for the purpose of amongst other things eliminating or substantially damaging competitor the section is intended to distinguish between vigorous comp etitive activity by firm even if such conduct has the ancillary effect of lesseni ng competition and conduct by firm which is designed to prevent the competitive process from continuing to operate effective ly with offsetting efficiency benefits the telecommunicationsspecific competition re gime in part xib of the tpa contains additional features to reduce the damage that can be inflicted by those wielding market power9 part xib prohibits carriers and carriage service providers from engaging in anticompetitive c onduct the competition rule10 the competition rule incorporates certain provisions in part iv including section 46 but carriers and services providers are subject to an add itional prohibition against taking advantage of market power with the effect of substantially lessening competition11 in addition in order for proceedings to be instituted under part xib the accc must issue competition notice in certain cases co mpetition notice reverses the evidentiary burden in court proceeding12 however the recent amendments to section 4613 are untested section 46 and part xib cases can be difficult to prove and time consuming and may not be sufficient to prevent predatory overbuild more eff ective approach may be to prevent such behaviour from occurring in the first pl ace via alternative regulatory measures 9 in particular the second reading speech stated there remain good reasons for there to continue to be industry specific competition regulation for telecommunications the removal of regulatory barriers to ent ry does not automatically result in the appearance of normal competitive market structures telstra continues to wield significant market power derived primarily from i ts historical monopoly position there is also scope for incumbent opera tors generally to engage in anticompetitive conduct because competitors in do wnstream markets depend on access to the carriage services controlled by them the fast pace of change and complex nature of horizontal and vertical arrangements of firms ope rating in this industry mean that any anticompetitive behaviour could c ause rapid damage to the competition that has already developed and severely hamper new entry see second reading speech on the trade practices amendment telec ommunications bill 1996 commonwealth parliamentary debates hansard house of representatives 5

limited to the rollout and cutover periods may have net procompetitive effect a34 exclusive right to mandatory cutover of lines the transition arrangements in respect of the timetable for upgrades of nodes and exchanges will be critical to ensuring that access seekers have time to adjust their business plans to accommodate fttn netw ork so competition can be preserved and promoted into the future these issues are examined in further detail in appendix i however one issue is whether an nbn provi der will require an exclusive right to mandatory cutover of lines some proponents propose to construct fibre optic network that wi ll connect to the copper pairs that run from st reetcorner pillars to each premises these copper pairs are owned by telstra proponent may propose to seek access to all of telstras copper pairs at each streetcorner pi llar and to then cut each copper pair over in single operation to connect them to the proponents proposed fibre networ k cutover refers to accessing the network at an existing cro ss connect point built into the network for example in an exchange or in pillar and redirecting the connection via jumper lead to the nbn providers dslam or cable connector for example this kind of reconnection occurs at exchanges currently whenever customer orders broadband service most of the industry appears to have accepted that in transitioning to nbn environment it will be necessary for copper li nes to be cutover to the new fibre link on 100 of lines node by node basis14 although the question remains whether the current regulatory regime facilitate s or allows such an arrangement the information available to the accc suggest s that this assessment is accurate for three reasons the technical aspects of ndusers on single node being supplied by either signal on ullslss line from an exchange nd service supplied from dslam or msan at node and the crosstalk effects of these two signals the economic feasibility of multiple truck ro lls to node to cutover copper lines to node once request for service is made by specific enduser the number of customers at node needs to be sufficient to make it economically viable for the nbn provider to pla ce dedicated equipment at that node one of the key issues associat ed with linebyline or ss than 100 per cent cutover is crosstalk or mid point injection interf erence crosstalk occurs when one xdsl service interferes with other xdsl services transmitted over copper pairs which are in close proximity to each other ie within th same binder cable crosstalk increases the further the copper pairs run in parallel the closer they are together and the larger more powerful the interfering signals crosstalk also incr eases with the frequency of 14 see regulatory submissions of all proponents and communications day internode backflip now supports full copper cutover terria monopoly 10 september 2008 12 the transmitted signals adsl2 is affected to greater extent than adsl while vdsl2 is affected to greater extent than adsl2 as the signal strength over copper pair comi ng out of the remote node is high relative to the signal strength over copper pair coming out of the local exchange given signals attenuate over distance travelle d crosstalk can be significant the issue is that copper pa ir carrying signal from th node negatively affects copper pair carrying the signal from th local exchange illustrated below figure 1 optical fibre and copper cable feed to distribution area source acif c559 part 1 figure 76 even if adjustments are made to the power used to transmit signals to prevent the node serviced signal interfering with the signals from the exchange this is likely to result in significant reduction in the speeds achievab from the node which would seem to be contrary to the commonwealths objectiv in the rfp to support high quality voice data and video services and offer broa dband services with minimum 12 mbps dedicated downlink transmission speed15 further given the relatively small number of endusers that will be connected to single node around 192 or 384 and the cost of single truck roll typically more than 200 for technician to go to node and tr ansfer copper line ove r to fibre link at the node it is likely that the costs for linebyline cutover of the nbn would be prohibitive for nbn operator if proponent can automate such transfer and thereby avoid the truck roll costs then this may change the economic viability of linebyline cutover nd could assist in maintaining and promoting competition in downstream markets however the benefits for competition of such an approach need to be assessed having regard to the extent to which the suite of services that an access seeker could provide to endusers from an exchange would be sufficient to ensure it can provide competitive offerings to consumers further even this assumes that an exchange would continue to be available which is by means assured one of the imp lications of upgradi ng the current copper exchangebased network to fttn configur ation is that the number of exchange buildings needed to house elec tronics for the supply of dow nstream services is reduced this is often cited as one of the potential costs aving benefits of upgrading to nbn 15 see clause 131 of the rfp 13 if it is necessary for the nbn provider to have an exclusive right to cutover all copper lines to the new fibre link this may require amendments to the current regulatory regime the current regime arguably requires two preconditions to be met before an access provider is obliged to provide access to an access seeker first the access seeker must be making the request for access so as to provide services to its own customer secondly the relevant copper line must not be currently used nor is there any reasonable expectation of use by the access provider or another access seeker to provide service which would conflict with the newly requested service it is unlikely that both preconditions would be met for mo re than small number of copper lines a35 competitive neutrality competitive neutrality where competitors compete on an equal footing is necessary condition for ensuring an optimal allocati on of resources government intervention such as when competitors operate under inconsistent investment taxation charging or regulatory frameworks can distort consumer choice between substitutable services this principle is reflected in the competition principles agreement 11 april 1995 amended 2007 in which all australian gove rnments agreed to policy governing competitive neutrality between public and private businesses16 the object of this policy is the elimination of resource alloca tion distortions arising out of the public ownership of entities engaged in significant business activities that is governme nt businesses should not enjoy any net competitiv advantage simply as result of their public sector ownership17 in respect of the nbn proponents may obtain competitive advantage through for example subsidy of the construction cost access to debt andor equity at rates di scounted from what would otherwise be available in the market place the government entering into take or pay contract wh ich underwrites profitability even with little or privat sector market penetration exemptions from various taxes exemptions from complying with re gulatory arrangements imposed on other competitors however such government action can be ju stified on efficiency or equity grounds government subsidies can be used to 16 competition principles agreement 11 april 1995 clause 3 17 see also the commonwealth competitive neutrality policy statement and australian government competitive neutrality guidelines for managers the competitive neutrality complaints mechanism is administered by the australian government competiti ve neutrality complaints office within the productivity commission 14 promote economic efficiency where there ar externalities where the production or consumption of good or service has an extern effect that is not reflected in the price or public goods where the g ood is public good or common property promote social objectives such as universal service obligation subsidy may also be preferable alte rnative to statutory monopoly such as overbuild protection which is an outright prohibition on competition a4 promoting competition in related markets this section considers the following issues general principles for signing an access regime summary of the existing access regime how the telecommunications access regime compares to other australian access regimes effectiveness of ope rational separation performance of the negot iatearbitrate model implications for the design of nbn access regime a41 general principles for designing an access regime the hilmer report recognised that in so markets firms require access to an infrastructure service in order to comp ete in upstream or downstream markets18 the incentive for an access provider and acce ss seeker to negotiate depends on two principal factors first the extent to whic h the access provider is subject to competitive restraints ie has market power if ther is effective comp etition there is the potential for the access provider to maximi profits by setting price too high and selling too few units compared to the social optimum in such case an objective of an access regime is to prevent th exercise of market power the second factor arises if th access provider or related company also operates in market in which the infrastructure service is production input vertical integration the access provider has potential incentive to use its market power to favour its operations in the related market for exam ple by refusing to supply the input charging higher access price to its competitor pri ce discrimination or providing lower quality service nonprice discrimination 18 aust independent committee of inquiry national competition policy report august 1993 hilmer report p 239 15 a42 overview of the existing access regime the regime for access to telecommunications services currently consists of the following components competition law part xib of the tpa access to services part xic of the tpa access to facilities s chedule 1 to the telecommunications act 1997 operational separation part 8 of schedule 1 to the telecommunications act 1997 information provision part xib of the tpa an overview of the provisions is set out in chapter 3 of the acccs report in summary part xic of the tpa and schedule 1 to the telecommunications act 1997 are based on the negotiatearbitrate model under part xic of the tpa if service is declared by the accc provider of that service is required to comply with standard access obligations including an obligation to supply the service to an acce ss seeker subject to certain exceptions failing agreement and in the absence of an undertaking the terms and conditions of access are determined by the accc acting as arbitrator under schedule 1 to the telecommunications act 1997 carriers are required as part of their licence conditions to provide access to certain facilities such as exchanges pillars ducts and towers if the parties are unable to agree upon the terms and conditions upon which the requirement is complied or on the appointment of an arbitrator the accc acts as arbitrator th accc has also made facilities access code governing access to mobile towers and underground ducts for example refusal to supply in respect of the nbn could potentially be covered by section 46 in part iv of the tpa the pe nalty in respect of body corporate must not exceed for each act or omission the greatest of 10 million three times the value of the benefit obtained by the comp any or where the benefit cannot be determined 10 percent of the annual turnover19 section 151ak in part xib of the tpa the penalty in respect of body corporate must not exceed where the contravention continued for more th an 21 days the sum of 31 million and 3 million for each day in excess of 21 that the contravention continued20 section 152bb in part xic of the tpa there is penalty although the federal court may order compliance or compensation21 however breach of the standard access obligations is also breach of carrier licence condition22 19 tpa s 76 20 tpa s

than telecommunications networks and australia post electricity networks gas pipelines and air ports under the transitional regime at the time of privatisation are s ubject to greater ex ec onomic

570 17 pricing principles which specify the governments expectations on pricing behaviour electricity transmission in respect of transmission services the national electricity rules ner defines two categories of regulated services prescri bed transmission services and negotiated transmission services transmission ne twork service provider is required to provide these services upon application by certain persons on terms and conditions that are consistent with the requirement s of the ner the ner provides for the arbitration of access disputes by commercia l arbitrator appointed by the australian energy regulator which is part of the accc however the service provider is also subject to transmission determination made by the aer for period of at least five years that includes revenue determ ination in respect of prescribed transmission services and specifies negotiating framework and negotiated transmission service criteria to apply to the negotiation of terms and conditions of access to negotiated transmission rvices the revenue determination determines the maximum revenue that the tnsp may earn in regulatory year which in turn provides the basis for deri ving charges the ner sets out building block model for deriving the annual revenue requirement detailed provisions governing connec tion applications and the terms and conditions of connection requirement subject to certain exceptions not to act as an electricity generator or retailer gas pipelines if gas pipeline is covered and is fully re gulated pipeline the service provider is in general required to submit an access arra ngement to the aer for approval if the aer does not approve the proposal the ae r must make the access arrangement the access arrangement which is usually for five year period sets out the terms and conditions of access including pric which the aer must apply when arbitrating an access dispute tariffs are derived from total revenue requirement which is determined using building block approach light regulation servic providers are required to publis h the terms and conditions of access including price on thei r websites but may also voluntarily submit limited access arrangement to

restrictions on contracts with associated companies australia post australia post has statut ory monopoly over the carriage of certain letters although 18 the scope of the reserved serv ices has been significantly re duced since 1901 it is also subject to community service obligation to provide certain letter services at uniform rate of postage across australia under part viia of the tpa australia

of postage for the carriage within australia of standa rd postal articles by ordinary post under the australian postal corporation act 1989 cth apc act person who requests bulk interconnecti on service from australia po st is able to notify the accc of dispute after conducting an inquiry the accc must provide report to the minister who may then direct aust ralia post to act in accordance with recommendation in the report the apc act also provides for the accc to require australia post to keep certain records including to identify any crosssubs idies between australia posts reserved services and the services that it provided in competition with other businesses a44 is the current operational separation framework effective the effectiveness of the operational separa tion framework that currently applies to telstra is discussed in appendix f in summary since coming into effect in june 2006 th operational separation arrangements that apply to telstra have failed to achieve equivalence experience suggests that the most eff ective means of ensuring equivalence and promoting competition in related markets is to impose statutory restriction that prevents the infrastructure provider and related entities from being involved in related business see for example the airports act 1996 other forms of ring fencing such as business operational or accounting separation do not necessarily eliminate the incentive to discriminate against access seekers a45 performance of the negotiatearbitrate model in the acccs experience the declarenegotiatearbitrate model of access regulation has been less effective in promoting competition in related markets where the acces s provider is vertically integrated an economywide negotiatearbitrate model for access regulation was first proposed in 1993 by the independent committee of inqui ry chaired by professor hilmer the committee considered that general competiti on law was not sufficient to resolve access issues24 the negotiatearbitrate model was intended to be less interventionist than regulated outcomes and to facilitate the volution of more mark etoriented solutions over time25 24 the committee noted the limitations of section 46 of the tpa for access s eekers hilmer report pp 242245 25 hilmer report p 255 19 however the likelihood of pa rties reaching negotiated out come depends principally upon the extent to which the access provide r has market power and is vertically integrated other determinants include the credibility and extent of the threat the backstop if the negotiation fails negotiated access is more likely to occur wh ere the regulatory threat is perceived as credible incomplete information when at least one party possesses relevant information that the other party does not whether this is as ymmetric or symmetric to both players this introduces incentives for strategic be haviour and may result in an inefficient bargaining outcome the number of industry partic ipants and the complexity of the issues bargaining where there are more than two players or multiple issues introduces the possibility of delay and an inefficient outcome the telecommunications industry to date s displayed the following characteristics particularly in respect of the fixed line customer access network can telstra is vertically integrated operato r supplying its downstream competitors with wholesale inputs telstra as vertically integrated operato r holds relevant information about its facilities services and effici ent costs to which access s eekers do not have general or uninhibited access there are multiple issues and multiple players all simultaneously negotiating ccess to services these characteristics suggest that it is less likely that the negoti atearbitrate model would achieve its aim of mark etnegotiated outcomes this is borne out by experience as at 1 january 2008 115 telecommunications access disputes had been notified since the commencement of the regime in 1997 th is can be contrasted to three access disputes that have been notified in othe r sectors in respect of gas transmission pipeline sydney airport and sewerage service the australian competition tribunal tribuna l recently described part xic as a26 drawn out process by which terms of access including price are agreed experience shows that there are many disput that take considerable time to resolve and when legal issues arise th parties can end up in court in the acccs experience an access pr ovider that has significant market power27 and is vertically integrated can use part xic to delay the implementation of efficient prices by 26 applications by chime communications for review of an exemption order made by the accc in respect of telstras local call service and wholesale line rental service 2008 acompt court identifier not yet available 22 december 2008 at 23 20 introducing serial undertak ings that are unlikely to be accepted by the accc negotiating industrywide i ssues on bilateral basis challenging procedural matters and s eeking merits and judicial review each of these issues is discussed below 1 introducing serial undertakings that are unlikely to be accepted by the accc part xic enables providers to submit voluntarily access underta kings to the accc which set out the terms and conditions on which the provider will provide access to their infrastructure services there are two types of access undertakings ordinary access undertakings which are s ubmitted in respect of declared services that are currently supplied ie active declared services28 and special access undertakings which are submitted in respect of services not yet declared or not yet supplied29 there is requirement for an access provi der to submit an undertaking if an access provider decides to submit an undertaking and the accc or the tribunal on review decides that the undertaking is not reas onable the accctribunal cannot impose revised undertaking in contrast to the ex regimes that currently apply to electricity networks and gas pipelines even if an undertaking is accepted by the accc the access provider has the option of unilaterally revoking the undertaking30 the intention of allowing for voluntary access undertakings was to provide an opportunity for increased regulatory certain ty to access providers however if an access provider has market power and is ver tically integrated th incentive under the current regime is to delay an arbitration by submitting series of undertakings that are unacceptable the assessment of an undertaking is hi ghly resourceintensive and timeconsuming process particularly where the decision is appealed to the tribunal it involves multiple complex issues volumes of submissions and other materials and costly legal and economic expert advice th undertaking process creates uncertainty in the market and diverts the resources of the accc nd access seekers away from other tasks in particular arbitral determinations however at the end of this process parameters are locked in and access seekers still have not obtained access on reasonable terms and conditions 27 where around 71 per cent of fixedvoice acce ss lines are supplied directly by telstras retail business acma communications report 200607 p 74 28 tpa s 152bs 29 tpa s 152cba 30 tpa ss 152ca and 152cbi in contrast undertakings accepted by the accc unde r part iiia of the tpa can only be withdrawn with the acccs consent tpa s 44zza7 21 the next time the access provider submits an undertaking the process starts again the access provider is able to submit substant ially different approach or inputs for example substantially different implied va lues were generated by telstras pie ii and tea models for the same assets ther eby requiring additional time consuming assessment lodging of an undertaking allows the access prov ider to argue that an arbitration or arbitrations should be suspended whilst the undertaking is assessed31 in the event that an access dispute is notified by an access eker there is an incentive for an access provider to immediately lodge an undertaking matter ho w unsuitable if it appears that the undertaking will not be accepted f or example based on the acccs draft decision the access provider can withdraw its undertaking and submit revised version this necessitates restart of the acccs assessment process any final decision by the accc not to accept an undert aking can then be appealed to the tribunal thereby delayi ng the process further an interim arbitration determination may be made and arbitrated pricing decisions can be backdated however retail prices will tend to reflect the prevailing prices where access prices remain higher than efficient leve ls during the course of the access dispute or where an interim determination has been made there is risk that the interim price may be subsequently increased conseque ntly endusers of telecommunications services will not face efficient prices over that time and will have their consumpti on decisions distorted this reduces we lfare across society more broadly 2 negotiating industrywide issues on bilateral basis under part xic if there is agreement or undertaking the terms and conditions of access are determined by arbitration by the accc the bilateral nature of an arbitration creates significant difficulty in that th accc can never finally determine prices terms and conditions to apply across the i ndustry and must arbitr ate essentially the same access dispute each time new dispute is notified unless all disputes re simultaneously notified so that joint hearing may be conducted the accc may make pricing principles and model terms32 however as the principles cannot be lockedin each arbitration still creates si gnificant amount of duplication and delay for industry part icipants and the accc 3 challenging procedural matters nd seeking merits and judicial review access providers may also delay the implementation of reasonable prices by challenging the procedural step s throughout the course of an arbitration eg validity of notification confidentia lity arrangements to apply speci fic claims of confidentiality conduct of joint hearings process for making final determination negotiation directions there is also sc ope for late submissions which has resulted in considerable delays in almost all arbitrations over the past 18 month period j udicial review has been sought in respect of almost all final arbitration determin ations made by the accc33 31 see tpa s 152cla4 32 tpa ss 152aqa and 152aqb 22 the arrangements in respect of access under schedule 1 of the telecommunications act 1997 have not been tested to any great extent34 however there is potential for significant delay as the arbitration regime does not incorporate the amendments that have been made to part xic the facilities access code c ontains number of steps th at provide potential scope for disputation schedule 1 including the faci lities access code is enfo rced as licence condition establishing breach of licence condition in the federal court is potentially protracted process which can st all the entrance of competitor the ambiguous definitions in schedule 1 nd the existence of two separate legal frameworks creates disputes over which regime imposes the relevant obligation on the access provider a46 implications for the design of nbn access regime in summary the appropriate access regime for the nbn will depend upon the extent to which the nbn provider has market power either as natural monopoly or through statutory barriers to competition and is vertically integrated the alternative forms of ringfencing for an nbn provider are discussed in appendix f however any regulatory framework also need s to incorporate the following features first the regime should be able to acco mmodate changing circumstances for example the regime should allow regulation to be rem oved if the nbn ceases to be bottleneck and provide for review of the regime afte r certain period of operation such as five years secondly the regime should be clearly fined before investment occurs in telstra v commonwealth 2008 hca 7 the high court held that part xic was not an acquisition of property as telstra had never owned any assets accept in accordance with legislation that created statutory access regime thirdly the regime should provide regulat ory certainty and thus reduce price and investment risk for both the nbn provider nd access seekers the price that an nbn provider will be allowed to charge its cu stomers is significant determinant of profitability and ability to fi nance the project however it is also important that access seekers have sufficient certai nty in order for them to make efficient investment decisions in respect to downstream markets 33 as at 13 october 2008 there were 18 final terminations before the federal court challenging the determinations on judicial review grounds 34 only one dispute has been notified to the accc in 2007 telstra noti fied dispute in respect of the access charges for access to an optus tower the dispute was settled by the parties and withdrawn before substantive issues had been considered by the accc 23 fourthly where both the access provider and terms and conditions of access are to be determined through competitive tender process for government sponsored infrastructure then it may be possible to establish access prices through that tender process this is because any monopoly rents from the infrastructure are more likely to be dissipated however this requires particular conditions to be sati sfied including that the bidders have accurate information comp arable skills and substantial financial resources35 the current stage of the nbn process in isolation is not sufficient to satisfy these conditions fifthly the regime should incl ude appropriate incentives fo r compliance in particular the penalties for noncompliance should be suffi cient to act as an effective deterrent a5 access regime vertically separated nbn provider this section discusses the design of an access regime for the nbn in the event that the nbn provider is vertically separated full structural separation pr ohibits bottleneck provider fr om operating in potentially competitive segments thereby eliminating the incentive to discriminate between access seekers access regulation is needed only to curtail the use of ma rket power generally through some measure of constraint on pric ing with reference to underlying costs if proponent proposes stat utory restriction on verti cal integration then the declarenegotiatearbitrate access regime in part xic provides an appropriate starting framework for the regulation of wholesale access to the nbn however changes could be made to provide greater regulatory certainty and t hus reduce price and investment risk for the nbn provider and access seekers thi s issue is further discussed below ensure that the regime governing access to facilities in schedule 1 of the telecommunications act 1997 is incorporated into part xic of the tpa this issue is discussed in section a45 above a51 existing mechanisms for regulatory certainty the current provisions of part xic enable regulatory settings to be determined in advance of any new investment being made in telecommunications infrastructure the telecommunications competition act 2002 amended part xic to give the accc the power to grant anticipatory exemptions from the st andard access obligations for carriers and carriage service providers that expe ct to supply service s 152ata accept special access undertakings from carri ers and carriage service providers that expect to supply service s 152cbc the accc must ultimately be satisfied that granting an exemption is in the longterm interests of endusers or that the sp ecial access undertaking is reasonable 35 see armstrong m and sappington d regulation competition and libera lization june 2006 442 journal of economic literature 325 at 343 24 the use of these mechanisms to obtain i nvestment certainty was canvassed by both telstra and fanoc commonly referred to as the g9 in previous fttn proposals box 2 use of exemptions and special access undertakings in previous fibre proposals note the following highlighted info rmation is commercialinconfidence voluntary information telstras fttn proposal of 2006 telstra in its preliminary negotiations w ith the accc regarding its proposed fttn network in five capital citie s sydney melbourne brisba ne adelaide and perth indicated that it intended to lodge exemptions with the accc for an ordinary individual exemption from the obligation to supply all currently declared services except pstn term inating access service and the mobile terminating access service within the fttn footprint for 10 years from the date of completion of the fttn telstra propos ed that the exemption would apply for all declared services except the ulls and lss on an exchange by exchange basis from the date on which an exchange was fibreenabled for ulls and lss on linebyline basis from the date on which the relevant enduser line was equipped by telstra to supply the high speed access service essentially bitstream service an anticipatory individual exemption in re lation to all services within the fttn footprint other than the proposed high sp eed access service and any future fttn terminating access service telstra proposed to lodge special access undertaking in respect of the high speed access service at the same time as the exemption for the supply of full wholesale broadband service of up to 24 mbps with w holesale voice and an entrylevel service of 2 mbps with voice at access prices of 90120 per month and 6468 per month respectively these prices were derived us ing hybrid valuation of assets cost model which was the subject of consider able discussion and iterations fanoc g9 fttn special access undertaking on 20 april 2007 the g9 lodged draft special access undertaking sau with the accc this was followed on 30 may 2007 by fanoc company created by the g9 lodging 15 year sau with the accc for third party access to bitstream access service on proposed adsl2 fibretothenode fttn network in the five mainland capital cities and then progressively to densely populated regional centres fanoc proposed to offer wholesale bro adband access service bas to access seekers initially it proposed to offer fi ve different bas products including stand alone telephone access service and four bitstrea m services that may be used to provide voice and broadband services of va rying theoretical peak speeds 25 fanoc proposed specific prices for these five services for the fi rst three years and methodology for calculating annual access prices after the initial access period of three years rather than price list the prices proposed were table 1 fanoc sau access prices source fanoc submission to the accc 30 may 2007 pp 67 on 10 march 2008 following the release of the acccs draft decision fanoc advised that it was withdrawing the propos ed sau further details on the fanoc sau can be found in the acccs ssessment of fanoc s special access undertaking in relation to the broadband access service draft decision december 2007 and on the acccs website at httpwwwacccgovaucontentindexphtmlitemid788471 broadly the acccs view is that these m echanisms are effective and flexible in fulfilling the objective of providing certainty before investment decisions are made however the fanoc sau highlighted the following limitations of the undertaking process the accc is unable to accept an undertaking subject to conditions access providers are limited in their ability to provide in an undertaking for the accc to perform functions and powers each of these issues is discussed below 1 accc is unable to accept an undertaking subject to conditions 26 the accc may only accept or reject an undertaking an undertaking cannot be accepted subject to conditions in respect of the fanoc sau the accc in its draft decision found that the g9s prices for the initial three year peri od of up to 29 to 50 per month depending on the speed offered may be within the reasonable range of prices for this type of service and network and that the pricing approach was generally acceptable however the accc found th at it would be unable to accept the undertaking as the undertaking gave the netw ork owner high degr ee of discretion in unilaterally determining nonpr ice terms and conditions for the 15 year undertaking period without independent regulatory revi ew the ability to accept an undertaking subject to conditions would facilitate accepta nce of undertakings and thus investment in infrastructure in the case of spec ial access undertaking or timely access to existing infrastructure in the cas of an ordinary undertaking 2 access providers are limited in their ability to provide in an undertaking for the accc to perform functions and powers the fanoc sau sought to confer numbe r of functions on the accc including monitoring and approving changes to prices under the undertaking approving changes to the services supplied under the undertaking and arbitrating disputes between the separate entities that would respectively own and manage the fttn that fanoc proposed to invest in however in contrast to part iiia of the tpa36 part xic does not provide for the accc to perform functions or powers proposed in an undertaking the accc considered that it did not have the power to carry out the functions proposed in the fanoc sau a52 providing regulatory certainty for the nbn the exemption and sau mechanisms could be utilised in respect of the nbn to provide regulatory certainty and thus re duce price and investment risk for the proponent however possible issue is how the exemption and sau assessment process interacts with the commonwealths nbn process possible approaches to address this include requiring proponent to have sau andor exemption applica tion in respect of services supplied on the nbn accepted by the accc before the commonwealth accepts the proposal deeming prescribed nbn services to be declared services for the purposes of part xic deeming process was used in the transition from the managed competition approach under the telecommunications act 1991 to the more open competition approach under the 1997 regime37 the issues around the appropriate 36 see tpa s 44zza6a 37 in particular section 39 of the telecommunications transitional provisions and consequential amendments act 1997 required the accc to prepare statemen t in consultation with austel then the regulator responsible for technical and competition regulation in telecommunications markets deeming certain services as declar ed services with effect from 1 ju ly 1997 the deeming process was intended to achieve smooth introduction of the ne w telecommunications access regime by essentially retaining existing access rights for carriers extending those rights to existing service providers and new entrants and providing access to the carriage of broadcasting services over cable networks 27 services to regulate and the descriptions that should be used are considered in more detail in appendix g of this report amending part xic to allow the accc to prescribe or lockin methodologies values of certain inputs such as the value of the assets or the rate of return or other terms or conditions to be used by the accc in any undertakings or arbitrations in respect of the nbn a6 access regime vertically integrated nbn provider this section discusses the design of an access regime for the nbn in the event that the nbn provider is vertically integrated if the nbn provider or related entity also competes in potentially competitive related markets it has the incentive to disc riminate between access seekers in order to inhibit retail competition in this case proposal that proposes an ex access regime where the terms and conditions of access are set upfront is more likely to promote competition in related markets than the ex post regime in part xic this could be achieved by am ending part xic in order to deem prescribed nbn services to be declared services require the nbn provider to submit an undert akings in respect of those services provide for the accc or tribunal on review in the event that the undertakings is not accepted to impose an undertaking similar to the power to make an arbitration determination except that the undertaki ng would apply to all access seekers prevent the nbn provider from unilatera lly withdrawing the undertaking without the consent of the accc part xic could be amended to prescribe the va lues of certain inputs to be used in the undertaking such model would be more interventioni st than the arbitration procedures that have applied to date but would introduce far less complex and resource intensive regime for the nbn and would provide si gnificantly less opport unity for delay and gaming 28 appendix b valuing the sunk network b1 executive summary infrastructure is regarded as sunk if it ca nnot be redeployed to an alternative use the opportunity cost of such infrastruc ture the amount st by not using the infrastructure in its best alternative use is therefore low or zero however the owner of the infrastructure will value it in terms of the value of the future cash flows the infrastructure is expected to generate for an unregulated monopolist this value reflects the cash flows ear ned from monopoly pricing economic theory suggests that sunk asset s value should be its scrap value that is its value in its best altern ative use which by definition is its scrap value prices based on this asset value would lead to st atic allocative and productive efficiency however valuing the assets at scrap would not encourage asset owners to replace them in the future whereas higher value may be more likely to hence there is tradeoff between static effi ciencies and creating investme nt incentives over the long term the choice of which value to attribute to sunk assets within the range of scrap value to value that reflects monopoly cash flows is eff ectively arbitrary usually bottleneck infrastructure providers subject to costbased regulation can also attribute value higher than scrap value to their sunk assets spite the opportunity cost of these specialised assets being very low the value attributed is typically established with reference to the costs of investing in the infrastructure the infrastructure provider is therefore able to recover the costs of past infrastructure investment and may be more willing to invest in the future the value attached to existing sunk assets to be used as part of the nbn will be significant input to access and end user pri ces other considerations that will affect access prices and their path over time include the regulated cost of capital discussed in chapter 2 levels of operational and maintenance xpenditure and how these change over time how and when the value of existing sunk assets will be recovered over what time period and from which serv ices in what proportions how future capital investment expenditures are to be reflected in access prices and the amount of flexibility afforded to the nbn operator in determining access prices for itself and any constraints imposed on that flexibility eg cost reflective access prices discussed in chapter 3 it is not possible to advise from only an examination of different sunk network values the effects on access and end user pr ices resulting from alternative values the net impact on prices following the nb n upgrade will flow from the choices made by proponents in relation to l of the above considerations elements of telstras customer access ne twork can can be considered to be sunk for example ducts and pipes cannot practically be dug up and reused for another purpose and the tr enching work undertaken to run these ducts and pipes cannot be sold on with the national broadband network nbn upgrade it is prudent to consider what valu should be attributed to these assets because they will continue to be used on the upgraded network 29 so long as the approach to treating future nbn investment is clearly defined how existing sunk assets are treated will have litt implication for investment signals going forward the value that is attributed to existing sunk assets represents windfall gain or loss to telstra as the current owner of these assets whether the value is rolled into their asset base or wh ether they receive compensation for the sale of these assets if another pr oponent is awarded the tender however each of the different approaches th at can be used to value can investment going forward have different effects on co strecovery investment and enduser prices therefore when considering which approach to use for new can investment it is important that it is consistent with the specific objective of the regulatory re gime that will apply to the nbn there are two broad approaches to valui ng sunk assets val uebased and cost based approaches valuebased approaches are sometimes argued to increase investment but this would be at the expense of the allocative and productive efficiencies that costbased approaches aim to achieve the starting point for value based approach would be the cans future revenue stream this revenue stream would be determined by telstras unregulat ed as well as regulated service provision hence to some extent assuming the can c ontinues to be subject to costbased regulation its future revenue stream is influenced by costbased regulation value based approach would therefore partly ge nerate circular value costbased approaches typically use efficient investme nt costs as benchmark and are preferred by regulatory agencies in most jurisdictions and industries there are several costbased approaches that could be used hi storicactual costs depreciated historic costs current replacement costs depr eciated current replacement costs optimised replacement costs and preciated optimised replacement costs broadly replacement cost approaches offer forward looking perspective whilst historic costs have backwar d looking perspective at th point in time at which an investment takes place each appro ach should derive the same value the forward looking perspective is argued to reflect the outcomes that would occur in pe rfectly contestable markets it therefore aims to create i nvestment and use buildorbuy signals and promote productive nd allocative efficiency creates uncertainty over wh ether the access provider will over or underrecover the costs of their investment because th assets value is recalculatedrevalued at intervals shorter than the period ov er which the costs of the asset are recovered this may deter future investment if the infrastructure provider believes they will not be able to recove r their investment costs or encourage overinvestment if they believe they are ab to earn return above their costs is used to value the can in the current regulatory regime this was based on the view that in an environment of rapidly changing technology and therefore falling costs of providing telecommunications services basing access prices on historic costs would inefficiently enc ourage access seekers to build their own infrastructure to bypass the access providers is only appropriate if the benefits of revaluation exceed the costs revaluation adds risk cost that is only justif iable if the corres ponding benefits the prevention of inefficient bypass outw eigh it if inefficient bypass is thought unlikely going forward it would seem that revaluation is longer justified 30 the backward looking perspective historicactual costs provides more certainty with regard to investment cost recovery doesnt aim to create the buildorbuy signa ls that perfectly contestable market would may not lead to productive and alloca tive efficiency though neither do forward looking costs suggests that at this point in time based on information on historic costs provided by telstra to the accc under the regulatory ccounting framework raf reporting requirements the gross historic cost value of the can is around 17 billion rkr cic and the depr eciated historic cost value is around 8 billion rkr cic the approach used to value the can cannot be considered in isolation of the pricing model that will apply to the nbn in th eory tslric pricing model could be applied using either backward or fo rward looking approach to asset valuation likewise other pricing models such as the building block model used by the australian energy regulator in the gas nd electricity industries could also be applied using either backward or fo rward looking approach to asset valuation number of features of the forward looki ng pricing framework create uncertainty as to whether investment costs will be over or underrecovered th features include the assumption that new network is built at each pricing determination that is valuing the can at optimised repl acement cost rather than depreciated optimised replacement cost at each pric ing determination in line with the acccs conservative approach to telecommunications access pricing the current application of optimised replacem ent costs means that the past decline in the cans value has never been nd never is taken into account as the above information suggests it appears th at just over half rkr cic of the historic cost of can assets has been pa id off by users because these recovered costs are never taken into account the period ove r which telstra is able to recover its investment costs on these assets is in effect neverending this is in contrast to the approach adopted in the energy indus try where at the commencement of the regulatory regime the regulated bundle of assets was valued at their depreciated optimised replacement co st and the proportion of costs recovered in each regulatory period is taken into account in subsequent regulatory periods the subjectivity involved in estimating optimised replacement costs using bottomup cost models estimates of optimised replacement costs have varied widely because the output of any bottomup cost model relies on how the large range of inputs to the model are manipul ated in this regard the asset values presented in this appendix that are pr oduced by the tea model relate only to services located in band 2 areas thes represent around two thirds rkr cic of the total services in operation throughout the country and cover around 02 per cent rkr cic of the geographic territory in square kilometres covered by the can as such the optimised replacement costs that the tea model estimates for all four ulls bands will be lot higher than the 207 billion accc cic figure presente d for band 2 in this appendix the pie ii model produces an optimised repl acement cost for all four bands of around 33 billion accc cic 31 choices surrounding technology deployment on the optimised network the optimised replacement cost of the can has most recently been estimated in the context of it being infrastr ucture that is used to provide the ulls because this service is defined as being provisioned over unconditioned copper facilities it has been assumed that the network is comprised of unconditioned copper facilities fibre has not been assumed to be deployed because the access service provided over fibre bitstream is diff erent to the ulls when estimating the optimised replacement cost of the can in the context of it being infrastructure that is used to provide generi c access service however the technology assumed to be deployed should arguably be fibre to the extent that fibre cable provides additional functionality to copper cable the cost of fibre cable which is already likely to be lower than co pper cable would be adjusted downwards alternative pricing models such as the aers current application of the building block model can over time reduce number of the aforemen tioned uncertainties associated with the current application of forward looking costs in telecommunications with such setandforget pricing m odel an opening asset valuebase is established at subsequent pricing dete rminations the cans value would be rolled forward from the previous pric ing determination less the investment costs that were recovered depreciation and plus any capi tal expenditure at actual cost that occurred since th last pricing determination the aer is currently moving towards system whereby forecast capital expenditure will be approved as being reasonable at the start of the regulatory period for the duration of that period this is aimed at improving investment certainty and may act as check on the efficiency of investment if setandforget approach is considered desirable for the nbn it is likely that policy or regulatory decision will need to be made about the level of the opening asset base and this will need to be locked in cont ractually between government and the nbn provider andor through legislative change to the telecommunications access regime to broaden the scope of regulat ed pricing to encompass the whole nbn facility the chosen level of the opening asset base and decisions made around the treatment of depreciation and future capital expenditure would have fundamental consequences for the incentives for pr oponent to accept the opening asset base and incentives to undertake timely and effi cient upgrades to the nbn in future 32 b2 introduction the capital value of infrastructure may be regarded as sunk if the infrastructure cannot be redeployed to an alte rnative use that is once th investment in creating the asset has been made the outlay cannot be re couped by selling the asset for some other purpose from an economic perspective the opportunity cost the amount lost by not using the asset in its best alternative use associated with such assets once the investment has been made is very low or zero the value of such infrastructure to its owner reflects the future cash flows the infras tructure is expected to generate for an unregulated monopolist these cash flows will be determined by monopoly prices and output levels these are precisely the prices and ou tput levels that regulation aims to prevent in regulated infrastructure i ndustries bottleneck infrastructu re providers are allowed to include value for the bundle of sunk assets in their asset base that is above the assets opportunity cost but below the value implie d by the revenues the infrastructure would earn if unregulated typically this value is established with reference to the efficient costs of investing in the infr astructure this value become s an important component of the regulated access prices that the access provider is permitted to charge the aim of attributing value to sunk assets is to allow the infrastructure provider to recover the costs of their re gulated investments includi ng normal commercial return if the regulated infrastructure provider was not allowed to include this component in access prices it may be unwilling to replace as sets when they wear out which could jeopardise dynamic efficiency and the long run provision of services standard regulatory objectives both overseas and in other indus tries include the promotion of efficient investment in and use of infrastructure under the current telecommunications access regime section 152ab2e of the trade practices act 1974 tpa lists one of the objectives to which the accc must have regard in promoting the long term intere sts of end users ltie as the objective of encouraging the economically efficient use of and the economically efficient investment in the infrastructure by which listed services are supplied and any other infrastructure by which listed services are or are likely to become capable of being supplied furthermore section152ah1 of the tpa states that amongst other things the criteria against which reasonable terms of acce ss are to be judged include the legitimate business interests of the carrier or carriage service provider concer ned and the carriers or providers investment in f acilities used to supply th declared service concerned38 38 section 152ah1 states that in determining whether particular terms and conditions are reasonable regard must be had to the following matters whether the terms and conditions promote the longterm interests of endu sers of carriage services or of services supplie d by means of carriage services 33 elements of telstras customer access ne twork can have lternative use other than to provide access to end users for the supply of telecommunications services for example ducts and pipes cannot be dug up and reused for another purpose and the trenching work undertaken to run these duc ts and pipes in cannot be sold on these network elements are therefore regarded as sunk infrastructure t attributing value to the can and thus potentially jeopardisi ng future investment in the network would be inconsistent with the current legislativ criteria as such under the current regime telstra charges access prices that cover th full costs associated with providing telecommunications serv ices including the sunk costs of the infrastructure they have invested in in the transition to the national broadband netw ork nbn if value is not attributed to sunk can assets investors may longer exp ect to be able to recover the funds they have invested in existing can assets when it comes time to replace elements of the can that continue to be used on the nb n they may be unwilling to replace the infrastructure and the longrun provision of telecommunications services could be jeopardised given that capita l investment in the can does not occur as infrequent one offs but rather occurs on an ongoi ng basis continuity of supply could be jeopardised immediately however so long as the approach to treating future nbn investment is clearly defined how existing sunk assets are treated will have little implication for investment signals going forward the value that is attributed to existing sunk as sets therefore represents windfall gain or loss to telstra as the curr ent owner of these assets whether the value is rolled into their asset base or whether th ey receive compensation for the sale of these assets if another proponent is awarded the tender given that high proportion of the costs asso ciated with the telecommunications sector are capital costs assumptions about the value of the can will impact substantia lly on the average level and path of nbn access pr ices over time indeed capital costs39 contributed to just over 75 per cent acc c cic of the access price proposed in telstras most recent unbundled

costbased approaches include historic costactual cost the original cost of acquiring or building the asset depreciated historicactual co st dhcdac adjusts the historic cost of an asset by the

available asset mea and depreciated optimised replacement cost dorcodrc values the asset at the cost of replacing it with an asset that is both adjusted for the proportion of the service potential of the existing asset that has expired and b optimised to provide the required service potential in the most efficient way possible replacement cost approaches are often described as bei ng forward looking and historicactual cost approach as backward looking when an investment is first made each of these approaches should arrive at the same value this is because the firm making the i nvestment will invest in the most up to date technology and because the asset is undeprecia ted at the start of its life over time the optimisation incorporated into optimised replacement cost approaches means that in theory they should trend lower than inf lation adjusted historic costs this is because optimisation allows historic networ k inefficiencies to be excluded from the asset base and technological change allows th same services to be provided at lower cost in practice however optimised repla cement cost approaches often trend higher than their historic cost count erparts particularly when sset prices have been rising such that they offset cost savings from optimisation over time therefore bundle of assets whic h have been invested in at different points in time will contain some assets for which historicactual costs depreciate d historicactual costs optimised replac ement costs and depreciated optimised replacement costs are very similar if not the same and some assets for which they may differ great deal 40 the difference between accounting and economic depreciation is discus sed in section 141 35 valuebased approaches differ from costbas ed approaches in its submission to the nbn expert panel on regulatory issues tels tra propose move away from costbased regulation for the nbn and move towards valuebased regulation if not costbased what should be the approach to the nbn access policy in telstras view an nbnspecific access pricing regime needs to be built around three principles shift to access pricingthat considersi nvestment incentives and pricing for value we call this valuebased pricing approach to dis tinguish it from todays below cost approach the costs of the upstream inputs to next generation network services are l ikely to vary much less than the value that consumers put on the downstream products in thi s environment value based pricing is justifieddynamic value rather than cost reflect ive pricing is an efficient means of promoting investment41 dynamic value pricing is not concept recognised in economic literature and as such how it would promote investment is unclear to the extent value based approaches are referred to in economic literature they include net present value which values an asse t as the present value of the cash flows generated by the asset and net realisable value which is the price that the asset would achieve in an open market there is also hybrid approach referred to as optimised deprival value odv which is defined as odv mindorc maxnpvnrv if valuing an asset based on the revenues that are expected to be earned by the asset net present value approach it should be cons idered that the future revenue stream of the can is based on future prices if these prices are guided by the regulator and based on costbased assessment of the cans valu using such value would be circular alternatively valuing the can based on the maximum amount that users are willing to pay for can services would effectively m ean assuming future expected revenues are determined by monopoly prices in this case investment incentives would not be heightened rather this w ould lead to the traditional monopoly concerns of higher prices and reduced output that is reduced investment that access regulation is aimed at preventing using net realisable value is also not possible as the assets are sunk which by definition means there is open market for them and in light of the preceding discussion odv collapses to dorc because each of the other approaches is untenable 41 telstra public submission on the rollout and operation of national broadband network for australia 2008 pp 1314 36 b4 what approach has the accc adopted in telecommunications to date in light of the criteria set out by secti on 152ah of the tpa the accc has generally set prices for fixed line access services based on the total service long run incremental cost tslric of providing the service42 tslric is the incremental costs the firm incurs in the long term in provi ding the particular service assuming all of its other production activities remain unchanged it is the cost the firm would avoid in the long term if it ceased to provide the par ticular access service in practice the accc has priced services on the ts lric of providing servi ce the incorporates contribution to fixed costs such as trenchi ng which arguably were not cost incurred by the incumbent and would not be cost in curred if new entran t were to build an optimised replacement network today the costs of investing in the infrastructure which provides the rvice the capital costs are large proportion of tslric the accc has considered an optimised replacement cost approach to valuing the can to be most consistent with tslric access pricing under the existing regime the acccs approa ch at the time of pricing determination has been to assume that brand new netw ork is instantaneousl constructed at its optimised replacement cost of note in line with the acccs conservative approach to telecommunications access pricing applyi ng this approach since the regime commenced has meant that the past decline the cans value has never been taken into account this is in contrast to the approach adopted in the energy industry discussed below where at the commencement of the regulatory regime the regulated bundle of assets was valued at their depreciated optimised replacement cost this investment cost is allocated over an assumed can asset life to determine annual capital costs known as annualisation43 the accc uses an annuity approach for annualisation as it incorporat return on capital as we ll as return of capital depreciation also annuity approaches gene rate access prices that are unrelated to the age of the underlying infrastruc ture this is necessary due to the assumption that new network is built at each pric ing determination annual capita l costs are then added to other relevant cost categorie s for example operations nd maintenance expenditure to determine an access price for that pricing determination at subsequent pricing determinations which under the curren t regulatory framework can at the access providers discretion occur even more fre quently than annually the process is repeated brand new network is assumed to be built and its investment costs are annualised and added to other relevant costs to determine an access price the following sections discuss the streng ths and weaknesses of this approach 42 the approach used to price particular services depends on both the approa ch put forward by the access provider and that approach being assessed as re asonable by the accc for that specific service for example the unconditioned local loop service and the line sharing service are priced using the tslric approach retail minus retail costs approa ch has been used for pricing the wholesale line rental and local carriage services benchmarking appr oaches have also been used particularly for the mobile terminating access service 43 in practice the cost of investing in each indi vidual element of the ca n is allocated over that elements assumed asset life and then summed across all elements to arrive at total annual capital cost 37 b41 the strengths and weaknesses of using forward looking costs the accc has valued the can at optim ised replacement cost for tslric access pricing because it was thought th at estimating tslric requires assets to be valued at their economic cost44 the forward looking nature of optimised replacement costs is argued to better capture economic costs than either backward looki ng historic costs or current costs45 this is because they reflect the ongoing efficient costs of pr oviding service which is more than firm could expect to rec over in contestable market in practice however the accc has been conservative in its approach and has based prices on the costs of building replacement network as opposed to the ongoing costs to the incumbent of providing services prices base d on this standard ar therefore thought to reflect the buildorbuy signa ls that would be created in contestable market this was thought to be important because when the regime began there was believed to be the prospect of inefficient bypass hence with regard to historic costs at the time of devel oping its access pricing principles for telecommunications the accc assumed that rapid advances in telecommunications tech nology would mean that historically incurred expenditures have little re lationship with and generally overstate the true economic costs of replicating an assets rvice potential as such it will often inflate the access price and encourage inefficient bypass46 however as chart 1 shows the costs of replacing the components of the can that make up the largest proportion of replacement costs copper cables and ducts and pipes have increased rather than decreased as was assumed would occur when the regime began information on current cost s provided by telstra to the accc under the regulatory accounting framework raf re porting requirements suggests that the current replacement cost of the can incr eased by 23 per cent rkr cic over the period 200405 to 200708 issues with this curr ent cost data are discussed in section b62 44 gans and king argue that tslric can be estimated using either forward or backward looking perspective they quote the centre for research in network economics and communications because the practise is so widespread it is often im plicitly assumed that tslric pricing must always be based on an optimised model of the network and valu ed at replacement cost of modern equivalent assets this is not correct however it would for ex ample be possible to construct tslric prices for real rather than notional

anticipates that all bts assets will be tr eated under full cca basis because entry signals are still major consideration50 although the forward looking pers pective aims to reflect mo re closely th buildorbuy signals that would be sent in contestable market the current approach has some weaknesses these will now be discussed the way in which optimised replacement costs have been annualised access prices are influenced not only by the vel of investment costs but also by how the investment costs are annualised annualisation involve s considering how investment costs will be recove red over time in particular the period of time over which the investment will be recovered ideally the useful economic life of the asset and the profile of recovery over time that is in equal amounts each year or in greater or lesser amounts in earlie r years frontloading or backloading respectively different approaches treat these considerati ons differently in regulatory context the most commonly used are straight line deprec iation and annuities in the past the accc has used an annuity approach in telecommunications because as opposed to straight line depreciation annuities simultaneously take into acc ount both depreciation and the return on capital in annualising in vestment costs and the resulting access prices bear relati onship to the vintage of the underlying infrastructure there have been both advantages and disadvantages to using an annuity approach in conjunction with optimised replacement costs under the current regulatory framework and tslric pricing model which ar discussed in the following section costrecovery and annuities when applied consistently throughout the fixed period over which costs are to be recovered the cost recovery period which would ideally be the life of the assets annuities ensure that the compensation r eceived from annual access charges in net present value terms is equal to the initial cost of investing in an asset however if an 49 ibid p 2 50 ibid 40 annuity is not applied consistently throughout the costrecovery period cost over or underrecovery can occur there are two broad types of annuities sta ndard flat annuities and tilted annuities although the net present value of the compensa tion each type of annuity allows is the same the path of cost recovery over time differs ch art 2 shows differences in the cost recovery path under both approaches for an asset with costrec overy period of ten years and an investment cost of 100 chart 2 standard and tilted annuities annual payments 1000120014001600180020002200 123456789 1 0 yearannual compensation cost forecast to rise 4 per year change in costs cost forecast to fall 4 per year standard annuity recovers the investment cost in equal annual sums in this example of around 16 per year over the cost recovery period51 in contrast tilted annuities take into account expected changes in asset prices if asse t prices are expected to fall the annuity is tilted so that more costrecovery is allowed earlier on in the cost recovery period frontloading if asset prices are expected to rise more cost recovery is allowed later in the cost recovery period backloading as chart 2 shows the annual compensation access price changes over consistent with changes in the replacement value of the asset for example an annuity with tilt of 4 per cent implies that asset prices are expected to fall by 4 per cent for each year of the assets life it provides the same net present value of compensation as standard annuity that is the areas under each curve in chart 1 are the same but that compensation starts higher and falls by 4 per cent each year the reverse is true of positively tilted annuity when the accc commenced regulating lecommunications assets there was general assumption that telecommunications sset prices would fall over time in light 51 in the beginning of an assets life this sum will consist of more return on capital and less depreciation over time th increase in the depreciation charge ex actly counterbalances the decrease in the capital charge resulting in cons tant access price over the period 41 of that assumption the accc has accepted tilted annuity pproach in principle this addresses the potential for assets to be valued at the time of new price review by allowing frontloading of cost recovery it also more closely approximates the cost recovery that would occur in potentially contestable ma rket than other methods of annualisation in such markets if asset prices are falling later entrants should always be able to undercut the incumbent the in cumbent would therefore only invest if they could recover higher proportion of costs in early periods since they know they will have less cost recovery in the later periods52 conversely where asse t prices are rising later entrants will not be able to undercut th incumbent rather they will only be able to enter at higher price all else being equal current incumbent could therefore compete by lowering its retail prices now knowi ng that it can get greater cost recovery later53 in practice despite rising replacement costs telstra has not sought to compete in this manner perhaps highlighting the aggr essive price competition or threat of that would be required for an incumbent to lower its prices now one analyst report suggests that the average price discount required before consumer will consider changing fixed line telco provider is 27 per cent54 if correct this provides telstra with 25 30 per cent price premium sugge sting price competiti on in the fixed line retail market is not pa rticularly aggressive as noted applying the annuity consistently over the cost r ecovery period ensures that there is under or overrecovery of investme nt costs by contrast chart 3 shows that if the annuitys tilt is increased from 4 to 5 per cent midway through the cost recovery period the net present value of the an nual compensation earned over the period exceeds the net present value of the cost of the investment the areas under both curves in the chart are not the same 52 mja comments on the tslric model for declared transmission services

regulatory framework the accc cannot make single determination that fixes the path of access prices over fixed costrecovery period rather at each pricing determina tion the optimised replacement cost is recalculated the tilt of th annuity can be changed nd the access price for that determination is set with reference to the investment costs the annuity attributes to year one the approach is labour intens ive and impacts upon investment certainty further under the current regulatory regime the only way in which under or over recovery is avoided is if the actual change in replacement costs between pricing determination one and pricing determination two matches the change that was forecast in pricing determination one despite the recalculation of investment costs at pricing determination two the resulting pri ce path and overall net present value of compensation is the same as if the price path was set for the whole cost recovery period in this circumstance recalculation doe s not lead to over or underrecovery of investment costs on the other hand if the actual change in replacement costs that occurs from pricing determination one to pr icing determination two differs from the change in replacement costs that was forecast and reflected in the tilt of the annuity at pricing determination one investment costs may be over or underrecovered chart 4 shows the difference between

calculated price chart 4 shows that from year one to year two the actual change in the replacement cost of the asset matched that which was forecast and reflected in the lt of the annuity in year one the price path follows that which w ould have occurred had prices been set in single determination for the whole of the assets life in contrast from years two to three the ac tual change in the replacement cost of the asset was greater than forecast and reflected in the tilt of the annuity at the year two pricing determination revaluing the asset in year three and changing the tilt of the annuity to reflect the new forecast change in replacement costs changes the path of the annuity this changes the net present value of the annuity payments that will be recovered such that they longer reflect the net present value of the payments that were expected at the time the investment wa s made in year one the same occurs from year six to year seven but this time the actual increase in replacement costs was less than that forecast if the actual increase in replacement costs is consistently higher than forecast th original costs of investing in the asset will be underrecovered on the other hand if the actual increase in replacement costs is consistently lower than forecast the orig inal costs of investing in the asset will be overrecovered on the one hand if forecasts of changes in re placement costs turn out to be incorrect periodically correcting for thes errors might ensure that nduser prices better reflect the true replacement cost of the assets over time in turn possibly improving allocative efficiency on the other hand correcting for errors in replacement cost forecasts may be at the expense of dynamic efficiency in the sense that any subsequent over or under recovery of the initial investment co st could distort investment decisions because the current telecommunications regul atory regime allows access providers to put forward access pricing proposals that can only be deemed reasonable or not 44 reasonable proposals that assume that ne w network valued at optimised replacement cost is built at each pricing determination are not priori considered unreasonable consequence of this however is that ther is predefined fixed period over which investment costs are to be recovered the cost recovery period is in effect never ending access prices therefore bear rela tionship to the proportion of investment costs that have already been recovered this has important implications for cost recovery as the next section discusses costrecovery and asset lives it is important to distinguish between two types of depreciation accounting and economic depreciation accounting depreciation deals with the allocation of investment costs over period of time whic h is typically an assumed sset life or book life on the other hand economic depreciation is the periodbyperiod change in the market value of an asset or the dec line in earning power of the sset over perio d it therefore involves process of assessing changes in an assets value over where the assets value is determined using valuebased pproach to asset valu ation the profile of economic depreciation over time therefore depends on changes in technology trends in capital equipment prices and trends in the productivity of new capital assets the future pattern of output the pattern of operating cost s over the assets life and the cost of capital as it directly affects the value of the asset55 under some circumstances accounting preciation and economic depreciation are equivalent for example when there is regulated market with competition in which the regulator commits to full capital recovery over the assets lives tha t is the regulator commits to zero net present value for the firms total investment or competitive market with longterm cont racts as long as the contract amount fully recovers the initial capital investment and the contract period is equal to the asset life56 in general however accounting depreciati on does not reflect economic depreciation in regulatory context ec onomic depreciation is the most theoretically correct method of depreciation however it is based on mark etbased assessment of the assets value which as noted is not the approach typical ly used by regulators to value sunk assets estimating how this value will change over time requires that number of assumptions are made about various parameters the certainties and impracticalities surrounding 55 nera estimating the long run incremental cost of pstn access final report for

of the assets book asset lives are likely to be shor ter than economic asset lives due to conservative accounting practices we have reviewed the values used and have number of concerns with the figures adopted58 pie ii was put forward by telstra from 2003 til late 2007 as model for determining forward looking efficient ulls access prices with respect to the telstra efficient access tea model which telstra has put forward as forward looking efficient cost model for determining band 2 ulls acce ss prices since late 2007 also discussed below ovum consulting note that lower asset lives mean that assets are re placed earlier than the actual or historical replacement date and therefore the calculated monthl ulls cost in the tea model is higher if the modelled asset lives in the tea model are repl aced with the actual repo rted asset lives then the ulls monthly charge decreases by 2 3the asset lives should be revalued to their economic lives the period of time during which an asset is usable following this principlethe asset lives could be further extended at least in the case for copper cables in the case of longer asset lives the calculated monthl ulls cost in the tea model will decrease59 furthermore telstra chairman dona ld mcgauchie noted in his speech its time to get serious about australias next generation network that by the early part of this century over 30 per cent of the copper pairs in the australian network were more than 30 years old with more than 5 per cent predating 195060 in contrast both the tea and the pie ii mode ls assume that copper main cabling has

investment costs over the life of can assets such as those assumed in pie ii are shorter than the useful life of the asse ts as such the full costs of investment in can assets are likely to ve been recovered even though the assets are still being used depending on the pricing and regulatory regime this raises the potential for end users to be charged more than once for assets wher the full costs of inve stment have already been passed on to them it is possible for this to occur under th current regulatory regime as explained below if investment costs have been fully recove red and the regulated asset continues to be used access prices that only reflect the ma rginal costs of operating the asset would ensure that access seekers and ultimately nd users are not charged more than once for the costs of past investment this could crea incentives for new i nvestment to occur and for efficient use of the existing infrastruc ture if the asset is replaced once the costs of investing in it are recovere d access prices should reflect the costs of investing in the replacement asset however the current regime in assuming th at new asset is constructed at each pricing determination allows for the costs of replacement asset to be reflected in access prices without requiring th at investment in the replacement asset to actually take place hence the access provider is able to be overcompensated on their existing assets and be paid to replace assets which it does not actually replace dr tony warren telstras general manager of regulatory affairs has effectively acknowledged as much as i was saying the tslric models bear resemblance to actual cost they are hypothetical cost models what that means is that the model is act ually already optimised so the cost pool out of which access prices are determin ed is already in place and in fact is already almost fttn network what that means is that we could spend multi ple billions of dollars doing fttn rollout multiple billions and the total cost p ool we are allowed to recover from wholesale and retail prices would not go up jot61 therefore there is little incentive for the incumbent to replace an asset that has been fully paid for under the acccs current cons ervative approach to access pricing it is able to charge the access prices it would earn as if it replaced the asset without actually having to make the investment linking access prices to the pr oportion of investment costs that have been recovered for example by basing access prices on deprec iated asset values would ensure that the investment costs of existing assets are not passed on to end users multiple times by basing access prices on an undepreciated valu only when investment actually takes place greater incentives to invest in replacement assets are created of note in its regulatory submission to th expert panel telstra note that in non remote rural areas much of their asset base is written down that is partially depreciated or written off t hat is is fully depreciated62 information on historic costs provided by telstra to the accc under the raf reporting requirements suggest that 61 t warren senate ecita committee 13 february 2006

rkr cic the gross historic cost of fixed can asse ts is around 17 billion rkr cic whilst their net value is around 8 billion rkr cic it appears th at around 58 per cent rkr cic of the historic value of copper cables has been depreciated in addition 40 per cent rkr cic of the va lue of ducts and pipes 64 per cent rkr cic of the value of pair gain systems and 72 per cent rkr cic of the value of radio bearer equipment have been depreciated linking access prices to deprec iated asset values may creat concerns over large jumps in prices when assets are actually replaced fo r example assume that an asset cost 100 to build has useful life of ten years has b een depreciated on stra ight line basis over this period and its replacement cost is not changing in the st year of the assets life the access price would be based on net d epreciated value of 10 in the following year when that asset is replaced the access pr ice would be based on gross yet to be depreciated value of 100 there may ther efore be large an d sudden increase in access prices however investment in the c an takes place on an incremental basis for example the incumbent does not repl ace all copper wires on an instantaneous basis rather it replaces the assets progressively over time price shocks may be less of concern the less lumpy investment is the subjectivity involved in esti mating optimised replacement costs number of models have been develope d since the telecommunications regime was implemented that estimate the costs of pr oviding access services the nera model pie i pie ii the tea model and the anal ysys model typically the models employ engineering data to develop bottomup estimate of the cost of building replacement network elements associated with particular services this cost is then annualised and combined with other annual costs such as operational and maintenance and indirect costs then allocated across relevant serv ices to determine access prices for the relevant service these cost models have been the subj ect of considerable debate since the telecommunications access regime commence d this is because the output of any bottomup cost model relies on how the large range of inputs to the model are manipulated for example as the replacement costs generated by the models are based on wide range of varying assumptions for example regarding optimisation technology deployed etc it is not surprising to see reason able differences between estimates of replacement costs furthermore the assumptions made in converting these costs into annual investment costs for example regarding asset lives depreciation asset price trends and the wacc lead to wi range of estimates of annual costs whilst it is typically proposed that t he models are tslric models all models are actually total element long run in cremental cost telric models telric are the incremental or additional costs firm incurs in the long run to provide network element as opposed to service the starting point for estimating telric is to consider an elementbyelement breakdown of the network and then to price individual elem ents on the basis of the cost of the individual element and the tra ffic flow across that element63 the approach 63 gans king comparing tslric and telric report on behalf of aapt ltd core research 2003 48 therefore prices discrete network elements such as the unbundled local loop rather than services it has been noted that there may be risk s in using the telric approach to proxy an estimate of tslric64 too much fixed and common cost could be allocated to regulated services if the cost of certain network elements is wholly or in large part allocated to the regulated service despite this element also being used for the production of other services which are disr egarded the problem doe s not arise if the model models network that carries all the traffic that the operator would offer and allocates the costs of network elem ents to all services using them65 telric models are used to proxy tslric as the former are computationally mo re manageable and have generally been seen to genera reasonable estimate of tslric the first generation of cost models incl ude the nera model and pie i the nera model was commissioned by the accc and developed by nera in 1998 to estimate the tslric of providing do mestic pstn ota services 66 the model is based on the cost of rebuilding networ k using modern equipment to provide the existing grade of pstn ota service this cost is annualis ed using an annuity formula the nera model assumes the network is operated efficiently within the existing archite cture and node locations the network is dimensione d to carry telstras traffic for 199798 pie i was put forward in 1999 by telstra in pport of its pstn ta arbitration with aapt telstra claimed the model was supe rior bottomup tslric model of building and operating the pstn network to the nera model the network is proposed to be built using best in use technology and is scorched node network using the number and location of local access switches that existed at that time in telstr as pstn67 investment costs are annualised using standard annuity

cons idered optimised replacement cost to be the presentday cost of repl acing the asset with another asset that provides the same service potential77 the mea concept assumes that the replacemen t asset does not provide superior grade of service in cases where the mea provides additional functionality capacity or quality adjustments are made for these di fferences so that only the level of functionality which is reflected in the existing asset is taken into account78 for example assume that an operator has an in stalled asset which can service x number of lines if the operator were to replace the sset today it would acquire an asset costing c which would be able to service x20 number of lines thus the cost of the mea with the same service potential as the existing asset would be c 1279 this would reflect the fact that the exis ting asset provides less capacity in terms of lines serviced than the new asset 77 accc access pricing principles in telecommunications guide 1997 p 41 78 accc current cost accounting methodology for telstras subsequent reports under the accounting separation regime 2004 79 ibid 52 the optimised replacement cost of the can has most recently been estimated in the context of it being infrastructure that is us ed to provide the ulls because this service is defined as being provisioned over uncondi tioned copper facilities it has been assumed that the network is comprised of unconditioned copper facilities fibre has not been assumed to be mea because the acc ess service provided over fibre bitstream is different to the ulls when estimating the optimised replacement cost of the can in the context of it being infrastructure that is used to provide generic access s ervice however the technology assumed to be deployed should arguably be fibre to the extent that fibre provides addi tional functionality to copper its cost would be adjusted downwards as discussed in the preceding paragraph assumptions about the technology deployed ma have implications for investment incentives indeed one of the reasons for using optimised replacement costs was that they were thought to create incentives for the incumbent to provide services in the most efficient way possible for example by using best in use technology as they would be unable to charge access pri ces that would cover the co sts of using inefficient technology80 in theory if regulated service is priced on the basis of the legacy technology but could be provi ded at lower cost usi ng different technology the incumbent would want to invest in this ternative technology to improve efficiency however if regulated prices are based on the costs of providing the service as soon as the access provider invests in the new technology the prices they are allowed to charge will decrease relative to those they are able to charge using the legacy technology this may remove the incentive to inve st in the different technology incentives to invest in the different technology may be furt her reduced if it provides greater service potentia l than the legacy t echnology for example assume that it costs the same amount to build and operate copper network and fibre network both networks can provide medium speed access service but the fibre network can also provide high speed service if access pric are costbased the access provider could build the fibre network and charge higher pr ices for the high speed service and lower prices for the medium speed service relative to the price of c opperbased medium speed service however the overall revenues that the access provider can earn are the same for both networkstechnologies because they cost the same to build and operate if fibre network cost less to build andor operate than copper network the overall revenues the access provider could earn if they built fibre network would be less than if they built copper network despite the fi bre network being able to offer superior grade of service hence the incentive to invest in the new technology may be reduced because under the current approach the regula ted revenues that can be earned fall once the investment is undertaken b5 what approach does the accc adopt in other industries the accc and other regulatory agencies have engaged in the process of valuing sunk assets in number of contexts outside of the communications industry particularly in the gas and electricity sector s these valuation exercises were often conducted in the 1990s as state governments across the country pr ivatised assets this section provides summary of the approaches taken to valuing sunk assets in these sectors following brief overview of the building block pricing model that these valuations feed into 80 accc op cit 53 b51 the energy sector building block model and historic costs the common approach to setting the ma ximum allowable revenue mar of regulated firm in the energy sector is descri bed as the building block model it basically sets maximum allowable revenue sufficient to recover the operating and capital costs of the service provider over time th is model is defined by two equations mar t wacc81rab t1 depreciation t opex82 t where rab the regulated asset base is defined over time as rab t rab t1 capex83 t depreciation t this formulation of the rab over time is scribed as the asset base roll forward equation notably the rab is not recalculate d or optimised in ea ch regulatory period the rab in the current period is simply the rab in the previous period adjusted for capital expenditure capex nd depreciation this roll forwar d method is seen to have number of advantages including that it promotes certainty re lating to the possibility of continual rab revaluation and that it improves regulatory fficiency as the rab does not need to be continually recalculated in each regulatory period for these reasons it is sometimes described as setandforget approach although currently the rab is not revalued or optimised in each period it would be possible to do so under the bbm however as discussed below in electricity whilst the regulatory regime initially permitted re valuations more recently the potential for reoptimisation of the asset base was removed and in gas revaluations have never been permitted this is largely due to the uncer tainty created by revaluations and the subsequent negative effects on investment sunk assets in the energy sector were va lued by the accc or state based regulatory authorities as part of the asset privatisati on process in the 1990s these state regulatory bodies included the office of the regulat or general org in victoria and the independent pricing and regul atory tribunal ipart in ns w as these valuations were being done at roughly the same time with respect to assets with similar economic properties the approach taken to the valuat ion of both electricity and gas assets was generally consistent where the acccaustralian energy regulator aer took regulat ory authority over some or all of these services it inherited th asset valuations that had been conducted by state regulatory agencies these valuations became the initial regulated asset base rab 1 in the building block equation in both gas and electricity the respective i ndustry codes now law set out valuation methodologies directing the re gulator to use specific methodologies however the acccaer has only engaged in the process of valuing sunk assets with respect to those assets which were not c overed by the relevant code prior to the time that the asset came under the acccaers regulatory authority 81 weighted average cost of capital wacc 82 operational expenditure opex in the regulatory period 83 capital expenditure capex 54 in order to facilitate thir d party access in the gas indus try regulators including the accc and statebased agencies during the 1990s undertook oneoff valuations of regulated gas pipelines in or der to establish an initial rab these valuations were largely governed by the national gas code the code or der identical or substantially similar provis ions the code was highly pr escriptive in its valuation mechanism under the code the regulators effectivel faced choice between depreciated actual cost dac and depreciated optimised re placement cost dorc notably in contrast with the way in which the tslric model is applied in telecommunications both approaches use depreciated asset values this perhaps explains why access providers in telecomm unications have consistently proposed models that assume new network is built at each pricing determination the only other recognised valuation methodology that appears to have been considered was deprival value dv which would have require d an assessment of the full value that the asset owner could expect to extract from owne rship of the asset however as the value of the asset is intrinsically linked to the regulatory valuation pro cess this method was seen to suffer from an unavoidable problem of circularity in ddition this valuation would likely have resulted in significant in creases in tariffs which may have been inconsistent with parts of the code and va rious policy positions of state governments that users would not experience incr eased prices following privatisation the valuation of electricity assets was largely governed by various statebased regulations as the national electricity code nec did not specify valuation method for assets that were priva tised prior to 1 july 1999 th valuation methodology that is specified in the nec for post1 july 1999 assets is deprival value however this appears to have been treated as dorc by the rele vant regulators and asset owners state regulators appear to have had choice around limited t hough well recognised valuation methodologies although as with gas the c hoice was generally presented as between dac and dorc ultimately valuations based on dorc were accepted though the full dorc value was often discounted to avoid tariff shocks or due to idiosyncratic factors for example ipart discounted the initial capital base for agl at around 80 per cent of dorc or roughly the midpoint between dorc and da c based on reservations about the methodology consistent with the nec requirements the acccs statement of regulatory principles84 indicated that the acccs preferred approach to asset valuation was to lock in the rab however in recognition that the nec pr ovided for asset revaluation the accc stated that it would consider pr oposed revaluation on its merits if proposed by transmission network service provider tnsp in 2005 new national electricity laws and rules took effect which replaced the nec and further amendments were made in 2006 and 2007 these new provisions removed the need for dorc valuations or reoptimis ation of the asset base in particular schedules 621 and 6a21 of the national ectricity rules ner set out the rab values to be applied by the aer to distri bution network service providers dnsps and 84 aer statement of principles for the regulation of electricity transmission revenues 2004 55 tnsps respectively which were based on t hose previously set by regulators the values set out in the schedule can be adju sted by actual capex in curred since the rab value was determined less economic depreciation and disposals the approach taken by the accc and other state regulators to th valuation of sunk rail assets has also generally been based on dorc methodology constructing dorc from orc traditionally dorc has been estimated by ad justing optimised replacement costs for accumulated depreciation so if 50 per cent of historic costs have been written down 50 per cent of the optimised replacement co st is also written down however dorc can also be estimated using economic depr eciation the approach taken affects the depreciated value as noted book lives are often shorter than economic lives if optimised replacement costs are depreciated by taking into consideration the remaini ng useful life of the asset rather than the remaining years of its book life the depreciation profile applied to optimised replacement costs will be different to the depreciation profile applied to the corresponding historic costs for exampl the productivity commission note that an asset might have nominal expected life of 25 years when it was built but with minor maintenance and modification may turn out to last 50 years at say ye ar 20 dac depreciated actual cost value will be low since the asset will be preciated by 80 per cent however dorc valuation conducted at this time would be based on an engineering as sessment of the asset with remaining life of 30 years85 so whereas the depreciated hist oric cost value assumes 80 pe r cent of the assets life has been used up the dorc value assumes only 40 per cent of the assets life has been used up all else equal dorc will therefore be higher than depreciated historic costs an approach to economic depreciation that has recently been debated the net present value dorc approach constructs dorc as the net present value of the future income from the asset where the income is consistent with the prices that would be charged by an efficient new entrant and recognising that the income stream for the dorc valuation will have life equal to the remaining life of the existing assets that life being less than the life of the new entrants assets86 the value of the new entrants assets is optimised replacement cost the access price and revenue stream in each year of this as sets life is determined using an annuity the dorc value for the existing asset is then determined as the net present value of the first x years of the new asset s revenue stream where x is the remaining life of the existing asset87 so if the new entrants revenue st ream is constant and the remaining 85 productivity commission review of the national access regime 2002 86 agility management the construction of dorc from orc 2000 87 ibid 56 life of the existing asset is 30 years the dorc is the net present value of the first 30 years of the hypothetical ne w entrants net income of note when considering the approach taken for gas networks the high court recently upheld the australian competition trib unals decision to reject the straight line depreciation approach for deriving the dorc from the orc in favour of the npv dorc approach88 b52 strengths and weaknesses of the pproach taken in other industries the opening rab in these industries was t based on forward looking approach to asset valuation dorc and additions to th asset base are valued at actual cost which as noted at the point in time at wh ich it is added is the same as optimised replacement cost in subsequent regulatory pe riods these additions to the asset base are not revalued but rather are valued at th eir historic cost ss depreciation historic costs are backward looking in that they reflect the costs the incumbent actually incurred in building the asset they theref ore provide return to the access provider independent of the quality of their inve stment decisions there may therefore be concerns that the approach does not enc ourage efficient investment however the general approach in the energy sector has b een to permit any actual capex to be added to the rab in the period following the expendi ture subject to some form of check on incurred expenditure to ensure it is pr udent the aer is currently moving towards system whereby forecast capital expenditure will be approved as being reasonable at the start of the regulatory period for the dur ation of that period this is aimed at improving investment certainty and reducing re gulatory issues associated with denying past capital expenditure on the basis of post hoc dete rmination that the expenditure was unreasonable furthermore investment in telecommunica tions networks is t ypically ongoing for example the access provider does not replace all the copper wires on the can at once rather it does so on an incremental basis ove r time therefore for certain proportion of its asset base the access provi der will always face the same actual investment costs as would be estimated using forward looking perspective the rab rollforward approach arguably re moves the uncertainty caused by the re optimisation associated with the curren t telecommunications access pricing model debate over an appropriate value for sunk asse ts takes place only at the establishment of the opening regulatory asset base rather than at each pricing determination these features may improve regulatory efficiency in contrast to the current approach in lecommunications this approach links access prices to cost recovery which reduces th likelihood of end user s being charge more than once for the same asset and the opport unities for investment cost overrecovery 88 east australian pipeline limited v accc anor 2007 hca 44 57 b6 what are the options

of these asse ts if the value of the redundant assets were reflected in the asset base dynamic efficiency would be harmed as any new investment would only be made if it can recover not only its own costs but also the cost of components it displaces on the other hand in regulatory c ontext if this resulted in valuations far below those used at privatis ation this could be consider ed to represent expropriation the credibility of the regulatory system c ould be undermined along with the industrys ability to raise finance for future investment90 b62 measuring historic and current costs as discussed number of models have b een developed since the commencement of the regulatory regime that provide estimates of optimised replacement costs and there are number of issues to take into account when using these estimates to value the can if dorc approach was preferred these issues would still need to be considered as the starting point for dorc is optimised replacement costs but with adjustments for depreciation however just as there are different appr oaches and judgements required regarding forward looking values of assets there can also be for histor ic and current costs

to note that the adoption of this approach should not be construed as the accc endorsing it as r obust basis for estimating current costs93 telstras asset register does not identify some fixed asset

ducts and pipes is roughly four times rkr cic more than their historic cost whilst for example the gross current replacement cost of copper cables is only roughly twice rkr cic that of their historic costs this is likely to be because each of the asset categories is ad justed using different composite price index the composition of the index for an asset category depends on what proportion of the costs of i nvesting in that asse t is driven by labour and what proportion is driven by materials in addition labour and materials costs are measured using different data sets for differe nt asset

cost figures in table 3 according to the model the optimised replacement costs of ducts and pipes and copper cables are more than their historic costs this could be because the model assumes there has been little technological improvement or optimisation in these asset categories since they were originally built and hence little room for costs to be optimised out andor the costs of investing in these assets for example labour and materials costs have risen since they were first built95 in theory the gross current cost measures should be higher than the optimised replacement costs because current costs are based on the existing technology and capital equipment and not the capital th at would actually be efficiently deployed however the optimised replacement costs of for example copper cable generated by pie ii are higher than the current cost this could be because pie ii assumes that prices for copper cable are higher than implied by th price index applied to historic costs to generate current costs it could also be th at pie ii assumes the same amount of or not much less copper cable is used on an optim ised network than on the existing network on the other hand pie iis

the network and where and the number and geographic distribution of services in operation as such it is reasonabl to expect that each model will arrive at different values for the can b64 the effect of changing valuation approach over time if valuation methodol ogy for example forward l ooking approach is not applied consistently over the cost rec overy period which as noted w ould ideally be the life of the asset the asset owner could under or overrecover the costs of investing in the asset unless the valuation approach itself is causing cost over or underrecovery in which case changing it could correct this when changing valuation methodologies it is therefore important to consider whether the change will lead to upward or downward revaluation of the asset and subsequently cost over or underr ecovery assuming the existing method is not already causing this and how this will be counteracted if desired96 for example consequence of having valued the existing network at the commencement of the regulatory regime at the optimised replacement cost of brand new network is that the past decline in the value of the existing assets was not taken into account these assets were attributed value th at assumed they were at the start of their useful lives rather than part way th rough them which means that they would have been upwardly revalued as discussed this was observed in of coms switching between hca and cca for valuing bts core fixed line network asse ts the value of bts pre1997 asset base increased with the shift to cca97 in 2005 given that facilitiesbased competition had 96 the extent of the re or devaluation will in part depend upon how l ong has passed since the asset was invested in and therefore the difference between its historic costs and its current or optimised replacement cost as noted in bundle of assets such as the can this will be different for each individual asset within the bundle the overall effect on the bund is likely to be less the higher the proportion of new assetslower the proportion of old assets 97 ofcom 2005 63 not emerged ofcom concluded that bt had been earning return above cost on these assets as result of the revaluation98 chart 5 shows the annual compensation ove r an assets life under both hca and cca assuming the asset is subject to straight line depreciation over its useful economic life constant increase in replacement cost nd constant cost of capital although the cost recovery paths are different if the total compensation under each approach was converted to net present value that is di scounted at the cost of capital they would be equal99 chart 5 gross margins required for constant cost of capital over the lifetime of single asset experiencing appreciation in value source ofcom valuing copper access final statement 2005 more cost recovery occurs ear lier under the hca approach while the recovery of costs from cca approach is great er later in the assets life accordingly change from setting cost recovery based on hca in the early period to cca in the later period at any point during the life of the asset would result in an overrecovery of costs the inverse is also true if the current replacement cost of the asset decreases over time if the cca curve in the above chart were downward sloping then underrecovery or loss would result from changing from hca to cca100 therefore if the approach to valuing the can is changed with the nbn upgrade it will need to be considered whether this will lead to an up or downward revaluation of the can and whether or not it is desi rable to make adjustments for this b7 conclusion different approaches can be used to value the can each of which will have different effects on costrecovery investment and nduser prices when considering which approach to use it is important that it is consistent with the specific objective of the regulatory regime that will apply to the nbn of the two broad approaches value 98 ibid 99 ibid 100 ibid 64 based or costbased costbased approach is pref erred if the objective of the regulatory regime is costrecovery there are several costbased approaches that could be used hi storicactual costs depreciated historic costs current replacement costs depr eciated current replacement costs optimised replacement costs and preciated optimised replacement costs broadly replacement cost approaches are f orward looking whilst historic costs are backward looking any replacement cost approach should take into account current market conditions and input prices for example copper prices wages etc for example replacement cost approaches to valuing the can are greatly in fluenced by changes in copper prices in particular because copper cabling is hi gh proportion of can investment costs although over the last ten years these have b een rising more recently they have begun to fall the forward looking perspective is argued to reflect contestable market outcomes in terms of efficient buildorbuy signals and infrastructure use incentives however it also creates uncertainty as to whether th access provider will under or overrecover the costs of their investment which may in turn deter future investment and encourage overuse of the asset or encourage overinv estment and underuse of the infrastructure respectively given that the costs of the largest components of can investment costs ducts and pipes and copper cabling have generally been rising and ther has been little technological advance in the ar ea of duct and pipe infrastructure it seems unlikely that an access seeker will build replacement can the buildorbuy signal may therefore be less paramount concern in deciding on the asset valuation approach to take the backward looking perspective historicact ual costs provides more certainty with regard to investment cost recovery but ma not create the build orbuy signals that contestable market would comparing the pricing models and the approach to asset valuation in the telecommunications sector nd other industries regulated by the accc highlights that the approach to asset valuation and the dopted pricing model are inextricably linked the approach used to value the can cannot be considered in isolation of the pricing model that will apply to the nbn changing pricing approaches requires an assessment of whether the current asse t valuation methodology remain s appropriate in order to ensure that cost recovery is facilitated number of features of the way in which the tslric pricing framework is currently applied create uncertainty as to whether inve stment costs will be recovered alternative pricing models such as the building bl ock model used by the australian energy regulator in the gas and electricity in dustries may reduce number of these uncertainties over time if such setandforget appro ach is considered desirable for the nbn it is likely that policy or regulatory decision will need to be made about the level of the opening asset base this will need to be locked in contractually between government and the nbn provider andor through legislative change to the telecommunications access regime to 65 broaden the scope of regulate d pricing to encompass the whole nbn facility this may also necessitate directing the accc to either adopt or follow contractually determined or prescribed approach to valu ing and rolling forward value for the nbn in the nbn context the chosen level of th opening asset base the value of existing sunk assets that will be used on the nb n and decisions made around the treatment of depreciation and future capital expend iture on new nbn assets and can assets when they need to be replaced will have fundamental consequences for the incentives for proponent to accept the openi ng asset base and incentives to undertake timely and efficient upgrades to the nbn in future 66 appendix c cost of capital c1 executive summary if the proponent awarded the nbn tender is subject to cost based regulation it should be allowed to recover regulated co st of capital as it is an economic cost incurred in operating any cap ital intensive business the cost of capital is the opportunity cost of the debt and equity funds used to finance the investments of firm it is the return that the firm forgoes by not investing in the next best alternative investment altern atively it can be thought of as the return the firm must offer an invest or to induce it to invest in the firm firms that are subject to costbased access regul ation are allowed to recover regulated cost of capital in regulated access prices r regulated revenues if regulated firms were unable to recover these costs they may be unwilling to invest in regulated assets and investors may be unwilling to invest in regulated firms the return an investment will earn reflects th risk associated with that investment as such the regulated cost of capital s hould reflect the risks associated with the regulated assets in question including th risks imposed or alleviated by the regulatory regime itself re gulated cost of capital that exceeds is less than the normal return in the market earned by inve stments of similar risk will encourage too much too little investment and an access price greater low er than the true economic costs of providing the service in practice because of the limited number of ways the cost of capital can be estimated the regulated cost of capital is of ten determined with reference to the risks and returns associated with similar regulated and unregulated assets and firms therefore determining the regulated cost of capital is very c ontentious process the regulated cost of capital that firm is allowed to include as component of its regulated assets access pricesrevenues will t necessarily equal the overall rate of return the firm earns in the market at any gi ven point in time particularly if the firm owns both regulated and unregulated assets nonetheless the regulated cost of capital does affect the firms actual overall rate of return in the market particularly in capital intensive industries such as telecommunications determining the regulated cost of capital is theref ore also very important process the accc measures the cost of capital usi ng the weighted average cost of capital wacc there are number of parameters that are inputs to estimating the wacc over which there has been considerable deba in the past in telecommunications and other regulated industries the acccs approach to the wacc is to maximise regulatory certainty for industry participants with regard to the co st of capital that will be allowed in regulatory decisions in light of this goal the accc considers the approach it has taken in the past to estimating the wacc parameters to be reasonably settled as such for some parameters the debt be ta the market risk premium gamma and 67 the tax rate it also considers the determination of their values to be relatively uncontroversial in assessing nbn propos als these parameters should be less contentious than others on the other hand although the acccs appr oach to estimating value for wacc parameters is generally uncontentious the va lues that the approach derives for some nbn wacc parameters the equity and asset betas the risk free rate the debt risk premium and gearing ratios will depend on the specifics of the nbn proposal that is accepted and as such may differ from the values currently applied for telstra and the copper network these parameters will be more contentious any difference in the value of these parameters with the nbn upgrade should reflect differences in risk associated with the particular proposal relative to the risks associated with investment in the copper ne twork differences in risk associated with the financial structure of th particular proposal and the degree to which risks are borne by the proponent or government the differences should also reflect changes in general financial market conditions ce previous regulatory decisions and fttx discussions it is likely that the equity and asset betas will be the most contentious parameters in assessing nbn proposals this is because th ey are affected by both general financial market conditions and the specifics of th proposal in question and because they have large effect on the overall wacc how the governments contribution is treated is also likely to be contentious adjustments to the wacc to account for asymmetric social outcomes asymmetric risk and real options have been proposed in the past and it seems likely that they will be proposed in the nbn context whilst the accc is yet to be convinced by the merits of arguments in favour of any these adjustments the accc strongly reaffirms that arguments surrounding asymmetric risk ie that certain applications of regulation penaliseexpropriate above normal returns but do not compensate for below normal returns are theoretical and do not represent re gulatory practice as applied in telecommunications or other industrie s regulated by the accc the accc does not consider that there should be practical risk of truncation regimes can be designed in such way as to ensure that it does not arise social outcomes ie because the soci consequences of underestimating the wacc are of much greater importance than the social effects of overestimating it the wacc should be adjusted upwards are as yet unsupported by empirical investigation and evidence arbitrary wacc adjustments are thus inappropriate it is also important to bear in mind that real world nbn returns will be affected not only by the regulated cost of capital but by several other real world considerations in particular if the value attributed to the existing sunk network the customer access network for access pricing purposes is increased decreased this could potentially offer telstra si gnificant increase decrease in the actual return they 68 earn from existing assets re gardless of whether or not they are awarded the nbn tender 69 c2 introduction the cost of capital is the opportunity cost of the debt and equity funds used to finance the operations of firm101 the cost of capital for the proponent awarded the national broadband network nbn tender is thus the op portunity cost of the debt and equity funds used to finance the nbn investment it is the rate of return th at those investing in the project require to induce them to either lend funds or purchase equity as it is legitimate cost incurred in running business if the nbn operator is regulated by costbased regulat ion it should be allowed to re cover the cost of capital in its regulated revenues importantly though the cost of capital that is allowed to be recovered is regulated rate of return on set of regulat ed assets this rate of return may or may not be equal to th rate of return the firm actually earns across all its businesses regulated and unregulated at any point in time in particular if the value attributed to the existing sunk network t he customer access network or can for access pricing purposes is increased decreased this potentially offers telstra significant increase decrease in the actual re turns they will earn from existing assets regardless of whether or not they are awarded the nbn tender in capital intensive industries such as tele communications the regulated cost of capital is an important component of access prices small changes to the cost of capital can have significant impact on the total reve nue requirement and ultimately end user prices and level of investment cost of capital that exceeds the normal commercial return in the market earned by investments of similar risk will give investors return above that they actually require to induce th em to make the nbn investment and lead to an access price greater than the economi c costs of providing nbn services on the other hand cost of capital below the normal commercial return will prevent regulated firm from gaining legitimate return on their investment and so may not induce funds to be supplied for the nbn investment this is recognised in the request for proposal s rfp where it is stat ed that one of the governments objectives for the nbn is that it enables low access prices that reflect underlyi ng costs while allowing proponents to earn rate of return on their investment commensurate with the risk of the p roject102 furthermore proponents are asked to explain the basis on which they have derived the cost of capital inc luding how investment risks have been calculated103 firms cost of capital can be expressed on number of different bases therefore number of different figures can be used to represent effectively the same underlying cost of capital it is therefore important to ensure that consistent definitions and bases are being used prior to compar ing different cost of capital fi gures for example rates of return can be stated on preta x or posttax basis in real or nominal terms and as rate of return on equity debt or weighted average of both 101 opportunity cost is the amount lost by not using resource in its be st alternative use 102 rfp overview 13111 103 ibid 1517 70 in telecommunications the accc consistently discusses the cost of capital in its regulatory decisions on what is known as nominal vanilla weight ed average cost of capital wacc basis the nominal vanilla wacc is the cost of capital weighted by the total funding proportions of debt and equ ity stated in nominal terms and with the cost of debt stated on pre tax basis and the cost of quity on posttax basis the vanilla wacc is used because it is legislat ed that the australian energy regulator aer use vanilla wacc hence for regul atory certainty vanilla wacc is also used in other areas regulated by the accc104 c3 wacc parameters this section shows the formulae that are us ed for calculating the wacc and discusses each of the parameters that are inputs to the wacc c31 wacc formulae the formula for calculating the vanilla wacc is where vd the ratio of debt value to the firms to tal value that is its debt plus its equity ve the ratio of equity value to the firms total value dr the required return on debt er the required post company tax post tax return on equity as the formula indicates the cost of bt and equity financing are considered separately this is because fr om an investors perspective debt financing is generally considered less risky than equity financing as creditors investors that have lent money to the firm have claims to payment before shareholders dr is generally calculated as dprrfd where rf the rate of return on riskf ree assets the risk free rate dp the premium required above the risk fr ee rate to encourage investors to hold the particular firms debt the debt risk premium er is generally calculated by the accc usi ng domestic capital asset pricing model capm which states that105 104 aer review of the wacc parameters for electricity transmission and distribution 2008 105 the domestic capm assumes that the operator of the regulated bus iness is australian owned and determines parameters accordingly the altern ative is an international capm which assumes foreign ownership is present the application of domestic as opposed to international capm has been considered appropriate in part due to the foreign owne rship restrictions that apply to telstra should shift to an international capm be considered appropriate if the nbn propon ent has high degree of foreign ownership this would likely effect the calcu lation of number of wacc parameters the risk d rvervdwacc 71 fm fe rrerr β where βe beta measure of the volatility of st ock relative to the market as whole rmrf the difference between the required return of the market as whole rm and the risk free rate the market risk premium the following section describes these parameters in more detail c32 debt and equity ratios gearing these measure the proportion of firms fina nce that is raised through debt or equity and in turn weight the returns to debt and equity to obtain an overall required return on capital lowering the debt ratio tends to increase the wacc as it means more generally more expensive quity funding is being used instead of generally cheaper debt funding either the firms actual gearing determined using direct estimation or an appropriate benchmark could be used to estimate these parameters106 the acccs consistent approach in telecommunications and the aer s in other regulated industries has been to use benchmark107 in telecommunications the accc has consiste ntly used benchmark debt ratio of 40 per cent and an equity ratio of 60 per cent for gearing when calculating the wacc for pstn and ulls services108 this was determined with reference to the telstrawide historic book value gearing ratio at the time of telstras privatisation observed gearing estimates of competitors and other regulator decisions in other industries regulated free rate the dent risk premium the market risk pr emium the equity beta and gamma the international capm may be less feasible given the difficulty of assessing the corres pondingly relevant parameters the australian energy regulator aer continues to apply domestic capm recognising the presence of international investors in the domestic market 106 direct estimation involves estimating firms cost of capital on t he basis of that firms financial data the firm is therefore compensated exactly fo r its own cost of capital in theory in practice regulated firms often also have nonregulated activities so the average cost of capital for the firms total regulated and unregulated businesses is typically what is estimated benchmarking uses the average cost of capital for proxy regulated firms the regulated firm is therefore compensated for the average cost of capital for similar regulated firms say in the same i ndustry because the benchmarked rate of return is based upon the average investor and an average firm but the markets in which firms actually raise funds consider the actual position of the investor and the actual position of the target firm the benchmarked rate of return could be above or below the regulated entitys true cost of capital benchmarking therefore gives regulated firms an incentive to reduce thei r actual cost of funds through time the accc and aers general approach is to establish the wacc on the basis of bench mark parameters in order to enhance certainty however the accc has noted that it may exercise j udgment in using empirical evidence and direct estimation from the market 107 aer statement of principles for the regulation of electricity transmission revenues 2004 108 accc report on the assessment of telstras undertaking

of default it is used to measure the premium th at investors require to hold firms debt or equity assuming these are not risk free the acccaer consistently uses the yiel d on commonwealth government bonds to determine the risk free rate because there is considered to be risk of default on government bonds 10year term is used in telecommunications and an average rate over the 10 days leading up to the start of th regulatory period is generally calculated as opposed to an on the day estimate110 in other industries the acccaer regulates it uses period of between 5 and 40 days to calculate the average111 the term of the government bond chosen should be consistent with the terms assumed in estimating other parameters such as the bt premium there has in the past been debate as to whether this term should equal the term of the regulatory period or be the longest term possible to refl ect the life of the regulated assets in its gasnet decision112 the australian competition tribunal the tribunal established that the term should as far as possible match the life of the regulated assets and this is the approach that has been ta ken by the accc in telecomm unications and the aer in other areas since this decision113 c34 return on debt the cost of debt varies depending on the fi rms degree of geari ng its credit rating and the term of the debt the cost of debt can be measured directly by the interest rate on firms debt on issue its corporate bonds or benchmarked from the rates on corporate bonds on issue of firms in the same industry with similar credit ratings the acccaers preferred approach in all of the industries it regulates is to use benchmark114 the difference between the rate on the benchmark bond and the riskfree rate is known as the debt risk premium this measures the return investors require above the return on risk free assets in order to induce them to hold the efficient benchmark firms debt as noted above in choosing the term of the firms debt on i ssue to use there should be consistency with the term used to estimate the risk free rate115 as general rule debt with longer maturity attrac ts higher risk premium 109 aer 2004 110 accc

calculates the re quired return on equity us ing the domestic capital asset pricing model capm117 the basis of this model is the relationship between risk and return the starting point for estimating the cost of equ ity is the riskfree rate if the investment subjects the inve stor to risk the return on equity is raised above the risk free rate the higher lower the level of ris k the higher lower the required rate of return on equity according to the capm ther are two types of risk systematic risk which is risk that the equity market as whole faces such as that caused by changes in the level of economi c activity inflation tax changes and interest rates matter how well diversif ied an investors quity portfolio is systematic risk cannot be eliminated it is therefore faced by all investors in the equity market firm specific risk which is the risk unique to the shares of an i ndividual firm or small group of companies that form subset of the equity market firm specific risk might cause things like asset strandin g an unexpected decrease in demand for services and operations risk investors are as sumed to be able to eliminate the level of firm specific risk in their overall quity portfolio by holding well diversified market portfolio118 the capm framework does not provide comp ensation for bearing firm specific risk on the assumption that investors can eliminate this risk without cost by holding well diversified portfolio of assets119 hence the return on equity should only take into account the amount of systematic risk borne by an investor in holding particular share the return that equity invest ors require over and above the risk free rate in order to compensate them for investing in risky shar is function of beta and the market risk premium the market risk premium represen ts the return that investors expect the equity market as whole to deliver in exce ss of the risk free rate beta weights the market risk premium to reflect the higher or lower level of systematic risk associated 116 accc unconditioned local loop service access dispute between telstra corporation limited access provider and powertel ltd ccess seeker statement of reasons for final

return on equity the acccaer considers it to be the most appropriate framework currently available 118 well diversified portfolio of shares is one that includes variety of shares such that the effect of any one stock on the overall perf ormance of the portfolio is small 119 aer 2008 74 with the particular share rela tive to the average systematic risk in the equity market these two parameters are now discussed market risk premium the market risk premium is the difference between the risk free rate and the rate investors earn by investing in fully di versified portfolio of shares that are not risk free that is portfolio that contains systematic risk because specific risk has been eliminated by diversification because the market risk premium is an exp ected or forward looking premium it is not directly observable historical estimates such as the historical difference between the return of the stock market and the risk free rate are commonly used to indicate the forward looking market risk premium120 in all areas regulated by the acccaer valu of 6 per cent is used for the market risk premium121 this is based on consultancy advice that this value is an appropriate balance of the available ev idence historical premiums typically suggest higher market risk premium than 6 per cent whilst estimates of the market risk premium over more recent periods and forward looking esti mates typically suggest lower market risk premium than 6 per cent122 this value has been upheld through numerous processes where various submissions have been made to the acccaer arguing for either an increased or decreased market risk premium123 equity beta the equity beta is measure of the expected volatility of particular stock relative to the volatility of the market as whole more formally beta is measure of the systematic risk of firm the risk th at cannot be eliminated by holding fully diversified portfolio of invest ments an equity beta of one indicates that the firms equity has the same systematic risk as the equity market average an equity beta less than one indicates that the stock has low syst ematic risk relative to the equity market average whilst beta greater than one i ndicates the stock has high systematic risk relative to the equity market average as ch lower higher beta means that lower higher expected return is required to enc ourage investors to inve st in the particular firms equity relative to that required to courage them to invest in the average share in the equity market importantly in the context of the regulated return on equity the betas should represent the risks associated with the firms regulated assets and lines of business for which the wacc is being calculated and not the firm as whole which may include both regulated and unregulated assets 120 aer 2004 121 aer 2004 accc report on the assessment of telstras undertaking for the domestic pstn originating and terminating access services july 2000 p 7477 accc assessment of telstras

takes into consid eration both the risk associated with the firms regulated assets for example the customer access ne twork can or the nbn and the effect on risk of the firms financial structure that is in the context of the nbn the proportions of funding for the nbn investment that come from debt and equity borrowed funds affect the risk of equity investment and the desired equity returns by increasing gearing up the potential retu rns available to i nvestors but also increasing risks by similar multiple and reducing one aspect of risk namely the amount of funds at risk in the event of total business failure because the lender assume s the risk associated with the loss of borrowed funds124 if the regulated assets are financed complete ly by equity the equity beta only needs to take into account risks associat ed with the cash flows of the assets because there are borrowed fund to increase the risk to equity ho lders in this case the equity beta is equal to the asset beta the asset beta onl reflects the risks associated with the regulated assets cash flows it provides reflection of risk which can be compared across asset classes independent of the financial structure that is proportion of debt and equity financing of in this case the nbn investment an equity beta can be generated from an sset beta process called relevering or alternatively an asset beta can be generated from an equity beta process called levering125 importantly the process of estimating ither of the betas is very sensitive to the period used the frequency of observati on the statistical chnique applied and variety of other factors in estimating the asset beta the acccs appr oach in telecommunica tions has been to estimate an asset beta for business supplying services over the pstn and the ulls that is business that has not diversif ied into business lines that use other networksassets such as mobile or cable tv126 the same asset beta is applied to pstn and ulls services because it has been co nsidered that the cash flows that have traditionally recovered the costs of the ulls are those resulting from the sale of ps tn products the introduction of broadband as rvice that is supplied over the ulls did not change this view because broadband is not necessary to rec over the costs of the ulls and if anything makes it more likely that ulls costs will be recovered as it provides additional revenue this would tend to lower the systematic risk associated with telstras asset base compared to when broadband was not supplied127 124 the formula the acccaer uses to take this in to account can be found in the appendix to this paper 125 the formula the accc uses for this process can be found in the append ix to this paper 126 accc unconditioned local loop service

translates to an equity beta of around 083 at 4060 ratio in the electricity transmission sector th aer has used an equity beta of 1128 the revenue cap decisions in this sector have generally stated that this figure of 1 is approximately equal to relevering an sset beta of 04 howev er the relevering process is not actually undertaken from obser ved market data to obtain the equity beta of 1129 these differences across i ndustries reflect the perceptio n that there is less risk associated with the cash flows generated by electricity transmission assets than telecommunications assets hence the asset beta in telecommunicat ions is higher but the financial structure assumed of firms in the energy sector that is the higher level of debt funding relative to that assumed in telecommunications imposes more risk on these firms equity holders hence the eq uity beta for an electricity transmission firm is higher in taking into account the effect of financial structure on the risk to equity holders the parameters debt beta gamma and the ta x rate are used these parameters are now discussed debt beta the debt beta measures that part of business systematic risk which is transferred from equity holders to providers of debt fo r given asset beta increasing the debt beta reduces the equity beta in telecommunications the accc uses debt beta of zero while the acccaer decisions in other areas have varied130 however this has been relatively uncontentious parameter in the past and the accc does not generally consider its effect on the overall wacc to be large tax rate as noted in regulatory deci sions in telecommunications the accc consistently discusses the wacc in terms of nomin vanilla wacc the vanilla wacc does not include the impact of company tax the accc therefore explicitly models company tax liabilities in cash flows after adjustments for the uti lisation of imputation credits discussed below are made the tax rate therefore onl enters the vanilla wacc as one of the parameters used in th relevering and delevering process to estimate equity and asset betas as such th accc has expressed the view that the tax rate used does not have rge impact on the vanilla wacc131 it does however impact the modelling of tax lia bilities in cash flows but this is done in separate process to calculating the wacc 128 aer 2004 129 aer statement of

debt is usually expressed in pret ax form and the return on equity in posttax form to express the cost of debt in after tax terms the pretax cost of debt would need to be downwardly adju sted taking into account the tax rate alternatively to express the return on equity in pretax form the posttax cost of equity would need to be upwa rdly adjusted by taking into account the tax rate as well as gamma 77 in telecommunications the accc historically preferred the application of an effective tax rate of 20 per cent as oppos ed to the statutory tax rate of 30 per cent as it was considered consistent with the average effec tive tax rate of companies in australia and should be reasonable estimate of an efficient effective tax rate132 however since 2006 for pragmatic reasons the statutory tax ra of 30 per cent has been allowed when calculating the vanilla wacc133 imputation factor gamma under australias imputation tax system aust ralian resident taxpayers can claim tax credit against the income tax they pa on dividends received from australian companies this credit reflects the tax that has already been paid by those companies these tax credits can be used to offset tax payable on other income and therefore reflect benefit to investors with vanilla wacc all tax effects including the benefit of imputation are capture d in cash flows rather than the wacc and ther efore imputation is onl relevant in the equations for relevering and delevering beta estimates134 the imputation factor or gamma represents the proportion of these credits which can on average be used and their value

implies higher benefit gained from income tax cre dits and hence the lower the estimated pretax wacc required to compensate equity holders for m aking the investment 135 in the telecommunications context this s largely centred around whether the marginal investor is an australian or an overseas investor telstra has argued that it is an overseas investor hence gamma should be 0 the acccs position has been that given the rest rictions that apply to telstra on foreign ownership and that domestic rather than in ternational capm is applied it is appropriate to assume the marginal investor is australian hence nonzero value is appropriate 136 aer 2004 accc unconditioned local loop service access dispute between telstra corporation limited access provider and powertel ltd access seeker

equity issu ance costs in the wacc and has noted that in the past lstra has never actually rais ed equity capital and should therefore not be compensate d for equity raising costs138 in other industries regulated by the acccaer such as electricity tran smission equity issuance costs are not included in the wacc but ra ther in operational or capit expenditure cash flows139 the acccaer does not consid er the overall wacc to be sensitive to the treatment of these costs c4 wacc adjustments the following adjustments to the wacc have been put forward by firms regulated by the accc in the past the accc has not supported the proposed adjustments in any regulatory decision to date and similarly th tribunal has also had reservations with regard to some of them c41 asymmetric social outcomes asymmetric social outcomes refers to the argument that because the social consequences of underestimating the wacc ar of much greater importance than the social effects of overestimating it the wa cc should be adjusted upwards or if range of waccs is estimated the upper end should be applied140 this argument has been put forward by telstra in several regulatory proceedings141 the accc has not considered the existence of asymmetric so cial outcomes to be certain and b taking account of them in the wacc to be appropriate even if they do exist142 the australian competition tribunal has accepted that in theory there is potential for asymmetrical consequences should th wacc be set too low or too high143 however it has noted that empirical i nvestigation and evidence is required to determine which leads to the greatest social damage and the degree of this damage before an 137 telstras pie ii model does not allow debt issu ance costs to be included in cash flows hence regulatory processes that have used this model have allowed debt issuan ce costs to be included by adding debt issuance costs to the cost of debt 138 whilst the inclusion of 015 uplift for equity issuance costs was allowed in telstras 2005 ulls undertaking their inclusion has been subject to reassessment since this time 139 aer 2008 140 australian competition tribunal re telstra corporation ltd 3 2007 acompt

regulatory truncation risk so the wacc or range of waccs this framework estimates under estimates the true cost of capita l the wacc should therefore be upwardly adjusted truncati on arguments centre around appl ications of regulation where above normal returns are penalised an dor expropriated ex post whereas below normal returns are not compensated for these arguments are theoretical and do not re present regulatory pr actice as applied in telecommunications or other regulated i ndustries by the accc accordingly the accc does not consider that there is practical risk of truncation as regulatory regimes can be designed in such way as to ensure that it does not arise c43 real options regulated access providers have recently be gun to argue that re options approach should be used in determining the acc ess prices for regulated investments145 advocates of this approach argue that neoclassical investment theory or the net present value npv rule sets the regulated return on capital below the true cost of capital as it fails to deal with the interaction between sunk costs and uncertainty146 to compensate the access provider adequate ly real option theory should instead be used real option theory contends that th ability of the investor to defer an irreversible and uncertain investment is so mething of significant value as it allows an investor to receive new information as time passes which assists in resolving some of the uncertainty surrounding the investment given that the investor hol ds this valuable option when the investment does actually occur and the firm exercises its option to invest it foregoes the opportunity to defer the investment and wa it for further information to arrive as this is an additional opportunity cost ssociated with undertaking an investment it should be taken into account by uplifting the wacc whilst telstra has not yet claimed r eal option surcharge on any of its new investments it has indicated th at it believes such mark up is likely to be appropriate in the future for example in telstra s 2006 fttx discussions with the accc an options value was included in its wacc mode l but its value was set equal to zero accc cic

committee inquiry into th telstra transition to full private ownership bill 2005 and related bills september 2005 146 traditional neoclassical investment theory states that the firm will undertake an investment if the present value of future expected net revenue streams usually discoun ted by some riskadjusted discount rate is greater than or equal to the direct cost of investment or alte rnatively the net present value of the project is greater than or equal to zero 80 capm does not take into account real opt ions the resulting wacc estimates will underestimate the true cost of

asset betas the risk free rate and the bt risk premium have the largest effect on the overall vanilla wacc c6 wacc for the national broadband network the approaches the accc considers appropria in determining the values of the various input parameters to the wacc are largely settled and fo r regulatory certainty it would seem preferable that these approaches do not change with the nbn upgrade in addition given the tribunal s decisions regarding asymme tric social outcomes the accc is unlikely to change its position in these areas subject to evidence being presented that should convince it otherwise as the approach to determining value for most parameters is generally settled there are some parameters whose value will likel be unaffected by the nbn upgrade these include gamma the tax rate the market risk premium and the debt beta these parameters are unaffected by either the genera l financial market c onditions that prevail at the time capital is raised or by which propone nt is awarded the tender if their values remain in line with regulatory decisions more generally regulatory certainty will be promoted on the other hand the values attributed to some parameters are likely to be different to those used in past regulatory decision s the following section discusses these parameters firstly those which are infl uenced by the proponent awarded the tender and their proposal and secondly those aff ected by the prevailing financial market conditions at the time funds are being raised c61 parameters that will likely di ffer according to the proposal an important consideration when assessing proposals will be the treatment of the governments contribution of funds the government has speci fied that it requires rate of return on this contribution but has not specified what this rate is nor whether the contribution will be debt or equity there are therefore number of permutations possible if proposals treat the contri bution as equity debt nd offer the government the same return on equity debt as normal equity debt investors the governments contribution should be treated differen tly from normal equity debt funding if proposals offer the government rate of return that differs from that offered to either debt or equity this may need to be factored into the wacc as separate cost of funds component if the latter is the case the effect on the risks borne by normal equity and debt holders will need to be considered 84 indeed regardless of the return offered to the government how proposals share risk between the government and other invest ors is an important consideration increasing decreasing the amount of risk the government bears should lower raise the regulated wacc all else equal at the extreme if the government bears all the risk of the project say by guaranteeing all i nvestors funds the regul ated return to the investment should be more than the risk free rate as another example should proposals put forward that the governments funds are provided as subsidy despite that the rfp specifies that the government re quires return this would have the effect of decreasing risk to all othe r investors and should be ta ken into account in the wacc accordingly ultimately the lower the return required by the government and the more risk it takes on the lower will be the return other investors require and potentially the lower prices will be for consumers as noted the accc has in the past adopted benchmarking approach to assess the value for various firm specific parameters debt and equity ratios the debt risk premium equity and asset betas and debt and equity issuance costs even if benchmarking is still considered the most appropriate approach to estimating these parameters some firmspecific parameters ma change from the current values relevant to fixed line regulation w ith the nbn upgrade importa ntly though the parameters must continue to reflect those of busine ss that earns revenues only from services provided over copper network or fibre network that is the effect of proponents other lines of business that do not use these assets for example mobiles should be excluded from the wacc the appropriate benchmark used for estima ting the asset beta may change if it is considered that investment in nbn assets involves different level of risk to investment in the pstn and the ulls the ri sk associated with the nbn assets is likely to be affected by capital cost recovery capital costs themselv are likely to be predictable but the pricing framework and regulatory regime that is applied may affect cost recovery technology risk not likely to be increased solely due to fibre itself but possibly due to providing access to fibre and uncertain demand not for services sim ilar to those provided over copper but potentially for high speed services how th is affects risk depends on the proportion of investment costs that are to be recovered from high speed services this will also need to be taken into acc ount in choosing an appropriate benchmark for the equity beta for the nbn as will ny differences in the financial structure proportion of debt and equity funding of the proponent relative to the benchmark financial structure assumed for the equity be ta today if the proponent has an credit rating and the same benchmarked financial structure as is currently assumed remains appropriate the benchmark used for the equity beta will only need to be adjusted for differences in the risks associated with the nbn assets relative to copper network assets 85 with regard to debt and equity issuance costs it is likely to remain preferable that these continue to be included in cash flows if they are included in the wacc the appropriate benchmarks for estimating them will not change with the nbn upgrade if benchmarking is longer s een as the appropriate approach and these firmspecific parameters are directly estimated or obs erved their values will depend on which proponent is awarded the tender and the speci fics of their proposal for example debt and equity ratios will vary depending on how the proposal is financially structured including how gove rnment funding is treated t hat is whether it be debt or equity and the re turns required on it the debt risk premium will change in line with the returns currently being earned on the firms debt on issue if they have any on issue and debt and equity issuance costs will reflect those actually incurred in raising funds for the nbn investment however because direct estimation of the values of the equity and asset betas would require observations of the relative volatility of the proponents shares on issue these parameters could only be directly estimate d for proponents who currently have shares on issue of note fanocs 2007 fttn special access undertaking proposed that given the nature of the fanoc investment the velopment of new network the wacc would use the actual cost of debt and the actual cost of equity capital arising from an initial capital auction the value of the equity beta was to be set at the lower of either 10 or value derived thr ough capital raising auction c62 parameters that change over time reflecting market conditions some wacc parameters in particular the leve l of the risk free rate and the debt risk premium will differ from those used in past decisions because they are influenced by changes in general financial market conditions over time table 3 shows the vanilla wacc that have f eatured in recent regulatory processes and updates them for contemporaneous versions of the risk free rate nd debt risk premium in light of current market conditions table 3 recent wacc values and contemporaneous updates at january 2008 06 ulls undertaking 06 fttn disc ussions 07

unclear for how long these conditions will continue but for so long as they do they will affect the cost of capital for all nbn proposals 86 c7 conclusion in regulated capital intensiv industries such as telecommu nications the allowed cost of capital has large effect on access prices and investment cost of capital that exceeds is less than the normal commerci return in the market earned by investments of similar risk will encourag too much too little investment and an access price greater lower than the true economic costs of providing the service the accc measures the cost of capital using the wacc there are number of parameters that are inputs to estimating an overall wacc which this paper has discussed as table 4 shows for most of these parameters the accc considers the approach to estimating them to be reasonably settled table 4 wacc parameters settled or contentious approach andor value parameter approach settled value dependent on financial market conditions value

wacc to account for asymmetric social outcomes in light of the tribunals decisions in this regard the accc does not consider such adjustments appropriate subject to evidence being 87 presented that would convince it otherwis the accc has also not considered regulatory truncation risk nd real options adjustments to be appropriate in any regulatory decision to date nd its position in th areas is also unlikely to change for those parameters that arent affected by financial market conditions or firmasset related risks if the approach to estimating them and therefore their value remains i n line with the approach taken in other regul ated areas regulatory certainty will be promoted these parameters include gamma the debt beta the market risk premium and the tax rate as such in assessing nb n proposals these parameters should be less contentious than others whilst the accc considers the approach to estimating parameters to be settled the value of some parameters for the nbn wacc ar likely to differ from those currently used these differences should reflect any difference in risk associated with the particular nbn proposal relative to the risks associated with investment in the copper network and any differences in risk associated with the financial structure of the particular proposal as such values for the equity and sset betas the debt ri sk premium and the debt and equity ratios are likely to differ from those currently used by the accc in telecommunications the differences should also reflect changes in general financial market conditions since previous regulatory decisions and fttx di scussions these conditions will affect the value of the debt risk premium as well as the risk free rate but will not affect the approach to estimating their value the equity and asset betas are likely to be the most contentious parameters when assessing nbn proposals this is because the approach to estimating them is less settled than for other paramete rs their value is dependent on the specific details of the proposal in question and the period over which they are estimated and because they have large affect on the overall wacc how the governments contribution is treated is also likely to be contentious 88 annexure redelevering formula the following formula is used by the accc to take into account the effect of financial structure on the returns to equity holders and for the re and delevering process edtrr dd da ae 111 γ ββββ where βa the asset beta βd the debt beta γ the imputation factor gamma the effective tax rate the debt to equity ratio148 there are several different formulas that can be used for this purpose the accc generally uses the one listed but has stated th at it will use its judgement in establishing the asset beta and how the equity beta is derived from it149 148 in theory the debtequity mix assumed in the formula for deriving of the equity beta must be consistent with the debtequity mix assumed in calculating the wacc 149 accc draft statement of principles for th regulation of transmission revenues 1999 89appendix d pricing flexibility d1 executive summary prices for products and services are variable pricing flexibility re fers to ability of firm to choose both the level and structur of prices which are to be charged for its products and services in competitive markets the pricing flexibility of firms is constrained by competition towards the costs of providing services in regulated infrastructure markets regulation fulfils the role otherwise performed by the competitive process in constraining flexibility to ensure prices reflect underlying costs any pricing regulatory regime must inhere ntly make decision s regarding both the levels and the structure of prices incl uding the degree of geographic and customer specific differentiation even if the decision is to let either or both of these be set by the operators themselves the regulato ry regime applying to the nbn upgrade will need to make similar decisions pricing flexibility of some extent is likely to be highly desira ble property of the regulation of the nbn upgrade however achieving pricing flexibility may require some degree of change to the regulatory regime currently applying to telecommunications it will be substantially policy decision for the government as to what constraints if any it wishes to place on pricing flexibility for the nbn operator this appendix considers some possible appr oaches to pricing fl exibility and their possible corollary consequences an important advantage of pricing flexibility is said to be that it better enables the firm to discover and adjust to uncertain demand to match prices to consumer willingness to pay to adjust to changing circumstances including changes in technology and the competitive environment and to operate in more business like manner than if there is pricing flexibility this can have substantial efficiency benefits in particular in the presence of well defined price caps but can lead to inefficient excessive pricing in the absence of such well defined caps pricing flexibility can crease incentives for verti cal price discrimination particularly in the absen ce of downstream economies of scale and scope vertical price discrimination such as where network operator discriminates price service quality etc in favour of the ope rators own downstream retail arm is generally seen as undesirable from comp etition policy and efficiency perspective the disadvantages of pricing flexibility include that the resulting prices may not be fully compatible with universal service obligations and other similar requirements or with distributional imperatives from policy or political perspective for example prices may differ across regions and customers depending on the costs of providing services to those customers or those customers willingness to pay different prices pricing flexibility also potentially creates greater opportunities for vertically integrated operator to enga ge in price squeeze and similar conduct 90 two potential regulatory appr oaches that allow for pricing flexibility are price cap regulation pcr incorporating average pr ice caps rather than individual caps on specific services and the building block model bbm of regulation used to fix total maximum allowable revenue rather th an to set individual allowable prices in other regulated industries pricing flex ibility is achieved th rough variants of the bbm or pcr both of these approaches can achieve pricing flexibility broadly constrained by costs of service provision and compensation for the level of risk involved by way of an appropriate riskadjusted cost of capital 91d2 introduction d21 price structures telecommunications service providers almost always provide wide sets of services that is they are multiproduct firms these sets of services are necessarily accompanied by similarly wide sets of associated prices the choice of set of prices involves both choice of the level of prices and the structure of the prices that is both the absolute prices and the relative prices therefore when the service provider is ciding on its prices or the regulator is setting those prices decision must be made not only on the absolute level of the prices that is the prices in dollar terms but also on the structure of the prices relative to one another for example when firm or regul ator is setting prices for two different but related products and b one of the important decisions is whether should have similar price to b or wh ether there is reason for to carry substantially higher price than b and what that relative price difference should be regulator charged with regulating firmsindustry s prices or government establishing regulatory framework also faces an additional choice should the regulator set prices of all relevant individual services thereby setting the pricing structure as well as the pri ce levels or should the regulator set only some type of average of prices thereby effectively sett ing the price levels but permit the firm to set the individual prices around the regulated average pr ice thereby permitting the firm to set the pricing structure the second choice involves granting the firm degree of pricing flexibility that it would not have under the first choice the structure of access prices will have an important impact on the development of infrastructure and competition in the industr as much as the level of access prices an inadequate structure of access prices can send the wrong signals for the operators choices of investment in infrastructure and for entrants entry exit decisions as general statement it can be said that the setting of access charges regulates the rate of return on the in cumbents investment in infrastructure there is in general trade off between promoting competition to increase social welfare once the infrastructure is in pl ace and encouraging the incumbent to invest and maintain the infrastructure that is regulato rs must encourage entry without expropriating incumbents150 the desirable amount of pricing flexibility is likely to depend critic ally on the level of vertical integration in the i ndustry vertically integrated industry typically contains an operator that provides both upstream bottleneck infrastructure services and typically owns such infrastructure nd downstream services in competition with rivals central difficulty w ith vertically integrated industry is that vertically integrated operator may have the incentive to discriminate against downstream rivals that rely on the upstream bottleneck infr astructure to provide their downstream services by contrast such problem w ill generally not occur where the industry is vertically separated that is where the industry is vertically parated so that the infrastructure provider is not also downst ream service provider where an industry 150 jj laffont and j tirole competition in telecommunications cambridge ma mit press page 7 92is vertically integrated core policy chal lenge is to design th regulatory and other frameworks so as to mitigate agai nst such incentives to discriminate d22 pricing flexibility in the nbn context the request for proposals rfp contains several requirements that may influence policy choices in relation to pricing flexibil ity and other relevant features further there are certain tensions among the differe nt objectives and any final policy position is highly likely to require some degree of tradeoff between these different requirements in order to reach balanced resolution the most relevant requirements in re lation to pricing flexibility are 1 that prices should reflec t underlying costs and enable uniform retail prices nationally see objectives 6 and 11 in the rfp this would generally speak against flexibility for prices and 2 that flexibility and good incentive struct ures should be encouraged implied by objectives 8 10 and 11 in the rfp this would generally favour greater pricing flexibility in its regulatory submissions telstra s argued for more pricing flexibility in particular telstra seeks lesser emphasis on the setting of exante price points for individual access service151 and movement towards an approach of greater flexibility of individual service pricing within broader overall constraints telstra argues that nbn operator will require reasonable degree of pricing flexibility at retail and wholesale levels because demand is unpred ictable and many products will be new to the market and that scope will be needed to experiment to discover demand and price levels however telstra also argues that pricing flexibil ity must be provided in manner that does not deprive nbn operato r of pricing certainty and hence must accommodate scope for fixed price ceilings and other pricing arrangements that are locked in for the life of the relevant asse ts telstra notes that there may be tensions between certainty on the one hand for access s eekers and flexibility to price innovate for nbn operator on the other hand152 telstra argues in one submission that solution to this may be the appr oach of anchor product regulation 153 under this approach only the retail or access price of key entry vel anchor products for example voice and low speed internet service would be regulated the nbn operator would be given unrestrained flexib ility in the pricing of other services though it is argued that the prices of unr egulated services would be indirectly constrained by the pricing of the anchor products154 151 however it should be noted that the accc does not have wide ranging pr ice setting powers with respect to telecommunications services the ccc can only set prices for declared services on bilateral basis following the lodgement of an access di spute therefore degree of flexibility already exists for third party access as op erators have full price setting powe rs in respect of all undeclared services 152 telstra public submission on the rollout and operation of national broadband network for australia 2008 p 25 153 telstra public submission on the rollout and operation of national broadband network for australia 2008 p 25 154 ofcom future broadband policy approa ch to next generation access 2007 93terria proposes that pricing methodol ogy model should be established to determine the relevant acce ss price with the accc havi ng the right to review key inputs in the model against an obj ective criterion appropriate to the telecommunications industry such as reasona bleness on regular basis terria also recommends that the accc should have the ri ght to determine thos key inputs if it is not satisfied with an operators proposal it argues that this would give the access provider additional certainty regarding the re turn it may make and give certainty to access seekers regarding the price they have to pay for access optus also supports the accc having the responsibility to approve access terms and prices most industry submitters along with many welfare and consumer groups government agencies and individuals emphasise the importance of the accc determining access prices and the importance of cost based principles drawing on the criteria of the rfp and othe r economic considerations desirable regulatory regime for nbn upgrade is like ly to contain small number of core features firstly the resulting prices ar likely to be broadly reflectiv of costs with reference both to marginal costs and average costs this will generally assist in attaining acceptable levels of static economic efficien cy and in mitigating against substantial windfall gains or losses for operators secondly there should be good incentive structures to encourage operators to engage in continued improvements in efficient co sts levels and continued advances in productivity and to engage over time in fficient investment in infrastructure and technological improvements this will ge nerally assist in nhancing static and dynamic economic efficiency in the industry thirdly there should be adequate opportunity for operators to dynamically engage in discovery of uncertain and changing mand and consumers preferences and to respond effectively to external changes in demand consumers preferences technology and similar this will typically be achieved by some sort of flexibility and responsiveness in pricin g and other settings this appendix examines the i ssue of pricing flexibility in the provision of services on the nbn section d3 outlines some of the potentia l advantages of pricing flexibility section d4 provides an overview of some regulatory models which can assist in achieving pricing flexibility section d5 outlines some of the practical limitations of some of the regulatory models which allow pricing flexibility section d6 examines whether there should be requirement for side controls when allowing firm to set prices in flexible manner consideration is given to what these controls may be and how would they change as the degree of vertical integration increases 94section d7 looks at how the degree of pric ing flexibility that is desirable varies according to whether the proponent is ve rtically integrated or separated section d8 examines the issu of price discrimination and the implications that price discrimination at the wholesale level has on prices at the retail level d3 the potential advantages of pricing flexibility d31 pricing flexibility may increase economic welfare through increased efficiency it is said that by allowing pricing flexibility across i ndividual products the resulting price structure will be more economically efficient the commonly argued reason for this is that more flexible pricing will be more ramseyorientated see box 1 below and therefore more consistent with economic efficiency155 the principle behind this argument is that this type of pricing most closely aligns with consumer preferences and demand conditions for differe nt products and consumer gr oups so that it distorts consumption decisions less than other form s of pricing the result is the economic welfare across all consumers will in principle be maximised one argument against such ramseyorientated pr icing is that this will typically result in pricediscrimination between groups of consumers this is argued by some to be inequitable see section d7 below for furt her development of the arguments for and against pricediscrimination further c onsideration is that the use of ramsey pricing principles by regulators can requi re information that is not available box 1 ramsey pricing ramsey pricing refers to the set of pr ices that maximise some given or pre determined measure of the total economic we lfare of the society the resulting prices will generally be function of the underl ying costs of production the demandside substitution and supplyside bypass possibilitie s and the elasticities of demand for the product the responsiveness of demand to pri ce changes this can also be considered in relation to different user groups or users in general comparatively higher price cost markups apply to products with ss elastic responsive demand than to products with more elastic demand as consum ption decisions will be distorted less in relation to less elastic products so that the impact com paratively on social welfare is therefore minimised d32 use of new information about changing circumstances another argument for pricing flexibility is that it will typically allow the operator to make better use of new information about changing circumstances very substantial amount of information is potentially rele vant to nbn operator or regulator in making decisions regarding pricing and other operating decisions including information on consumer preferences or demand different technologies competitive pressure and so forth further this inform ation is likely to evol ve substantially over time given the likely technological changes in broadband provision as well as the 155 see i vogelsang and j finsinger 1979 regulatory adjustment proce ss for optimal pricing

95ongoing process of development of applica tions for which broadband can be used pricing flexibility would arguabl allow the operator to adjust its individual prices to reflect such large amounts of evolving information incl uding elasticit ies of demand complementarities and substitutabilities between segments and competitive pressures even if the operator cannot aff ect its overall average price if this is constrained by regulation156 in this sense pricing flexibility can permit the incumbent operator to become more business orientated low degree of pricing flexibility may not provide sufficient incentives for the operator to respond to increas ed information about and changes in demand which it can discover through responding to market signals in pa rticular in environments marked by some competition and technologi cal change in addition to enduring bottleneck and natural monopoly characteristics that is there are limited incentives for the operator to increase cap acity or make services available to more users because again it does not get compensated for doing so this could mean that potential dynamic efficiency and productivity gains are lost d33 imperfect and asymmetric information third argument in favour of pricing flexib ility is that the regulated operator will typically have more fullyd eveloped information about their own business for example their cost structures and about th regulated industry for example demand conditions and consumer preferences than the government or the regulator in practice regulator seldom has complete information about consumer demand in the industry or about the technol ogical capabilities and cost structures of regulated producers it is argued that under thes conditions of imperfect and asymmetric information degree of pricing flexibility provides greater incentives for the regulated operator to make best use of the information it has avai lable and provides grea ter incentives for it to seek further and better information the c onsequence is argued to be greater total economic welfare for consumers and other market participants critical question is how can the regulator best induce the regulat ed firm to employ its superior information to further the broa der interests of societies as well as furthering the firms own intere sts that is how can the interests of the regulated firm be broadly aligned with the inte rests of the broader society in answering this question there is trad eoff between providing strong incentives for the regulated firm to align prices with mand and reduce costs which call for high degree of pricing flexibility and preventing the firm extrac ting too much rent which calls for lower degree of pricing flexibility increasing the incentive power of the regime increases the incentives to the firm to behave efficiently but is also likely to increase the profits retained by th firm and vice versa general principle in relation to the inform ational requirements that are placed on the regulator and by implication the degree of flexibility given to the regulated firm might be 156 jj laffont and j tirole competition in telecommunications cambridge ma mit press p 4 96the access pricing rule more generally the regulatory framework must impose reasonable informational requirements on the regulator in terms of computing the access charges and monitoring compliance this simplicity help s to reduce the regulatory costs and limit the influence of politics in the dete rmination of access charges157 d4 relevant forms of regulation it is widely recognised result of economics that unconstrained monopolies and firms with substantial market power subject to minimal levels of constraint in general charge higher prices and produce lower am ounts of output than the social optimum which is typically seen to be the output and price that will prevail in competitive market for the good or service in questi on where market is capable of being competitive the optimal policy response to ensure that the market becomes or remains competitive is typically achieved by the application of competition polic antitrust measures however in some markets competition is inherently difficult to achieve in particular in industries with strong natural monopoly features such as network economies andor enduring bottlen eck characteristics typically including fixedline telecommunications and utilities industries in essence natural monopoly arises in an industry or in an element of an industry if technology and consumer demand are such that it is substa ntially more economical for one firm to serve the relevant market than for several firms to serve it in such industries the optimal policy response is often to regulat the natural monopoly firms including the prices that the firms charge and other service characteristics such as quality158 once it has been decided that an industry s hould be regulated or certain elements of the industry such as infrastructure bottl enecks for example by means of an access regime as is currently containe d in parts iiia and xic of the trade practices act 1974 further policy decisions must be take n typically price regulation is key component of economic regula tion of such industries but what form should the regulation take d41 rate of return regulation some approaches to regulation require each regulated price to be individually approved early forms of price regulation specially in us utilities including telecommunications were often based on notions of rate of return regulation rorr under rorr the regulator spec ifies an allowable rate of return on the firms total costs including operating and capital depreciation costs prices under rate of return regulation rorr are thus t predominantly with reference to measure of the cost of production so that the operato r may typically charge the re levant variable cost of production plus an allowable rate of return on capital where change to the regulated price is sought by th service provider the change may typically only occur upon application to and approval by the regulator 157 jj laffont and j tirole competition in telecommunications cambridge ma mit press page 7 158 attempting to replicate competitive market outcomes as cl osely as is reasonable in the circumstances is the most common stated objective of economic regula tion regulation has however also been enacted for variety of other reasons these have included distributional rationales as between the consumers and the producers or different groups of consumers or both and regulation at the behest of firms seeking protection fr om too much competition for example part x of the tpa tariff protection of industries and similar 97in practice rorr is generally implemente d when the regulator specifies the allowed prices that regulated firm may charge that the regulator estimates will give t he regulated firm the allowed rate of return in summary under rorr the regulator sets prices typically with reference to predicted demand the firm has little discretion in altering these prices once they are set prices are adjusted to keep the rate of re turn constant the regulator ensures that the realised rate of return does not deviat substantially from the target rate and that the firm has opportunity to earn the target rate of return on an ongoing basis costs directly affect prices prices are adjusted to reflect significant changes in costs other commonly applied forms of regul ation with similar features are marginal incremental costbased appr oaches such as tslric tslric and telric the appendix val uing the sunk network expl ains these regulatory approaches further building block model approaches see section d42 below problems identified with ra of return regimes it has been argued by some that rorr can give rise to variety of adverse consequences in particular that such appr oaches do not provide sufficient incentives for efficiency gains by the operators one argument is that such approaches to regulation may not provide adequate incentives for the operator to minimise costs or improve productivity and can encourage the operator to overinvest in capita l where the allowable rate of return is higher than the underlying cost of capital t he socalled gold plating problem the argument is that in the absence of any re gulatory mechanism to encourage efficiency gains the lack of incentive to minimise cost s arises because prices are typically set to cover the firms actual costs irrespective of the level of those costs under pure actualcost approach if the firm invests capital andor effort in costminimisation then the cost savings will subsequently be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices it is argued th at this effectively removes th incentives for the firm to make such costminimisation effort as it will not benefit from the investment in similar manner the firm does not have strong incentives to avoid co st increases as it will be compensated for the cost increases by way of higher regulated prices another argument is that the approach ma not provide sufficient incentives for the operator to respond to increas ed information about and changes in demand which it can discover through responding to market signals in pa rticular in environments marked by some competition and technologi cal change in addition to enduring bottleneck and natural monopoly characteristics that is there are limited incentives for the operator to increase cap acity or make services available to more users because again it does not get compensated for doing so 98further it has been argued that such pproaches are costly and cumbersome to implement in terms of administration information requirements etc as they typically require the regula tor to obtain substantial amounts of information and typically involve the regulator setting indi vidual prices for range of services these argued flaws in rate of return regulat ion have been proposed as arguments in favour of incorporating incentiveorientate d mechanisms in regulatory regimes d42 incentive based regulation building block model bbm of regulation one form of regulation that is potentia lly consistent with more incentive based regulation is the building block model bbm approach159 further while bbm is conceptually best seen as costbased pproach it can potentially be applied in manner that incorporates pricing flexibility elements the bbm approach is among others the basis for the accc aers regulation of the electricity and gas sectors the accc aer typically uses the bbm approach to establish in accordance with the relevant legi slation code or rule s reference tariffs for reference services these tariffs then form the basis of negotiations between an operator and users within framework acce ss arrangement that has been approved by the accc aer incentive elements can be incorporated into the bbm by permitting operators that beat the benchmark within review periods to retain the associated benefits review periods can be set over longer periods eg 3 or 5 years rather than annual to permit operators sufficient time to outperform the re levant forecasts operators can be given strong incentives to achieve such outperformance by being permitted to retain all or some of the associated benefits for exampl the operators may be allowed to retain some or all of the increased earnings re sulting from them increasing revenues beyond forecast growth by growing their markets or decreasing costs by operating the assets more efficiently than forecast in its basic form the bbm accounts for each cost category faced by the service provider return of capital periodic depreciation on capital costs noncapital expenditures including oper ations maintenance and administrative costs return on capital return on equity and retu rn on debt calculated with reference to the allowable regulatory asset base the appendix cost of capital provides further information on determining the allowable weighted average cost of capital other expenditures or allowances includi ng adjustments for taxation and incentive schemes 159 among others see accc submission to the productivity commission review of the gas access regime 15 september 2003 99typically these periodic costs are then aggr egated to determine the periodic revenue required by the operator to cover its reasona ble costs including reasonable returns on capital more specifically the maximum allowable revenue for period is the sum of the allowable regulatory asset base at the beginning of the relevant period times the allowable weighted average cost of capital plus the allowable depreciation during the relevant period plus the allowable noncapital expenditures during the relevant period plus other expenditures or allowan ces for the relevant period in the simplest form of the bbm the maxi mum allowable revenue is then divided by forecast demand for the relevant period to ca lculate reference tariff or price for the service in question this application of the bbm requires that demand forecasts be made for the time periods to be cove red in each regulatory review period however the bbm can be applied without taki ng the extra step of calculating specific reference tariffs by way of demand forecasts as per the above the bbm can allow pricing flexibility by allowi ng the operator total amount of maximum allowable revenue and permitting the operator to charge the prices that it sees fit within the total maximum allowable revenue cap the bbm is often based on effi cient costs rather than actual costs efficient costs can be determined on variety of different bases including benchmarking processes applied to actual costs the purpose of us ing efficient costs is the view that going forward the benchmark for the operators compensation should not include any current or legacy operational inefficiencies however the bbm can also be based on actual costs ie irrespective of whether or not they are efficient costs both in principle and in practice price cap regulation pcr pricecap regulation pcr is an early form of incentiveba sed regulation that potentially permits substantial flexibility to the operator in price setting typically both across the retail and the wholes ale levels pcr was designed as an alternative form of regulation that would eliminate the cost disincentives associ ated with rate of return regulation the discussion in this section fo cuses on pcr at the wholesale level if pcr is effective at this level retail prices are also likely to be such that efficient outcomes are promoted price caps became common in regulating incumbents in number of network industries including in us nd australian telecommunications160 typical price cap regulatory system has four basic characteristics 160 jj laffont and j tirole competition in telecommunications cambridge ma mit press chapter 1 1001 the regulator establishes an acceptable set of prices these ar the initial price cap or starting point 2 in multiproduct industry the regulator does not establish specific maximum price for each product bu t establishes an overall ceiling for aggregate prices for basket of services 3 the regulator may allow the price cap to be adjusted over time by pre determined adjustment factor 4 regulators typically provide for periodic review of the system at set intervals core aspect of price cap re gulation is that any cost sa vings achieved by the firm are retained at least in part by the firm ther eby reinstating the incentive of the firm to achieve cost savings and efficiencies note that this is also feature of bbm if applied as described above firms retain f ully or partially cost savings achieved within regulatory period other important features of such price cap regulation are as follows 1 regular prices resets the rate at which the firm can increase prices over time is fixed for predetermined periods typica lly several years nd is not adjusted to reflect realised costs and prof its during this regulatory period 2 link to costs current prices are not explicitly linked to current costs see below 3 regulatory discretion the regulator has considerable discretion over future policy ie beyond the current regulatory period common way of implementing pcr for multiproduct firm is by way of an average tariff basket and similar forms of pcr here collectively referred to as average pcr average pcr has been applied in respect of telecommunications in number of us states and other jurisdic tions average pcr shares the above listed features of pcr with one additional feature control of average basket price only onl the firms average price is controlled and the firm is free to control the pattern of relative prices wi thin the basket of regulated services therefore an average price cap is an ove rall constraint on so measure of the average of the firms prices or alternativel subset of those pr ices rather than separate price constraint placed on each of the firms products this is generally implemented by calculating price index on basket of goods the cap is typically adjusted each year to account for inflation and expected technological improvements within the confines of the cap on its aver age price level the firm typically is otherwise free to adjust the pr ice levels of individual serv ices the average price cap can be subject to some constraints on the speed of price rebalancing 101an average price cap thereby gives the opera tor significant price flexibility in setting prices of individual products and services th is is compared with regime of separate price caps on individual products services where the operator does not have comparable flexibility in pricing amo ng its different products services further form of pcr is global price cap regulation global pcr under global pcr the average price cap would apply to all prices char ged by the regulated operator if applied to nbn upgrade global price cap could be applied to both wholesale and retail prices global pcr of this form has been propos ed in extensive and respected economic literature161 but has not yet been implemented fully in practice anywhere unlike other forms of average pcr which have been implemented for telecommunications and other industries in number of ju risdictions one possible reason for non implementation of global pcr up to now is that it is relatively recently proposed variant of the broader concept of average pcr implementation would therefore involve additional considerations an nbn operator would likely be multiproduct firm so that if pcr was chosen as the regulatory framework then this could be implemented by way of global pcr pcr and some bbms allow pricing flexibility as stated above an important feature of price cap systems and some bbm systems of regulation is that they permit the firm great er flexibility in setting its prices in particular pricing flexibility would typically allow the ope rator to respond to changes in consumers preferences and demand or shifts in pr oduction technology by adjusting the relative prices of its different products for reasons outlined in sect ion d3 this may result in substant ial increases in economic welfare this pricing flexibility would typically be exercised within the context of certain constraints imposed by the regulatory regime that is in place where the regulatory regime is pcr the operator would be able to adjust its relative prices within the constraint of the overall average pri ce cap in the case of bbm regulation the operator could adjust its relative prices subject to the overall maximum allowa ble revenue constraint the incentive and efficiency properties of incentivebased regulation feature of incentivebased regulation such as pcr or an appropriately implemented bbm is that the link between prices and costs is substantially broken at least over time prices nd price caps may nonetheless be set initially in reference to underlying costs and be adjusted over with reference to expected desired productivity improvements or other costrefle ctive criteria u nder common form of price cap regulation the prices the firm ch arges are permitted to increase on average at specified rate for specified time the specified average rate of price increase is often linked to the overall ra of price inflation and t ypically does not reflect the 161 see eg jj laffont and j tirole competition in

firms past cost performance is in principle not intended to be reflected in the p eriodic revision of the price cap the price cap is partly intended to weaken the link between prices and costs with principal purpose being to s uppress the link from cost inefficiencies to price increases with the aim in turn of providing the firm with powerful incentives for cost reduction the incentive properties of price cap regulation arise because prices are not directly linked to costs for relativel long periods of time the consequence is that regulated firms can have strong incen tives to achieve effi ciencies by reducing their operating costs in contrast rate of re turn regulation adjusts the firms prices as the underlying costs change to assure the firm reasonable opportunity to recoup underlying costs incurred and earn an allowable co st of capital andor rate of return pcr is prominent example of highpowered incentive form of regulation that is form of regulation that provides operators with substantial incentives to reduce costs and increase efficiencies highpowered in centive regime is one in which the firm bears high fraction of its cost at the marg in and similarly retains high fraction of marginal benefits162 by contrast lowpowered in centive regime is one in which the firm bears only low fraction of its cost at the margin in particular under cost plus regime the firms costs are fully reimbursed so that the firm is not made accountable for its cost savings or overruns however it is noted that under rorr the fi rm is assured reasonable opportunity to earn the authorised return on its investments over medium or longer term so that the firm has limited concern that its sunk investments will be expropriated by future regulatory policy the us federal communications commi ssion fcc generally prefers pricecap regulation to rateof return regulation as in its view it is prudent to implement regulatory systems that are better able than ra of return to operate effectively in an environment marked by competition and technological change163 adjustments over time with pcr price caps are typically adjusted over tim to allow for inflation and productivity andor technological changes such dynami c adjustment is commonly known as cpi x or rpix in the uk this formula tion denotes that price caps are adjusted upwards for inflation typically measured by the cpi or the rpi in the uk and adjusted downwards for expected efficiency savings x other adjustment formulations include cpixk which has been used in the uk water industry where k is an adjustment factor base d on capital investment requirements the purpose of adjusting for inflation is ne utralise the impact of economywide price changes on the real prices obtained by the operators adjustments for expected efficiency change s are intended to provide incentives for efficiency savings as any savings above th predicted rate x can be retained by the operator and its shareholders in the form of increased returns at least within given 162 for example if the firms costs rise by 1 its net return is reduced by an mount close to 1 or equivalently its gross return

docket 87313 fcc 8991 p19 103review period at subsequent reviews th efficiency gains can then accrue either fully or partially to service users in rms of permanently downward adjustments in prices the efficiency gain factor x is often measured not only on the firms past performance but also on the performance of other comparable firms such as other operators in relevant markets in this wa the x factor is intended to be proxy for competitive market in the sense that firms that achieve greaterthanaverag or greaterthanexpected efficiency gains can retain some or all of the benefit of those achievements at least within review periods adjustments over time with bbm maximum allowable revenues are adjusted over time by rolling forward the previous periods regul atory asset base to the beginning of the relevant period by adding allowable curren t capital expenditure to the previous periods regulatory asset base and subtra cting allowable current depreciation and estimating allowable depreciation and noncapital expenditures for the relevant period in this way the maximum allowable revenue in each period under the bbm fundamentally remains product of estimates of the relevant periods regulatory asset base which is itself determ ined from the previous period s regulatory asset base and current allowable capital expenditure and preciation and the estimates of current allowable weighted average cost of capital depreciation and noncap ital expenditures these revised estimates can then be combin ed with revised demand forecasts to yield price estimates for reference tariffs alternatively if the operator is to have pric ing flexibility the operator could have the to tal amount of maximum allowable revenue determined by the regulator with freedom as to what prices to charge which will yield this revenue d5 practical limitations of price flexibility there are however number of limitations of regulatory regimes such as pcr or appropriate applications of bbm that inco rporate degrees of pr icing flexibility and that weaken the relationship between pri ces and underlying costs these are now discussed d51 potential for significant gains or losses by regulated firms information asymmetries open doors to large windfall gains or losses by firms where the regulator has imperfect informa tion regarding the opera tors costs as is reasonably to be expected there is an unavoidable tradeoff between providing incentives and creating variability in the operators profits the regulator may aim to make the firm fully accountable for its efficiency performance by allowing the firm to rece ive 1 in increased profits for every 1 in cost efficiencies generated however cost savings or increased costs may also occur for external reasons ie for reasons not connected with the firms controllable efficiency performance such external efficiency shocks may create windfall gains or losses for firm under regulatory regime s including pcr that weaken the link between underlying costs and prices 104d52 potential issues with regulatory commitment the problem of external costs and productiv ity shocks as discussed in the previous point raises issues of the credibility of regulatory commitment where firms make windfall profits over extended periods the regulator may face pressure to reduce price caps outside of the scheduled price review process similarly where firm makes unexpected large losses the regulator may f ace similar pressures to raise price caps eg to keep operators alive under incentivebased regimes that depart from primary production costs basis the regulator arguably has substantial discreti on over the profitability of the firm under pcr this raises two potential and opposite concerns linked to issues of regulatory commitment regulatory capture where th regulator is too so ft on the firm and voluntarily inflates the firms rent and b regulatory taking wh ere the regulator is too harsh on the firm and does not adequately compensate the firm for its investments and its efficiency gains these potential problems hei ghten the need for clear external objectives and guidelines regarding how the regulator is to exercise its discretion d6 the requirement for side controls d61 quality of service controls high incentives to reduce costs can give ri to quality concerns under incentive based regulation eg pcr the firm di rectly bears higher proportion of its expenditures the firm has an incentive to reduce its expenditure however it can do so which can include expend iture on items and services that are valued by the consumers this incentive to skimp on quality may mean that pcr needs to be accompanied by increased attention to quality issues the effect of pcr on service quality is seen to be potentially significant problem decline in quality can be seen as being in essence disguised increase in price regulators of telecommunications in both the uk and the us have introduced quality of service side controls subsequent to introducing pcr after it was found that the regulated firm had skimped unduly on rvice quality expenditure and that this quality had decreased in response to the introduction of rvice regulation d62 universal service obligations universal service obligations usos generally impose so sort of requirement on the operator to provide certain services f or example certain baseline services viewed as being essential to all members of society further usos often require that these services be provided to different user groups on equivalent or similar terms the obligation is usually to provide these rvices to all irrespective of whether or not it is economic to provide these services and on the relevant terms to all demographic and other subgroups of society two commonly argued rationales for usos are 1 distributional arguments that it is just that all members of society receive the same basi c services irrespective of location and cost of delivery of those services and 2 regional planning arguments 105that provision of basic serv ices assists the broader econom ic and social development of locations that are geographically di stant from establis hed urban centres prominent example of uso in telecomm unications is the requirement to provide basic telecommunications services to distant rural ar eas on equal terms as they are provided in dense urban locales irrespectiv that it is often substantially more expensive to provide such services to geogr aphically distant locations and that it may thereby not be economic to serve such locations on equivalent terms d63 limits on speed of rebalancing individual prices in addition to the cap on average price leve ls under pcr or revenues under bbm freedom of price flexibility can be constrained by some constraints on the speed at which individual prices can be rebalanced an operator that can price flexibly subj ect to some cap may find it desirable to rebalance prices rapidly this is particul arly likely when price flexibility is first introduced as the operator seeks to match di fferent demand profiles of different user groups and seeks to eliminate crosssubsidiz ation and after subs equent substantial demand or costs shocks rapid rebalancing can lead to rapid price increases for some consumer groups from an economic efficiency perspective this is likely to be seen as desirable however it may be judged from policy perspective that th is is undesirable there is likely to be policy tradeoff in this regard betw een total economic welfare efficiency considerations and distributi onal equity considerations in the context of the nbn upgrade commensurate policy judgment and decision would need to be made one possible safeguard in broader context of pricing flexibility may be to permit firms to price flexibly but subject to some form of safeguard such safeguard might be form of approval process for very ra pid price rebalancing above some form of predefined threshold the object of such process might be to capture the economic welfare benefits of pricing flexibility while protecting market participants aga inst unexpected rapid price adjustments over th shorter term however potentially substantial issue would be that new regulatory mech anism would need to be established administered and enforced in pa rticular set of criteria would need to be established that would specify both the prices that should be controlled and the rebalancing thresholds eg time rates of cha nge of prices or prices relative to one another or other criteria th at should not be exceeded specific proposed mechanisms should be examined carefully for their full impact including the potential efficiency benefits and costs and for potentia l unintended adverse consequences d7 pricing flexibility and vertical integration one of the key concerns in regulating co mpanies in natural monopoly industries is that vertically integrated firm in cont rol of bottlenecks may have the incentive to attempt to exclude its upstream or downstr eam rivals either through direct exclusion or through engaging in price squeeze behavi our that attempts to disadvantage or exclude downstream competitors this is likely to be more significant pr oblem where there is ve rtical integration of the bottleneck operator with competitive ups tream or downstream markets vertical 106integration in such case can give rise to the incentives for the operator of the bottleneck to discriminate in favour of its own downstream operati ons and against its downstream rivals164 further with vertical integration under asymmetric information which will generally be the case as between regulator and the regulated firm the vertically integrated operator ma have incentives to exaggerate its costs in order to convince the regulator to set hi gher access price again to the disadvantage of its downstream rivals165 by contrast where the indus trys structure is vertically separated incentives to discriminate agains t downstream rivals are substantially less likely to exist although perverse incentives with respect to re porting of costs may equally exist in regulated but ve rtically separated industries under strictly costbased approach to regula tion vertically integrated operator of bottleneck infrastructure may have incentiv to discriminate against downstream rivals for the purposes of partial or full ex clusion of those rivals from downstream markets such discrimination can be price based such as chargi ng higher price of downstream rivals than of the operators own downstream business one form of which is known as pricesqueeze or nonpricebased such as providing lower quality services to downstream rivals or even forms of sabotage potential for such anticompetitive exclusionary behaviour in turn typically requires close regulatory monitoring similar incentives for such discrimination may also arise under pcr where it is applied only at the wholesale level incentives to discriminate are argued to be decreased by global pcr even where the structure is vertically inte grated it has been argued that global pcr significantly reduces or even eliminates the incentives of the bottleneck operator to attempt to exclude downstream rivals according to these arguments under global price cap the operator manages its product lines symme trically as it has inbuilt incentive to favour one product type over another global price cap provide s the operator with the flexibility to choose which product t ypes including wholes ale vs retail are profitable formal economic analysis suggest s that behaviour that seeks to exclude rivals tends also to reduc the operators own profit this profit reduction is particularly clear where riva ls have market power nd the exclusionary practice consists of raising the rivals costs in formal economic modelling the exclusionary practice is equivalent to the operator ra ising its own cost of providing the retail service through its co mpetitive rivals166 however as stated above global pcr has not been implemented in practice anywhere so its practical ability to constrai n instances of vertical price discrimination is as yet unproven d8 price discrimination price discrimination refers to seller char ging different prices of different buyers for reasons other than underlying co sts eg simple example is charging different prices 164 see eg m armstrong d sappington 200 7 recent developments in the theory of regulation in m armstrong and r porter eds handbook of industrial organisation iii amsterdam elsevier 15571700 165 see eg j vickers 1995 competition and regulation in vertically relat ed markets review of economic studies 62 117 166 jj laffont and j tirole competition in telecommunications cambridge ma mit press pages 173178 107of different user groups for an identical pr oduct in an identical time and place price discrimination will generally be profitable for the seller where different consumers or identifiable groups of consumers have different demand profile s in particular different elasticities of demand that is different responsiveness in demand to the price of product price fl exibility say under an averag price cap will generally lead an operator to price discriminate as it will generally be profitable for the operator to do so in consequence an operator under pricing flexibility will generally charge higher prices for those products r to those consumers for which demand is less elastic that is less respons ive to changes in price than would be the case if price discrimination was not allowed or not otherwise possible the economic literature points to substantial potential efficiency and economic welfare benefits from price discrimination the core of these arguments is that substantial efficiency and welfare losse s can arise from pricing that distort consumption decisions eg cause consumption that is substantially lower than the efficient levels price discrimination can assist to reduce these inefficiencies and welfare losses because under efficient price discrimination the less elastic products will attract relatively higher price in consequence the consumption distortion will generally be less relative to what it would have been under nondiscriminatory pricing with the result under many circumst ances that broader economic welfare will be higher the difficulty with price discrimination arises from distribution and equity arguments and considerations similar to those outlined in re spect of usos and elsewhere above it can often be the case th at demand is less elastic for essential products such as basiclevel telephony u nder price discrimination such products would typically attract comparatively higher prices with the impact falling disproportionately on lowerincome groups in this sense there may be something of tradeoff between economic efficiency total welfare and distributional considerations decisions in relation to such tradeo ffs generally require the invocation of political and policy considerations policymaker may decide that distributional considerations merit the equalisation of certain prices and merit the concomitant loss in economic welfare relative to where prices are permitted to adjust freely in response to demand such control of relative prices for distribut ional purposes generally involves indirect cross subsidisation of so users by other users better alternative in many circumstances may be direct subsidisation meaning that prices are permitted to adj ust and vary freely and that certain users are instead compensated by direct cash payments or favourable tax treatment the r eason this may be preferable is that under direct subsidisation there is not likely to be the same dist ortion of consumption decisions and resultant loss in total economic welfare as there is with indirect subsidisation through manipula tion of price levels as result under direct rather than indirect subsidisation there will gene rally be net gain in economic welfare even taking into account the co st of the direct subsidies d81 implications of price discrimination at the wholesale level on retail prices price discrimination can in principle occur at the wholesale level as well as at the retail level 108price discrimination at the retail level w ould typically take place between different users or user groups price discrimination at the wholesale level would be likely to feed through to concomitant price differences at the retail level it is recalled that price discrimination essentially involves char ging different prices of different users for reasons other than costs and would in clude charging differe nt prices for an identical product at the wholesale level this would mean different access seekers are charged different prices for the same w holesale product that they use as an input in cost structures even th ough they are using in this ex ample equivalent wholesale products this form of price squeeze behaviour can potentially have substantial implications for the ability of the highe rpriced purchaser to compete in downstream markets with possible implications for th level of competition in those downstream markets where operators are also able to price discriminate at the retail vel in addition to being able to di scriminate at the wholesale level this may amplify the risks of price squeeze behaviour and th consequent potential implications for competition in downstream retail markets it is also useful to recall that price disc rimination may be very difficult to reconcile with equivalence requirements whether they be imposed at the wholesale or at the retail level d9 conclusion this appendix has considered some possibl approaches to pricing flexibility and their possible corollary consequences an important advantage of pricing flexibility is said to be that firm that can price flexibly is better able to d iscover and adjust to uncerta in demand is better able to adjust to changing circumstances i ncluding changes in technology and the competitive environment and is generally bett er able to operate in more business like manner than if there is pricing flexibility the disadvantages of pricing flexibility include that the resulting prices may not be fully compatible with universal service oblig ations and other similar requirements or with distributional imperatives from policy or political perspective pricing flexibility also potentially creates greater opportunities for the incumbent to engage in price squeeze and similar conduct two potential regulatory pproaches that allow for pricing flexibility are 1 price cap regulation pcr incorporati ng average price caps rather than individual caps on specific services and 2 building block model bbm regulation us ed to fix total maximum allowable revenue rather than to set individual allowable prices pcr is said to provide the opportunity over to break the link between allowable prices and underlying costs and the regulatory requirement to evaluate detailed allowable costs this is argued to assist in providing incentives for operators to increase efficiencies and productivity and to be mo re market responsive disadvantage is that this may result in s ubstantial windfall gains or losses to the operator which may raise political issues further potential issue is whether the regulator would in the event of significant loss by the operator be required to assist 109the operator by way of unscheduled reviews with potential advers consequences for the regulators reputation for commitment bbm approach would keep the total allo wable revenue more closely aligned with underlying allowable costs one advantage is th at this is likely to assist in avoiding windfall gains or losses to the operator consequence is that bbm would likely require much closer ongoing and active regu latory engagement with the operators allowable asset base and with the oper ators capital expe nditure operating and maintenance plans than pcr would require this may however be consistent with the higher degree of scrutiny required if the nb n concentrates the bottleneck nature of the existing fixed infrastructure pricing flexibility may well need to be accomp anied by targeted side controls this is particularly the case where the operator of the nbn is vertically integrated such as with businesses in competitive upstream content markets andor competitive downstream retail and other rvices markets appropria side controls in the presence of vertical integr ation would likely include equivalence provisions to ensure that the nbn grants equivalent access to upstream or downstream competitors some degree of quality of service regulation may also be necessary confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 110appendix funding uneconomic services e1 executive summary uneconomic services are those for whic h the revenues earned do not cover the costs in the australian telecommunications context uneconomic services arise due to the combination of three factors there is presumption that consumers in high cost regions traditionally rural and remote areas would not be willing to pay price for telecommunications services that would reflect the long term costs that is including capital costs of providing services to them this in turn implies that whilst generally operators may be willing to incur losses in the shor t term operator would be willing to build the infrastructure to supply services in these areas because capital costs will not be recovered however it is considered desirable from social policy perspective that these customers are able to access telecommuni cations services hence telstra is required by law to provide services to customers in rural and remote areas further given the absence of willingne ss to pay social policy typically also requires that these customers be able to access the services on an equitable basis which is interpreted to be at similar price and nonprice terms to those in metropolitan areas despite technical and differing cost considerations to the extent that such prices do not cover the costs of pr oviding services to regional and remote areas the operator will incur loss ordinarily giving rise to need for mechanism to fund the shortfall the nbns objectives for 98 per cent coverage of equal capacity combined with the requirement for uniform retail pricing of key entry level voice and broadband services implies that the nbn operato r could incur loss in serving some customers particularly in high cost regions as such how the gap between the revenues earned from and costs of providing services to these customers will be funded needs to be considered it should be kept in mind that the costs of providing services to traditionally high cost areas may actually reduce with the nbn upgrade hence there may be fewer uneconomic services to fund relative to the legacy network this will depend critically on the technologies proponents c hoose to deploy in traditionally high cost areas furthermore whilst determining the shor tfall between revenu and costs on the legacy network has been problematic for the sunk legacy network the process should be more transparent following the nbn upgrade via the nbn rfp process proponents had to xplicitly state the technologies that will be deployed in different regions and their costs that is they were effectiv ely required to state what the costs of funding services in differe nt regions will be in some respects the nbn tender process mimics contestabili ty for universal service provision confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 111 there are three broad mechanisms that have been used to fund uneconomic services in the past internal cross subsidies access deficit charges and universal service funds usfs internal cross subsidies oc cur when revenues from services for which the price is above costs are used to fund services for which the price is below costs access deficit charges are variatio n on internal cross subsidies with access deficit charges all providers of subsidising services contribute payments to subsidise uneconomic access services so for example all service providers in metropolitan areas u sfs are pools of funds that are used to directly compensatesubsid ise the service provider for providing uneconomic services internal cross subsidies we re in place for many years prior to the introduction of competition however past experience bot h in australia and overseas has clearly shown that internal crosssubsidies are unsustainable in competitive market retail cross subsidies are unsustainable if there is competition in the retail markets for the services which provide the subsidy eg metropolitan markets wholesale crosssubsidies that is averaged access prices are unsustainable if there is infrastructureb ased competition in regions which provide the subsidy eg metropolitan markets however if access seekers in metropolit an areas have other option but to purchase access services from the nbn operato r that is if there is possibility that the nbn will be bypassed averaged access charges may be sustainable the sustainability of uniformaveraged acce ss charges will also depend on the cost of providing services in tr aditionally high cost regions which in turn will depend on the technologies proposed to serve th regions if the costs do not differ great deal across regions uniformaverage d access prices would be efficient and sustainable because they would more or less be costreflective indeed if this is the case it is possible that there will be uneconomic services within the nbn footprint still internal mechanisms such as crosssubsidies lack transparency and accountability with vertical ly integrated nbn operator they also create anti competitive conduct concerns eg the ability to price squeeze anticompetitive conduct concerns would be reduced in th case of wholesale only proposal the accc notes that australi is signatory to the world trade organisation wto agreement on basic telecommunications which requires that only transparent and accountable funding mechanisms are implemented if access prices are deave raged to reflect cost differentials across regions it is still possible to achieve uniform retail pricing objectives direct subsidies can be offered to operators in high cost areas to recover shortfalls hence there would be disincentive to offer retail services in high cost areas at price different to that offered in low cost areas subsid ies could be sourced from usf confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 112 usf provides an alternative means of funding uneconomic services to internal crosssubsidies subsidies are provided from the fund to the operator or operators that provide services to uneconomic regions to compen sate them for thei r losses in doing so the mechanism can be structured such th at either one operator for example the nbn operator is the only service provider in uneconomic regions for example by providing subsidies at the whol esale level to th wholesale supplier ie the nbn operator or multiple operators provide services in uneconomic regions for example by providing subsidies at the retail level ie to resellers of the nbn operators wholesale products there are likely to be unavoidable dist ortions in the market for whichever technology receives subsidy for example assume 3g is deployed and subsidised in high cost areas the common costs for example covera ge associated with that operators 3g network across all regions will be reduced relative to those that an unsubsidised operator would have to recove r which may preclude further rollouts of competitive infrastructure into these high cost regions further that operators revenues would be subsidised to the exte nt that coverage can be used as marketing tool which would provide competitive advantage across all regions funds for the usf should be collected in an efficient and transparent manner there are three broad options general taxation revenues contributions from service providers through an industry based levy or from consumers which of these is most efficient and transparent will depend on the specifics of thei r implementation consideration should be given to uneconomic services outside the nbn footprint if an operator other than the nbn operator services the last 2 per cent of premises internal mechanisms are unlikely to be sustainable for funding the last 2 per cent of premises in this case usf or direct government subsidy would be required if the nbn operator is requi red to service the last 2 per cent of premises but different funding mechanism is used for these premises than that used for uneconomic services within the nbn foot print distortions in competition and investment across regions may arise there would not appear to be clear rationale for using different funding mechanisms for the two different uneconomic regions if they are both supplied by the same operator currently requirements for quality and price have been laid out for the last 2 per cent of premises the desirability of differentials in price and quality across the last two per cent and the nbn footprint therefore so needs to be considered confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 113e2 introduction in general service provider will not of its own accord provide services to customers who do not generate enough reve nues to cover the costs of providing services to them it would be uneconomic to provide services to such customers hence they are known as uneconomic servi ces importantly what is uneconomic for new entrant may not be uneconomic for an incumbent with sunk assets from social policy perspective it is widely considered undesirable for some members of society to not have access to basic services what constitutes basic service will of course change over time the revenues service provider can ear n may be constrained by consumers willingness to pay competition or regulation for example in contestable markets service providers ability to earn revenues is constrained to its co sts by the threat of competition on the other hand an unregul ated monopoly infrastructure providers ability to earn revenue is less constrained the prices it is able to charge end users and therefore the revenues it earns are dict ated by the willingness of consumers to pay for the service its investment decisi ons therefore reflect the difference between the revenues it expects to earn from group of consumers or specific region and the costs of earning this revenue investment is lik ely to be greatest least with regard to consumers or regions for which this gap between revenues and co sts profits is largest smallest in the australian telecomm unications context the re venues that the incumbent operator has been able to earn have been constrained by both access regulation this aims to emulate similar constraint on revenues that contestability would create the revenues th incumbent has been able to earn from the services it provides at the wholesal eaccess level are constrained towards the level of the costs of providing the services retail price controls thes are applied to the prices charged to end users for certain services and are not di rectly related to the costs of providing the services to those end users hence the difference between revenues and costs profits for retail services varies in line with differ ences in the costs of providing services to different groups of consumers and regions the controls also i ndirectly constrain the prices that competitors can charge their customers costbased access regulation does not of itsel f constrain telstras revenues to below costs and therefore does not cause the uneconomic service issue rather it is the presumption that some groups of end users wi ll not be able to pay prices that cover the costs of providing services to them pl us social policy objectives which require uniform retail prices and retail price contro ls that make some services uneconomic the issue of uneconomic services typically arises in the contex t of end users access to telecommunications in remote areas ge ographically uniform re tail prices are in place to ensure that end users in these ar eas have access to basic telecommunications services on the same basis as end users in metropolitan areas despite the higher costs of providing these services confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 114from social policy perspective it is considered equitable for all members of society to receive the same basic services irrespective of where they live and the cost of delivery of those services from regi onal planning perspective the provision of basic services to all members of societ assists the broader economic and social development of locations that are geogra phically distant from established urban centres the request for proposals rfp to roll out the national broadband network nbn makes it clear that achieving these social po licy objectives remains high priority for the nbn for example the government s indicated that one objective of the nbn is to enable uniform retail prices on national basis section 1316 however schedule 2 to the rfp only requir retail price information for key entry level and basic services including both basic voice and broadband service see schedule 2 section 153 of note fulf ilment of this obj ective would appear to extend the operation of existing retail price controls which currently only apply to voice and narrowband services into services not pr eviously controlled specifically broadband services the current retail price control nd universal service re gimes are discussed in more detail in section e3 depending on the prices put forward by pr oponents for these services the revenues that can be earned from them may not cover the costs of providing services in regional and remote areas it is unlikely that the nbn operator or any other service provider would of its own accord provide services to uneconomic consumers or regions this is because its interests will lie in maximising value for shareholders rather than society as whole hence the rfp also requires that the nb n operator deliver minimum service quality 12 mbps and coverage objectives 98 per cent of premises the objective of fair and equitable access to nbn services across regions gives rise to the potential for mandatory provision of uneconomic services as such the rfp recognises that there will be services provided under the nbn which will be uneconomic to provide proponents should identify the parts of the network that are commercia lly viable in their own right and those parts that would not otherwise be commercially viable with out financial support see 1522 as this suggests in order for the dual objec tives of uniform retail pricing and 98 per cent coverage to be simultaneously met mechanism will need to be created to ensure the ongoing viability of service pr ovision to uneconomic consumers the rfp calls upon proponents to set out the mechanis ms which they propose to ensure this specifically the rfp states that if proponent is proposin g crosssubsidy arrangements wi thin access prices to support uneconomic services or achieve other outcomes the proponent s hould identify these services and outcomes the amounts of the losses and the crosssubsidies separat ely the rationale for them and methodology for their calculation b if proponent proposes another type of mechanism to support oth erwise uneconomic services or achieve other outcomes it should identify the services and outcomes concerned and set out details about the nature of its proposed mechanism and other relevant details schedule 2 section 144 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 115internationally there is standard appro ach to funding universal service the main mechanisms appear to be to not subsidise universal rvice at all this is base d on the rationale that the universal service provider obtains substa ntial benefits from being the universal service provider for example in the uk bt funds its universal service obligation because these obligations have not previously been considered to represent an unfair burden on them167 internal cross subsidies between or within services provided by incumbent operators adcs paid by telecommunica tions operators to subsidise the access deficit of incumbents in this sense they repres ent an external crosssubsidy because the shortfall in funding for uneconomic servic is funded from all providers high margin customers not just the incumbents universal service funds usfs independe ntly administered funds that collect revenue from various sources and provi targeted subsidies to implement universality programs168 these mechanisms are not always applied mu tually exclusively and there are range of variations on each of them each performs differently in terms of ef ficiency the degree of economic efficiency will depend amongst other things on which services andor end users receive and provide the subsidies and on the size of the subsidy in general nontargeted and nonquantified crosssubsidies between serv ices tend to be the least efficient mechanism on the other hand the most efficient mechanisms are those that provide targeted subsidies to promote specific unive rsal service objectives such as can take place with usf approach in terms of the collection of revenues to fund the usf mechanisms that collect revenues from government sources or wide range of telecommunications services s opposed to just high margin services tend to be the most efficient169 each mechanism also performs differently in terms of transparency and accountability this has implications for measuring the actual cost of funding universal service and for the potential fo r abuse of market power by the universal service provider further accountability and transparency must be features of any funding mechanism in order that australia co mplies with interna tional trade rules the wto regulation reference paper which forms part of the wto agreement on basic

section e8 concludes the appendix e3 current arrangements the aim of universal service policy in australi in the past has been to ensure that all australians have reasonable access on an equitable basis to standard telephone services and payphones the universal rvice obligation or uso the current regime comprises arrangements for selecting universal service providers inclu ding contestability arrangements discussed below provisions for the regulation of universal service charges arrangements for the collection and distri bution of the universal service levy also discussed below continued access to timed local calls and price control arrangements telstra is currently the sole universal servi ce provider of standard telephone services and data services the standard telephone component of the uso is currently defined as the obligation to ensure that standard telephone services are reasonably acces sible to all people in australia on an equitable basis wherever they reside or carry on business170 many of the key dimensions of the cu rrent uso such as functionality of the standard telephone service reasonable access and prici ng parity are left to be defined by telstra in its uso standard ma rketing plan or uso policy statement these documents define these concepts to so extent but the documents act more as guidelines than prescriptive obligations telstra is compensated for the net cost of fulfilling the uso through subsidy the size of this subsidy is determined by the minister following advice from the australian communications and media authority acma the methodology for establishing uso subsidies is not prescribed in the relevant legisl ation but the size of the subsidy is meant to reflect the cost of providing noncommercial services minus 170 section 4 telecommunications consumer protection and service standards act 1999 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 117any revenue that the univers service provider receives in 200708 the subsidy for universal service was around 145 million171 all carriers in australia cont ribute to the usf the f und from which uso subsidies are drawn via universal service levy wh ich is based on their share of eligible revenue172 carriers are required to lodge their eligible revenue returns to acma for each year they hold telecommunications carrier licence acma then assesses the returns and advises carriers of their elig ible revenues for each financial year retail price control ar rangements were introduced in 1989 with the aim of preventing telecom from leveraging its market power in rural markets where it was the monopoly provider for most services173 they are currently set by the minister and require telstra to put downward pressure on its telephone call pr ices and indirectly those of its competitors174 importantly the current regulation which applies until 30 june 2009 maintains 22 cents cap on untimed local calls and promotes pricing parity between metropo litan and regional areas for local calls175 and line rentals there is 12 month delay in parity requirements for local calls but not for line rentals parity for line re ntals only applies if line rental is not bundled with any other service such as inte rnet services and if third party is selected for long distance calling176 telstra is required to report to the ccc on its compliance with the price control arrangements although the pr ice parity arrangements onl apply to subset of services and are not particul arly stringent generally it can be observed that telstra and its competitors offer all of their retail products at the same price regardless of region in those regions where the products are available e4 what lessons have been learnt the following section discusses the main less ons that can be learnt from australian and international experience and from the economic literature e41 internal crosssubsidies internal crosssubsidies occu r when revenues from servi ces for which the price is above costs are used to fund services for wh ich the price is below costs for example 171 acma funding of the uso and ddso at httpwwwacmagovauw

from in ternational and long distance calls were used to fund line rental and local call charges interservice crosssubsidisation and revenues from metropolitan customers were used to fund regional customers intraservice subsidisation when the idea of community service obliga tions csos began to enter australian telecommunications regulation in 1975 the delivery of telecomm unications services to uneconomic areas was funded via internal cross subsidies at the retail level generated by the governmentown ed statutory monopoly telecom177 in 1988 the cost of csos was estimated to be between 240 295 million during the 1970s and 1980s governments and regulators began to reassess arguments about the claimed natural monopoly characteri stics of parts of the network and the scope to introduce competition with the introduction of competition into telecommunications markets in 1991 and the implementation of the telecommunications access regime in 1997 crosssubsidisation became increasingly complex competition began to force re tail prices down especially within metropolitan areas which reduced the amount of funds that could be used from end users in these areas to fund uneconomic regions this trend was also observed internationally and the subsequent unsustaina bility of internal crosssubsidies along with the other problems with crosssubsidie s outlined in table 1 have initiated an international trend away from reliance on this mechanism178 with the failure of crosssubsidies em erging in 1991 it was arranged for both optus and telstra to share the financial load of csouso costs between them based on their respective share of the telephone market and then from 1997 for all carriers to contribute the merits of these arrangem ents are discussed in later sections averaging of access prices the introduction of access regulation and co mpetition in 1997 also meant that the opportunity arose to crosssubsidise at the w holesale level initiall this took the form of an external cross subsidy the adc discussed below more recently wholesale level crosssubsidies have taken the form of access prices which are averaged across regions which as opposed to the adc are in ternal to the incumb ent if costs vary significantly across regions averaged w holesaleaccess prices mean that access seekers purchasing access services in low co st regions generally metropolitan areas subsidise the below cost access price of serv ices provided in high cost usually rural and regional areas 177 dcita 2007 178 p xavier what rules for universal service in an ipenabled ngn environment background paper prepared for itu workshop on what rules for ipenabled ngns 2006 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 119economic theory179 australian180 and international experience181 and the australian competition tribunal the tribunal182 support the notion that averaged access prices are unsustainable when there is the potential for infrastructurebased competition in metropolitan areas for averag ed access prices to be sustainable the potential for duplication must either be banned for example there must be overbuild protection or not technically or commercially feasible in metropolitan areas this includes inefficient bypass th at is bypass that would not be commercially feasible but for distorted bove cost averaged wholesale prices this is because if the cost that an ac cess seeker would face in building its own network in metropolitan areas was less th an the costs the universal service provider decides to recover in metropolitan areas access seekers may be encouraged to build their own infrastruc ture this inefficien t duplication would drive retail prices down to cost in tropolitan areas which if uniform retail prices are maintained would require that retail prices also fell in regional areas the universal service provider would longer be able to subsidise service provision in regional areas using revenues from metropolitan areas on the other hand if bypass cannot occur in metropolitan areas the network operator will have persistent monopoly in both the short nd long term in all regions so access seekers will be unable to bu ild their own infrastructure and undermine the above cost access price in metropolitan areas183 averaged access charges can be thought of as the universal service providers network bearing all of the tax burden re quired to fund uneconomic services the oecd argues that only br oadlybased tax levied on th incumbent and all of its rivals whether they utilise the incumb ents network or their own competing network can be sustainable in the threat of network bypass184 in order to sustain uniform retail pricing and retail competition in metropolitan areas it is preferable to tax retail services through usf or sim ilar arrangement economic efficiency is achieved by setting access prices at efficient costs and using the tax to fund shortfalls it is distorting to not to share the tax burden amongst othe r networks if there are other networks with which to share it although averaged access prices are not sustainabl if there is the potential for infrastructure based competition uniform access prices are still possible as noted the shortfall in high cost areas would simp ly be compensated for externally if the entire shortfall is met via this external mechanism there is need for averaged access prices but access prices will be uniform 179 armstrong m access pricing bypass and universal service american economic review papers and

importantly the likely willingness of consumers and access seek ers to switch to purchasing services from networks other than the nbn is im portant when considering whether averaged access prices would be sustainable if c onsumers and access seekers would readily switch to alternative networks abovecost access prices in metropolitan areas would not be sustainable because the nbn opera tor would wish to prevent infrastructure based entry occurring in these areas also important is an assessment of the ex tent to which costs across regions actually differ the accc has accepted uniform access prices for the specific costs of the line sharing service lss because the re levant cost pool is not geographically specific that is it is ce ntralised computer system185 it has previously specified geographically averaged connection and disconnection charges although these costs do vary across different regions the cost variations are not large186 however the accc has stated that if line cost component were to be included which it currently is not it should be deaverage d because these costs do vary significantly across regions as consequence of the retailminusretailcost approach access prices for the wholesale line rental nd local call services which allow access seekers to provide retail voice service are averaged across regions in line with telstras pricing of its quivalent retail services e42 access deficit charges adc adcs are variation on traditional crosssubsidy mechanisms while traditional cross subsidy mechanisms are internal to the incumbent with adcs all providers of subsidising services which were traditiona lly local calls contribute payments to subsidise uneconomic access services hence markups on retail products were used to subsidise access products the cost of the subsi dy is therefore spread across all competitors an adc imposed on regulated access services is one potential solution to the problem of diminishing cross subsidy base an adc like any form of cross subsidy involves driving wedge between the cost of providing the service and the price being charged to access ekers this distorts efficien t use of and investment in the service that is the subject of the char ge an adc can also acts as barrier to competition in similar way to an industry levy discussed below this approach was considered reasonable by the accc for

over time this would lead to corres ponding reductions in the size of the access deficit and eventually allow it to be removed commencing in 200203 telstra was given greater freedom in their retail price controls over pe riod of five years this has allowed telstra to rebalance its tariffs nd increase line rentals with the aim of eliminating the access deficit similarly to in the australian telecommunica tions context adcs ve been rejected or are under review in many jurisdictions189 e43 universal service funds as internal cross subsidies and adcs ar increasingly being phased out they are being replaced with more efficient target ed mechanisms to promote universality as early as 2001 the oecd working party on telecommunications and information services policies noted that interconnection charges shoul d not include an access defic it contribution or universal service contribution if there is any economic loss due to the provision of universal service including the provision of subscriber lines this should be compensate d separately through for example competitively neutral funding mechanism190 international experience suggests that universality funds have many benefits191 usfs are pools of funds that are used to direc tly compensate the service provider for providing uneconomic services that is f unds equal to the difference between the costs of providing the servi ce and the revenues earned from the service are given to the provider that services the uneconomic service in order to directly compensate them compared to internal crosssubsidies and adc s usf can be more transparent and it can be designed to be competitively neutra l for example by requiring broad range of operators to contribute to the fund192 contributions to the fund can be made by the telecommunications industry as is the case with the current usf in australia c onsumers of telecommuni cations services or the government from ge neral taxation revenues193 internationally the most common approach appears to be one in which levy is placed on telecommunications operators the chief advantage of the current system in australia whereby all carriers contribute in proporti on to their share of total ca rrier revenue is that it offers broad and sustainable revenue base due to the wide definition of eligible industry revenue 189 xavier 2006 190 oecd working party on telecommunication and information services pol icies interconnection and local competition oecd 2001 191 intven oliver and sepuilveda 2000 192 xavier 2006 193 it should be noted that if providers pass on the costs to them of c ontributing to the universal service fund and because general taxation revenue is earned from consum ers residential and business the costs of universal service are ultimate ly always funded by consumers what differs is how broadly the costs are spread across different consumer groups further if the fu nd is contributed to by general taxation revenues it would basically be similar mechanism to direc t subsidy programs such as the australian broadband guarantee confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 122on the other hand requiring nonuniversal service provider ca rriers to fund the universal service providers rural and regional activities could have negative effects on competition in an environment where co mpetitive carriers are finding it hard to make inroads against the incumbent the current uso regime actually requires competitive carriers to crosssubsidise the universal service providers acti vities thus potentially strengthening the universal service providers position the contribution could thus act as disincentive for competitive carriers to provide their own regiona l and rural services this could in turn impede the deployment of alternative technologies such as wireless in these ma rkets even when such delivery systems are more efficient further knock on effect of this is that it could reduce the incentive for the uso provider to build the most efficient network in these areas194 table 1 provides summary of the adva ntages and disadvantages of the three mechanisms discussed above table 1 options for increasing universality advantages and disadvantages195 option advantages disadvantages internal cross subsidies traditional approach in many countries often in combination with mandatory service obligations inefficient depresses demand for services that provide the subsidies and forecloses entry in the subsidised markets because competitors cannot match the low prices unsustainable in competitive environment because new entrants typically target profitable market segments ie the areas that provide rather than receive the subsidies if untargeted all existing us ers receive the subsidy whether they can afford to pay or not anticompetitive effects using the crosssubsidy to enable lower prices on nonuniversal services difficult to detect and prevent adcs spreads funding burden across all operators including competitors many of the same problems as with traditional cross subsidy including inefficiencies difficult to calculate access costs difficult to implement and administer in transp arent and efficient manner encourage bypass of the pstn and therefore inefficient duplication of network facilities depriving the incumbent of revenues th ey would otherwise earn difficult to calculate benefits of uso provider can lead to excessive access charges to competitors universality funds most effective means of providing targeted subsidies to expand or support uneconomic services potentially most efficient some administrative complexity and transaction expenses in establishing fund some potential for bad governance difficult to fore cast associated costs

service to new areas if combined with competitive bids for private operators e44 costing universal service provision on the legacy network subsidies received by universal service pr ovider are aimed at compensating it for any shortfalls in revenue if the estimate of the subsidy required is inaccurate competitive neutrality can be affected if funded by industry levy high estimate may advantage the universal servic provider if it exceeds its true costs because its higher contribution is more than offset by contributions it receives from other providers these contributions in effect subs idise costs the universal service provider does not bear196 too low estimate means the vy will not cover the costs of providing universal service hence the uni versal service provid er would be at competitive disadvantage an incorrect levy can also possibly affect efficiency i n that to the extent it is passed on to cons umers too high levy can distort their consumption decisions and too low vy could affect investment decisions197 under the current universal service regime the level of the subsidy required to support uneconomic services has been difficult to determine and has been open to debate for example in 199798 the first ye ar in which the net universal service cost model was applied telstra claimed net cost of 18 bil lion the australian communications authority assessed it at over 548 million but the minister introduced legislation that prev ailed to cap it at 25332 million198 detailed measurement of the net cost has not ccurred since 2000 since then the subsidy amount has been determined by adjusting each years amount based on trends in underlying factors partly debate over costs has arisen because they relate to rgely sunk network and are based on estimates of the costs of building and operating hypothetical network as noted by optus in its submission to the nbn panel on regulatory issues telstra typically claims that it faces losses in rural and remo areas since it is unable to recover its costs through line rental charges but in making this claim telstra is trying to doubledip the bu lk of the costs telstra claims in respect of existing connection s are not real costs that telstra actually faces since they relate to the original investment made in building the copper access network the vast majo rity of connections to telstras copper network were made many decades ago by th government given that the economic life budgeted for copper lines is typically around 15 years the capital costs cited by telstra have already been recovered in the past thr ough telstras very substantial revenues199 196 productivity commission inquiry report on telecommunications competition regulation 2001 197 ibid 198 minister for communications information

the arts dcita review of the uso in 2004 suggested that any new attempts to measure the costs of universal service in detail would be difficult contr oversial costly and take minimum of two years200 the review determined that the problems and costs associated with developing new model ght outweigh the potential benefits the review stated that any subsidy based on m odelling results would risk being contested by one or more of the affected carriers give n the range of factors and the nature of the methodological issues involved201 issues also arise due to lack of tran sparency because the current uso regime provides only loose guidance as to key dimensions of the uso there is definitive answer to the question of how many services are provided under the universal service arrangements or where they are located if uso is defined without high degree of specificity there will always be scope fo r debate over whether the universal service subsidy is adequate202 in its 2007 submission to the dcita revi ew of the uso the accc outlined its preference to introduce contestability fo r the provision of universal service203 contestability gives the market the opportuni ty to determine the size of the subsidy such market based approach can minimise the subsidy by encouraging the pr ovision of universal service over more efficient networks help to overcome the information asymmetr problems that arise when regulatory body seeks to independently estimate these costs help place value on the intangible benefits that carrier receives when it is the universal service provider and avoid the high cost of developing cost models it also removes the ability for carriers to subsequently contend that subsidies are insufficient this process is so metimes referred to as competition for the market as opposed to competition in the market204 of note in this regard the government announced the introduction of contestability in the delivery of universal service in 2000 commencing with two regional pilots while the contestability arrangem ents commenced in 2001 to date provider has been approved by acma as competing univers service provider the productivity commission note that this may be because unde r the current regime there is lack of 200 dcita review of the operation of the uso and csg 2004 201 ibid 202 accc submission to the dcita review of the operation of the univers service obligation 2007 203 ibid 204 the two differ in that competition for the market will lead to there being only one universal service provider in an area because competition occurs for exclusive provision in certain areas on the other hand competition in the market would involve competition between carriers within uni versal service areas this would oc cur under for example pe r service subsidy scheme confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 125incentive to reveal the true costs of serv ice provision to regulat ors and therefore lack of incentive for competition in the prov ision of universal service it also notes that process designed to encourage potential suppliers to indicat their true costs and which would reward the lowest cost suppliers for doing so would enhance the prospect for competition205 whilst contestability has had li ttle practical success in aust ralia to date as discussed in section e51 it may prove more fruitful in the nbn context the competitive tender process being undertaken for the nb n of itself incorporates elements of contestability for universal service provision hence ther is the potential for number of the costing issues discus sed in this section to fall away the accc has also noted that it is difficult to determine the true cost of providing universal service whilst there is uso that is not clearly defined partial solution was argued to be to increase the degree of specificity in the uso for example how many uneconomic services there are in austra lia and where they are located to place clearer boundaries around the cost debate in addition it was noted that the trend analysis used to estimate the net cost of fulfilling the uso did not provide reliable estimates for the cost of the uso and that any estimate going fo rward would need to take into account alternative subsidy programs like the australian broadband guarantee abg and the communications fund206 e45 interaction between different funding mechanisms there are currently number of schemes in place to fund universal service type policies for example in addition to the mechanisms discussed above for funding the uso the government has more recen tly supported the provision of broadband services to underserved areas through programs such as the abg via this program australians living in the most remote or difficult to reach areas are entitled to broadband subsidy of 2750 per household207 the cost and effectiveness of the schemes is affected by the interaction with other policies that are operating simultaneously while the focus of determining the vel of subsidies is generally on costs under the current regime changes in revenues associated with universal service such as those gained from the abg must also be considered coordination between policies can reduce the overall costs of universal service both in terms of do llars spent and distortions to investment and consumption e5 key issues to consider for funding uneconomic services on the nbn there are differences between the nature of legacy networks and next generation networks which the nbn will be which may change the way we currently think about and achieve universal service for example 205 productivity commission 2001 206 the two differ in that competition for the market will lead to there being only one universal service provider in an area because competition occurs for exclusive provision in certain areas on the other hand competition in the market would involve competition between carriers within uni versal service areas this would oc cur under for example pe r service subsidy scheme 207 rtirc regional telecommunications review framework for the future 2008 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 126 whilst currently telecommunications services are provided using multinetw ork system next generation networks are exp ected to result in one single network capable of supporting all traffic types further clear paration is permitted between network facilities nd services this raises questions as to whether access to services or access to the nbn infrastru cture itself is the relevant universal service objective how the objective is defined may have implications for competitive and technological neutrality it is likely that customers will be prepr ovisioned that is the equipment required to provide different services will be in stalled for each customer regardless of whether they purchase the service or not nd services provided at the application layer the operational costs of connecting consumers to different services will therefore not differ great if at all for different services as it can be done remotely so whilst the nbn is require d to provide entry level voice and broadband to 98 per cent of the population at uniform prices the same infrastructure will be able to provide more advanced services at little if any additional operational cost the capital co sts of providing higher speed services may still be greater for premium services due to the greater backhaul requirements quality concerns for voice services in next generation networks which will be known as voip may be heightened includ ing reliable access to emergency calls interruptions to normal rvice reliance on the power supply to maintain the service jitter on the line access diffi culties virus attack security etc208 in light of these changes and the lessons learned about funding uneconomic services in section e4 the following section consid ers some of the ke issues for funding uneconomic services on the nbn as well as the 2 per cent of premises that will not covered by the nbn e51 costing the subsidy required to fund uneconomic nbn services with the nbn upgrade the costs of providing services and the subsequent levels of funding required to serve unec onomic services may change relative to the legacy network ngns have the potential to redu ce the sometimes prohibitively high costs of supplying communications services to traditionally high cost areas209 this in turn has the potential to reduce the number of uneconomic services and therefore reduce the costs of mandatory provision to unec onomic services or potentially even eliminate the issue within the 98 per cent nb n footprint altogether for example the analysys wireless costing model suggest s that wimax would be lower cost 208 voip is general term for family of transmission technologies for delivery f voice communications over the internet or other packetswitched networks xavier 2006 209 the capital costs of providing services in trad itionally high cost areas will in large part depend on the technologies that are deployed in these areas wireless technologies in particular have the potential to reduce capital costs while still meeting th quality and coverage objectives as set out in the rfp capital costs in these areas will also depend on the extent to which they are already supplied by backhaul that can support broadband services with regard to operational nd maintenance costs operational expenditure for new customer connections is likely to reduce w ith the move to the nbn there is likely to be less need for visits to custom er sites because problems can be repaired remotely and damage to fibre cable say due to rain is likely to occur substantially less than with copper cables confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 127alternative to fttn in bands 3 and 4210 analysys also found that 3g and later generation mobile technologies may similarly be cheaper than wire line solutions in some areas but lack the range and capacity of wimax211 however telstra have disputed these findings stat ing that 3g is more costeffective alternative to wimax its chief technology officer hugh bradlow has publicly stated with respect to wimax i object to my tax dollars being spent on an inefficient solution t hat has future212 the 2008 regional telecommunications i ndependent review committee rtirc report suggests that the lowere d costs of the nbn relative to the copper network will extend competitive markets into regional australia213 in contrast telstra in their regulatory submission to the nb n expert panel argue that the costs of loss making or unprofitable services will grow with the nbn currently the big losses on service provision occur in relation to remote users in non re mote rural areas much of the asset base is written down or off and the cost differential though real is manageable however there will be many more uneconomic services as the expensive infrastructure is rolled out in rural areas214 as noted determining the costs of fundi ng uneconomic services under the current uso system has similarly been open to such divergent views however unlike for the legacy network and the current uso model th capital costs of th nbn rollout will be directly observable rather than bei ng based on hypothetical cost estimates this increases the governments ability to determine which are the true uneconomic services and the cost of funding them ther should therefore be less subjectivity in the future relating to the costs of unive rsal service provisi on as noted the rfp requires that if proponent is proposin g crosssubsidy arrangements wi thin access prices to support uneconomic services or achieve other outcomes the proponent s hould identify these services and outcomes the amounts of the losses and the crosssubsidies separat ely the rationale for them and methodology for their calculation schedule 2 section 144 given that proponents are required to identify and quantify the amount of any cross subsidies and the services they apply to the issue of universal service funding shortfalls should arise to far lesser extent if at all particularly in the short term following the nbn upgrade via the nbn rfp process in contrast to the current system proponents are effectively able to determine the cost of funding uneconomic services there are several access technologies th at could be used to achieve the 12mbps and 98 per cent objectives each with varying capabilities and costs propone nts are able to choose the 210 analysys comparative costing of wireless access technologies in australia final report for the accc 2006 211

service provision proponent s will put forward their proposed mechanisms and costs of funding these and the government is able to favour the most efficient and effective proposal the pro cess is very similar to that noted by the accc in its 2007 submission to th dcita review of the uso the government would set minimum standard of service and request bids from carriers if fully effective the process woul d see carriers submit bids that involve subsidy that reflects the cost of providing the service including rmal rate of return the owner of the most efficient network should win the tender process by virtue of its lower costs the winner of the tender would then be provided with the requested level of subsidy if any in order to provide services under this model there would only be one universal service prov ider in each universal service area215 indeed the oecd notes that competitive tendering is more practical and administratively simpler where new as opposed to existing universal service is to be provided e52 defining the services to which pricing and coverage objectives apply with ngns the delivery of number of previously separate communications services is possible using only one transmi ssion platform as opposed to on the legacy network where the infrastructure required to provide broadband connection is separate from that required to provide voice service and not preprovisioned with the nbn upgrade the same platform that provides voice will also be preprovisioned to provide broadband connection if an enduser is connected to voice service they are also likely to be assured access to br oadband and vice versa further as noted it will not cost the nbn operator more to connect broadband and voice over the nbn than it would cost to connect just voice as connection takes place via remote access however the backhaul costs for each serv ice are likely to differ because voice requires relatively less of this than othe r services hence including nbn pricing and coverage standards for broadband as well as voice should not increase operational costs to the nbn operator relative to if th objectives had only applied to voice but as noted may increase backhaul costs the question could be raised as to whether the focus of universal service should move towards ensuring access to the infrastructu re element that provides next generation network services for example access to the nbn rather than the services themselves universal service objectives would address only access to communications infrastructure on the gr ounds that competitive provision of services for example telephone service provided using voip will ensure their availability and affordability there is considerable debate as to whethe r this is the way forw ard ofcom notes that there may be case for separating the two ements but that it may be premature to conclude that the provision of services will facto ensure the availability and affordability of services to the standards required216 in its submission to the nbn panel on regulatory issues ceg argue that the concept of ubiquity should include 215 accc submission to uso review 2007 216 xavier 2006 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 129the common services delivered over the nb n such as freeto air tv internet and email access the queensland government also suggests that voice data and television should be included in definitions of universal serv ice and the south australian government that universal serv ice should be recast as next generation network able to deliver voice and broadband capability217 the recently released rtirc report also finds that universal rvice should be extended to mobile and broadband but that the current uso framework is not suitable for this hence new uso framework is needed218 in contrast despite the rfps objectiv the communications alliance does not support the extension of unive rsal service beyond voice because covering broadband is likely to be costly and distort compe tition and there is not clear public policy rationale to ensure universal supply of broadband services219 hutchison note that key entry level voice and broadband servic to which uniform retail prices are to apply should be defined minimally to ensure that the distortionary effects of uniform national prices are minimised ideally the mechanism that is chosen to fund uneconomic services would not be one that supports one technology platform over another or one provider over another220 it is important to consider the nature of serv ices that can be offered by infrastructure based competitors for example 3g mob ile networks are currently capable of providing voice and data services hfc networ ks can provide equivalent services to those provided over fibre whilst defining th nbns universal serv ice objectives in terms of access to the nbn infrastructure w ould ensure that all users regardless of where they live are able to access the serv ices offered by the nbn it might impede the ability of alternative in frastructure to compete with the nbn assuming these networks duplicate the nbn rather than form part of it because only the nbn operator will be entitled to receive an subsidy for funding uneconomic services on the other hand defining the nbns coverage objectives in terms of services such as access to voice and access to broadband could be competitively and technology neutral any operator who pr ovides these services at the constrained retail price would be entitled to subsidy so comp etitor or technology would be favoured over another ultimately the difference between the two is that access to infrastructure the nbn would mean the nbn operator would be the only universal service provider whilst access to services could allow multiple operators to be universal service providers however subsidising different technologies in one area may affect the performance of that technology across all areas for example if 3g technology is deployed in traditionally high cost areas and subsidise d this may effect competition investment and use in the mobile market in metropo litan areas the common costs of which coverage is one across all regions associ ated with the universal service operators 3g mobile network that must be directly recovered from consumers will be reduced 217 queensland government submission to the australian government on regulatory reforms to be implemented with the national broadband network 2008 south australian government submission on

only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 130relative to those that an unsubsidised mob ile operator would have to recover hence this may distort all mobile markets furt her the subsidised 3g operators revenues would also be subsidised to the extent that coverage can be used as marketing tool it is unclear how large these effects will be and which markets could be affected but it is nonetheless likely to be an important consideration when assessing proposals another implication of the move to ngns is that how capital costs which will largely be common to all nbn services are allocate d across services will affect the services price and correspondingly wh ether it is affordable if the nbn operator chooses not to allocate large amoun t of costs to key entry level services but rather allocates the bulk to nonkey entry level services uniform retail prices for key entry level services could be achieved without the need for funding mechanism however presumably this would make nonkey entry level services to which uniform pricing constraints do not apply even less accessible in high cost areas which may or may not be desirable to government it would also likely affect the takeup of these services in all areas this highlights that how proposals define services and their prices are important considerations when assessing the mechan isms put forward to fund uneconomic key entry level services e6 efficiency considerations the benefits of social po licy objectives such as the nbns price and coverage requirements are widely believed to outwei gh the costs of achiev ing these objectives as noted in general societies value that all members of that society receive the same basic communications services irrespective of where they live who they are or the cost of delivery of those rvices further the provision of basic communications services assists the broader economic and so cial development of locations that are geographically distant from established urban centres nonetheless it is still importa nt to recognise that there are costs involved in achieving uniform retail pricing and coverage object ives for example such objectives may restrict or distort competition and availabi litychoice of technology in ruralremote areas such objectives may have adversely affected the rollout of next generation networks if the services pr ovided over such networks w ould have been relatively more attractive to consumers were the true costs of the alternative the legacy copper wire reflected in retail prices benefit those who do not need subsidies because many universal service programs are generally not means tested and some in receipt of the benefits of these objectives may be able to afford to pay for them discourage potential market entrants faci ng the prospect of competition against subsidized provider offering rvices at prices below cost and deter entry due to the additional costs that universal servi ce policies impose on market participants especially if they are made to contribute to usf that is used to transfer funds to the designated uso provider be wasteful if they apply blunt one size fits all approach whereas consumer preferences can differ markedly and confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 131 impose considerable cost on consumers who may bear the final incidence of universal service levies and costs imposed on operators221 in light of this it is desirabl that the approach taken to supporting univer sal service is the most efficient and creates the least distortion to consumption and investment possible this section highli ghts the efficiency considera tions that will need to be taken into account when assessing the m echanisms for supporting universal service put forward in proposals e61 relative efficiency of altern ative fund raising mechanisms cross subsidies in light of the considerations in section e4 internal crosssubsidies or regulated cross subsidy such as an adc may t be favourable as basis for funding uneconomic services on the nbn servicebased retail market competition on the nbn will likely mean that cross subsidies between retail cu stomers are unsustainable however this will depend on the nbn operator not having market power in the provision of any of its retail products if it has the ability to charge price above cost for any of the retail products it provides it may be able to char ge price below cost for other retail products the anticompetitive implications of this are discussed in section e63 competition in the provision of all services would seem consistent with the rfps objectives and means that reta il level crosssubsidisation will not be sustainable the sustainability of crosssubsidies at the wholesale level will depend on whether there is competition in the provision of w holesale services say because servicebased competitors are able to build their own networks to compete andor because there are alternative platforms from which service based competitors can purchase wholesale services if there is competition at this level averaged acce ss prices will not be sustainable as discussed in section e4 these issues have been extensively examined in the australian context in the past one of the key considerations in assessing the effectiveness and desirability of averaged wholesale prices is the potential for bypass as noted averaged wholesaleaccess prices across regions should only be adopted if bypass efficient or inefficient in metropolitan areas is either banned or is not technically or commercially feasible the ex istence of alternative infrastructure such as optus hfc network in the capital citie s transacts fttn network in the act and 3g wireless networks hi ghlights that bypass of the legacy network in metropolitan areas can occur key consid eration is whether bypass of the nbn in metropolitan areas is likely to occur the rfp expresses preference that exis ting infrastructure capable of providing minimum speeds of 12 mbps should not be duplicated by the nbn specifically the rfp notes that 221 productivity commission 2001 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 132the commonwealth expects that there will not be economically ineffic ient duplication of existing fttn or fttp infrastructure prop onents are also encouraged to consider interconnecting with existing fttn or fttp rollouts rfp clause 1520 and the extent to which existing infrastructure is to be utilised in the nbn and the extent to which existing infrastructure is already capable of delivering minimum dedicated downlink speed of 12 mbps over each connection schedule 2 1113ai these requirements imply that assuming bypa ss is possible averaged access prices would not be desirable as averaged access prices could encourage inefficient duplication in metropolitan areas on the other hand the preference for hooking up the nbn to existing infrastructure could mean that network that was once competing with the gacy network for example hfc in metropolitan areas and 3g in regional areas will longer be competing network but rather will be part of the nbn this might mean the nbn has sustainable monopoly that bypass is not pos sible and therefore that averaged access prices may be sustainable indeed to the ex tent that lower cost technologies such as wireless are used on the nbn in regional areas the cost of providi ng services in these traditionally high cost areas may fall leading to less disparity between cost s in regional and metropolitan areas this w ould further support uniform access prices evidence of reductions in the differences be tween costs across regions would need to be supplied to support averaged access prices if the nbn does duplicate existing networks and compete with them averaged access prices would be unsustainable if compe tition from alternative networks drives down the access price the nbn opera tor could charge in metropol itan areas mechanisms to prevent this from happening eg overbuild protection may encourage additional inefficient bypass in these areas in regional areas if for example the nbn uses higher cost technology such as fibre as opposed to wireless t echnologies that is supported by crosssubsidies at the wholesale level lower cost technology may be unable to compete despite it being the more efficient alternative in contrast averaged access price may encourage the doption of more effici ent technologies in regional areas and would not lead to inefficient duplic ation in metropolitan areas submissions to the nbn expert panel on regula tory issues appear to support averaged access prices or at least seem not to r ecognise that other funding mechanisms are available to fund the rfps pricing and coverage objectives for example the south australian government argues that all as pects of nbn pricing should be uniform including wholesale services222 transact argue that nationally the uso deficits will net to zero if the access price wholesale access revenue per line treating sts and broadband lines equally is set to ensure this this will mean that some areas ie the metro areas will effectively be ta xed to provide crosssubsidy to high cost areas the amount of the crosssubsidy can be reduced if the 47bn com mitted by the commonwealth is treated as grant another virtue of this approach is t he simplicity of the 222 south australian government 2008 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 133funding being collected at source in access pri ce surcharges rather than from an invoice based on retailer revenues223 optus state that whilst individual customer connection costs will differ the price charged for connection will likely be set to recover the average costs of providing coverage to 98 per cent of the population hence further funding will be required within the coverage area as the pricing agreed under the new regulatory regime will be sufficient to cover the costs of constr uction and connection of new customers in rural as well as metro areas224 telstra recognises the potential for ineffici ent duplication with averaged wholesale prices it submits that if averaging at the w holesale level is to be implemented its first preference being for the governments nbn pricing and coverage objectives to be directly funded by the government averagi ng must not be implemented inflexibly as the revenues from which crosssubsidies would be funded are open to erosion by cherrypicking that is access seekers bu ilding their own competitive infrastructure in low cost areas in turn reduci ng the nbn operators revenue base225 telstra note that it will be important to take into account the fact that nbn will face compet ition from other next generation networks such as hfc 3g and fixed wireless they will be able to cherry pick the most profitabl customers whether in metro or nonmetro areas undermining internal crosssubsidies wi thin the nbn service telstra then goes on to argue that there would need to be mechanism to ensure that the nbn owner is not trapped into averaged prices in res ponding in competitive areas and that deals with the eroded cross subsidy that was ot herwise available to fund the loss making areas this of itself highlights that av eraged wholesale prices will not be sustainable mechanism for funding the nbn s pricing and covera ge objectives and that they are likely to lead to ine fficient duplication of infrastructure nextgen also recognises these effects submitting that with averaged prices subsidies flowing from city users to regional and rural areas will lift the prices of services to city users providing an incentive for cityb ased service providers to deploy alternate access networks and undermine the nbn business case226 are uniform retail prices sustainab with deaveraged access prices some of the submissions to the nbn pa nel on regulatory issues suggest that stakeholders do not believe uniform retail prices are sustainable unless access prices are also uniform this is however not the case it might be likely that deaveraged cost reflective access prices would lead to access prices in regional areas that are above retail prices which with competition in metropolit an areas would reflect the costs of providing the services in metropolitan areas if th is is the case it would be unattractive for access seekers to purchase access and compete in regional areas because they would make losses from doing so by the same token it would be unattractive for the nbn operato r to provide services in these regions because they would also make losses from doing so assuming access seekers purchase access 223 transact the national broadband network blueprint for the 5th utility 2008 224 optus 2008 225 telstra submission on nbn 2008 226 nextgen networks national

would come fr om retail customers to whom it would have to charge prices that reflect the costs of providing services in metropolitan areas the nbn operator would therefore be at risk of not recovering its costs in these areas however as noted there are several m echanisms that can be used to fund uneconomic services in the case above compensation could be provided to any operator access seeker or nbn operator for losses incurred in servicing uneconomic services this could be achieved via perservice subsidy scheme with funds coming from usf discussed below this type of arrangement would permit multiple carriers to be registered as univer sal service providers in the one area the carriers would then compete for customer s and receive universal service subsidy payments based on the number of custom ers they serve u nder this approach consumers get to choose which carrier provi des the best service rather than the government choosing the provider that then serves all us ers in the area under these arrangements the nbn operator would recover their costs because they receive the costreflectiv access price from access seekers and are compensated from the usf for supplying directly to reta il customers for whom the retail price is below the cost access seekers would also be compensated for their losses by the subsidy so efficient competition in high cost areas would not be deterred further they would only be encouraged to bypass the nbn in metro areas if they could provide services using their own network at lower cost than the nbn operator so only efficient investment should take place it is also important to bear in mind that the rfp does not require the nbn operator to provide services to the last 2 per cent of premises these last 2 per cent of premises are likely to be the highest cost areas if the cost differential across regions within the 98 per cent nbn footprint is not large that is if the technologies deployed in different areas are such that the costs of pr oviding services in different areas within the 98 per cent footprint are broadly the sa an averaged access price could be more or less cost reflective put anothe r way the degree of averaging across areas within the 98 per cent footprint would not be large because the costs across the different areas would be much the same universal service funds where should the funds come from as noted revenues for usfs can come from industry consumers or general taxation revenues each of these options is now discussed general taxation revenue the cost of achieving the nbns coverage and pricing objectives could be funded directly by the government for example the governments up to 47 billion commitment to the nbn if provided as subs idy could be used to fund the rollout of infrastructure to support uneconomic rvices this would imply that the governments monetary return on its contribution may approach zero rather consistent with the idea that universal serv ice is government social policy tool the contribution would earn social return funding the nbn pricing and coverage objec tives using general revenues appears to be favoured by some industry stakehol ders for example the communications confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 135alliance submit that their members support government funding227 and telstras view is that as universal rvice objectives are directed at meeting the governments social policy goals they s hould be directly and entirely funded by the government228 in the recent past other subsidised tel ecommunications services have been funded from consolidated revenue such as part s of the rural cdma rollout and the abg there does not seem to be clear justif ication under the present uso system for treating universal services t he voice service differentl to these other services particularly where services are increasingly converging there are advantages and disadvantages to raising funds th rough general taxation mechanisms the advantages include that it is competitively neutral the marginal administrative costs of raising funding through existing taxation mechanisms would be negligible and there are issues relating to sustainabi lity or predictability of the funding mechanism disadvantages include that it could potentially be less efficient than tax on telecommunications products it is difficult to determine which is the leas t distorting mechanism the magnitude of economic loss caused by taxation in australia is unclear but it is likely to be non trivial perhaps as much as 20c per dollar raised229 on the other hand the distortions caused by tax on telecomm unications products will depend on the mix of products the levy is applied to if applied to inelastic telecommunications products explained below the economic loss could be less th an the loss from general taxation mechanism if demand fo r most telecommunications products is more inelastic than the average product in the economy it is possible that levy on any or all telecommunications products would lead to less distortions than general revenue taxation it could be less transparent than if funds were to be raised via levy on telecommunications providers levy on telecommunications providers would give them buy in which would in turn be likely to encourage debate surrounding the level of the subsidy required and indeed if it is required at all on the other hand if funds are sourced from general re venues the level of the subsidy may be more open to manipulation by the nbn operator 227

individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 136industry levy as noted the usf in australia is currently contributed to by industry participants as with funds sourced from general revenues this approach has number of advantages and disadvantages sharing the cost of universal service amongst carriers on the basis of revenue could be quite efficient particularly if the organisations that contribute the majorit of the funds have scope to pass the costs on to consumers in an efficient way230 the ability of carriers to pass the cost of the levy on to consumers depends on the extent to which consumers change their purchasing behaviour in response to cha nge in the price of each firms product firms in competitive ma rkets for example mobile may be less able to pass on the levy because the resul ting price increase would mean consumers switch their purchases to competing product for example fixed voice nonetheless the ability of each firm within market eg mobile to pass on the costs should be the same so the mechanism is competitively neutral the reduction in profit margins available to all firms in the communications industry could create barriers to entry and inve stment and thus impede competition administrative costs could also create ba rriers to entry for example under the current regime administrative costs must be incurred regardless of the size of the carrier however implementation of an eligible revenue threshold below which carriers are not required to submit an elig ible revenue return could go some way to addressing this issue if there is uncertainty as to the level of the levy business planning may be difficult which may deter long term investment further if providers contribute on the ba sis of revenue shares and access revenues are included in these revenues the nbn opera tor may be at disadvantage relative to access seekers in providing services because they would be required to contribute larger amount of funds pe r service than access seekers231 ensuring only retail revenues are included would alleviate this issue as noted above an industry levy may encourage industry buy in and more transparency than funding the usf from ge neral revenues further if the industry levy is administered in way which is tr ansparent to end user s of communications services for example via an itemised amount on end users service bill reflecting the portion of the charge that is being us ed by the carrier to fund their universal service obligation public debate as to whether universal serv ice type policies are desired by the public would be facilitated levy on consumers of telecommunications services fee could be levied directly on consum ers of telecommunications services this could be either flat fee or usage based f ee it could be levied on all connections or only on certain products similarly to as not ed above for the industry levy tax on end users has the potential to make the contribution to the usf more transparent than 230 productivity commission 2001 231 ibid confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 137if the fund were contributed to from gene ral revenues and makes it easier for the public to assess the costs of universal service232 connectionsbased system could involve ny connection to the nbn whether it is used for data or voice or any other application being taxed233 this approach has the potential to raise predictable amounts of revenue through relatively small imposts on each end user234 generally small broadbased taxe s are unlikely to distort economic decisions significantly and the approach would be competitively and technology neutral source of funds since all providers would be included including for example wireless cable and voip providers however in practice this type of system raises number of issues235 in order for all usersconnections to be captured some form of telephone numbe r equivalent that is some way of identifying each end user would need to be assigned to each end user and the charge be levied on that identifier it may not be possible to assign such unique identifier for example ip addr esses are dynamic and so could not be used an alternative could be to use providers cu stomer records however this could mean some end users are taxed twice if they purch ase services from two different suppliers further if the telephone nu mbering system was used end users that only took broadband service would not be taxed and end users that had telephone number for both plain old telephone service assuming th is still operates for some transitionary period and voip servi ce would be taxed twice if tax were applied only on the use of certain products the distortionary effect would depend on how readily consumers switch their purchases in response to price changes the elasticity of demand for those products the economic losses from imposing levy will be higher if tax is imposed on products which consumers will readily stop purchasing in respons to price rise ie that have high elasticity of demand hence the overall distortion from imposing levy on consumers will depend on which types of products attract the bulk of the charge table 1 shows elasticities of demand that ve been estimated for sel ection of telecommunications products based on these figures levy that predominantly impacted the price of local calls would be more efficient than one that imposed the levy on international and long distance calls one per cent increase in the price of local calls would lead to reduction of only 02 per cent in the quantity of local calls dema nded whilst one per cent increase in the price of international calls would l ead to 09 per cent reduction in the quantity demanded of

users and the rich this concern might be addressed by exempting or providing rebate for the poor237 further if an industry levy is passed on to end users on fixed fee basis as opposed to one related to use an industry levy would not perform any better in this regard than flat tax on end users usag based charge either on all identifiers or on certain products would reduce these concerns e7 coexistence with other subsidy programs how the nbns pricing and coverage objec tives are funded will interact with the governments other universal service related policies subsidy programs such as the abg and the communications fund are inte nded to underwrite the provision of adequate services to regions which may si gnificantly overlap unive rsal service areas for the nbn these subsidy programs have important implications for assessing revenues relevant to any determination of the subsidy required to fund the nbns pricing and coverage ob jectives including that if they are to continue to apply and will apply to services provided over the nbn they will reduce the costs of subsidising the nbns pricing and coverage objectives and if they are not to apply to services pr ovided over the nbn they could limit the ability of the nbn operator to earn revenues to help meet its costs if it would have to compete with the subsidised prov ision of broadband on other platforms any future determinations of the level of subsidy required to achieve the nbns pricing and coverage object ives will clearly need to address these issues as broadband is included in the key entry leve l services the nbn ope rator is to provide it may be more efficient to achieve the g overnments pricing and coverage objectives using single universal service tool ra ther than multiple potentially conflicting policies 237 xavier 2006 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 139e8 implementation issues the following section discusses some pr operties that are desirable in the implementation of any funding mechanism including transparency and accountability and ensuring th at proposed mechanisms are nondiscriminatory of note australia is signatory to the wto agreement on basic telecommunications which relevantly states that any member has the right to define the kind of universal service oblig ation it wishes to maintain such obligations will not be regarded as anticompetitive per provided they are administered in transparent nondiscriminatory and competitively n eutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the member in addition appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who alone or together are major supplier from engaging in or continuing anticompe titive practices including engaging in anticompetitive crosssubsidisation hence in implementing universal service scheme these obligations may need to be considered australia has so subscribed to the apec principles on costbased interconnection that discourage the inclusion of internal crosssubsidies to account for the delivery of the uso e81 transparency one of the desirable properties of usf is that it is both visible and measurable transparency can be achieved in number of ways ranging from the publication of the rules and regulations which apply to th uso to the universal service provider having to publish separate accounts for t hose services which are uneconomic and profitable to provide in the absence of transparent robust funding mechanism universal service provider is able to allege that it is not being adequately compensated for services provided in fulfilment of its universal serv ice obligations telstr has in the past claimed that the universal service obli gation coupled with retail price parity obligations makes service provision in commercially unviable areas unprofitable according to telstra this shortfall is not adequately compensated for by the usf this argument was most recently put forward by telstra in its attempt to have wholesale prices for its ulls averaged acro ss australia the lack of any evidence to support or refute the claim makes it difficult to conclusively reject an argument by universal service provider that it is not receiving adequate reimbursement from the usf accordingly the real or perceived s hortfalls of the usf puts pressure on other policy levers to ameliorate or adjust for the shortcomings of the universal service scheme however the presence of transparent funding mechanism would place the onus on the universal service provider to prove that the funding mechanism does not adequately compensate for losses transp arent funding scheme would also be able to adjust if necessary to any deficit or surplus confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 140funding mechanisms which are internal to the universal serv ice provider are effectively invisible and as result it is difficult to obtai n any real oversight over the manner in which uneconomic services are funded the acccs preference is for the funding mechanism to be external to th universal service provider external mechanisms are highly visible and are subject to oversight it should be noted that any funding mech anism used to supp ort the provision of uneconomic services imposes cost upon one part of society in order to assist another as such public debate of the issues surrounding unive rsal service would seem to be important e82 accountability the provision of reliable access to services and in particular emergency services in the nbn context presents some issues which were not present in the pstn context the prioritisation of voice traffic over an ip network technical problems and the reliance on power supply to provide services present additional challenges to the provision of universal service it is difficult for internal mechanisms to impose accountability on service delivery as such external mechanisms will be required to ensure specified level of quality of service is maintained over the nbn such provisions could be contracted into the nbn operators obligations or be set with reference to performance benchmarks the importance of accountability is highlight ed in the rtircs recommendations it recommends that the government develop publish and implement plan of measures to ensure that all individuals and all small businesses can purchase serv ices that meet their communications service standards css wherever they live or work in australia on an equitable basis238 further it recommends that an independent body not subject to ministerial direction be required to conduct an audit at least every three years on the effectiveness of the governments plan of measures in ensuring communications services meeting the standards are available to be purchased by all and this audit be tabled in parliament239 similar measures could apply to services provided within the nbn footprint e83 anticompetitive conduct concerns there may be concerns with any fundi ng mechanism that there is direct relationship between the revenues raised to fund uneconomic services and actual expenditures to support provision of services to these consumers these concerns may be particularly acute in the case of intern funding mechanisms internal crosssubsidies may be used in the shortterm for anticompetitive purposes rather than for service provision for exampl in the nbn context this could be by using the revenues gained from metropolit an users of key entry level voice and broadband services to temporarily allow wer prices to be charged in competitive markets on say presumably initially more expensive services such as high speed broadband clearly defining the services to which the nb ns pricing and coverage objectives are to apply both as the source of revenues and the ta rget of revenues 238 rtirc 2008 239 rtirc 2008 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 141 becomes very important as does monitori ng and enforcing that the flow of funds only occurs between these services this is difficult to do with internal mechanisms another issue is whether nb n operator that also provides services in retail markets will be willing to offer access to nonfacil ity service based operators in low costhigh profit region s on equivalent nonprice terms to what it offers to its retail arm there may be an incentive not to do so in order to prevent the revenue source for cross subsidies being eroded the nbn has the potential to enable greater service layer independence from the main network ch that third party service providers can provide customers access to range of ip ba sed application services without revenues necessarily flowing to the network provider240 if this is the case vertically integrated nbn operator may have incentiv to degrade the quality of service provided by non facility based rvice providers in low cos thigh profit areas so that customers switch back to procuring applica tion services from the network provider in order to sustain intern cross subsidies these issues are of less concern if any wh ere structural arrangements are such that incentives for anticompetitive behaviour are minimised the issue reverts to standard analysis of the adequacy of f unding and how to ensure quality of service standards are maintained and improved upon over time e9 nonubiquity of the nbn the st 2 per cent of premises at the same time as releasing the rfp the minister called for submissions to be made to the rtirc on policy and funding initiative s to provide high speed broadband to the last 2 per cent of premises not services by the nbn the minister noted that this could include enhancing the abg program to achieve outcomes comparable to the nbn these submissions are not related to the rfp process and are considered separately241 it is likely to be important to consider how the mechanism used to fund uneconomic services on the nbn if any is in fact needed interacts with the mechanism used to fund the remaining 2 per cent of premises not covered by the nbns pricing and coverage requirements the rtirc note th impact of the nbn process on their deliberations the complexities on the nbn have made it difficult for this committe to make specific recommendation in some areas relating to the future adequacy of significant telecommunications services accordingly the committee intends to meet after th awarding of the nbn contract to consider the impact of the implementation of the nbn on matters relating to the adequacy of services in regional parts of aus tralia242 if the mechanism for funding uneconomic services on the nbn is internal to the nbn operator for example averaged access prices and the nbn operator does not provide services to the last 2 per cent of premises consideration will need to be given to separate mechanism for funding uneconom ic services for the last 2 per cent of premises 240 xavier 2006 241 rtirc 2008 242 ibid confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 142if an internal mechanism is used to fu nd the last 2 per cent of premises but the operator servicing these areas is not the nbn operator this operator may not have any profitable services from which to source any cross subsidy this firms operations in other areas if they have any at all will presumably be purchasing access from and competing with the nbn this means that the firms revenues and subsequently profits earned in these areas will be c onstrained by the price it pays to access the nbn in these other areas and compe tition andor retail price controls so if the nbn operator is not required to serve the last 2 per cent of premises and another operator does so it ems unlikely that internal crosssubsidies will be viable mechanism for funding the last 2 per ce nt of premises the last 2 per cent could be funded using an external mechanism such as usf if an external mechanism is used to fund the nbns objectives such as usf the mechanism could be used to fund uneconomic services both within and outside the nbn footprint this would likely lead to less distortions in competition and investment between the nbn footpr int and the last 2 per cent another alternative may be that the nbn operator be required to also provide services to the last 2 per cent of pr emises using the same mechanism as used for the nbn footprint indeed if there are actually uneconomic services within the 98 per cent nbn footprint the last 2 per cent of premis could effectively be the only remaining uneconomic services for which funding mechanism is required however currently unlike services provide d over the nbn there is requirement for those operators providing services to th last 2 per cent of premises to set retail prices on uniform basis or with referen ce to the price of nbn services likewise there is requirement at this stage for nonnbn services to provide minimum speeds of 12 mbps though the rtirc note th at the 12mbps will need to be matched in nonnbn areas243 this may result in lower quality services being priced at higher level than the nbn services or lowe r quality services being set at the same price level depending on the policy of the government this may or may not be concern there may be desire to marry up th retail prices for service to the last 2 per cent with those prices offered for nbn services this would be matter of government policy though it would seem that if prices were to be married up using the same funding mechanism as applied for the nbn to the last 2 per cent of premises has the potential to lead to less distorti ons in investment and consumption across regions this perspective is put forward by the queensland government the subsidy to provide broadband service to nonnbn consumers should not be funded through levy on the telecommunications industry the australian gove rnment should fund the subsidy in the same manner in which it has funded the nbn that is th rough an australian government budget allocation244 although this assumes uneconomic services on the nbn will be funded via government subsidy it highlights that consistency in the mechanisms used to fund uneconomic services across regions is consideration on the other hand whilst optus also note the interaction between policies to promote coverage within and 243 ibid 244 queensland government 2008 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 143outside of the nbn footprint they submit that the costs of funding the last 2 per cent should not form part of the consideration of costs and prices for the nbn and that these costs should be considered as part of the governments separate review of the uso arrangements taking into account the number of current gove rnment initiatives to provide funding for telecommunications in remote areas such as the abg e10 conclusion simultaneously achieving the objectives of uni form retail prices for key entry level voice and broadband services and 98 per cen t nbn coverage means that mechanism may be required to fund the pr ovision of services to cons umers in regions that it is uneconomic to provide these services to the costs of providing these services may re duce relative to the legacy network with the nbn upgrade hence there may be less uneconomic services to fund further the nbns coverage and uniform pricing objectiv apply to 98 per cent of services as opposed to 100 per cent for the legacy network depending on the technologies deployed in traditionally high cost areas th ere may be potential for there to be uneconomic services within the nbn footprint of note the nbn rfp requirements extend ex isting universal servi ce objectives from only voice and narrowband to also include broadband further whilst on the legacy network the infrastructure used to provi voice and broadband differed with next generation networks the same infrastruc ture provides the voice and broadband service and the same infrastructure that provides entry level services is able to provide premium versions of these servic at little or extra cost assessing how services are defined and the costs that are allocated to them will therefore be important in assessing proposals proposed funding mechanisms the issues that have arisen with determ ining the level of s ubsidy under the current universal service regime should arise to far lesser extent following the nbn upgrade this is because via the nbn rfp pr ocess proponents will have to explicitly state the technologies and co sts of these technologies they intend to deploy in different regions and the retail prices they intend to charge they are effectively required to explicitly state what the costs of funding uneconomic services if there are any will be this removes the ability of the nbn operator to come forward in the future and claim funding shortfall if there continue to be uneconomic services on the nbn the mechanisms that proponents put forward to fund them must be assessed cross subsidies and adcs have been the least sustainable m echanisms under the current regime internal cross subsidies mean that the pr ices paid for servic diverge from the costs of providing them this has conse quent effects on competition and efficient investment in and use of infrastructure wholesale crosssubsidies that is averag ed access prices are unsustainable if there are large differences in costs across regions and there is competition at t he wholesale level in regions which provid the subsidy eg metropolitan markets however if access seekers in metropolit an areas have other option but to confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 144purchase access services from the nbn operato r that is if there is possibility that the nbn will be bypassed averaged access charges may be viable further if the costs of provi ding services either at the retail level or the wholesale level are similar across regions as there is potential for with the adoption of next generation access depending on the technologi adopted in traditionally high cost areas uniformaveraged access prices w ould also be suitable because they would more or less be costr eflective indeed it would seem that if lower cost technologies are deployed in traditionally hi gh cost areas there is the potential for the uneconomic service issue to fall away altogether or be significantly reduced in addition the nbn operator is not at this stage require d to service the last 2 per cent of premises the cost differentials within the 98 per cent footprint may be sufficiently small such that an averaged uniform wholesale price is broadly cost reflective internal crosssubsidies being internal to the nbn operator lack transparency and accountability further with vertically integrated nbn operator they could lead to anticompetitive conduct concerns australia is obligated under the wto agreement on basic telecommunications to only implement funding mechanisms that are transparent and allow accountability it is important to note that if access pr ices are deaveraged to reflect cost differentials across regions it is still possible to achieve uniform retail pricing objectives direct subsidies can be offered to operators in high cost areas to recover the gap between the uniform retail price and costs hence there would be disincentive to offer retail serv ices in high cost areas at pr ice different to that offered in low cost areas these subsidie s could be sourced from usf usf provides an alternative means of funding uneconomic services to cross subsidies subsidies would be provided from the fund to the operator or operators that provide services to unecono mic regions to compensate them for their losses in doing so the mechanism can be structured such that either one operator for example the nbn operator is the only service provi der in uneconomic regions by only allowing the nbn operator access to subsid ies ie providing subsidies at the wholesale level or multip retail operators provid services in uneconomic regions by providing subsid ies at the retail level it is desirable that funds for the usf are collected in the most efficient and transparent way possible which of the three broad options is most efficient and transparent will depend on the spec ifics of their implementation consideration also should be given to the interrelationship between those uneconomic services provided within the nbn footprint and those services provided to the last 2 per cent of premises in part icular if an operato r other than the nbn operator services the last 2 pe r cent of premises internal mechanisms are likely to be an unsustainable mechanism fo r funding the last 2 per cent of premises on the other confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 145hand if the nbn operator is required to rvice the last 2 per cent of premises it would seem that distortions in competition and investment across regions would be minimised if consistent funding approach were to be taken consideration should also be given to whether it is desirable that there be differences in prices and quality for equivalent services within and outs ide of the nbn foot print currently requirements for quality and price have b een laid out for the last 2 per cent of premises confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 146appendix f structural arrangements and equivalence f1 executive summary the structural arrangements of the nbn will be an important determinant of the nature and scope of competition which will exist in australias communication markets for at least the next 15 years the nbn operator is likely to have market power and if it is vertically integrated that is providing retail as well as wholesale services then incentives and abi lity for it to discriminate against its wholes ale customers is greater than if it only offered wholesale services since the liberalisation of the australian telecommunications market there have been limited opportunities to address the competition issues created due to the presence of vertically integrated in cumbent the nbn process creates unique opportunity to address these i ssues and put in place stru ctural arrangements which will ensure equivalence and promote competition to the benefit of end users one of the commonwealths objectives set out in the rfp is to establish nbn that facilitates competition through open access arrangements that ensure equivalence of price and nonprice term s and conditions and provide scope for access seekers to differentiate their product offerings the accc notes that the use of the word ensure implies that very high threshold needs to be met to demonstrate that this objective has been achieved since the introduction of managed comp etition in 1991 and open competition in 1997 telstra has been subject to an access regime and since 2001 this access regime has been complemented with acc ounting separation measures in june 2006 the government introduced form of functional separation the operational separation framework over telstras fixe dline operations however since coming into effect the operational paration arrangements that pply to telstra have been shown to be ineffective in number of essential areas the accc is of the view that equivale nce in access over an nbn can only be ensured by nonintegrated or fully st ructurally separate d proponent that is vertical integration of any form into dow nstream markets even when subject to functional separation will not ensure equivalence such that this objective has been fulfilled if the nbn operator is vertically integrated there are range of regulatory tools that could be put forward to assist in the pr omotion of equivalence in access to the nbn these tools include horizontal paration functional separation access regulation accounting separation and behavioural undertakings horizontal separation involves the splitting of ownership of potentially substitute functions of business while it may be procompetitive in certain circumstances it can only assist in promoting equivalen ce where it substantially constrains the market power of the nbn operator if not horizontal separation should not be seen as complete alternative for other structural measures rather any horizontal separation measures would need to be c oupled with other mechanisms such as strong functional separation regime in orde r to assist in promoting equivalence confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 147 functional separation when successfully implemented may go some way to addressing concerns regarding equivalen ce in this appendix the accc sets out what it considers to be the minimum requi rements of robust functional separation model to apply to vertically integrat ed nbn operator w ith market power confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 148f2 introduction one of the commonwealths objectives fo r the national broadband network nbn is that it facilitates competition through open access arrangeme nts that ensure equivalence of price and nonprice terms and conditions and provide scope for access seek ers to differentiate their product offerings245 the accc notes that the use of the word sure implies that very high threshold needs to be met to demonstrate that this obj ective has been achieved that is vertical integration of any form into downstream ma rkets even when subject to functional separation will not ensure equivalence such that this objective has been fulfilled nevertheless measures such as strong functional separation model may go some way to addressing concerns regarding equivalence the request for proposals rfp documentati on does not require proponents to have particular structural arrangements instead requesting that proponents submit their proposed arrangem ents for ensuring open access to the nbn including measures or models to ensure that access is provided on equivalent price an d nonprice terms and conditions 246 the rfp does however acknowledge the importa nce of structural arrangements of the nbn when proponent has vertically integr ated operations vertically integrated nbn proponent would own and operate the nbn infrastructure charging third parties to access this infrastructure so that these third parties can service customers in downstream retail markets and operate retail business which uses the nb n infrastructure to provide services to customers it is in the retail ma rkets that the nbn operator would face competition from those third part ies who pay it to access its nbn infrastructure the rfp requires vertically integrated proponent to demonstrate what structural measures or models it proposes to put in place and maintain to prevent inappropriate selfpreferential treatment and ensure that effective open access is achieved on terms required by the commonwealth247 proponents are requi red to specify what measures and models it proposes be put in place to ensure equivalence between itself and its wholesale customers in relation to the supply of interconnection access and other wholesale services 248 however as noted above if proponent submits vertically integrated nbn model there exists structural arrangement that can be put forward that will ensure in the strong sense of the word that services are provided on an equivalent basis 245 department of broadband communications and the digital economy request f or proposals to rollout and operate national broadband network for australia rfp n umber dcon0818

149this paper explores the measures or models which may be implemented by vertically integrated proponent to assist in the promo tion of equivalence between itself and its wholesale customers but will inevitably be unable to guarantee equivalence it is important to note that since the liberalisation of telecommunications markets in australia there have been limited number of opportunities to addr ess the structure of the vertically integrated incumbent tels tra where such oppor tunities have arisen incremental and arguably insufficient steps ve been taken to address both telstras ability and incentives to discriminate ag ainst its downstream competitors and in favour of its own retail arm while in th context of the legacy copper network the structural separation of telstra has been c ontemplated it has neve r been implemented that said in the context of the nbn questions around the appropriate structural arrangements should not be focused on telstra rather they should be focused on the appropriate structure of the nbn operator taking into account the experiences in dealing with the vertically integrated telecommunications incumbent in the pas t importantly the structure of

structural arrangements to pply to the nbn operator in general there was significant amount of support from industry government consumer groups and individuals for structural or at the very least functiona l separation and consequently strong equivalence requirements confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 150optus submitted that existing pr ovisions

the benefits of structural separation would be achieved acacia australia also argued that under structural separation there would be incentives for such provider to engage in discrimination against its wholesale customers255 notably telstra was the only industry part icipant whose submission was strongly in favour of vertical integra tion and strongly opposed to st ructural or functional separation of nbn in opposing structural separation telstra argued that vertical integration enables the most efficient pr ovision of telecommunicat ions services and 249 singtel optus optus

policy within the australian telecommunications industry since 2001 while the structural arrangements of the nb n have been the focus of the regulatory submissions to the nbn expert panel it is important to recognise that discussions around the appropriate structur of the telecommunications industry are not unique to the nbn process while more detailed exam ination of the histor of the industry is contained in chapters 3 and 4 of the repor t this appendix examines the development of vertical separation policy since 2001 the first separation measure to be introduced into the australian telecommunications industry was accounting paration pursuant to the telecommunications act 1991 cth which required the regulat or to develop an account ing separation regime referred to as the chart of account and co st allocation manual the regime however only required horizontal accounting sepa ration between each carriers retail services258 in 2001 the accc introduced its lecommunications i ndustry regulatory accounting framework record keeping rule s issued under section 151bu of the tpa these record keeping rules required lstra to keep vertically separated accounts on historical cost basis and report revenues and costs for telstras retail and wholesale services including its inte rnal wholesale services separately second set of accounting separation rules were implemented by the accc in june 2003 and required vertical accounting sepa ration under current cost accounting basis in addition to this in june 2003 the governme nt directed the accc to implement an enhanced form of accounting separation of telstra this direction required the accc to report on key perfor mance indicators for nonprice terms and conditions that compare service performa nce between retail and wholesale supplied 256 telstra telstra corporation limited public subm ission on the rollout and operation of national broadband network for australia 25 june 2008 257 optus terria austar

the public with greater transparency with respec t to telstras wholesale and retail costs260 the accounting separation regime which is st ill in force at present requires the notional expost allocation of costs ac ross wholesale and retail operations and therefore does not contribute greatly to detecting and remedying specific occurrences of anticompetitive conduct in 2005 the productivity commission complete d an inquiry into the impacts of national competition policy reforms in releasing its final report review of national competition policy reforms261 the productivity commission recommended that quasistructural regulatory remedy for telstra should be considered ahead of its full privatisation in 2006 the productivity commission also expressed clear preference for that remedy being functi onal separation operational separation concluding that262 potential benefits of full structural separation of telstras wholesale and retail arms are not sufficiently large to justify the efficiency and transaction costs that would entail for similar reasons the productivity commissi on stated that it was unconvinced that major horizontal structural changes in this case requiring telstra to divest its cable network would be worth pursuing in tele communications in relation to horizontal separation it was noted that263 precluding telstra from direct involvement in cable networks could pot entially deprive the market of its experience in network developm ent and also the investment capital that it could bring to the process there is also risk that recourse to d ivestiture could reduce general investor confidence and thereby retard rather than enhance t he rate of new network development splitting the cable network from tels tras other assets would again raise range of technological issues and like vertical structural separation it could be procedurally complex and time consuming process with major implications for the proposed privatisation of telstra in april 2005 the department of comm unications information technology and the arts dcita released an issues pape r seeking comments and views from the telecommunications industry and other intere sted parties about whether it would be appropriate or desirable to make furt her changes to the telecommunications competition regime264 an outcome of this review was the telecommunications

integrated firm which retains dominan t market position in many telecommunications markets telstra also owns infrastructure wh ich its competitors need to access and interconnect with in order to compet against it telstra s control over this infrastructure combined with its market position creates an inc entive and the ability for it to favour its own retail business in the provision of access to this important infrastructure telstras vertical integration so creates lack of transparen cy that makes it harder for the accc to effectively enforce the competition regulations 265 the government specified that one of the fundamental aims of operational separation is to provide transparency that telstra is not favouring its own retail activities over the activities of its wholesale customers wh ile allowing telstra to obtain legitimate benefits from vertical integration266 this has been expressed more simply as the concept of equivalence the operational separation regime require d telstra to prepar draft operational separation plan osp directed towards the achievement of the aim and objectives of operational separation equivale nce and transparency and pr ovide it to the minister for approval267 the minister approved lstras osp on 23 june 2006 under the osp telstra has provided that it will maintain three business units wholesale retail and key network and that it will operate these businesses substantially separate from each other the osp includes four strategies aimed at promoting equivalence these include service quality strategy sqs aimed at ensuring the standard of delivery of eligible services268 supplied to wholesale customers is equivalent to the standard of delivery of comparable elig ible services supplied to the retail business units information equivalence strategy ies describes the measures that telstra will implement to demonstrate that the provision of information provided by the key network services business it or the wholesale business unit to wholesale customers about relevant cha nges to telstras network is to the extent possible equivalent to the provis ion of the same or similar information to the retail business unit information security strategy iss ou tlines the measures telstra will adopt to protect confidential information rela ting to telstras wholesale customers 265 telecommunications legislation amendment

crs aimed to ensuring that telstra is responsive to complaints made by its wholesale customers establishes process for resolving disputes between telstra and its wholesale customers and describes the measures that telstra will implement to monitor its compliance with the sqs and the ies in addition telstras osp also provides for price equivalence framework pef which seeks to provide an ongoing assurance that telstra is not favouring its retail arm by supplying services to itself at pri ces which are unjustifiab ly lower than those offered to its downstream competitors the pef requires telstra to conduct imputation testing with the intention of assessing the impact of material price change as defined by telstra on the margin available to efficient competitors under the operational separation model whet her telstras osp should be varied or rectification plan prepared in respect of any contraventions is ultimately matter for the minister the role of the accc is essent ially to investigate and report matters to the minister as appropriate in terms of remedying breach telstras osp can be seen to contain two strikes policy as the accc can only take enforcement action when rectification plan has been vened and rectification plan would only exist where the minister has first required telstra to prepare such plan and has accepted it since coming into effect in june 2006 the operational separation arrangements that apply to telstra have been shown to be in effective in number of essential areas since june 2006 telstra has been able to supply adsl2 services on retail basis only ignore the acccs written advice on imputation testing principles deflect wholesale customer complaints on the basis they were not made under the operational separation plan provide wholeofbusine ss incentives to executives in the ringfenced divisions and require enduser customers who are customers of access seekers to provide telstra retail units with information th at is confidential to the access seeker in senate estimates in june 2008 the ac cc chairman graeme samuel made the following comment about the effectiveness of telstras osp we continue to receive complaints of conduct th at suggest that the obj ective of equivalence which was the objective of the regime is not be ing achieved there have been some instances of conduct since the regimes inception which wh ile it is not clear they breach the operational separation plan do not promote the objective of equivalence which was the fundamental objective of the plan in the first place in rela tion to the other objective of transparency there is some additional reporting that the regime provides however this has been of limited benefit and is at highly aggregated level i guess in summary we would have to say that the confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 155regime is fundamentally unduly complex there is lot of discretion left to telstra there are limited self regulatory mechanisms and undu ly convoluted processes to implement any corrective action 269 the accc is of the view that the operati onal separation regime pplying to telstra is weak form of functional separation which in its current form is not working as government intended the accc has written to the re levant minister advising of its concerns in relation to the apparent shortcomings in the osp first on 6 february 2007 in relation to concerns that telstra was rewarding ostensibly ringfenced technicians for providing retail sales leads and introducing higher quality adsl services for retail customers before advising wholesale customers and second on 27 february 2008 in relation to telstras failure to provide information to the accc in response to formal request made under clause 68 of telstras osp the request required telstra to produce the model it uses to assess its pricing under the pef af ter notifying the accc of material price change to date further action has occurr ed in relation to these matters f5 achieving equivalence through structural separation for the reasons set out below the acccs vi ew is that ensuring in the strong sense equivalence in access can only be achieved by nonintegrated or fully structurally separated proponent full structural sepa ration requires the gal separation of particular assets and activities of vertically integrated entity into separate corporate entities with entirely separate owners shareholders there are number of legitimate reasons why firm may choose to vertically integrate for example vertically integr ated firm can avoid the transaction costs associated with dealing with other firm s eg costs related to establishing and administering relationships with other fi rms these transaction costs can increase when they involve relationshipspecific investments270 or contractual incompleteness vertical integration also allows firm with market power to avoi d series of mark ups over marginal cost that each firm in th vertical chain builds into its wholesale price in order to earn profit referred to in the economic literature as double marginalisation on the other hand vertically integrated firm with market power has both the incentive and the ability to discriminate against its downstream competitors via both price and nonprice means there may also be some vertical diseconomies which may 269 graeme samuel chairman accc senate estimates standing committee on economics 5 june 2008 270 relationshipspecific investment is one which is specifically tailored to the needs of another firm in the vertical production chain and where the value of this i nvestment is significantly reduced outside of this particular relationship confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 156arise as firms take on additional functions which are outside the scope of its core functions and which the firm is not well equipped to perform there is hard and fast rule that more or less integration in particular firm or industry would be optimal at any particular point in time indeed market structures continually change through mergers and acquisi tions as well as di vestiture activities of private firms often this is driven by changes in technology however it may be that in some cases vertical separation can enhance the valu of separated firms that is there may be vertical diseconomies of scope one possible source of such decline in efficiency is loss of management focus as the skills required to operate the two components are distin ctly different in such circumstances the actions of capital markets tend naturally towa rds less integrated structures an example of this is the time warner inc announcement in may 2008 that it would legally and structurally separate from th second largest cable operator in the united states time warner cable inc time wa rner inc president and ceo jeff bewkes commented that after the separation each company would have greater strategic financial and operational flexib ility and would be better pos itioned to compete within their respective markets separating the two companies would also help their management teams focus on realizing the fu ll potential of the respective businesses time warner cable president and chief execu tive officer glenn brit t added further our time warner cable inc separation from time warner also enhances our ability to compete aggressively and perform well in highly competitive environm ent by delivering the innovative telecommunications services that our customers need wh ile making prudent investments to deliver continued value for our stockholders271 in addition to this split time warner so announced its plans to divest its aols dialup internet and advertis ing businesses into separate divisions by early 2009 after merging in 2000 it was noted that in recent times aols financial performance had declined and that the split would allow time warner to focus on creating content rather than distributing it australian examples of companies choosing to structurally separate aspects of their businesses include australian gas light splitting its infras tructure assets from its retail and merchant energy business in 2005 on the basis that the move would create greater longterm value for shareholders272 and toll splitting off its infrastructure assets ports and the pacific national rail business from its logistics busine ss in 2007 regarding the restructure toll stated that dynamic growth op portunities were identified in both businesses building on tolls current strong results and performance273 271 time warner time warner cable agree to separate 21 may 2008 272 see comments by chairman mark johnson in osullivan m agl to fl oat retail assets 1 november 2005 sydney morning herald online version 273 see comments at httprestructuretollcomauhomeasp confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 157there is also the potential fo r structural measures to courage efficiencies as non core functions of firm which it may have been illsuited to perform are divested and management is able to focus on the firms core business operations reflecting this firms will tend to integrate so businesses within vertical chain but not others where firm is not subject to effective competition it may be slow to move to this optimal position or it may liberately choose to re main more highly integrated for strategic reasons in some cases armslength contractual arrangements can better capture efficiencies of vertical integration when compared to the verti cally integrated firm full st ructural separation has the potential to bring grea ter benefits where it would be expected that vertically integrated network operator would have the incentive to favour its downstream affiliates over third party access seekers and it is unlikely that these in centives could be effectively countered through other forms of regulation at general level where there is market power private interests in integration ie interest in profits can diverge from public interest in competition and social welfare an integrated network operator would be expected to have strong incentive to discriminate when it has market power in the upstream market equivalence in access might risk profit contribution ie where materially higher return is availa ble on retail supply than from providing network access services and effective competition in downstream mark ets would result in the erosion of excess profits if access seekers had quivalent access to the upstream input and countervailing incentives such as thos that might exist under the threat of effective competition across all leve ls of production eg if hfc andor wireless networks provided strong competitive constraint are weak implementing full structural separation ma encourage dynamic efficiencies through the promotion of competition in downstream services it may also permit lighterhanded regulation else where such as pricecap re gulation and may increase the effectiveness of targeted regulatory intervention that is required274 however unless the board and management of the firm in question are committed to the outcomes full structural separation may be disrupt ive process there may be some transactional costs associated with parating an entity for example the cost of reorganising the sepa rate businesses 274 for instance structural separation measures would ensure that robu st data will be available to assist in regulatory decisionmaking confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 158a pivotal issue in structurally separating an integrated entity is the question of where to separate given the information asymmetr that exists between the regulator and the firm full structural separation is more likely to occur at the right point and hence be more effective in the situation wh ere the firm is cooperative or voluntarily offers to structurally sepa rate in the absence of full information there is much greater risk that the point of separation will not occur at the optimal point275it is likely that the task of identifying the appropr iate point of separati on is easier in the context of the provision of ne xt generation services than it is in relation to legacy services the singapore government has stipulated fu ll structural separa tion as its preferred structural model for its next generati on national broadband network next gen nbn the singapore next gen nbn tender requires structural separation of the passive network276 operator netco from th downstream service layer277 operators opco furthermore the next gen nbn will require the opco to be operationally separated from retail service providers the si ngapore model differs to others being pursued internationally as fo rm of full structural separation would be applied to the netco that is the opco and presumably other downstream service providers could not own controlling interest in the operations of netco that said singtel has 30 per cent stake in the opennet consortium which was awarded the netco tender on 26 september 2008278 f6 measures to assist in promotin g equivalence in the presence of vertical integration as discussed in section f2 above if proponent submits proposal based on it being vertically integrated nbn operator it is required to specify what measures and models it proposes to put in place to preven t inappropriate selfp referential treatment and ensure equivalence between itself and its wholesale customers279 as noted above vertically integrated pr oponent can go as far as entirely ensuring equivalent open access as such this s ection examines range of second best solutions which may go some way to providing open access and promoting equivalence of price and nonprice terms and conditions but will ultimately not be able to guarantee it it is important that this section is read in this context whether particular structural measur should be adopted will depend upon an analysis of whether it is likely to prom ote effective competition efficient market outcomes and consumer welfare it is di fficult to quantify many of the longterm 275 telstra corporation limited public submission on vertical integration and separation 25

form of analysis consequently any such the analysis needs to be undertaken on quali tative as well as quantitative basis280 there are range of regulatory tools th at could be put forward by vertically integrated proponent to assist in the promotion of equivalence in access to the nbn these tools which are not necessarily mu tually exclusive include horizontal separation although relevant onl in the context of an nb n operator with ownership interests in another network such as an hfc network functional separation access regulation accounting separation and behavioural undertakings functional separation is one model that wh successfully implemented can go some way to addressing concerns regarding equiva lence in this section the accc sets out what it considers to be the minimum requi rements of robust functional separation model to apply to vertically integr ated nbn operator with market power however in and of itself functional sepa ration either used in isolation or in conjunction with any of the othe r tools described in this ch apter is not sufficient to ensure that equivalence will be achieved the accc is of the view that equivalence in access over an nbn can only be ensured by nonvertically integrated or fully structurally separated proponent f61 horizontal separation horizontal separation involves the splitting of ownership of potentially substitute functions of business281 in australia there is level of horizon tal integration in the telecommunications context given that both telstra and optus in addition to provid ing services over the copper access network also own their ow n cable hfc networks telstra in addition owns 50 of the dominant pay tv provider foxtel australia is one of the few countries that permitted the incumbent telecommunications operator to also own an hfc network othe r countries where there is or has been common ownership of cable and telecom ne tworks include denmark and portugal international evidence suggests that the be st prospects for fu llfacilities based competition in telecommunications markets and therefore the strongest case for regulatory rollback is where there is in tense competition between copper and cable networks both networks utilise optical fi bre technology and are ca pable of providing range of services including basic telephony and highspeed broadband services282 particularly with development of new docsis standards to improve broadband speeds over hfc cable networks have the dded advantage of also being capable of providing paytv services 280 this difficulty is recognised in hilmer supra at p221 281 oecd 2001 restructuring public utilities for competition p 8 282 telstras hfc network offers speeds of up to 30 mbps to 17 million home s with the remaining 08 million homes accessing speeds of up to 17 mbps optus hfc network offers speeds of up to 20 mbps to myhome and fusion subscribers and 99 mbps to other subscribe rs as portion of the coaxial network segment is shared between customers actual speeds will decline significantly with each additional user confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 160in its emerging market structures in the communications sector report june 2003 the accc recommended that the governme nt after undertaking cost benefit analysis consider legislati ng to require telstra to dive st both its hfc network and foxtel the accc stated283 the commission believes substantial comp etition benefits would be derived from requiring telstra to fully divest its hfc network and its 50 per cent shareholding in foxtel divestiture of the hfc would intr oduce new infrastructure competitor into the market establishing conditions for incr eased rivalry and innovation in the supply of full range of telecommunications services if telstra were divested of its foxtel shareholding both telstra and foxtel woul d have improved incentives to supply their services to competitors and telstra would ve diminished ability to use its market power to leverage into converged markets in 2005 however the productivity commi ssion in releasing its final report review of national competition policy reforms noted in relation to telstras ownership of its cable network and shareholding in foxtel that though the overseas evidence suggests that the case for horizontal changes is stronger than that for full vertical structur separation it is still far from clear that such changes would deliver future net benefit in an australian context284 more recently in late 2008 the accc reject ed an application from telstra seeking exemption pursuant to section 152at of th tpa from its obligations to supply various declared services to optus within the optus hfc footprint the rationale of the application from telstra was that wher optus owns its own endtoend network competition will be promoted by optus comp eting on that network rather than via access to the pstn the accc however reje cted the application on the basis that such an exemption would amount to discriminatory access policy which may also have the effect of deterring future investme nt in infrastructure the accc also noted that the high content costs faced by optus in its supply of pay tv services limits its ability to achieve economies of scope over its hfc network in contrast to australia in the uk belgium and spain the dominant telecommunications provider was prohibited from offering cable television services in 1997 the dutch incumbent kpn was fo rced by the government to reduce its participation in the cable firm casema from 100 to 20 consequently the telecommunications industry in the neth erlands has become one of the most competitive telecommunications indust ries on an international scale285 in other countries the pressure exerted by regulators combined with some financial difficulties has led incumbents to divest th eir participation in firms that own cable networks following pressure from the ec utsche telekom sold off its last cable networks in 2004 in may 2002 the merg er of telia and sonera the telecommunications incumbents of sweden and finland respec tively was approved 283 accc

the nth lowest monthly average broadband subscription prices as at october 2007 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 161by the ec subject to the condition among othe r things that telia divest its cable television network other examples of horizontal separati on include the formal separation of telecommunications operator att in the ited states att were required to formally separate its longdistance calls business from the regional bell operat ing companies rboc local call services the basic c oncern that led to the breakup was that att had utilised its control of bottleneck local telephone networks to foreclose competitors and crosssubsidise its potentially competitive marke ts286 it was considered that full horizontal struct ural separation would remove the rbocs incentive to favour att over its longdist ance rivals since then the us has moved away from full structural separation between vertically integrated operators the line ofbusiness restrictions on the rbocs which precluded th em from entering longdistance call markets have been withdrawn an option in the current nbn process ma be to consider imposing horizontal separation upon the successful proponent by requiring it to divest any other networks it currently owns andor opera tes and requiring it to undertake not to ownoperate any such networks in future this may provide improved scope for up to three independently owned fixed networks and coul d reduce the need to regulate services in overlapping coverage regions this of course heavily depends on th characteristics eg geographic reach capacity service quality barriers to expans ion of the networks required to be divested and the net result in terms of each separate firms customer base including its position relative to competitors and network ownership when these factors are considered the accc is not satisfied that optus could provide much constraint on services offered over the nbn by comp eting via its hfc network optus has relatively few paytv customers does not own the most valuable content rights which limits its ability to fully compete in offering triple play offering of voice broadband and video services and has subs tantially smaller fixedline voice and broadband revenues than telstra287 accordingly the viability of further expansion of optus hfc network which at pres ent has limited ge ographic coverage288 in australia is questionable on the other hand in the event the nbn was awarded to party other than telstra there is greater possibility that telstr could look to expand geographically and upgrade its hfc network this is for two ma in reasons first by virtue of its 50 stake in foxtel and associated customer base and content rights it is in considerably stronger position than optus in competing on video offerings whether through foxtel or its own online or iptv offerings second telstras dominance in terms of share of fixedline telephony and broadband customers would give it much larger revenue stream to defend and cons equently much stronger incentives to migrate customers to an lternative network were it not to be the nbn operator 286 jamison sichter us experiences with business separation in t elecommunications public submission on vertical integration and separation 287 see chapter 4 of this report for more detail on copper and cable h fc broadband competition 288 optus hfc network is present only in the ca pital cities of brisbane melbourne and sydney confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 162therefore in the context of assessing hor izontal separation as measure to address equivalence consideration as to whether separation would substantially constrain the market power of the nbn operator must be undertaken if not horizontal separation should not be seen as complete alternativ for other structural measures rather any horizontal separation measures would need to be coupled with other mechanisms such as strong functional separation re gime in order to assist in achieving equivalence in any case the costs and benefits asso ciated with requiring horizontal separation would need to be carefully balanced in th context of divesting an hfc network this would include having regard to the direct co sts of divestiture the prospects that this network would be purchased and operated by third party the prospects that this network or other hfc networks would be extended beyond its exis ting footprint to compete with nbn covering 98 of the population and the extent to which hfc networks will be an effective substitute fo r the nbn further relevant consideration is that emerging content delivery mechanisms such as digital tv and online content delivery potentially including iptv app ear to be increasi ng their capacity to compete with pay tv and might in some ci rcumstances diminish paytvs role as key driver for telecommunications infras tructure rollouts accordingly while divestiture of an hfc network may go so way towards promoting equivalence there are doubts as to whether it woul d be sufficient to fully ensure it f62 functional separation functional separation attempts to replicate the incentive properties of structural separation where structural separation cannot be achieved or is not feasible andor where horizontal separation would not be sufficient to provide competitive constraint upon the nbn operator functiona l separation is broad term used to define various models which segregate par ticular assets and other inputs into separate division without requiring sepa rate ownership for that division the key feature of functional separation models is that the network provider operates at arms length from the downstream servic providers it usually requires operations and management separation and carries the potential for decisions to be made independently by the separated division and the rest of the company models implemented internationally require that the separate divisions trade using identical processes including explicit prices for both inte rnal within the same company and external customers in way that can be verified functional separation however is very much second best outcome to situation where there is common ownership between the network owner and downstream retail entity while functional separation can have measurable effect on the incentives to discriminate it creates an ar tificial and fundament internal conflict between the overall profit maximisation obj ectives of the firms common ownership and the separated business units as result firms will typically seek to circumvent its requirements through whatever means are legally available accordingly even the most robust functional separation regimes require extensive ongoing monitoring and enforcement which may be costly confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 163functional separation therefore complement s and ameliorates but does not obviate the need for other regulatory t ools and monitoring functions to deal with the ability of vertically integrated firm to discriminate set out below is an examination of in ternational experien ces with functional separation in the telecommunica tions industry as well as an examination of functional separation models operating in the energy sector in australia this is followed by the acccs views on what it considers to be the minimum requirements of robust functional separation model to apply to vertically integrated nbn operator with market power international experience with functional separation in the telecommunications industry functional separation has been implemented in number of jurisdictions in recent times in relation to existing copper networks in europe functional separation of operato rs with significant market power has had some support the european regulators group has advocated the inclusion of functional separation as supplementary remedy under the current eu electronic communications regulatory framework for markets where general nondiscrimination obligations have been shown to be ineffective289 the ec has since accepted this recommendation in november 2007 the european commissi on presented its proposals for reforming the european union telecommunications framework the legislative proposals provide national regulatory agencies nras with the additional remedy of functional separation as an exceptional re medy subject to the eu ropean commissions supervision the european commission has however been very careful to provide guidelines on the use of functional sepa ration as remedy it believes that in exceptional cases functional separation may be justified where there has been persistent failure to achieve effective non discrimination in several markets and where there is little or prospect of infrastructure competi tion within reasonable time frame after recourse to one or more regul atory actions previously considered to be appropriate290 on 8 july 2008 the european parliament committee on industry research and energy voted to adopt functional separation of telecommunications companies as last resort regulatory tool for national regulators291 by that time some european member states had already commen ced development off such models 289 erg

84 291 under the proposal national regulator may as an exceptional measure require telecoms operators to separate their network services from their content ones by creating separate business unit to run the network services this unit should then provide all network user firms with access products and services on equal terms however the national regulator may apply this remedy only if both the commission and body of european regulators in telecommunications confir m that other measure has achieved effective competition and that without the remedy there is little prospect of future

number of differences to the functional separation models operating in the telecommunica tions industries in the uk and nz for example ringfencing measures in the energy sector generally allow the sharing of some st aff such as human resources corporate services and it staff between ringfenced units 295 see also discussion on page 11 of icrcs ring fencing guidelines for gas and electricity network service operators in the act confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 168o often allow the sharing of informati on systems between ringfenced units do not require board separation between ringfenced units and are enforceable by penalties that ar relatively low compared to those applicable in the functional sepa ration models operating in the telecommunications industries in the uk and nz minimum requirements of robust functi onal separation mode l to apply to vertically integrated nbn operator with market power below is list of what the accc consider s to be minimum requirements of robust functional separation model to apply to vertically integrated nbn operator with market power these are largely based on th functional separation models operating in the telecommunicatio ns industries of the uk and nz given the similarities that can be gleaned between the telecommunications i ndustries of the uk nz and australia arms length transactions requiring that the network owners business dealings with its downstream operations are conducte d in the same way as their dealings with unrelated third parties that is at arms length creation or designation of di screte organisational divisions which are then assigned responsibility for specified operati ons these can either be division of the existing firm or subsidiary company each of these affiliates is ringfenced from other affiliates of the firm the organisation of the firms other affiliates including downstream retai ling affiliates and allocation of remaining operations between them remains at the firms disc retion an effective functional separation regime would require each business unit to have separate business systems which assign control over necessary infrastruc ture operational support systems and information systems eg accounting system s to the ringfenced divisions in addition line of business rest rictions would need to be imposed to prevent other affiliates replicating the functions that have been ringfenced price equivalence measures requiring affiliates pay the same for their access to the network as wholesale customers this involves establishing transfer pricing system and the preparation of separate accounts for the ringfenced affiliates and retail affiliates of the firm that are pr epared on the basis of these transactions this differs from imputation testing m odels as are used in part xib anti competitive or competition investigations which seek to identify for regulatory purposes an implied access price for affiliates by deducting an estimate of higher layer costs from average retail prices that are offered without ex separation of the relevant business its however there is requirement that this implied price must reflect the same tariffs faced by wholesale customers further there is requirement under an imputation testing only model for retail or wholesale affiliates to account for their use of th network on an arms length basis nonprice equivalence measures requiring that the sa access products are offered and the same processes and systems are used to provide operational support service qualification and provisioning fault handling and billing to the retail and wholesale customer facing affiliates and to access seekers equivalence in technical quality is promoted by the use of the same access products while equivalent operational qual ity is promoted by the use of the same operational confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 169support systems296 this differs to more lighthanded approach that permits differences in processes provided that sp ecified measures of relative performance do not differ this alternative approach provides less assurance and is dependent upon robust and encompassing measures being designed and implemented and even then permits targeted discrimination governance arrangements where each business unit employs separate staff that is staff would be prevented from being employed within more than one business unit or transferring between them to be most effective th is obligation should extend to all staff including all employees di rectors and officers each business unit is required to occupy parate premises with direct reporting lines to senior management for ringfenced divisions in addition remuneration and incentives including shortterm incen tive schemes such as annual bonuses as well as long term incentive and remuneration schemes for all staff in ringfenced divisions be on unit performance and independently of wholeofbusiness performance strong governance arrangements should include oversight by body similar to the equality of access board that was establ ished in the uk to report and advise on bts compliance with its ringfencing obligations297 enforcement provisions to deal with breaches functional separation models should be implemented pursuant to legi slative framework that permits court enforcement and imposition of penalties andor injunctions in respect of established breaches the greater the size of the potential penalties the greater the deterrent in the uk financial penalties fo r breach of bts operational separation regime may be up to 10 of relevant turnover298 in new zealand the breach of the separation undertakings by telecom c ould result in pecuniary penalty of up to 10 million for each breach plus 05 million per day for continuing breaches299 the accc is of the view that pecu niary penalties for breaches of functional separation regime to apply to vertically integrated nbn operator with market power should at least be comparab with the current penalties for breach of the standard access obliga tions set out in section 152ar of the tpa being maximum of 10 million for each contravention300 while these measures can be important to effectively deter discrimination this is not to say that under func tional separation model more transactional work is placed onto the regulator on the ry these models aim to reduce the need for regulatory intervention on points of detail this is by i establishing organisation arrangements that reduce incen tives to discriminate and ii creating independent oversight of the network ope rators management of complaints and 296 the issues surrounding equivalence in process vs product are elaborat ed on in appendix h 297 see clause 109 of bts undertakings provided to ofcom pursuant to ction 154 of the enterprise act 2002 uk 298 see section 97 of the communications act 2003 uk 299 see

of the telco act empowers the accc to institute proceeding in the federal court for the recovery of pecuniary penalty not exceeding 10 million in respect of each vention of subsection 681 of the telco act confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 170alternative dispute resolution mechan isms such as the uks office of telecommunications adjudicator equivalence of information whereby access seekers and ringfenced affiliates have equivalent access to information in ddition procedures need to prevent access seekers information that is provided to the network services unit or the managed wholesale services unit from being disclose d to the retail unit it is important that access seekers have full confidence in the f act that vertically integrated access provider cannot pass on information to its retail arm in relation to the retail customers of access seekers information security and equivalence measures are important to ensure the promotion of dynamic efficiency and innovation for example in the circumstance where an access seekers requires modification of the access service to enable new product to be offered in the retail market there needs to be sufficient mechanisms in place that prevent the access provider sharing this new idea with its retail arm prior to its competitors launch the accc is of the view that the current telstra osp and the supporting legislative framework would not provide suitable mode l to implement functional separation for the nbn operator in telstras current osp many of the organisational arrangements listed above are missing or are so weak they can be readily circumvented f63 access regime an access regime generally establishes legal rights for third parties to access and use an incumbents infrastructure services on reasonable terms and conditions concurrently the incumbent is required to provide access to third parties to declared services in australia the current telecommunications access regime was introduced in 1997 via part xic of the trade practice act 1974 tpa under part xic an access provider is required to provide access to an access seeker for certain declared services where an access provider and an access seeker are unable to reach commercial agreement on terms and conditions of access the accc is required to arbitrate disputes subject to consideration of the criteria set out in section 152cr of the tpa access regulation typically tries to minimi monopoly pricing and seeks to promote downstream competition by allowing competitors access to certain essential bottleneck infrastructure it appears that while the operation of an access regime can help address the monopoly pricing problem arising from c ontrol of natural monopoly infrastructure it is arguably less effective in promoting equivalence in nonprice terms of access this arises from the risk that equivalence in access poses to profit contribution from downstream affiliates and difficulties in the regulator identifying the price servicelevel and other nonprice terms of access at which the vertically integrated provider supplies its own affiliates and associated lays in mandating equivalence through existing regulatory measures confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 171delays in equivalence in turn harm the competitive process further this harm can potentially extend beyond any initial pe riod of delay of equivalent access downstream affiliates may gain firstmover advantages301 that can entrench their pricequality offers in introducing legislative framework to s upport operational separation of telstra the government noted that an access regime one may not be sufficient to prevent discrimination the current regulatory regime has enabled competition to develop in the telecommunications market but it has not fully prevented telstra from discriminating i n favour of its own retail operations addressing th is issue at this time is important to enable competition to continue to develop302 f64 accounting separation measures accounting separation is nonstructural measure primarily aimed at increasing transparency of pricing vertically inte grated operators accounting separation essentially comprises scorecard of ne twork operators relative performance on average and in respect of some aspects of access in providing access to affiliates and third parties while these measures do not directly guard against discriminatory conduct in relation to pricing they can provide degree of transparency to thirdparty access seekers over network operators re lative performance this increased transparency could in certain circumstances promote efficient entry and exit by access seekers andor complement the effectivene ss of other forms of regulation to promote equivalence303 while accounting separation is primarily aime d at increasing transparency of pricing matters certain nonprice measures such as key performance indicators on nonprice terms and conditions can also be component as discussed earlier in section f4 an enhanced accounting separation regime has been imposed on telstra since 2003 howe ver as noted in the explanatory memorandum to the legislative framework fo r the operational separation of telstra accounting separation models that have opera ted do not appear to have contributed materially to the promotion of competition this could reflect inherent limitations in the ability of expost regulation to provide timely and effective remedies for instances of discrimination which may be identifie d through accounting paration measures as such the ability of accounting separa tion measures to counter incentives to discriminate are limited alternatively this co uld be due to limitations in the nature or scope of the reported measures providing li ttle ability to detect material forms of discrimination would be read ily detected for instance 301 such as by contracting enduser customers or selling servicespecific c pe 302 telecommunications legislation amendment competition an d consumer issues bill 2005 explanatory memorandum 2005 at p2 303 transparency of itself would not be expected to promote entry without the credible threat of other forms of regulation that could quickly remedy identified discrimination hence while accounting separation may complement other forms of regulation it will be insuffi cient to provide an effective substitute source hilmer supra at p220 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 172 reported performance measures are nece ssarily of an average nature and hence are able to mask targeted di scrimination eg against potentially disruptive entrant reported measures can be of notional na ture eg in respec t of pricing they have not required transferpricing and full separation of accounts but rather are based upon modelling assumptions around efficient cost of service provision the reported measures are necessarily provided at the end of the reporting period and hence there can be delays in discrimination being detected the nonprice performance measures are necessarily limited in scope and hence care must be taken in interpreting these data304 f65 behavioural undertakings behavioural undertaking can be descri bed as commitment by firm to regulator court or government to take particular action or refrain from taking particular action even though such an action may be profit maximising to be effective behavioural undertak ings need to be capable of being implemented adhered to and monitored furthermore in circumstances where they are breached they need to be capable of being enforced and penalised behavioural undertakings could be suitable means by which to mitigate against identified instances of discriminatory conduct generally speaking behavioural undertakings are set of ongoing remedies which seek to constrain firms behaviour in relation to specific price and or nonprice matters section 87b of the tpa allows the accc to accept written undertaking given by person in connection with matter relating to power or function of the accc under the tpa that is there needs to be substantial relationship between the conduct complained of and the undertak ing accepted these undertakings are commonly known as s87b undertakings in relation to s87b undertakings the accc has outlined in its merger guidelines that it has strong preference for structural unde rtakings noting that behavioural remedies are rarely appropriate on th eir own to address competition concerns however on occasion behavioural undertakings may be appropriate as an adjunct to structural remedy 305 the accc also noted in its rger guidelines that it is pa rticularly rare for the accc to accept behavioural remedies that apply on permanent basis due to the inherent 304 for instance under its current operational paration plan telstras reported kpis do not measure technical equivalenc and so telstra can report that th ere has been material discrimination in wholesale adsl services whilst supplying higherquality xdsl ser vices such as adsl 2 only to retail units other known limitations concern the in ability to measure accuracy of service qualification data provided to access seekers or measure incidence of other impediments that disc ourage placement of orders 305 accc merger guidelines november 2008 pg 63 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 173risk to competition combined with th monitoring and enforcement burden such remedies create306 where person has breached s87b undertak ing the accc may seek an order from the court directing the firm to comply with the undertaking or compensate any other person who has suffered loss or damage as result of the breach however monitoring compliance with the undertaking tablishing breach and then gaining resolution via the court process is likely to take some time and be costly even in the circumstances where clear breach can be established the alinta case provides recent example of the accc seeking an order for breach of behavioural undertaking and the timef rames involved in seeking remedy in october 2004 alinta gave behavioural undertaking to the ccc under s87b of the tpa as part of its acquisition of the da mpier to bunbury natural gas pipeline the accc required alinta to give undertakings to the accc in order to address potential competition issues arising from that fact that alinta would become an owner and manager of the pipeline as well as shi pper on the pipeline the undertakings sought to prevent alinta from using its part owne rship of the pipeline and management role to discriminate against other gas sh ippers that used the pipeline in september 2006 the accc filed proceedings against alinta in the federal court for breach of the undertakings over the period 23 january 2006 until 6 october 2006 the accc alleged that an alinta employ ee was seconded to the pipeline business and involved in commercial negotiations in breach of the undertakings the court handed down decision in augus t 2007 requiring alinta to make certain declarations that it had breached these unde rtakings and ordered it to pay the acccs costs307 the reason the utility of behavioural undertak ings is limited is that they do not directly realign the incentives of the busin ess entities with which access seekers deal to gain access rather the undertakings must be taken in an iterative fashion with each revision preceded by detailed inquiry to overcome informational asymmetry between the regulator and th access provider and which can then be followed by the emergence of new instances of discrimi nation to be effective behavioural undertakings need to contain workable mechanisms for the ongoing monitoring compliance and investigation of th specific terms of the undertaking further existing regulatory structures applying to lecommunications do not lend strong support to this appro ach unlike other regulatory regi mes in australia or those applying to telecommunications ma rkets in other jurisdictions308 part xic does not 306 accc merger guidelines november 2008 pg 63 307 accc media release 23507 29 august 2007 federal court declares alinta breached s87b undertakings 308 for instance cmt the spanish regulator has required telefonica ens ure equivalence in the local loop information systems which are termed service qualificati on systems

submits an undertaking that would allow for all ac cess seekers to be covered is at its discretion in the absence of credible threat of further regulatory intervention the access provider has little incentive to provide robust undertakings that would constrain behaviour it considers beneficial at wholeofbusiness level f7 effect of nbn build whether vertically integrat ed operator of the nbn woul d have strong incentives to discriminate will depend upon the characteri stics of the nbn its operator and the access and other regulatory arrangements proposed for it that said it is clear that vertically integrated nbn operator will be able to discriminate over matters such as provisioning and fault repairs as well as the availability of network information and operational support systems the nbn operator would likely have strong incentives to do s especially where facilitiesbased competition is weak access prices are regulated and costoriented and retail services are not downstream service differe ntiation is supported costs are also fixed and present in do wnstream service provision andor downstream margins are expected to be high there is the potential for the nbn build or other developments to alter the network operators incentives to discriminate in reaching its draft view to reject th fanocs special access undertaking the accc expressed the view that the proposed operator of that network would be to some degree vertically integrated and leaving price and nonprice terms of access to its discretion would give rise to competiti on concerns in its dr aft decision the accc considered that vertically separated ownership model coul d reduce incentives for the access provider to discriminate between downstream users of the access service and therefore facilitate strong and effective competition between access seekers in retail markets where such an ownership model is in place the accc considers the need for regulatory oversight of nonprice terms and conditions of access in par ticular could be relatively low310 f71 incentives to discriminate as noted above vertically integrated network operator with market power will retain incentives to discriminate excep t where market developments andor access 309 rather price and nonprice terms of access are either commercially negotiated between relevant parties or determined by the accc through the dispute reso lution framework established under part xic of the tpa this framework reflects negotiate arbitra model by which parties are encouraged to seek agreement on terms and conditions of access to d eclared services through direct bilateral negotiations 310 accc december 2007 draft decision assessment of fanocs special access undertaking in relation to the broadband access service p6 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 175and other regulatory arrangements make it i ndifferent between wholesale or retail supply while functional separation can redu ce vertically inte grated operators incentives to discriminate against its competitors it may also have the effe ct of reducing its incentives to innovate and invest however any loss in dynamic efficiency should be weighed up agains t the negative effect on downstream competition this is noted by ofcom where it states equivalence of input and functional separation have the potential to minimise the ability of upstream monopolists to discriminate and remove the incentive for i nefficient investment resulting from the ability to leverage upstream mark et power it would be possible to improve bottleneck asset owners incentives to inves t by allowing it to act anticompetitively by leveraging its market power in the downstream market one of the major risks of regulatory forbearance on next generation access but the c ost of doing so is in terms of the long run dynamic benefits of competition 311 the following arguments have been advanced in regulatory proc eedings before the accc as well as by telstra in its re gulatory submissions on the nbn process312 in support of the view that th operator of next genera tion access network may not have strong incentives to discriminate fixed investment it has been argued that the scale of inve stment required to build next generation network will counter incentives for the ne twork operator to discriminate as it will want to sell next generati on services through all available channels to minimise demandside risks313 it is possible that changes in the quantum of sunk invest ment of the network operator will alter its incentives but it is not clear that this will ne cessarily reduce incentives to discriminate for instance depending upon other regulatory settings such as how closely access charges are oriented to the cost of providing access vertically integrated network operators incentives to discriminate may be heightened telstra has previously expre ssed the view that it is the ability to supply downstream higher value add services which will ge nerate the demand and margins needed to justify the business case for th upstream network investment314 if margins on downstream services are required to fund the nbn then incentives to discriminate would appear to be more compelling for the nbn operator than those observed today where regulation might otherwise pr eclude them from being realised 311 ofcom future broadband policy approa ch to next generation access 26 september 2007 at p74 312 telstra corporation limited public submission on vertical integration and separation 25 june 2008 313 ofcom has recognised that incentives to discriminate can be reduc ed by the level of demand side risk associated with next generation services and the potential for downstream rivals to help grow overall demand for access provided the network ope rator is able to profit from providing access however ofcom still considers that functional sepa ration will promote equivalence source ofcom

individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 176it is of note that the capital requirement of the operator of th nbn may be reduced by proceeds generated from the sale of re dundant assets eg freehold or leasehold over exchange buildings and copper cables for example kpn the dutch incumbent anticipates that asset sales will substantially fund its inves tment in its next generation network315 access to already depreciated elements of the existing customer access network ducts and copper loops esp ecially where fttn architecture is implemented316 however this will ultimately depend on whether the written down value of existing assets is fully reflected in access prices the level of public funding and the cond itions on which it is provided eg whether the public funding is provide d on nonrecourse basis andor whether the funds are provided on fully commercial basis fixed costs in downstream service provision downstream service provision may also re quire investment in cluding in network equipment such as switches routers application servers and interexchange transmission used in the co re network in retail capita l equipment including billing and customer relationship management sy stems and content competing service providers will likely seek to invest in their own capacity as means by which to differentiate their downstream service offeri ngs as consequence diversifying sales channels would not completely remove ll demandside risk faced by vertically integrated network operator reducing other barriers to entry it has also been suggested that the nature of the nbn and the ngn services that will be supplied over it will reduce barriers to entry and exit by supporting greater access to customers by multiple service providers simplifying access to the nbn at the transport layer317 and simplifying downstream service development and distribution while these factors may well reduce some ba rriers to entry and exit of themselves they do not address whether the potential fo r discriminatory access to the physical network and transport layers would remain consequently this barrier to entry would not reduce simply as result of migrating to nbn that is operated by vertically 315 kpn 20f sec filing of koninklijke kpn n v 3 may 2008 316 telstras fixed asset statement submitted der the telecommunications industry

for vertically integrated networ k provider to discriminate for instance bt has incurred significant cost s to reorganise its fixedline businesses into vertical chain but cons iders that the benefits to it of implementing functional separation have outweighed these costs it can be observed that bts share price did not deteriorate and has outperformed its peers since it agr eed upon functional separation countering telstra s claims to the contrary although costs would likely be significant it could be that certain anticipated costs would not arise or be of lesser order due to the paration being implemented as part of wideranging investment in next generation access network as next generation access network will require movi ng distribution nodes and replacing many elements of the physical network layer nd the transport prot ocols there is correspondingly high need for downstream rvice providers to make coordinated changes to their networks and services it is contentious point as to whether paration impedes this investment being made kip meek in support of telstras regulato ry submission to the nbn expert panel noted the demand risks and uncertainties associated with

broadband network probity clearance 178the nbn architecture and proposed access and regulatory arrangements will all influence the extent to which the network will support downstream service innovation for instance standardised netw ork protocols can provide robust basis for downstream providers to invest in new or better quality services and to supply them to the extent supported by the access network architecture in the presence of access regulation to unbundled local loops comp eting service providers have invested in overlay networks and supplied higher quality xdsl services over the existing access network322 similarly provided appropriate regulatory arrangements were in place over access to the nbn and operational support systems dow nstream providers will be able to invest in and supply new or higherquality services and applications to the extent permitted by that network architecture that is as the nbn would comprise next generation access network that would be capable of supporting very highquality services such as vdsl the nbn should in crease the frontier of downstream service innovation that would require or modest incremental investment in the access network and support systems further it is unclear how vertical integration woul d overall provide efficient incentives for investment in new or impr oved services vertical integration would tend to increase competing service providers concerns that their business plans may be disclosed or necessary network or operational support system improvements could be frustrated hence verti cal integration would weaken rather than strengthen their incentives to invest or make quality impr ovements in turn this could discourage longrun dynamic efficiency and weaken incentives faced by the downstream affiliates of the nbn operator to invest in order to improve their service quality so long as the incentives remain for disc rimination to occur on the nbn measures will need to be put in place to ensure that the ability to discriminate is curtailed andor acts of discrimination can be qu ickly identified penalised and remedied f72 ability to discriminate in the absence of measures to address the incentive to discriminate regulatory andor contractual tools will need to be relied upon to curtail the ability to discriminate the anticipated nbn architecture will be unlik ely to remove the ability of vertically integrated network operator to discriminate especially where it retains control over access to the remaining copper loops distrib ution and leadin and ducts ports on switches dslams andor msans at the node in much the same way as telstra controls this access in the current network 322 competing service providers introduced adsl 2 services in april 20 05 immediately following its technical specifications being codified in australia source internode internode launches extreme broadband australias first adsl2 19 april 2005 more broadly new services and improvements in

and billing and information over current and planned ne twork availability and performance323 however it should be noted that there is so dispute over whether or not vertically integrated nbn operator would retain contro l over access to all of the above listed elements in addition there is likely to be scope to re design all of the existing interface operating systems for the nbn to preclude discrimination and ensure that access seekers are dealt with in exactly the same manner as vertically integrated operators downstream arm new interface sy stems could be designed to facilitate easy monitoring and detection of any anti competitive conduct and therefore would remove the ability to discriminate expost anticompetitive conduct enforcement similar to the provisions under part xib can help deal with anticompetitive discrimination however discrimination in and of itself is not always necessarily anticompetitive in its purpose or effec t for example raising rivals costs in orde r to increase profitability without squeezing rivals out of downstream markets is disc riminatory but not anticompetitive anti competitive conduct provisions while they ca n be effective can only deal with the more egregious examples of discrimination the standard access obligations saos under part xic provide that the price and nonprice elements related to declared servic are supplied on an equivalent basis the saos are mechanism intended to directly curtail the ability to discriminate as opposed to anticompetitive conduct provisions however the saos are limited in scope consequently enforcement provisions and associated penalties for breaches of access obligations under both the telecommunications act and the trade practices act have not been used to date refinements of the saos and associated enforcement and dispute resolution mechanisms to increase their timeliness and effectiveness in rest raining vertically integrated operators ability to discrimina would be minimum requirement in the absence of structural separation f8 conclusion there are sound arguments for detailed cons ideration to be given to the optimal structure of the nbn operator the rfp requi res vertically integr ated proponents to outline measures and models to ensure that access is provided on equivalent terms and prevent inappropriate self preferential treatment in and of itself the transition to nga is unlikely to remove the incentives of vertically integrated operator of the nbn to discriminate or reduce the strong countervailing incentives for it to do so 323 further detail on these issues is set out in appendix g confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 180full structural separation is the only mode l which can ensure equivalence in access to the nbn once it has been deployed and ensu re equivalence in access while existing services are migrated to the nbn howe ver in the absence of full structural separation while there are number of other regulatory tools which can assist in the promotion of equivalence they can not guarantee it access regulation accounting separation measures and behavioural undertaking either alone or used in conjunction with one another have not proven sufficiently effective in delivering equivalence in access in australia or in other jurisdictions functional separation is one regulatory tool which can ssist in the promotion of equivalence in access several jurisdictions moving towards some form of functional separation over current access networks ndor signalling preparedness to require functional separation including for next generation access networks functional separation is an attempt to replicate the incentive properties of full structural separation if it is considered that full structural separa tion is not desirable model for the nbn then an effective functional separation model would be the minimum required to promote to the exte nt possible equivalence in access the accc is of the view that the existing operational separation arrangements which apply to telstra are inadequate and woul d not provide robust template for an effective functional separation model horizontal separation involves the splitting of ownership of potentially substitute functions of business while it may be procompetitive in certain circumstances it can only assist in promoting equivalence wh ere it substantially constrains the market power of the nbn operator if not horizo ntal separation should not be seen as complete alternative for other structural measures rather any horizontal separation measures would need to be coupled w ith other mechanisms such as strong functional separation regime in order to assist in promoting equivalence confidential only for individuals

scope for access s eekers to differentia their service offering to customers this appendix considers the minimum requirements of service description for nbn upgrade w ith focus on providing an environment conducive to product differentiation and which reduces the likelihood of discrimination to date regulators have generally consid ered that the lower the layer in the network at which access is granted and th closer it is to the basic physical infrastructure that makes up the bottl eneck the less opportunity there is to discriminate between access seekers and the greater the ability of access seekers to control their own costs and supply chain to differentiate service offerings innovate and improve service quality the accc has previously considered th at providing access seekers with greater control over their own business and pr oducts to the extent that it is economically efficient is likely to minimise discrimination promote competition and investment in new services and be in the longterm interests of australian endusers although layer 2 bitstream access service is unlikely to provide access seekers with as much flexibility as ex isting ulls or lss arrangements it may be the most economically feasibly ac cess service for th nbn operator to provide the accc notes that it would be beneficial for access to be provided at various layers of the network this w ould allow for access seekers to invest at the level in the network where they w ould achieve sufficient returns on their investments this flexibility in acces s to the network would also better accommodate access seekers in the longer term where costs change andor further applications are developed it is important that access seekers ca n access the same service on equal terms where they can operate in an environm ent with minimised discrimination any bitstream service description should th erefore have regard to minimising the potential for discrimination while sti ll encouraging product differentiation to promote competitive environment ensuring that the wholesale bitstream access service is clearly specified may mini mise scope for discrimination it will also be necessary to monitor operatio nal aspects such as ordering billing complaint handling and repairs although th is can be difficult due to the human element required to provide those services the accc considers that bitstream acce ss service with rvice specification addressing the following minimum elem ents would be likely to promote competition and investment in new servic be in the longterm interests of australian endusers and meet the ob jectives of the commonwealths rfp confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 182 layer 2 bitstream access service which may be offered at variety of rates but should include product that is not throttled as well as product that is symmetric to the extent that technol ogy permits products both consumer and business grade should be equally available to all access seekers on non discriminatory basis service whether the bitstream or anot her service that allows access seekers to provide voice service and

offer commercially viable services interfaces that permit retail servi ce provider to contro l the network and service configuration including fau lt status if relevant of its own customers points of interconnection which are commercially feasible for service providers and support competition in cluding competition for backhaul services from the first point of aggregation interconnection protocols based on we llaccepted standards for broadband voice and if applicable video which are sufficiently well described to allow access seekers to design and build thei r own interconnecting facilities arrangements for access to buildings shel ters and facilities for interconnection equivalent treatment of access seekers in relation to all interfaces including quality of service provision required to provide service an appropriate process for amending service specifications in later periods as needed or desirable and adequa notice periods for any change there are two methods by which existi ng voice services can transition to provision in nbn environment one method involves the service taking bitstream form only at the local node this would require installation of equipment at the node but allow for the continued use of current equipment at the end users premises the other thod which is essential in ftth environment but optional in fttn nvironment requires equipment to be placed at the end users premises rega rdless of which method is used where voice services are migrated to nb n architecture the access provider and access seekers will need to roll out soft switches during the transitional period while this occurs to ensure voice rvices are smoothly migrated without potential disruption it may be necessary to consider maintaining the copper between exchange and node this may be more costly solution confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 183 the panel may wish to consider the ongoi ng provision of services other than voice services that are cu rrently using the pstn such as burglar alarms eftpos and traffic lights the accc is not aware of the availability of equipment that could be installed at th node to obviate the n eed to install new equipment at the customer premises to c ontinue the provision of such services there are also questions associated with the ability to supply customers with speeds of 12 mbps in line with the commonwealth objective outlined in the rfp as applications using data servi ces develop over time future demand for capacity is likely to rise and may affect the ability to provide such service speed however the desired capacity of the ne twork will have significant impact on the cost of the network therefore th ere are tradeoffs between cost and capacity g2 introduction the commonwealths rfp highlights the importance of equality of access in any proposed network by stating that proponents should submit arrangements for open access to their netw ork including measures or models to ensure equivalence of access prices and nonprice terms and conditions and arrangements for allowing access seekers to differentiate their service offering to customers324 the rfp also sets out that one of the co mmonwealths objectives for the nbn is that it facilitates competition through open access arrangements that ensure equivalence of price and non price rms and conditions and provide scope for access seekers to differentiate their product offerings325 the commonwealths objectives for the nb n also encompass the minimum speed of services that should be supp lied on the nbn the sort of applications it would be expected to support and the im portance of certain key servic such as voice data and video services326 currently the core economic bottleneck in the provision of telecommunications services is the access infrastructure for establishing physical connection to the customer premises the ulls and lss are examples of communications services currently being regulated to ensure that the copper loop from the exchange to the customers premises can be rented by acce ss seekers when acquiring the ulls the access seeker rents the entir ety of the capability of the copper loop for lss the access seeker rents only the high frequency capability of the copper loop while the access provider uses the low frequency cap ability the accc regulates access to these services in order to promote competition using this deep level of infrastructure 324 clause 191 325 clause 13110 326 see objectives 2 3 and 4 in clause 131 of the rfp confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 184it is likely that the move to nbn arch itecture would introduce technical changes to the way telecommunications signals are tr ansmitted across the network ultimately the accc expects that natural monopoly or bottleneck will continue to exist in respect of the customer access network however the changes to the network architecture may have significant implicati ons for the manner in which services and in particular access services are and can be feasibly supplied on the network regardless of the specifics of the network it will remain possible to offer an access service or services of some kind in respect of the bottleneck while it is possible that access to physical parts of the network will be feasible and access may be needed to promote competition using these deeper layers of the network such as by providing for access to ducts andor subloops it seems clear that the key access service t hat will be feasible and promote competitive outcomes in the foreseeable future will be shared over the nbn fibre capacity in contrast to the current ulls access where access seekers rent the entire capacity of the copper loop in many if not most cases capacity will be shared between competitors on the fibre from the node the question therefore arises as to the scope that may exist for discrimination between access seekers in the way in which capacity is shared as outlined elsewhere in this report most particularly in appendix f where vertically integrated access provider also competes in potentially competiti ve downstream markets it has strong incentives to exclude its rivals through nonprice means327 where the access provider engages in exclusionary behaviour this may place them in stronger position compared to access seekers as access seekers struggle to overcome the impact of the behaviour328 some examples of exclusionary behaviour might involve the access provide r delaying providing number portability making technological choices designed to favour the access provider over access seekers or requiring access seekers to reve commercially sensitive information the resulting weakened competition would not be in the longterm interests of australian endusers therefore in order to facilitate comp etition using the nbn infrastructure an appropriate service definition is fundamental to encourage services to be provided in nbn environment with open access equi valence product differentiation and effective competition in downstream retail co mmunications markets particularly if the nbn operator will be vertically integrated this appendix considers the issues that arise in respect of implementing nbn and the implications they have for the layers of communications networks at which access could be provided 327 briefly exclusion involves an access provi ders profitmaximising strategy intended to loosen regulatory constraint the intended result of the access provider is to shift their power in the bottleneck to the competitive segment see j laffont and j tirole competition in telecommunications 2000 p163 328 laffont and tirole outline three broad groups involving various exclusi onary practices by the access provider including refusal and delays in inte rconnection raising riva ls costs and lowering rivals demand pp164165 the concept of exclusion is also considered i n appendix h confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 185 the scope there is for discriminatory behaviour in supplying access services on the nbn the access services needed to ensure th at access seekers have sufficient service offerings to ensure they can compete effectively in downstream markets because of the scope and incentive for discrimination between access seekers may be broadened where fibre capacity is shared be tween competitors this appendix focuses in particular on the considerations that arise for the supply of bitstream access service g3 network layers from technological perspect ive communication networks can be considered as number of independent layers of communication the c oncept of layered communication networks and how they relate to services as seen by the end customer is important because it assists in determini ng the most appropriate regulation to apply to the nbn the functional inputs nece ssary to provide internet protocol ip services329 and applications to endusers over the network ar often categorised into various layers there are number of different layering models used to implement communications networks figure 1 illustrates typical layered model of communications network330 the structure is represen tative of the kind of yering envisaged by most people when discussing ngn and ip networks 329 generally internet protocol is method by which data can be delivered bet ween customers and can be considered to form the ba sis of communication on the internet 330 alternative models include for example the open system interc onnection reference model which has seven levels and is referred to by ofcom in next generation networks further consultation annexes 30 june 2005 p 17 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 186 layers the application the end user is using eg voice email tv ensures the data is not lost and is in order eg the transmission control protocol tcp gets the data across network of links eg wholesale dsl service ensures that the data gets across link eg bitstream service the electronics that put the signals on the medium eg dslam the copper wire optical fibre or radio channel eg ulls and lss use the copper loop 5 application 4 transport 3 network 2 data link 1 physical 0 medium figure 1 layered model structure for communications network331 in general terms the lowest layer layer 0 equates to the physical connection the actual transmission medium between two points332 it could also refer to the use of other physical media such as optical fibre or radio waves the layers sitting above layer 0 involve connections th at are logical rather than physical for example layer 1 is usually reserved for the signals us ing the physical transmission medium each layer sits on top of the preceding layers and assumes the lower layers perform the functionality required effectively and acco rding to generally agreed protocols333 and standards competition can take place at particular layer not only at the physical medium 331 tcp is one of the core protocols of the internet protocol suite it provides communication service between an application program and the internet protocol when n application program needs to send mass of data using ip in stead of breaking the data into ips ized pieces and issuing series of ip requests the software can issue single request to tcp and tcp handl the ip details 332 many models do not include the concept of layer 0 but instead refer to logic layers only 333 protocol is self contained set of rules both parties to an interaction understand that is used to enable effective communication confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 187to date regulators have generally considered that the lower the layer in the network at which access is granted and the closer it is to the basic physical infrastruct ure that makes up the bottleneck the less opportunity there is to discriminate between access seekers the greater the ability of access seekers to control their own costs and supply chain and to differentiate service fferings innovate nd improve service quality the accc has previously considered that an approach to regulat ion providing access seekers with greater control over their own business and prod ucts to the extent that it is economically efficient is likely to nimise discrimination promote competition and investment in new services and be in the longterm interests of australian end users334 accordingly it would be important that access to services is provided as close to the bottleneck as feasible if the proposed nbn access service could be designed to give access seekers as much control as possible over thei r own customer traffic this is likely to increase the resulting levels of competition the current ulls and lss provide an access eker with access at layer 0 that is they are provided physical access to the copper wires from the exchange to the customers premises the access seeker is th able to utilise their own equipment eg dslams for the higher layers providi ng an opportunity to differentiate their product to that of the access provider and or other access seekers however it is important to note that where an access seek er obtains access at layer 0 and installs their own dslam their ability to compete on technical level is constrained by industry code acif c5592006335 briefly this mandatory code requires all users of dslams to comply with set of technical rules as each access seeker at this layer is constrained by the same set of technical rules their ability to differentiate is limited to means other than technical differentia tion such as by marketing products in vacant niche offering endusers different sp eeds within the technical rules or through commercial arrangements in nbn environment the likely network technology would make use of bitstream services this commonly means data conn ection at layer 2 in this situation the current use of unbundled access to the copper ops via the ulls is likely to become more difficult if not impossible further the accc understands that there is limited business case for alternative providers to offer services from the node using subloop unbundling336 subloop unbundling is therefore unl ikely to be feature in nbn 334 accc fixed services review second position paper april 2007 p 21 335 industry code acif c5592006 unconditioned local loop service ulls network deployment 2006

has publicly commented that the nbn network would require 100 pe r cent cutover in order to be economically viable confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 188environment the wholesale service that potential proponents appear likely to make available to an access seeker would comprise not just the transmission medium such as the copper wire pair but the transm ission medium plus some electronics the service could be said to have moved up two layers337 to provide the access seeker with as much control as possible over its own customer traffic in nbn environment it would generally be feasible for the access provider to offer at least layer 2 bitstream access service layer 2 bitstream access service would provide access seekers with significant flexibility and control to adopt the protocols that be st support the services and applications used by their customers this is in contrast to higher layer wholesale access service where the access provider controls the higher layer protocols and as result effectively limits the ability of access seekers to co ntrol these higher layers and offer differentiated services it would be important for any future bitstr eam access service to be provided at lower level in the network than wholesale xdsl service where access seekers are provided with typically layer 3 service that arrangement involves an access provider providing the dslam and operating laye rs 1 and 2 over the copper loop the concern with access providers only providing service at this highe r level stems from the importance of access seekers being able to directly control their own customer traffic so they can innovate on services nd applications and not simply resell the access providers product the user of wholesale xdsl servi ce has little control over the service and is often able to do little more than add its own marketing and call centre as noted it is important that access seekers can differentiate their services to be able to appeal to and capture di fferent types of customers although they must do so in accordance with any applicable rules or codes338 one instance where access seekers may wish to offer differing services is fo r symmetric and asymmetric services an access seeker may believe that there is niche where they could market symmetric service offering customers equal bandwidth in bo th directions to be able to make this choice particularly in circumstances wh ere the access provider does not opt to provide such service the access seeker will require access to at least layer 2 bitstream access service the uk communications regulat or ofcom similarly desc ribes future broadband access product as needing to offer high leve ls of flexibility and configurability allowing competitive operators as much contro l as possible ofcom has stated that its approach to future broadband access produc t would be consistent with seven key principles the first principle being to pro mote competition at the deepest levels of 337 in the case of other layering models that do not include layer 0 the s ervice has moved up one layer 338 for instance as mentioned above access seek ers

regulation should be focussed as deep in the layering model as possible if for example some form of access was to be ma available at the multi service access node340 then ofcom would favour the access to be at the physical level rather than service specific level howe ver ofcom continues to s upport competition at different levels of active and passive assets in orde r to meet the needs of different types of providers341 the french regulator arcep has stated that it intends to mandate access to the duct network of france telecom342 it has commissioned study concluding that access seekers are likely to be permitted access to over 50 per cent of the ducts this has been preceded by new entrants typically tering the market by purchasing broadband services on wholesale basis from france telecom and subsequently using their own equipment with the ulls more recently given stronger subscriber base some companies have announced that they are co mmencing deployment of their own fibre to the home facilities in cities with dense population leading to arceps announcement the european regulators groups erg r ecent response to european commission ec draft recommendation on regulated acce ss to next generation access network nga urged the ec to reconsider its draft approach to network access in nga environment the erg emphasised that in the event of nga duct sharing alone was likely to be insufficient to stimulate efficient investment in infrast ructure by the incumbent as well as competitors343 it indicated preferen ce to emphasise access to both active and passive assets such as enhanced bitstream products andor backhaul products the report further stated that it is important that infrastructure and service competition are not seen as opposed to each other but are linked through the ladder of investment allowing competitors through quence of regulated access products that are consistently priced to invest in step by step manner in own infrastructure344 this approach is broadly the same as the stepping stone or l adder of investment hypothesis previously used by regulators i ncluding the accc the stepping stone hypothesis supports

suggested that as entrants gain market share over time th risks associated with infrastructure investment diminish increasing their incentive to climb the ladder of investment at the limit the hypothesis suggests that entran ts will move towards fullfacilities based competition obviating the need for mandated access entirely the accc previously noted the stepping stone approach to competition with the important caveat that full facilitiesbase d competition is not the end goal in all circumstances the accc only seeks to promote facilitiesbased and quasi facilities based competition where it is economically efficient347 while the ladder of investment concept may be useful an alogy for the process by which competition emerges the accc does not consider that it forms major part of the acccs approach to regulation the accc noted in recent decision that one way of conceptualising the ladder of investment is that regulator should make all or several rungs available such th at access seekers are able to make efficient investment decisions by choosing between them number of regulatory submissions from propon ents state that the nature of services supplied using nbn is subject to some degree of uncertainty348 traditionally number of services have been regulated to allow market forces to determine the most appropriate access layer initially bitstr eam access will be required however it appears reasonably possible that over time th service description may require some adjustment to account for changes in the cost of equipment andor technical changes similarly while there appears little current demand for subloop unbundling it is quite possible that costs could fall in the future andor ne w applications are developed such that subloop unbundling becomes econo mically feasible gi ven the long term during which nbn arrangements will appl the accc considers it would be beneficial to provide for access seekers to access the nbn at varying layers of the network provided that access is available on nondiscriminatory basis that promotes efficiency and competition including ensuring that the nbn operator also receives commercial returns on its investment then access seekers could choose to invest at the level of the network and in the areas where they would achieve sufficient returns on their investments this would allow compe tition to emerge where it is feasible and in manner that best reflects competitive market outcomes 345 for example the euro pean regulators group in response to the draft recommendation on the regulated access

the provision of acce ss services over on nbn however as outlined in appendix f the transition to next generation access network may not remove the incentives of nbn operator to di scriminate further regard needs to be had to whether with the access service potentially moving up two layers there may be more scope for discrimination in assessing the extent to which proposals fulfil the commonwealth s objectives for the nbn it is important to consider wh ether all access seekers can access the same service on equal terms as th access provider if the acces s provider is vertically integrated or as each other where the access provider is not vertically integrated to encourage conditions that allow them to co mpete on their relative merits to achieve platform where access seekers can access the same service on equal terms any bitstream service description should have regard to minimising the potential for anti competitive discrimination while still allowing for product differentiation the accc has previously considered the minimum requirements for the supply of bitstream access service on fttn in the c ontext of its consideration of the fanoc special access undertaking section g41 below considers the scope for discrimination in the provision of access services on nbn while section 142 outlines what can be considered the minimum requirements of any bitstream access service g41 scope for discrimination discrimination can occur in number of ways that can primarily be classified under various kinds of product or process di scrimination while product discrimination is readily detectable process discrimination can be difficult to detect and therefore requires careful attention to identify and nimise it the two forms of discrimination are discussed below overall it is possible to discriminate in the service provided to access seekers and at times it may be necessary to discriminate in the interest of ensuring functional network sometimes an access seeker may act ually request differentiated service with corresponding price in order to di stinguish its servi ce from other access seekers while it is possible to detect technical discrimination against an access seeker this can only be done where there is clear understa nding of the product to be provided in the case of vertically integrat ed access provider there will also need to be clear understanding of the service it provides to itself and monitoring arrangements to ensure that the service an access provider suppli to itself is equivalent to that it has agreed to provide itself nd equivalent to that it provides to access seekers confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 192a clear service description also promotes industry awareness of specifications of services supplied to access seekers and access providers where vertically integrated and therefore assists in the prevention of discrimination unless service specifications available for all telecommunications competitors are transparent discriminat ion will be inevitable and undetectable product specification and functionality the bitstream service can be technically sp ecified in such way that discrimination can be easily monitored by an industry body or technical regulator based on internationally agreed standards the fo llowing elements are generally set out in product specifications and can be specif ied so as to reduce the likelihood of discrimination in assessing nbn propos als the panel and ultimately the commonwealth may wish to have regard to the following aspects of proponents proposed service descriptions quality of service covers the speed accu racy and reliability of service the qos is largely effected by the dsla msmsans optical backhaul and router capacities used this physical infrastructure capacity can be allocated in an open and fair manner class of service covers the manner in which traffic of different priority categories is handled for example real time voice has different requirements to email and therefore requires different cl ass of service furt her access seekers may elect to receive different class of service for an identical end user application which would not in itself be discriminatory in an anticompetitive sense however packets of an identical class of service should be handled identically by the bitstream service and w ithin particular class of service to avoid access seekers using the highest cla ss of service for all applications there may need to be some mechanism to encour age efficient classification of traffic this might involve establishing differentia l pricing or industry agreed standards protocol management349 the routers at layer 3 in the network are able in real time to monitor the particular higher yer protocols being used and have the ability to proactively manage their pe rformance this can be done for any protocol on any layer of the network above layer 2 for example an access provider could proactively manage the performance of packets using voip protocol this might need to be done at times of high network stress however there should be discrimination between access seekers stream management the routers in th network are able in real time to monitor and control the streams being us ed by particular access seeker such as the traffic of particular access seeker or even particul ar end user eg bank this enables management of various network events such as in the event of equipment malfunction which results in excessive and meaningless data being transmitted into the network stream management should occur in an open and nondiscriminatory manner such that particular access s eekers stream is 349 together with stream management protocol management is one of the ke elements of the so called net neutrality debate confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 193targeted inappropria tely and can be done by setti ng out what controls will be implemented for specific network events protocol transparency higher layer pr otocols should pass across the bitstream service transparently higher layer protocols manage end to end communications as well as various nd customer equipment including home gateways access seekers should all have equal ability to use protocols above the bitstream service if an access provide r sought to restrict retail suppliers ability to supply endtoend services by limiting what prot ocols the retailer uses at the upper layer this is likely to inhi bit competition in downstream markets if restrictions on the use of protocols for upper layers of the network are applied then only if they are done in uniform manner across all access seekers and the access providers retail arm if it is vertical ly integrated would they not limit an access seekers ability to differentiate its product and compete fully in downstream markets point of interconnection poi350 bitstream service terminates at point of interconnection in nbn environment the location of the poi may be particularly important in relation to services such as tv which is most appropriately delivered via multicast service351 where multicast services are involved there is advantage in having the multicast point as close to the end users as possible to minimise the required transmission resources access seekers should have equal ability to us such points however the location of pois can present difficulties because of the high cost of inst alling equipment at pois for instance the accc understands that very high speed port card needed for router at each poi could cost up to 100000 with port on such card being used for each access seeker conne ction at that poi generally where an access seeker has small number of end users in widely dispersed areas it becomes uneconomic to connect their own backhaul networks at pois different nbn proposals are therefore likely to repr esent different tradeoffs between the extent of competition they promote i n both the provision of transmission and end user multicast services and the costs of access that is the more competition and pois they facilitate the more likely it is that access prices will be higher relative to propos als that have few pois ability of the network to discriminate th routers at layer 3 have full visibility of all packet headers consequently they are able on packetbypacket basis to manage different streams differently in real time sometimes it is necessary to do so in order to manage network relia bility for example at times when the network is under heavy load or sufferi ng from faults the data within the packets can also be inspected in order to deal with variety of network threats such as worms and denial of service atta cks hence it is important that any such 350 for further discussion on pois please see appendix i 351 multicasting is method for the delivery of information to group of stinations simultaneously it uses the most efficient strategy to deliver messages over each link of the network only once the nodes in the network take care of replicating the packet to reach multiple receivers where necessary in the case of tv service this would involve nding one packet containing the video stream to the node closer to the enduser and then replicating it at the node to deliver to each enduser confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 194discrimination is conducted according to agreed principles and based on objective rules process and operational arrangements while it is relatively easy to specify the nbn product bits tream service so as to minimise scope for discrimination process arrangements applying to the supply of wholesale bitstream services can expose access seekers to discrimination further monitoring operational aspects such as orde ring billing complaint handling repairs and service changes can be difficult due to the human element required to provide those services there are ways in which process discrimi nation can be reduced however this would be likely to involve high degree of in tervention in respect of the contractual arrangements between indivi dual access seekers and the access provider as noted above although some regulatory submissi ons indicated that the incentive to discriminate may ease in nbn environment the accc considers that where vertically integrated access provider also competes in potentially competitive downstream markets it has strong incentives to exclude its rivals through nonprice means352 the extent to which proposal to build nbn establis hes specific and detailed terms and conditions for genera l application to access agreements or provides for the review and approval of rms and conditions as they apply to particular access seeker will determine th extent to which they will permit anti competitive discrimination the various operations admini stration and management functions of the bitstream services need to be handled in an equal manner for all access seekers and the access provider where it is vertically integr ated in order to promote competition in downstream markets for exam ple the time taken to add or amend service should be similar as should the manner in which fau lts are handled all parties should have equivalent views of network development plan s these issues are examined further in appendices related to transition and migr ation as well as key nonprice terms and conditions however there may be circumstances when services that are di fferentiated would not be considered anticompetitive such as where access seekers elect to receive differentiated service as noted above w ith respect to the class of service specification for instance an access seeker may wish to pay premium in order to receive fast response or lternatively to pay reduced cost and receive slower response time this is the case with respect to all access servic such as subloop unbundling and duct access g42 the minimum elements of bits tream access service on fttn in its draft decision on the fanoc speci access undertaking sau in which fanoc proposed to implement fttn

not throttled is considered fundamental requirement of bitstream access service by the accc and ovum it facilitates service that can be differentiated by th access seeker to accommodate requirements

that the nbn facilitate competition through open access arrangements that ensure equi valence of price and nonprice terms and conditions and provide scope for access seekers to differentiate their product offerings360 358 as discussed above the accc uses the term layer 2 to refer to the bas ic functionality required to transmit data stream across physi cal pointtopoint link layer 2 bitstream access service would therefore require the access provider to provide an access service comprising both the physical layer which in fttn network may equate to hybrid fibreco pper link from the customers premises to point of interconnection as well as the layer 2 prot ocols necessary to enable data to be carried over that link there could be number of layer 2 protocols that are used for

ability of the nbn to support these services is also commonwealth objective in the rfp362 in its draft decision on the fanoc undert aking the accc expressed concerns about the commercial viability of access seekers providing voice services in transitional environment during the nbn rollout363 the accc expected softswitches to be introduced across the network as part of the transition to next generation ip core however the accc considered that alt hough softswitches had been deployed on smallscale by some carriers364 they were yet to be deployed on an extensive scale365 which involved possibility that the reliab ility of voice services would deteriorate although the accc did not express any fina l conclusions it noted that commonly other countries retained thei r existing copper network to run voice services even if just for transitional period issues involved in the transitional period in which nbn is implemented are discussed in greater detail in appendix i and further discussion about the transition of voice servic is contained at g51 below as discussed above the location of pois is likely to represent tradeoff between the promotion of competition and the cost of the access service in the fanoc draft decision the accc highlighted that the pois should be as close to customers as is appropriate and efficient the accc also not ed that while it may not be efficient to provide access at individual nodes the fact that access ekers that were currently using ullslss were able to interconnect efficiently at existing local exchanges suggested that they would be able to interconnect efficiently to replacement bitstream access service at or near those exchanges366 the accc therefore considered that it did not appear justifiable to restrict interconnec tion

that permit retail service pr ovider to control the network and service configuration including fa ult status if relevant of its own customers source ovum consulting368 the nbn will carry different types of tra ffic including voice data and video these traffic types have different endtoend requirements in terms of packet prioritisation and handling for example th quality of voice traffic teriorates if there is excessive endtoend delay or delay variati on in the transport of packets conversely email traffic is more tolerant of delay but it is preferable that email packets are not discarded by the network therefore for the network to provide good quality service it is necessary for packet prioritisation and handling to be treated differently for different traffic types this may be achieved by assigning different class of service for different traffic types on the networ k as discussed above in section g41 as also discussed above in section g41 it is important that the nbn operator offer various access services of differing qualities so that access seekers can determine the most commercially appropriate service to offer however access seekers at each level of service quality should be pr ovided with si milar service in the fanoc draft decision the accc high lighted concerns that fanoc had not provided sufficient detail in relation to how capacity would be allocated between access seekers and what would happen with any spare capacity the accc highlighted its view that there needed to be significant amount of detail in relation to allocation of capacity

downstream services and the imp lications for the access service the historical primacy of voice servi ces has influenced the evolution of telecommunications systems and specifi cally the switching architecture of telecommunications networks that still exis ts in many parts of the network today however as the range of services supplie d over the network has broadened over time there has been more emphasis on data rvices such as email and internet the ability of access seekers to compete in downstream markets depends on the nature of the wholesale services available to them and how they can transform or use those services to provide co mpelling service offerings to consumers it is therefore important that the wholesale services s upplied on the nbn allow access seekers to provide sufficient range of service offerings in order to compete in the relevant retail markets for example business markets both large and small and residential markets while data servi ces are becoming increasingly important and consumers are increasingly demanding range of different data services the ability to use voice services remains an essentia l component of any service offering this is reflected in the rfp commonwealth objective for the nbn to be able to support high quality voice data and video services370 emphasis added this raises questions about whether the wholesale services supplied on the nbn should include wholesale voice service and number of wholesale data or bitstream services the terms of the nbn rfp specifically the commonwealths objective for the nbn of offering broadband services with minimum 12 mbps dedicated downlink transmission speed over each connection provid ed to premises also raise questions about the average speeds that consumers wi ll see supplied

commonwealt h the accc expects that any change to the range of services supplied subject to universal service obligation uso would continue to includ basic voice service where voice services are to be provided in nbn environment it is likely that the nature of the ip architecture of the ne twork will mean that voice services will be provided in voice over intern et protocol format voip374 across at least part of the network most likely the core the communications alliance has developed industry guidelines outlining the acceptable quality of voip375 given the importance of voice services it is essential that during the transition to potential nbn environment the telecommunica tions industry can c ontinue to provide the same or similar product to existing voi ce services number of issues arise in the migration of voice services to fttn environment these include issues around changes to equipment if fttn architecture is used equipment at customer premises does not necessarily need to change where the voice service takes bitstream form only at the local node ie voice signal is transmitted on the copper line from the node to the customers premises the accc notes that number of proponents including telstra have expressed concerns that complete cut over of all voice services from pstn to nbnbased services would requir switching based on softswitches376 as already noted in section g42 in the fanoc draft decision the accc expected softswitches to be introduced wi dely across the network as part of the transition to next generation ip co re but was concerne d about the ability of carriers to smoothly deploy the soft switches on largescale while networkwide migration of voice serv ices from the pstn to softswitch reliant bitstream service is possible it has yet to be attempted on the scale of major carrier anywhere in the world without mixture of pstn and voip services involved ovum recommended cau tion including that the switch only be undertaken on an incremental basis over the course of the nbn rollout with testing mechanisms in place and the ability to revert customer services to pstn voice services if teething problems arose377 effectively this would require maintenance of the copper between exchange and node for period until the transition is finalised whic h may be more costly solution 374 voip involves the provision of voice services

they are sensitive to delay variation and require new equipment at the customer premises378 the migration of these services to nb n is likely to necessitate migration of endusers from current analogue equipmen t or devices to digital equipment unlike voice services the accc is not aw are of the general availability of equipment that could be installed at the node to obviate the need for such change of customer premises equipment the accc notes therefore that there may be need for copper to be retained between the node and the local exchange fo r some time after node is upgraded as part of the nbn in order to allow conti nuity of voice services and other special services this will ensure that access seekers are able to compete effecti vely in relevant downstream markets and submarket s further transitional issues may be minimised where voice equipment is installed at the node rather than at the endusers premises the transitional issues around th implementation of nbn are considered in further detail in appendix i g52 data services similar to voice services high quality data services are also an objective of the commonwealth in the rfp379 data services have become an increasingly important aspect of communications services over time there has been rapid development and uptake in applications requiring data serv ices over the digital portion of the lines comprising the access network this is prim arily the case because applications and services offered over networks have expande d to include services such as broadband and video streaming380 therefore while the physical characteristics of the network remain largely unchanged the purposes for which the network has traditionally been used have changed substantially this s opened new market for competition in addition to traditional voi ce service market the accc expects that as data applicationsservices continue develop nd expand this may provide an important area in which market participants can compete for

telstra proposal involved download speeds of up to 24 mbs albeit with lesser rollout383 the accc considers that future competition in and development of applications using data services is closely linked to th access speeds to be provided by the nbn therefore the ability to compete in key downstream markets or submarkets such as large business smes and re tail businesses will be affected by the access speeds available however it is not clear from the rfp as to what proportion of time customer can expect to be able to use th 12 mbs speed service and hence how the network needs to be dimensioned network di mensioning is an important aspect as the backhaul connection will be shared resour ce for instance in any given instant it may be possible for the enduser to receive speeds well inexcess of 12 mbs however it is equally possible that the end user may receive an extremely low data speed simply because the instantaneous demand ebbs and flows depending upon the applications being used by customers it is normal to expect customers to not be using th full potential rate of th backhaul connection 100 per cent of the time that is the backhaul data rate is generally not equal to the number of customers times the maximum desired data da per customer but somewhat less than that this is often referred to as the contention ratio384 contention ratios of 110 to 1100 are not unusual it is possible however that as more streamed video applications are used the contention ratio will need to be lower that is less customers will share certain bandwidth in order to provide satisfying customer experience key implication of the selected contenti on ratio is the required capacity of the backhaul transmission link and the scale of the core ip network the level of capacity can have very significant impact on netw ork cost meaning that the contention ratio is matter of tradingoff cost versus cu stomer capability in the context of nbn proposals the accc notes the commonw ealths objective that the nbn has sufficient capacity to meet current an d foreseeable demand and has specified upgrade path within clear timeframes consistent with internati onal trends while it may be possible for proponent to offer re latively low cost nbn that fulfils the commonwealths objective of 12 mbs speed service such network may not have sufficient capacity to meet future demand as new more data intensive applications are developed accordingly the panel and the commonwealth may need to consider the tradeoffs between cost and capacity that di fferent proposals are likely to represent in any case the speed of the network as seen by the customer is dictated by the least capable link along the route from the customer to the application and in most cases 382 telstra asx release the

bandwidth at any one time and therefore the lower the effective bandwidth of fered per user especially at peak times confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 205this is likely to be the end application rver rather than the network or access link itself that is while it may be theoretica lly possible to achieve 12 mbs speeds on all links on the network the data speeds xperienced by endusers may be lower and possibly even higher in some areas g6 conclusion access seekers require sufficient service ffering to ensure that they can compete effectively in downstream markets this appe ndix considered the various issues that arise in the attempt to ensure the serv ice provided to access seekers in nbn encourages effective competition it is likely that once the nbn is built bitstream access service may provide the greatest degree of functionality that is technically and commercially feasible however in accordance with various intern ational approaches the provision of access at various layers of the network would allow access seekers to make efficient investment decisions this would allow compe tition to emerge where it is feasible as well as allow for future changes to s upply costs and the development of new applications in many if not most cases capacity will be shared between competitors on the fibre component of the nbn the question arises as to the scope that may exist for discrimination between access seekers in the way in which capacity is shared there are number of elements that can be specified in service descrip tion so as to reduce the likelihood of discrimination however di scrimination is harder to monitor where the service incorporates process arrange ments involving human element such as billing and repairs in these circumstan ces discrimination can be reduced through contractual arrangements ho wever monitoring contractua l arrangements would be more cumbersome than monitoring disc rimination through service description where proposal to build nbn estab lishes specific and detailed terms and conditions for general application to access agreements or provides for the review and approval of terms and conditions as they apply to particular access seeker this is likely to reduce anticompetitive discrimination the accc considers that clear service scription promotes industry awareness of specifications of services supplied to access seekers and access providers where vertically integrated and th erefore assists in the preven tion of discrimination it is therefore important to techni cally specify the bitstream service in such way that discrimination can be easily monitore d as noted the accc has previously considered the minimum elements of bitstream access service that are likely to be necessary to promote nondiscrimination and competition in downstream markets these elements have also been considered by ovum who suggested additions and amendments to the acccs list the accc considers that the elements identified would be likely to provide access seekers with sufficient flexibility and control over the access service to enable them to co mpete effectively and make appropriate decisions in relation to the efficient use of investment and infrastructure as noted above high quality voice and data services have been stated as commonwealth objective in the rfp to

well as to consider the costs associated with increased capacity confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 207appendix h key nonprice terms and conditions h1 executive summary the governments requestforproposals rfp specifically re quires proponents to address number of nonprice terms nd conditions nptcs in their proposals and to specify the measures and models that will ensure equivalence385 nptcs can deal with vari ety of nonprice matters relating to access such as the processes for ordering and repairing services the ability to connect those services to different networks and the way that information including confidential information is handled between the network operator and service providers number of nptcs are specifically iden tified in the rfp additionally other nptcs may also affect access ekers ability to compete all nptcs have the potential to lead to competition concerns network operators particularly where vertically integrate d have incentives to engage in anti competitive exclusionary nonprice conduct for example refusals or unjustified delays to interconnection c onnecting new customers or re pairing faults might be employed in order to raise rivals costs or lower riva ls demand the competition concerns relating to nptcs and incentives for exclusionary be haviour are lessened if the network operator is not vertically integrated accordingly careful consideration needs to be given to which nptcs need to be defined by the successful pr oponent upfront and which ones may be subject to later negotiations it should be noted that not all form s of exclusionary nonprice conduct are anticompetitive there may in fact be procompetitive reasons for particular types of exclusionary nonprice conduct for example disclosure of some confidential information might be necessary for network planning reasons also access seekers do not necessarily all wa nt identical services for instance in relation to quality of service considerat ions some access seekers are willing to pay higher price for better quality service and vice versa concepts of equivalence and nondiscrimi nation in nonprice terms and conditions are therefore rarely clearcut easy to asse ss or easy to enforce in particular it may be difficult to ensure complete quivalence where the ne twork operator also operates at retail level although under this scenario the need for equivalence becomes even greater there is wide range of nptcs that ma be important considerations in the national broadband network nbn in particular notification of network changes ordering and provisioning proce sses fault repair and maintenance facilities access amendment of documents treatment of confidential information and number of other issues would all be important consider ations in assessing the potential competition effects of nptcs 385 eg rfp p 2 1110 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity

commercial arra ngements number of monitoring mechanisms have progressively been introduced in the existing regime in response to concerns that telstra does not provide th same level of servi ce for example in fault repair and maintenance to its wholesale customers that it provides to its own retail arm the appropriateness of any given regulatory tool will depend on structural issues and the nature of the incentives faced by the network operator to engage in anti competitive exclusionary nonprice behaviour the accc in 2003 and 2008 made model nptcs relating to number of non price matters including those in the rfp and other matters386 while these model nptcs relate to core services supplied over the legacy network the reasoning and analysis in relation to these nptc s remains applicable to the nbn 386 accc final determinationmodel nonprice terms and conditions october 2003 accc final determinationmodel nonprice terms and conditions november 2008 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 209h2 introduction and background this appendix considers the role of non price terms and conditions nptcs that would govern the nbn and the relations hip between the nbn operator and its wholesale customers h21 what are nptcs historically disputes about access between access seekers and access providers and regulatory processes such as undertaking assessments have largely focused on the price paid by access seekers to the access provider however nptcs have become more significant aspect in debate in recent years and could be in creasingly significant if an nbn were built nptcs can be just as significant an issue for access seekers as price terms and may be less transparent nd more difficult for both the regulator and access seekers to monitor these nonprice matters can deal with variety of aspects of access such as the processes for ordering and repairing services the ability to connect those services to different networks and the way that inform ation including confidential information is handled between the network operator and rvice providers number of nptcs are specifically identified in the rfp additio nally other nptcs may also be relevant and may also best be specified in arra ngements with the suc cessful proponent not all nptcs are necessarily controversia l or the subject of significant debate however depending on the content of the acce ss arrangements relating to these issues for the nbn many could have negative effect on competition h22 equivalence an important consideration when consideri ng the issue of nptcs is the concept of equivalence or nondiscrimination which is an overarching concept within the rfp387 relevantly the rfp states that proponents should submit on arrangements that ensure equivalence in certain nptcs388 as general principle equivalence means that carriers should be able to co mpete with each other on the basis of their individual merits and is related to the concept of open access to the nbn broadly speaking it requires consideration of whet her the nptcs faced by any given access seeker would be similar to or the same as those faced by other access seekers and possibly the successful proponent and whet her such nptcs allow for competition to occur on the merits parties should not be disadvantaged by actions of the wholesale provider that unduly favour the retail arm of that provider or other access seekers and prevent competition on the respective merits of market participants equivalence and nondiscrimina tion have more commonly b een concerns in relation to price but are equally concern for nptc s it would be possible for particular access seeker or class of access seekers to be significantly disadvantaged by the nptcs such that they were unable to comp ete on their merits lack of equivalence between parties on such issues will be pa rticularly relevant if the successful proponent or related companies also competes in the retail market 387 eg rfp p 2 1110 388 rfp schedule 2 clause 142cviii confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 210h23 why are nptcs relevant the reason that nptcsand equivalence nd nondiscrimination in nptcsmay be competition issue is due to the strong incen tives for verticallyintegrated network operator to engage in anticompetitive exclus ionary practices in nonprice aspects of access this is particularly true where th network operator is subject to regulatory control over its wholesal pricing that constrains it fr om discriminating between itself and access seekers in order to allow it to earn above normal revenues and profits the network operator in such s ituation can still gain an dvantage over its access seeker rivals by engaging in nonpr ice behaviour that limits their ability to compete vertically integrated operator may then be fr ee to raise or maintain its retail prices above the competitive level broadly there may be three categories of exclusionary behaviour that such an op erator could engage in refusals and delays in interconnection raising rivals costs eg by requiring access seekers to purchase costly interface equipment lowering rivals demand eg by insufficiently maintaining and updating the network389 the successful proponent may be able to engage in some or all of these categories of behaviour through the use and manipulation of the nptcs of access to the nbn for example it may make it time consuming fo r access seekers to order nbn wholesale services or create difficulti in obtaining facilities access to allow interconnection this would lead to access seekers being unabl to provide services to endusers with ease and being placed at competitive disadvantage to the network operator such nonprice quality of service issues can lead to competitive detriment as directly as price issues as consumers will judge serv ice provider not just on the price paid for the service but also the quality of th service they obtain for that price h24 specific examples of nptcs as noted above the nptcs of access can cover range of issues the rfp specifically requires proponent s to address number of nptcs in

the rfp and other matters391 while these model nptcs relate to core services supplied over the legacy network th reasoning and analysis in relation to these nptcs remains applicable to the nbn number of the nptc issues in both the rfp and the acccs model nptcs also interact with rollout cons iderations covered in the transition and migration appendix h25 equivalence in nptcs concepts of equivalence and nondiscrimina tion in nptcs are rarely clearcut easy to assess or easy to enforce it may not be possible to ensure complete equivalence where the successful proponent also operates at the retail level however under this scenario the need for equivalence and non discrimination becomes even greater given the incentives present and the potential effect on competition in particular the appropriate benchmark for equivalence in nptcs is not always obvious where vertically inte grated operator supplies serv ices to itself it may not be clear which operating unit or functional vel of the vertically integrated operator for example retail wholesale or networ k divisions corresponds to the business of access seekers similarly it may be difficult to ensure equivalence in nptcs when vertically integrated operator is supplying to itself because it may have different internal processes it would be necessary fo r appropriate assurances to be given by the successful proponent about how equiva lence could be best achieved the concerns about nonprice issues may be reduced where the network operator is not vertically integrated this is because in such case the incentives for anti competitive nonprice exclusionary conduct ar likely to be significantly smaller however questions of equivalence and nondiscrimination could remain important even if the successful proponent is not fully vertically integrated for example the potential remains for particul ar access seekers to receive preferential treatment from the network operator for reasons such as whether the access seeker had part ownership interest in the network operator392 the accc examines structural issues further in appendix f variety of tools may be av ailable to monitor and enforce nptc issues ranging from relatively lighthanded to relatively prescriptiv the need for any particular approach will depend on the nature of the incentives to engage in anticompetitive nonprice exclusionary conduct overall it is necessary to carefully assess the terms and conditions that may apply in relation to services provided over the nbn the nptcs would need to be of type that did not unduly discriminate between access seekers and the network operator should it be vertically integrat ed or discriminate against one or more access seekers 391 accc final determinationmodel nonprice terms and conditions october

appendix examines the ability of the network operator to discriminate and the ways in which anticompetitive nonpr ice exclusionary behaviour may occur h3 nptcs under the existing regime h31 model nonprice terms and conditions the telecommunications competition act 2002 introduced new regulatory requirement to establish model terms nd conditions relating to access to core telecommunications services section 152 aqb of the tpa requires the accc to make written determination setting out model terms and conditions of access for each of the core services393 the core services are set out in the legislation as domestic public switched telephone network pstn originating access service and terminating acce ss service pstn oa and ta local carriage service lcs unconditioned local loop service ulls other declared services have b een specified as core services model terms and conditions are non binding however model terms and conditions still provide industry with an upfront view of the likely approach that the accc would take to particular issue in conduc ting an arbitration th ereby assisting the parties to reach commercial agreemen t on access or to submit access undertakings394 in developing model nonprice terms and c onditions of access consideration is given to the overall objective of part xic of the tpa and the reasonableness criteria contained in that part as noted above the accc has issued mode l nonprice terms nd conditions relating to legacy core services in 2003 and 2008 the reasoning and anal ysis applied in establishing these model nptcs is equally relevant to the nbn h32 dispute resolution regardless of how prescriptiv set of nptcs are and how strong the enforcement and compliance mechanisms they are unlikely to be comprehensiveexhaustive consequently it is essential to retain clear and effective dispute resolution mechanisms in place to address any residua l nonprice issues these residual issues could potentially relate to uns pecified or future nptcs the model nptcs seek to establish how disputes should be managed including the procedures and timeframes that should apply the general dispute resolution 393 trade practices act 1974 ss152aqb2 394 explanatory memorandum telecommunications competition bill 2002 pp 2 and 39 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 213procedures seek to facilitate the resolu tion of disputes in an expeditious manner without the need to reso rt to legal proceedings the general principle behind the dispute re solution provisions is that parties should seek to resolve disputes through alternative dispute resolution adr prior to seeking arbitration or commencing legal proceedings th is is because it is likely that disputes will resolve more quickly and with less cost where parties are able to agree an outcome either amongst themselves or as part of mediation or expert determination process they agree upon however it should be noted that adr will only be successful where both parties ve incentives to resolve the dispute this is unlikely in the case of vertically integrated operator with market power the model nonprice terms and conditions outl ine principles that form the basis for fair and reasonable dispute reso lution procedures if the pa rties are not able to agree on the terms and conditions on which access is to be provided the matter may be notified to the accc and the accc must arbitrate the dispute if dispute is notified for ar bitration it is general pract ice for the accc to seek the parties views on whether adr processes may be of assistance to resolving the dispute the accc can order parties to pa rticipate in such processes andor defer arbitration while these processes are followed h4 what nptcs would be significant in the nbn this section examines the specific nptcs th at may be significant to the nbn it examines why particular nptcs may be important and how the principle of equivalence or nondiscriminati on may be achieved in relation to those terms where relevant the rfp requires proponents to submit in regards to number of specific nptcs395 in addition other nptcs may also be releva nt considerations particularly where the network operator is vertica llyintegrated as noted above concerns about nptcs will be less of concern where the network operator is not ver tically integrated the accc also notes that another significan t nonprice issue relates to the service description of the access services provide d over the nbn product characteristics of the service such as jitter delay packet ss and other technical specifications would need to be specified however such technical specificati ons or product functionality nptcs are perhaps more eas ily monitored than more process nptc issues such as those discussed below service description for the nbn is examined in appendix g h41 network changes and notification the accc discusses the competition issues relating to transition and migration from the copper network to the nbn in detail in separate appendix however given that the nbn would be expected to be very long lived issues relati ng to notification of changes to the network will stil l be relevant after the nbn is primarily rolled out in this regard the rfp requires proponents to specify that equivalence is provided in 395 eg rfp schedule 2 p 13 147cviii confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 214arrangements for supplying wholesale customers with information about future changes to the nbn396 the reason that such changes will likely re main important is that network repair works and upgrades can be expected even after the nbn is depl oyed the successful proponent will be expected over time to undertake upgrade and maintenance work such as relocating nodes on th network such work albeit smaller in scope than the initial transition to the nbn may result in disruption to access seekers ability to provide services or obtain interconnection in contrast to the initial transition the ongoing maintenance and upgrade work will happen on more ad hoc basis failure to have equivalence in notificat ions may mean that any retail arm of the successful proponent or particular access seek ers will have significant advantage in planning over other access seekers such co mpanies would be able to better compete as they would have reduced risk of service disruption correspondingly higher degree of service continuity nd better ability to serve end user customers this would have negative impact on competition as significant disruptions would lead to the competitiveness of other companies being artificially limited by their inability to provide comparable service offerings if the successful proponent was structurally separated the issue becomes somewhat more straightforward equivalence in that context would require the network operator to inform all affected access seekers of upcoming work at the same time which should mean an equal impact on the position of these firms in the retail market and therefore undue competitive advantage to any particular retail operator where the successful proponent is vertically integrated or where some access seekers have an ownership interest in the nbn operator equivale nce is more important in particular it is necessary to determine wh decision to perform upgrade work is actually effectively made or notified to the network provider triggering the requirement to give notice to access seekers as noted in the transition and migration appendix appendix i it would generally not be appropriate that information about network upgrade only be provided to access seekers at the same time as vertical ly integrated network operator informs its retail arm397 rather that notification would better be given at the same time as the vertically integrated network operator in forms an area such as its wholesale or network division however difficulties with the concept of equivalent notice may mean that consideration should be give n to minimum notice period that would ensure that network upgrades and maintena nce did not take place before certain period of notice was ensured for access seekers the accc has noted in the past that ther is wide range of potential network upgrade and maintenance activities that coul d take place ranging from potentially highly disruptive to matters of little conse quence for the availability or quality of 396 rfp schedule 2 p 13 142cix 397 accc assessment of telstras ulls monthly charge undertakingfinal decision august 2006 p 177 the potential exception would be if the network operator informed its wholesale and retail arms at the same time confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 215services398 similarly the australian competiti on tribunal noted that recognising the range of work that could potentially be performed on network was important 399 given that the types of ongoing upgrade and maintenance work may vary the appropriate length of time for minimum notification period would depend strongly on the type of work taking place as such the specific terms and conditions may vary and any minimum notification periods may have to draw distinction between different categories of work400 too short period would run the risk that access seekers would not have an appropriate leng th of time to conduct necessary activities in response to the upgrade or maintenance work such as planning their own infrastructure works negotiating revised access arrangements or conducting marketing and enduser communications alternatively too l ong period would hamper the ability of the access provider to conduct work on the network thus potentially harming its interests in properly maintaining its network and planning necessary infrastructure build also notice periods should generally be ab to be bypassed with the consent of all affected access seekers if companies are happy for amendments to occur before the minimum notice period there would seem little point in requiring the full notice h42 ordering and provisioning ordering and provisioning terms and conditions have the potentia l to be significant nonprice concerns effective operations s upport system interfaces have been critical to competition on existing networks and w ill be equally so for bitstream access service401 it has also previously been noted that these operational systems need to be in place well before migration402 the standard access obligations under the current regime likewise emphasise that equivale nt ordering and provisioning must be provided to access seekers403 these issues are explicitly raised in the rfp requirement that proponents outline arrangeme nts for ensuring equivalence in service qualification and activation404 ordering and provisioning systems and pro cesses allow access seekers to acquire access services from the network operator in the nbn context those services are likely to at the least include bitstream service it will be necessary for access seekers to readily be able to place orders to acquire services from the nbn operator firstly as noted in appendix i key consideration is whether access seekers are able to order and provision new services befo re transition and migration take place similarly if ad hoc upgrade work takes place access seekers will n eed to be able to order replacement services if their exis ting services are longer available 398 accc final

confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 216equivalence in ordering and pr ovisioning relates to various considerations including the availability of services time taken for orders to be processed and the particular nature of the ordering process to ensure that the open access requirements of the rfp are met it would be expected that there would be procedures in place that allow access seekers to order and provision all services that can be accessed by other access seekers including the network provider if vertically integrated any inability to order particular products and hence to provide the full range of servic could have potentially serious affect companys ability to compete in the provi sion of telecommunications services this could negatively affect competition generally equally equivalence in orde ring and provisioning would ge nerally require that the time taken by any given access seeker to ve an order fulfilled is longer on average than any other service provider th is issue has been ra ised with the accc previously for example the time taken for ordering and provisioning the ulls was matter raised in arbitration that dis pute centred on the di sparity between the provisioning times for the ulls at 5 to 13 days with the provisioning time for telstras retail services at 2 to 3 days405 the impact on competition of significant disparities in the time taken for services to be provisioned will be felt if enduser customers regard access seekers as providi ng an inferior quality product because of long ordering times in such case acce ss seekers would be less able to compete because of difference in service quality th at is in the hands of the network provider rather than the access seeker this excl usionary behaviour would deny the access seeker party level playing field in the pr ovision of services nd lead to reduction in the access seekers demand existing differences in ordering and provisioni ng times to some extent reflects legacy ordering and provisioning systems that were not originally designed for access services and newer access service systems th at use different processes for example access seekers currently use the lolo and ullcis ordering systems to order services from telstra while telstra uses different ordering system for its internal products the systems used by access seekers also include processes set out in existing communications alliance codes which may not be as efficient as internal ordering processes and may not cater for th large amount of access services that are now ordered equivalence may not be easy to measure in such case an access seeker may acquire wholesale input from the network operator in certain period of time however if verticallyintegrated network operator regard s itself as providing retail services only to its own endusers it may be difficult to assess the time it takes to provision the wholesale service to it self and therefore to assess whether provisioning times for access seekers cons titute equivalent terms of access that said small amount of extra for provisioning service might not necessarily be considered discriminatory or anticompetitive or significantly aff ect companys ability to compete however period of days or weeks would probably do so it would be necessary to consider how much any

end users regard as competitive number of specific ordering issues have also been rais ed by industry and examined by the accc in the conduct of various regulatory processes these include the procedures that apply to managed network migrations mnms of large number of resale services to ulls or lss based supply such as minimum order numbers notice periods the way in whic h jumpering work can be performed and the number of mnms per day406 the absence of simple method to tran sfer from lss to ullsbased supply407 provisioning of ulls on lines with soft dial tone only408 the accc has noted that there are numbe r of competition implications of these ordering and provisioning issu it has set out model terms to better manage these concerns and issued arbitration final terminations that modify existing terms409 for the nbn number of these issues may become less relevant although they may remain issues in those areas where the nbn infrastructure is yet to be rolled out the development of ordering systems for the nb n provides an opportunity for systems to be developed that remove some of these legacy ordering issues and limitations the range of issues that have been raised with the accc in relation to ordering and provisioning emphasise that ordering and provisioning is significant area for consideration in assess ing the nbn proposals h43 fault repair and maintenance as with ordering and provisioning fault repa ir and maintenance is recognised in the current regime as nonprice aspect of access that should be provided on an equivalent basis between access seeker and access provider410 however fault repair and maintenance has perhaps been less c ontentious under the current access regime than ordering and provisioning the ac cc does receive some basic accounting separation measures relating to fault re pair for telstra resale services only411 in most senses the same fundamental issues apply in relation to equivalence in fault repair and maintenance as apply to equi valence in ordering an d provisioning access seekers need way to readily report faults to the network operator and need to have 406 accc final determination model nonprice

seekers not being able to readily re port faults or faults taking significantly longer to repair for one access seeker compar ed to another could lead to company suffering competitive detriment from bei ng known as having poor service quality despite such problems not being its fault verticallyintegrated operator would in particular have incentives to provide different levels of fault repair and maintenance to access seekers compared to its retail arm in order to allow its retail arm to provide better quality of service and gain comp etitive advantage significantly such an advantage would be entirely in the hands of the verticallyintegrated operator but would affect access seekers only as w ith ordering and provisioning such exclusionary behaviour would have the effect of reducing the demand of access seekers the accc notes also that equivalence in fault repair and maintenance should also mean that repair work once scheduled s hould be distributed on nondiscriminatory basis that is the faults reported by one or more access seekers should not be continually put to the back of the queue if fault reports come from some other access seeker or the retail arm of the network opera tor it would be preferable that systems are developed that do not disti nguish at the stage where fault repair work is allocated to technicians between services provided by one access seeker compared to another h44 facilities access facilities access terms and conditions set out the way in which an access seeker will access the facilities of the ne twork operator to acquire an access service and then interconnect equipment in order to supply services to endusers the current access regime requires companies providing declar ed services to access seekers to allow interconnection of facilit ies to allow the use of declared services412 facilities access has become significant issue in recent periods with acces s seekers raising concerns about in pa rticular obtaining access to exchanges to install dslam equipment413 parties have in particular rais ed concerns about exchange capping where an exchange has capacity in its di stribution frame or floor space in which competitors are allowed to make infrastructure builds414and queuingwhich relates to the procedures for the timing of entry into an exchange to conduct works and the order in which access seekers ma carry out infrastructure works under an nbn facilities access issues may be somewhat different to those under the current market structure in particular if the primary access service is bitstream service access seeker partie s are unlikely to need to obtain ac cess to exchange buildings to install dslam equipment furthermore many current exchange buildings may not be in existence as deploying fibre in the access network may render significant number of exchange buildings redundant 412 trade practices act 1974 cth section 152ar5 413 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions november 2008 p 51 414 there may be physical space available but the access provider is able to and does reserve space for its own anticipated requirements confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 219however facilities access could still be si gnificant consideration in an nbn context this is because access seekers may still require facilities access albeit of different types the first type of facili ties access that may be sought would be access to facilities at different parts of the network to allo w backhaul and core network interconnection with the nbnfor exampl access seekers may seek access to the exchange buildings which curre ntly house the pois for thei r backhaul investments or similar facilities the second t ype of facilities access that ght be relevant is if the successful proponent provides either initia lly or at some time in the future an unbundled subloop access service in such case access seekers would need to be able to obtain access to the cabinets at node s in order to interconnect their own access technology dslammsan infrastructure with that of the network operator accordingly it is relevant to consider some of the issues that have arisen to date in general parties should be able to r eadily obtain access to av ailable facilities to allow interconnection if inte rconnection is denied access seekers will evidently be unable to provide services to endusers limiting their ability to provide competitive services to endusers it woul d also have the potential to raise rivals costs as they may have to install additional interconnecti on facilities or install them in locations where greater backhaul is required this w ould similarly negativel affect the ability of access seekers to provide competition acco rdingly it is important that there are appropriate procedures in place to allow facilities access and he nce the provision of services to better permit competition on the rits the fact that access seekers have currently had difficulty in gaining access to fa cilities suggests that existing procedures could be improved on as an overall proposition equivalence in faci lities access is best served by all parties including any retail ar m of the network operator being subject to the same facilities access procedures at present telstra is not subject to the same capping and queuing procedures as access seekers and can re serve space for its reasonably anticipated requirements accordingly it may be appropria and better advance the principle of equivalence if the successful proponent and all access seekers have the same status under facilities access processes however there may be issues such as the uni versal service obliga tion uso or need to supply special services such as eftpos and security systems that currently limit the extent to which true equivalence could be achieved as the owne r of the facilities it is reasonable that telstra has degree of discretion in ga ining access to these facilities and allowing for its anticipated re quirements that said it would not be reasonable for telstra to for instance reserv excessive space to the point that access seekers were denied competitive entry the high court has pointed out that telstras ownership of the copper network always br ought with it obligations to provide third party access415 furthermore in the nbn context reasonably anticipated requirements would appear less likely to be an issue in particular if access is being obtained to bitstream services the nbn opera tor would only need to reserve space in relation to pois or if subloop access was pr ovided it would not appear to be an issue in relation to access to bitstream services 415 telstra corporation limited v the commonwealth 2008 hca 7 6 march 200 8 s422007 19 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 220the accc has previously considered in th context of access to exchanges that decisions by any network operator on whethe r access to facility can be obtained at all should be made according to the mo st recent and accurate information having regard to fair and reasonable criteria416 this same basic principle is equally applicable to the nbn context where access seekers may seek access to interconnection facilities or to node cabinets significantly there may be ways in which the capacity of an apparently full facility can be expanded and any facilities access approach would need to take account of the potential for building works to expand capacity accordingly if decision is made to classify facility as full and not accessible to access seekers such deci sion would need to be made only after recent inspection of the facility has been made this could be made by the network operator although access seekers may wish to also inspect the facilities and floor plans for access to backhaul in terconnection facilities or cabinet plans for access at the node etc have been verified the potential for building works or other solutions by which to increase capacity has recently been investigated where the decision is based upon reasona bly anticipated requirements of the access provider or another service provider discussed below all relevant details of those requirements including timing ve been documented and all necessary internal approvals or contractual arra ngements necessary for the implementation of that requirement have been established417 as noted above if decision is made to cla ssify building or facility as full this should equally apply to any retail arm of the network operator to the extent possible it would not achieve equivalence if acce ss seekers were not granted access but the retail arm of the network operator was then able to install significant further equipment the approach described above would help to provide certainty about facilities access issues it would also help to ensure th at decisions are made appropriately and therefore allow access seekers to seek facilities access on an equivalent basis and for competition to occur on its merits access s eekers would also need to be able to examine facilities examine documents about the available capacity in the facility and consider possible expansion methods and suggest them to the network operator however equivalence would also require th at the reasonable re quirements of other parties also be recognised an access seeker would not always have right to place infrastructure inside facility as this might take away from the requirements of existing access seekers or the retail arm of the network operator equivalence in facilities access equally requires that existi ng providers in facility do not lose or have to give up facilities access without ppropriate reason as noted above under the nbn such issues are likely to be more c onfined that the exchange access issues under the current market structure and restrict ed to poi access or should it be offered sub loop access 416 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions september 2008 p 53 417 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions september 2008 p 54 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 221in addition to consideration of whether faci lity can be accessed at all it may also be necessary in the nbn context to consider th way in which requests to gain access to facilities are ordered this may be less signi ficant for the nbn than under the current market structure where multiple access s eekers may be seeking to install dslams into exchanges but may still be relevant consideration in short equivalence would be best served by allowing multiple parties to enter facility to install infrastructure for interconnection where possible418 in particular it would only be appropriate to not allow such shared access where reasonabl necessary for health and safety reasons andor to ensure network reliability this w ill depend on the nature of the work that is carried out equivalence of access would be likely to be achieved if all work is automatically queued whether or not queuing is necessary particul arly if any retail arm of the access provider is not subject to th same limits it would also be preferable that terms and conditions re lating to facilities access low for queues to progress quickly where they are necessary equivalence in relation to queuing could be achieved by terms and conditions that require that the network operator be subj ect to the same queuing systems as access seekers this would provide incentives for the network operator to provide an orderly and efficient queuing system and would ensu re level playing field for competition h45 amendment of documents network operator would be likely to have operation manuals setting out issues such as the ordering and provisioning approach or facilities access rule that from time to time would need to be amended similarl the access agreements between parties may need to be varied from time to time such amendments may be necessary for the efficient operation of the network and to specify appropriate processes for new servi ces accordingly it is necessary for there to be nptcs setting out how amendments may be made to both the access agreements and operational manuals can be made in general there should not be power that allows unilateral amendments by the network operator without consultation with an affected access seeker in relation to access agreements which are contract between the access seeker and access provider it would usually be necessary for agreement to be made by the two parties involved clause that reserved unilate ral right to amend access agreements would seem unlikely to achieve equivalence be tween the access provider and access seeker instead access agreements should usually be amended by agreement between the parties it can be seen that were unilateral amen dments permitted vertically integrated network operator would have in centives to amend its access agreements in way that disadvantaged competing access seekers this may include arbitrary changes to requirements that raise the costs of the access seeker or prevent it from providing services this would reduce the competition provided by such companies operational manuals may have slightly di fferent considerations these documents do not describe the fundamental relationshi p between the parties but can specify 418 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions september 2008 p 58 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 222important information about exactly how service can be acquired and operated they will typically be documents that apply to all access seekers equally an acc ess provider can require flexibility to modify such document to allow for necessary changes to properly manage the network ho wever access seekers will equally adapt their systems to interact with the provisions of the operational documents and changes to such specifications will therefor affect the ability of access seekers to provide competitive services to endusers the accc has considered previously that access seeker agreement to changes in operational manuals should only be require d if the changes ar specific to the particular access seeker419 for changes of general app lication it would likely be sufficient that notice of planned changes is given to all access seekers to allow them to provide comment and that the access provider is required to consider such changes in good faith parties would also be able to us general dispute resolution procedures equivalence in such circumstance could be better achieved if the access provider is also required to follow the procedures in the operational manuals which should be feasible if they are of gene ral application however as not ed previously vertically integrated network operator may not consider that it acquires the same services as access seekers overall amendments to both access agreem ents and operational manuals should not be unilateral and should include some consultation with affected parties amendments which materially affect part icular party to the exclusion of others should be required to be the subject of agreement between the parties while amendments to generally applicable docu ments may simply require an appropriate period of consultation h46 confidential information an access provider will have significant confidential information about the endusers served by its access seeker customers accordi ngly it will be necessary for there to be arrangements in place to handle and prot ect this conf idential information the rfp contains requirement for an information strategy420 and the accc has also previously considered the competition implications of confidentiality issues in it s model nonprice terms and condition s and in arbitration processes421 related issue is the ability of the access provider to co mmunicate with the ndusers of an access seeker confidentiality restrictions sh ould equally apply to the conduct of access seekers in relation to the confidentia l information of the access provider the most obvious category of confidential information that will be known by an access provider is the identity of the endusers served by any given access seeker in the current regime such information may be limited to the identity or location of the enduser particularly when the enduser is served by ulls and the access provider 419 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions november 2008 p 38 420 rfp schedule 2 147aii 421 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions november

confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 223may have visibility of the type of retail service provide d by the access seeker however under an nbn there will be greater level of information known by the access seeker about each enduser such as the particular bitstream service acquired for that endusers requirements the network operator may also have information related to other more general aspects of the access seekers business such as forecasting information planned entry into pa rticular geographic areas or information about the access s eekers facilities422 it would not be appropriate for netw ork operator to pass enduser customer information on to its own retail arm if vertic ally integrated or other access seekers thus allowing the endusers to be directly targeted such use of information would have clear negative effect on competi tion as the access seeker would have reciprocal knowledge about the operations of the network operator or the other retail operators accordingly it w ould be necessary for there to be in place restriction that states that any information concerni ng an access seekers endusers can not be provided to or used by the reta il arm of any other service pr ovider and that any use of the information only be for network operation and billing purposes without such restriction there would be str ong incentives for such informa tion to be used to target the access seekers customers and impe competition confidential information could however be used in other ways if consent was provided by the access seeker similarly where the information relates to pa rticular investment plans or forecasts of an access seeker the network provider should not be able to target competitive retail response based on the use of confidential information availabl to it through its wholesale operations communications with endusers should also be restricted in other ways as noted above access seeker information about end user customers should not be used to target those customers the access provider shou ld only be able to deal with that end user customer where necessary for network management purposes or where they supply some other service to that enduser equally in the course of conducting fault repair or maintenance work the network ope rators technicians should not target the enduser whose premises are being re paired for winback appropriate confidentiality arrangements should preven t such behaviour from taking place because the fault repair or maintenance wo rk is being done on behalf of the access seeker it should not be used as an oppor tunity to perform targeted marketing these restrictions on the use of information may be more relevant in nbn context with the current use of ulls and lss physical jumpering must be performed to switch customer away from one service pr ovider to another which requires some time and cost to perform comparatively if most or all servic providers are using bitstream services and switching between service providers does not require any physical wiring changes the transfer of enduser customers may be relatively straightforward accordingly there may be greater incentives to attempt target win back activity 422 list of examples of information likely to be considered confidential information is contained in telstra information security strategy 23 june 2006 clause 32 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 224it should be noted that such restrictions on the use of information do not prevent customers being marketed to through the use of general marketing or offers to particular classes of endusers this is part of healthy competitive process however the restrictions would prevent the use of confidential informati on of the access seeker to inappropriately and anticompetiti vely target enduser customers h47 other issues the accc has considered number of other nonprice terms and conditions in various processes under the tpa issues that have arisen include billing creditworthiness suspension and termination of services423 billing has perhaps been less contentious issu than others such as fault repair or ordering and provisioning equiva lence in billing should be relatively straightforward to ensure between access seekers parties should face the same terms billing pe riods and rebilling periods as other access seekers issues related to billing may be more likely to arise when considering an access seeker and the retail arm of vertically integrated network operator as the reta il arm of the network operator would be unlikely to be charged bill in the same sense as an access seeker would it may not be possible to have the same terms and conditions applying to both companies instead equivalence in billing can best be served by an appropr iate set of rules relating to billing these would include rule s that do not make it unduly difficult for the access seeker to pay its bills such as very short payment period after bill is issued or render it subject to rebilling long period of time after bill was initially paid it would also require that an access provider has in centives to get bills correct and that billing disputes can be notifie d and dealt with in an appropriate way in relation to creditworthiness and suspension and termination of services there will be times when it is appropriate for the network operator to i nquire into the access seekers ability to pay and require that s ecurity be provided or to suspend or cancel services supplied to an acce ss seeker where bills are not paid creditworthiness terms may be necessary to ensure that an access seeker can pay its bills however there should not be any blanket obligations to provi security or provide credit information before access can be given as this may impe the access seekers ability to readily compete in the market424 such steps should only be taken where necessary such as for new access seeker or company with history of poor creditworthiness it would be unreasonable for network operator to require increases in security or implement credit checks and require credit information at will equally such arrangements should not low the network opera tor to suspend or terminate services without good reason notice should typically be given unless there is case where the access seeker is insolven t or there is some sort of emergency or 423 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions november 2008 p 1419 3638 424 accc

other cases such as wh ere there is some sort of breach of the access agreement or failure to pay bill on time notice should be given and an opportunity such as 20 business days be provided to allow the breach to be remedied426 the accc has previously considered th at there may be need for separate procedures in relation to billing disp utes as compared to other disputes427 this recognises that the issues in billing dis pute may be relatively sp ecific and more time critical than other disput dispute resolution is considered further below h5 nonprice terms and conditionsdispute resolution and compliance the rfp states that proponents should specify the proposed mechanisms for enforcing and resolving commercial disputes on the terms and conditions for access and interconnection servi ces provided on the nbn428 variety of regulatory tools may be available to monitor and enforce obligations and resolve disputes regarding nonprice terms and conditions these tools will range from being relatively handsoff to being rela tively interventionist examples of the various approaches can be seen in exis ting forms of regulation although there may also be additional methods available the workings and effectiveness of these regulatory options are discussed in more detail in appendix f the appropriate tools will depend on the na ture of the incentives of the network operator to engage in anticompetitive nonpr ice exclusionary behaviour the strength of these incentives will depend on structur issues which are examined in more detail in appendix f less prescriptive approach to monitori ng and enforcing the nptcs of access would rely on the use of expost enforcemen t activity the accc currently has an enforcement role in telecommunications under pa rt xib of the tpa this part sets out the circumstances in which carriers and carriage service providers are said to engage in anticompetitive conduct and sets up special regime for regulating anticompetitive conduct in the telecommunicati ons industry it applies in addition to part iv of the tpa this expost enforcemen t approach is less prescriptive in that it does not set any particular terms beforehand allows parties to reach their own agreement on nptcs and then relies on subs equent complaints to and enforcement action by the accc including the imposition of penalties and remedies it is perhaps instructive that number of expost compe tition notices in the early period of the telecommunications regulatory regime around 1997 to 2001 related to nonprice issues in wholesale markets429 425 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions november 2008 p 3638 426 accc final determination model nonprice terms and conditions november 2008 p 37 427 accc model nonprice terms and conditions

customer to another provider the acccs competition notices confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 226an additional power under part xib that may facilitate the use of expost enforcement activity would be the use of the acccs pow er to make record keeping rules rkrs to obtain information about nptcs for example in 2003 the accc used those rkr powers to introduce accounting separation of telstra which was intended to provide greater transparency of telstras operations to sure that it does not unfairly discriminate between access seekers using it s network and its own retail operations under accounting separation telstra is requir ed to provide the accc with reports on key performance indicators kpis on non price terms and conditions that compare telstras customer service performance between specified retail and wholesale supplied services nptc reports kpis on nonprice terms and conditions of access measure the difference between the percentage of telstra wholesale and retail customers that meet required performance st andard set out in the customer service guarantee it should be noted however that the m onitoring information captured under the accounting separation regime is highly aggreg ated and can hide specific instances of anticompetitive behaviourindeed the report is not intended to identify whether particular instances of discrimination may have occurred it does not necessarily ensure that telstra consistently applies equi valent treatment of its wholesale and retail customers in the normal course of business another relatively light touch approach to monitoring nonprice terms would be to continue the use of set of model term s as outlined above the model nonprice terms are nonbinding and are signed to provide industry w ith an upfront view of the likely approach that the accc would ta ke to particular issue in arbitration although they are nonbinding and therefor not enforceable the model nptcs may assist parties to reach commercial agreement on access or to submit access undertakings assuming the power to make np tcs of this type remains open to the accc430 in contrast to the model nonprice terms more prescriptive approach would be the use of access undertakings access undertak ings can be lodged by access providers under part xic of the tpa and are if accep ted by the accc legally binding they are designed to promote certainty the settlement of access arrangements and reduce regulatory gaming and delay by setting price andor nonprice terms for access to declared services across the entire industr however undertakings lodged with the accc have traditionally covered mainly pr icing matters in recent undertakings given to the accc the only significant nonprice rms in the undertakings have related to network modernisation and the saos in the past the accc has considered that access undertakings do not need to be exhaustive given that terms or matters not addressed in the undertaking can potentially be addressed by recourse to arbitration or commercial negotiation431 the are available at the acccs website at httpwwwacccgovauconten

broadband network probity clearance 227accc seeks to be satisfied that any nonpr ice terms and conditions would not create barrier to access seekers ga ining equivalent services432 more prescriptive approach to enforci ng nptcs would be the use of reference offerwhich would require the regulator or other third party to set binding terms and conditions for access to nbn services in comparison to the current voluntary undertaking process this is more interv entionist as it does not rely on the access provider coming forward with proposal but instead sets terms and conditions that will apply to the industry in effect the re ference offer could be considered binding form of the model nptcs and would to large extent re place the existing negotiatearbitrate model of access in the exis ting legislation an advantage of this mechanism is that the thr eat of unfavourable regulato ry intervention may tend to encourage more negotiation between access ekers and access providers in any case in determining the appropriate regulatory tools which form the framework applied to the nbn it is relevant to consider the incentives for nonprice discrimination which closely relates to the structural form of the nbn operator when applied to vertically integrated operator th various regulatory options can only reduce the scope and incentives for nonprice discrimination rather than eradicate them as such the need for more interventionist ap proach to nptcs such as the use of reference offer may be more pressing where the incentives for anticompetitive exclusionary behaviour are hi gh similarly the need for part icular nptcs in addition to those in the rfp to be specified in the existing arrangements will depend on the extent of incentives to discriminate the effectiveness of various approaches ch as operational separation to countering the structural incentives to discriminate and engage in anticompetitive behavi our is discussed further in the appendix abou t structural issu appendix f h6 overall conclusion on nonprice terms and conditions this report considers the ro of nonprice terms and conditions nptcs that would govern the relationship between the nbn ope rator and its wholesale customers the governments rfp specifically requires proponents to addre ss number of non price terms and conditions in their proposals and to specify the measures and models that will ensure equivalence433 however the objective of equivalence cannot be readily guaranteed as network operators pa rticularly those which are vertically integrated will have incentives to engage in anticompetitive conduct verticallyintegrated network operator s considerable scope and incentive to engage in exclusionary nonprice behaviour that uses nptcs to place rival firms at competitive disadvantage for example the network provider might use refusals or unjustified delays to interconnection to ra ise rivals costs or lower rivals demand access seekers facing nonprice discriminati on from vertically integrated operator could be significantly disadvantaged by an ticompetitive nptcs as they lose the ability to compete on the merits of their competitive offerings to endusers 432 ibid p 52 433 eg rfp p 2 1110 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 228there is wide range of nptcs that may be important considerations in the nbn in particular notification of network changes ordering and provisioning processes fault repair and maintenance facilities access amendment of documents treatment of confidential information and number of other issues would all be important considerations in assessing the poten tial competition effects of nptcs monitoring and enforcing anticompetitive c onduct by vertically integrated operator in nonprice commercial arrangements can be complex number of monitoring mechanisms would be available to address c oncerns that the netw ork operator is not providing an equivalent level of service in relation to np tcs for example in fault repair and maintenance to its wholesale cu stomers as it provides to its own retail arm in determining the appropriate regulatory tools to monitor and enforce the nptcs to apply under the nbn consideration of the st ructural form of the nbn operator and hence incentives for particular behaviour is relevant the accc examines structural issues in appendix f confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 229appendix i transition and migration i1 executive summary the rollout of the national broadband ne twork nbn should happen as quickly as possible but should be conducted in way that promotes competition if the rollout is not conducted in such way there could be significant competitive detriment arising from the rollout meaning that the potential benefits of the nbn may not be realised the successful pr oponent could have the incentive and opportunity to perform the rollout in ch way that harms the competitive constraint currently provided by access seekers the transition to the nbn can be thought of as the timeline for the overall rollout of the nbn into different geographi c regions over period of years migration can be thought of as the actual physical process of cutover to the new network at particular point in time the main transition and migration issues centre on the ability of service providers and enduser customers to smoothly migrate services from copper to fibre ie to the services delivered over the nbn ny approach to transition and migration should ensure that both wholesale custom ers and retail enduser s receive sufficient time and information to best guarantee continuity of service the process and forecasting for the nbn rollout the length of notice that is received of pending infrastructure works the content of any migration notice provided and commitments to equivale nce and nondiscrimination are all important considerations in ensuring tr ansition and migration from the copper network to the nbn happen in manne r which does not harm competition or cause significant disruption nd detriment to endusers some of the key benefits of systematic transition and migr ation process include continuity of service greater certainty for access seekers in making infrastructure investment decisions and greater certai nty for all parties in negotiating access arrangements for the nbn equivalence and nondiscrimination in both information and service availability are important principles in the rollout central principle might involve an obligation by the successful pr oponent to give an equivalent period of notice and equivalent notice content to access seekers to that which it gives itself any equivalence commitments would be in addition to sufficient minimum notice period the request for proposals rfp provides for some key transition and migration documents the project schedule and information strategy will be important documents in the rollout in addition detailed notice of migration is likely to provide greater certainty these docum ents would allow access seekers to undertake planning of activitie s relevant to their own network migration such as equipment purchases workforce planning and customer marketing and interaction the project schedule should adequately set out the forecast timings for the rollout of the nbn across the different geographi c regions of australia the notice of migration should provide confirmed details of the time and nature of upgrades in confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 230particular geographic area and lock in the successful proponents commitments to wholesale customers these documents will need to be detailed and provide for equivalence in the provision of information to the industry the proposed initial rollout period is also significant the ccessful proponent will most likely begin deploying fibre soon after being awarded the nbn contract leaving access seekers with limited notice to avoid potential problems with this short notice period the successful proponent couldin the first part of the rollout periodbegin deployment in areas with competitive infrastructure dslams and msans the geographic approach to the rollout insideout vs outsidein may also have an important impact on whether the future competitiveness of current access seekers is affected however concerns about competitive harm stemming from the geographic approach to the rollout may be lessened if documents such as the project schedule and notice of migration ar appropriately specified information about the likely location of fu ture points of interconnection is also likely to be crucial to the ability of ccess seekers to provide services over the nbn confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 231i2 introduction and background one of the commonwealths objectives in its rfp is for the nbn to be rolled out and made operational progressively over fi ve years from the date of execution of contract between the commonw ealth and successful proponent434 this appendix examines the specific provi sions contained within the governments rfp and also looks at approaches taken inte rnationally with particular focus on the netherlands and new zealand435 significant competition issues could arise from the approach taken to the rollout of the new network there would be for example significant potential and incentive for the successful proponent to utilise the build to adversely affect the ability of certain competitors in the market to provide services this incentive would be particularly str ong if the successful pr oponent was vertically integrated this stems from the fact that the nbn operator is likely to have market power where pricing of the wholesale serv ices supplied over the nbn is subject to regulation there will be incentives for dominant vertically integrated network operator to engage in exclusionary nonpric behaviour to affect the competitiveness of its access seeker competitors broa dly there may be three categories of exclusionary behaviour that such an operator could engage in refusals and delays in interconnection raising rivals costs lowering rivals demands436 the successful proponent may be able to achieve some or all of these by exploiting the transition and migration arrangements to the nbn comparatively such incentives might be lessened were the nbn operator not vertically integrated however an nbn ope rator that was not vertically integrated would still want to conduct rollout in particular wayfor example to rollout the network in metropolitan regions first for the financial viability of the new network even if such rollout is not intended as ex clusionary it will still have an impact on the competitive scenarios for existing access ekers further it would be necessary to account for the fact that if one or more acc ess seekers had some ownership interest in and hence representation on the board of the network provider they may be in an advantageous position compared to other access seekers as such transition and migration issues remain important even where the successful proponent is not vertically integrated 434 rfp section 1317 435 fibre rollouts are being considered undertaken in number of countries such as germany france italy the uk japan and south korea however the netherlands and new zealand examples provide greater level of detail in rms of rollout forecasts and notice periods 436 laffont and tirole competition in telecommunications 2000 p 1645 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 232transition and migration are not necessarily distinct concepts in all circumstances and are often used interchangeably howeve r distinction between the two terms might prove useful this appendix emphasi ses the importance of both an initial forecast requirement under the rfp thr ough the project schedule and shorter term notice of migration the followi ng descriptions are not meant as rigid definitions but can instead be thought of as broad distinctions transition timeline and details regarding the general rollout of the nbn for example the proposed approach to deployment by geographic area involves project schedule forecast migration the actual cutover of customer s from the old network to the new from x services to services on z dateeg timeframes operational and facilities information for partic ular region potenti ally provided through notice of migration major reason that the transition and migration between the copper and fibre networks is an issue relates to the type of technology that has been deployed by access seekers to date current exchangebased broadband equipment such as dslams and msans which is used in conjunction with unbundled services such as the ulls and lss relies on complete unbroken copper li ne between the exchange equipment and the enduser to provide broadband and voice services if the nbn is rolled out as fibre to the node fttn network the upgrad will likely involve building new fibre out from the exchange to node next to each streetpillar in place of the previously existing copper accordingly under such ployment the removal of part of the copper and replacement by fibre means there will be complete copper path and hence way for the exchangebased dslammsan equipment to be used to supply broadband services accordingly the equipment would longer be useful in the exchange this is often referred to as the stranding of dslams and msans while in theory both copper cable and fibr path between node and exchange could be maintained there are potentially large technical and economic barriers to the co existence of exchangebased competition with nbn the technical barriers include the possibility of interference between coppe r and fibre while the economic barriers include the cost of maintaining two netw orks accordingly existing investments in technologies used with unbundled services such as current exchangebased dslams and msans may become redundant as the new network begins operation of course it is not expected that all unconditioned local loop services ulls and line sharing services lss will become redundant immediat ely after the government awards the nbn contract the nbn is to become operational progressively over an extended period and as such current services will be pr ogressively phased out as customers are migrated to the nbn the way in which the nbn rollout occu rs could therefore have significant competition effects in particular the tice periods that are received of pending works and the order in which the nbn is rolled out to particular geographic areas could be significant to whether the future competitiveness of curre nt access seekers is affected the competitiveness of downstream markets could be adversely affected i f vertically integrated access provider or only certain access seekers can provide confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 233service to retail endusers from day one while absent fficient upfront information competing access seekers face lag to provide services this lag would arise from the time taken for access seekers to design and bu ild the facilities required to migrate existing customers or commence marketing services provided over the nbn to win new customers given the scale of an nbn upgrade and the specification of new access services access seekers may require greater certainty th an would be needed for the introduction of an additional access service provided over the current copper access network relevantly the rfp requires proponents to devise high level framework for fibre transition and customer migration the rfp asks proponents to draft project schedule setting out how the ne twork is to be rolled out437 as well as an information strategy which places broad requirements to inform wholesale customers regarding transition to the new network and migration to new services438 addressing these rfp requirements requires consider ation of both the timing and project plans for the roll out of the nbn across the country and the manner in which any particular line or exchange service area is migrated this appendix provides an overview of th competition issues in relation to the transition and migration from the copperbas ed network to the rvices provided by the nbn specifically section i3 will examine the project schedule and transition section i4 will examine migration and notice section i5 will examine the immediate start to the rollout and the geographic approach taken section i6 will examine points of interconnection pois section i7 will examine compliance and oversight i3 project schedule and transition competition could be significantly affected by the approach taken to rollout of the nbn in particular if rollout occurs to schedule that does not adequately allow existing service providers to perform the necessary activit ies to switch from provision over the existing copperbased network to the nbn competition from those service providers might be significantly reduced on ce the nbn is rolled out there would be particular risk of this were the successful proponent ver tically integrated as it would have incentives to engage in exclusionary behaviour that would gi ve its retail arm competitive advantage over access seekers the rfp requires proponents to provide project schedule which asks that proponents should provide at geographically disaggregated level the start date and timeframes for the rollout of the proposed network infrastructure the sup ply of wholesale and 437 rfp schedule 2 clause 13b 438 rfp schedule 2 clause 147 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 234where relevant retail services and any planned geographic expansions and technological upgrades proponents should include detailed project schedule including milestones critical paths key decision points and the identification of any required outcomes to move forward proponents should detail milestones reflecting the progressive coverage targets to be met during the deployment period where relevant the proponent should indicate whether the timeframes for the c ompletion of the infrastructure build and supply of services and applications eg voic and broadband services would differ an d any planned prioritisation of regions all key assumptions upon which the timeframe is based should be set out and any risks to the sc hedule should be identified439 in relation to existing services and infrastructure the rfp provides that in cases where the proponent co nsiders existing exchangebased services cannot feasibly co exist with the nbn proponents should clearly set out the timetable and processes for transition between existing services and the nbn440 further proponents ar asked to detail the extent to which existing infrastructure is to be utilise d in the nbn and the extent to which existing infrastructure is already capable of delivering minimum dedicated downlink speed of 12 mbps over each connection441 how this is linked to the proposed rollout schedule including the pro posed use of pre existing fttn and fttp equipment conduit manholes pits exchange buildin gs and existing backhaul transmission442 the rfp also requires that proponents should provide information that substantiates the practicality and feasibility of fully implementing and successfully operating the nbn within the proposed timeframe 443 i31 transition and forecasting approach the rfp requirement for proponents to provide project schedule is significant the project schedule is important to access seekers because th ey may in response to the nbn rollout need to among other things negotiate access to new wholesale services both in areas where they

cut over to fibrebased access pote ntially stranding their existing assets schedule technicians to install necessary equipment to interconnect with the nbn perform any necessary ma rketing to endusers these responses could take considerable time in sourcing andor constructing necessary facilities equipmen t and services in order to maintain service provision during and following the network upgrade the rfp asks for proponents to set out detailed project schedule including milestones critical paths and key decision points but does not set out how these particular points should be addressed given that cutover to the new network may otherwise largely occur at the discretion of the successf ul proponent the project schedule would need to be transparent nd sufficiently detailed with specified planned periods and information about rollout to allow access seek ers to assess which will be cut over to an nbn with reasonable accuracy the rollout schedule would in particular need to be provided and settled be fore the rollout actually commences even if not finalised within proposals the information in the schedule would mean that access seekers were less likely to suffer competitive detriment from the rollout access seekers will be better ab with detail about the likely project schedule to plan their infr astructure works and perform marketing relevant to the nbn as well as negotiate access to new services as mentioned some access s eekers will also need to inform their retail customers of any change or temporary disruption during the transition process provision of the rollout information will allow access seekers to compete on an equal footing with other service providers including the retail arm of the network operator sh ould it be vertically integrated the competitive implications from not knowi ng detailed level of information about the timing of the planned nbn rollout is relatively straightforward access seekers need to know when and where rollout will ccur in order to plan their deployments furthermore the detail of the project sche dule is also important in the absence of detailed information access seekers could pl an unnecessary work or fail to perform planning and organisational work which is cruc ial to their ability to transition services properly this would raise their costs perhaps causing financial damage to these companies and also in some cases preven t their ability to pr ovide continuity of services to endusers access seekers who experien ce service dropouts and cannot guarantee continuity of servic would be likely to be unattractive to many enduser customers and would therefore likely suffer competitive detriment this would have negative competition effects this could be particularly exacerbated were vert ically integrated network operator or other access ekers able to provide such continuity of service this timing issue also affects concerns bout the effect on exis ting assets of access seekers and on the investment decisions to be made while the nbn is being rolled out to the extent that service providers have installed infrastructure in exchanges lack of sufficient information about rollout plans would have the potential to harm the investment outcomes for those providers as the assets may be suddenly stranded in confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 236the absence of sufficient notice it may also affect any potential installation of infrastructure now in fear of these new ssets being suddenly stranded by the rollout the rfp requires the project schedule to be geographically disaggr egated in this regard should the successful proponents project schedule specify geographically small areas such as those seen in the rollout forecasts required of telecom new zealand discussed further below then it will provide greater certainty for access seekers transitioning to the new network ccess seekers would have greater certainty by for example being provided with da or list rather than capital city or municipal council list infrastructure work and customer interacti on would need to be targeted towards the particular regions that ar being cut over to the nbn geographically detailed project schedule would allo w this to occur much of the work involved in transitioning to the nbn will be specific to particular and small geographic regions were access seekers not to know which geographic area work was to be conducted in they would be significantly hampered in their ability to plan the necessary activities to manage transition it would be reasonable to xpect that some deviations from the original project schedule might occur within the overall 5y ear build envisaged by the rfp and that not all arrangements for migration to the new network would necessarily be in place at the time the nbn contract is signed ccordingly the successf ul proponent might be asked to publish rolling forecasts updated on predefined basis this would allow access seekers to tailor their own planni ng appropriately and be able to better assess where work is required rather th an being subject to changing targets i32 international examples an example of how to address project sc heduling concerns can be drawn from new zealand where the commerce commissi on telecom new zealand and access seekers have been addressing transition nd migration

approach to migration as with telecom new zealands cabinetisation notice kpns migration agreement provide s for detailed information about notice periods and changes to the network and rvices in this regard the migration agreement which is published on kpns web site seems to be transparent way of ensuring commitments to minimal disruption for its wholesale customers however the dutch process is quite different to that being followed in australia and hence may not be as applicable i4 migration and notice in addition to project schedule it will be necessary for the nbn builder to provide ongoing notification of upcoming migration act ivity both the notice period and the information to be provided in such noti ce of migration are impor tant considerations detailed notice of migration may also provide for firm commitments by the successful proponent and greater ce rtainty for access seekers the rfp specifies requirements for the migration of both retail and wholesale customers the government will need to be assured that existing retail customers w ill experience or minimal disruption to their services and also that the migration of w holesale customers will not be subject to anticompetitive delays or pr ocessing timetables proponents should ensure that equivalent or superior services to those that are currently available ca n be offered to all existing customers 449 proponents should describe in detail arrangements to migrate existing whole sale services and customers to the nbn450 as noted above the rfp also requires that the proponent have an information strategy that sets out how wholesale customers will be notified of changes to the network451 448 kpn draft mdf migration agreement 25 april 2008 online at httpwwwkpn wholesalecomtemplatesdi spatcherasppage_id1933 449 clause 1513 p 89 450 schedule 2 clause 146a p 15 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 239a notice of migration would operate as c onfirmation at some certain period before actual physical infrastructure work took place that work was scheduled for particular date and time it would also provide specific information about the work that would occur the benefits of sufficient migration noti ce are likely to include minimal disruption to current retail customers and the wholes ale customers of the nbn operator minimal disruption to wholesale customers will ensure that the competition provided by these customers is not negatively affected large disruptions would limit the competitiveness of the service offerings and hence position in the market of such firms particularly if the same level of disruption was not experienced by any retail arm of the successful proponent or by othe r access seekers this imbalance could occur where vertically integrated networ k operator provided more information about the timing or nature of upcoming migration to its own wholesale and retail arm than to other companies this would mean that it would better be able to manage the transition issues compared to those other companies which would be an anti competitive effect stemming from the rollout i41 equivalent notice an approach might be taken which oblig the successful proponent to give an equivalent period of notice to access seeker s should the successful proponent be vertically integrated this will most likely require something more than previously suggested approaches within the cont ext of the copper access network of simultaneously notifying the retail arm of the vertically integrated operator and notifying access seekers at the same time for example in relation to network modernisation notification periods telstr has previously proposed the use of website that would be used to notify telstr retail and access seekers at the same time of pending network mode rnisation activities452 however notification to the retail arm of verticallyintegrate d provider at the same time as access seekers would not necessarily ensure equivalence between th verticallyintegrated provider and access seekers as the companys wholesale arm woul d be able to engage in infrastructure planning and building before the notification was posted to this end equivalence provisions might be measured not only against the successful proponents retail arm but also to its business units responsible for organising interconnection and arranging for chnical work to be planned453 this approach would ensure access seekers would be informed of network modernis ation activities at the same time as the network operators wholes ale arm in order to give access seekers the time for their own infrastructure pl anning and service tinuity arrangements such as negotiating access to new services notably telstra has not in the past even 451 rfp schedule 2 clause 147 452 accc assessment of telstras ulls monthly charge undertakingfinal decision august 2006 p 177 453 the concept of equivalence is currently in lstras operational separation plan as part of the information equivalence strategy eis obligations under its operational separation plan telstra undertakes that any information provided by the key network services bus iness unit or the wholesale business unit to wholesal customers about relevant change s to telstras network is to the extent possible equivalent to the provision of the same or simila r information to the retail business unit453 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 240provided commitment to give an equivalent period of notice of proposed network upgrade to an access seeker to that which it gives to its retail business units454 the timing of decisions to perform migrati on work has been an issue examined by the accc in arbitrations455 that assessment noted that appr opriately defining the point in time at which the access provider is deemed to have received notice would be crucial to the success of implementing equivalent tice in the context of the legacy copper can one possible approach would be to ba the time of the d ecision and hence the requirement to provide notification to acce ss seekers on the date on which telstra approves or allocated any capital expenditure to an upgrade456 however in the transition to the nbn where capital expenditu re may be allocated at the start of the project this may be less suitable altern atively some other particular event or approval within company may be appropriate as long as it was clearly defined and compliance could be observed equivalence is desirable because it leads to level playing field between competitors and allows them to compete based on their respective merits the australian competition tribunal recognised the importan ce of equivalence in notice periods for network upgrades stating that failure to give an equivalent period of notice of proposed network upgrade to an access seeker as the network operator gives to its retail business units was r eason for objection to telstr as network modernisation provisions457 the importance of equivalence in provision of information is also implied in certain documents forming exis ting operational separation obligations for example telstra is required to produce an information equivalence strategy under its operational separation plan osp458 if truly equivalent notice is provided between all companies the ability to compete and to manage the transition to the nbn will largely come down to the respective merits of the companies operations rather th an an artificial adva ntage to one or more operators due to the withholding of info rmation the degree to which proponents can make commitments on equivalent procedures is therefore relevant consideration it would also be necessary to account for the fact that if one or more access seekers had an ownership interest in and hen ce representation on the board of the nbn provider they may receive information about proposed deployments earlier than other access seekers459 any equivalence of notice provisions would need to account for this source of information as well as any official notice methods 454 see eg telstras access undertaking ulls

not by itself provide sufficient certainty to service providers of the likely notice periods that would apply it may be more realistic to assess what reasonable length of time w ould be for access seekers to be able to make alternative arrangements to the curr ent exchangebased ulls and then simply enforce this minimum notice period in its access arrangements with access seekers telstra ty pically specifies 15week notification period for major network upgrades however the australian competition tribunal has expressed the view that notic period of 15 weeks is inadequate for major network upgrade such as fibretothenode460 similarly the accc concluded in its recen tly published determination on model non price terms and conditions that equivalent notice but so minimum period of six months notice should be provided to acce ss seekers for major network upgrades461 fibre deployment in the access network would certainly constitute major network upgrade although the model nonprice term s and conditions do not apply to the nbn462 in this regard the governments cons ultative process w ould be the more appropriate forum within which nonpr ice issues should be developed specifying minimum notice period is largely an exercise in balancing the concerns and requirements of the part rolling out the fibre nd access seekers the accc commented in its model nonprice terms and conditions that six months would represent reasonable approach and bala nce the competing interests of access provider and access seeker i43 service disruption the acccs latest model nonprice terms and conditions may also provide for an appropriate approach to the rfps conti nuity of services and minimal disruption requirements the model nonprice terms and conditions proposed that the lss to ulls migration process should provide for enduser service disruption of less than three hours463 further any enduser involvement in that migration is not required this target timeframe of thr ee hours has also recently b een specified by the european regulators group erg for managed network migrations mnm processes in its report on best practices on regulatory re gimes in wholesale unbundled access and bitstream access464 as an indicative approach th is maximum threehour service disruption would be broadly appropriate fo r any cutover to bitstream access services in australia the inclusion of

only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 242i44 operations support systems it is important that effective operations support systems are in place well before migration effective operations support sy stem interfaces have been critical to competition on existing networks and are li kely to be equally so for the access services supplied over the nbn notice peri ods become irrelevant if company is unable to order an equivalent replacement service for those longer available after network transition work has taken place should there be way to order an equivalent replacement service access seekers may suffer significant competitive detriment from not being able to supply replacements for the access products they currently use to supply services to endusers not having such systems in place at the time of the rollout could have significant competition consequences as competitors of the network operator could their existing customer base these competition consequences would be particularly str ong if verticallyi ntegrated successful proponent is able to provide services f undamentally access seekers would want to be reassuredvia both well detailed pr oject schedule and migration noticethat the processes for ordering new nbn servic is transparent and supplied on an equivalent basis just as importantly access seekers would want to have sufficient visibility of provisioning and fault repor ting and rectification i45 locking in migration commitments finally it is clear that the impor tance of any notice of migrati on rests in the fact that it can lock in commitments made by the successful proponent the notice of migration would essentially require proponents to commit to the migration of particular geographic area at particular time for example 6month migration period the maximum 3hour enduser service disr uption and operations support system requirements without some form of locki n and penalties for not meeting migration commitments proponents may not have suffi cient incentive to conduct transition and migration in way that is quivalent for all retail provide rs this would lead to an uneven competitive playing field for the parties in the market this need for lockin would be particularly relevant given that the overall transition project schedule may need to vary over time as noted above there may be need for the rollout schedule to be published on rol ling basis as the network is rolled out i46 international examples examples of how to address migration and notice considerations can be drawn from new zealand and the netherlands under its unbundled copper local loop ucll standard terms determination telecom new zealand is required to provide access seekers with an initial notice of cabinetisa tion for the first 24 months and cabinetisation notice at least 24 months before any other cabinetisation takes place ie that was not addre ssed in the initial notice content of the notice will include affected confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 243 exchanges lines per exchange access seekers per exchange and ucll per exchange and ucll cessation date termination of ucll supply and the comple tion of cabinetisation required within 3 months of the planned date for cabine tisation as set out in the cabinetisation notice or the initial notice in some circumstances such as where there is material risk to the ucll service telecom may amend these notices or may cab inetise part of its network by giving less than 24 months notice in these events and if re quested by the access seeker telecom must pay for the transfer of the access seekers customers to other telecom services465 further the notice must explain the effect on any access seekers in receipt of the ucll service this cabinetisation notice requi rement would serve similar function to that which notice of migration might serve in the au stralian context pr oviding detailed and specific information about each actual upgrade as it takes place as well as providing confirmed dates for upgrade work to take place as noted above the migration agreement in the netherlands and future migration project plan in the netherlands contains provision for at least nine months notice of migration activities and requirement on the incumbent kpn to provide generic plan an operational plan per customer and then per location ulls migration plan similar to the new zealand example this re quirement to have specific information for particular regions provides an example of an approach to notice of migration as such migration agreement may help to ensure commitments to minimal disruption for its wholesale customers i5 immediate rollout and geographic approach as the rollout of the nbn in australia may take place almost immediately after contract is awarded to the successful proponent it is necessary to consider how such an immediate start might be best facilita ted the approach would need to recognise that there may not be sufficient time for an industryled migration approach to be agreed before the start of the rollout related issue is the approach that is taken to prioritising particular geographic regions and in particular prioritising areas that cannot currently access minimum speeds of 12 mbps as required by the rfp466 consideration must therefore also be given to the approach to deploying nbn to different geographic areas such as whether an outside in approach to rollou twhere the deployment of fibre initially commences in rural and regional areasshould be applied i51 immediate rollout with the release of the rfp the government st ated that it is appr oaching the rollout of the nbn as policy priority given this it is likely that the rollout of the nbn will begin as soon as possible following the conc lusion of the competitive bid process 465 commerce commission standard terms determination for the designated service telecoms unbundled copper local loop network decision 609 7 november 2008 466 rfp part 1 overview clause 155 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 244this may affect the operation of the proj ect schedule and the manner in which the notice periods operate for the in itial part of the nbn rollout if the nbn operator begins deploying fibre immediatel after being awarded the contract there is the potential for the comp etitive process to be harmed for example if work began on particular the da after the nbn contract was signed access seekers would need to negotiate arrangeme nts for infrastructure works and access to new services while their existing services were already being lost this would negatively affect their ability to continue to provide services to their endusers if they were unable to perform all necessary tasks the immediate rollout may therefore lead to increased costs and decreased revenues and overall financial damage for access seekers as result the competitive offerings of access seekers would be compromised as such facilitating an immedi ate rollout requires balancing of the need to have the network upgrade begin as soon as possible wi th the need to ensure sufficient notice and information is provided to access seekers however if access seekers can readily obtai n access to equivalent new services and particularly if they can obtain access for quivalent or better terms and conditions than they get currently the immediate rollout of the nbn may not present competition concerns this outcome would require th at access arrangements are negotiated rapidly and that minimal infrastructure deployment by access seekers was needed to begin service provision overall an important issue for considerati on is the need to reconcile the need to provide existing access seeker s with reasonable notice pe riods without delaying the commencement of an nbn construction to address the issue of access seekers being affectedand services potentially being di srupted during the ini tial period after the contract is awardeda possi ble option might be that th successful proponent be obliged to initially migrate only those in which there is significant presence of competitor infrastructure as noted the need for this would depend on the difficulty for access seekers of acquiring equivalent wholesale services and successfully providing services to endusers once the nbn is in place i52 geographic approach the rfp asks that proponents should state to what extent they are able to prioritise areas that cannot currently access minimum speeds of 12 mbps467 the geographic aspect of the rollout of next generation networks seems to be less prominent consideration in other countries than in it is in australia this may be because australia is unusual in terms of its land mass and population distribution and because of the requirement for 98 per cent c overage for nbn in contrast the much smaller landmass of other countries wher network upgrades are being undertaken such as the netherlands and new zealand si gnificantly lessens the impact of different geographic approaches to rollout 467 rfp part 1 overview clause 155 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 245central to access seeker concerns about the geographic approach to the nbn rollout is the issue of asset strand ingthat is concern th at their exchangebased investments dslams or msans will be made redundant as fibre rollout bypasses existing exchange build ings on this issue as with concern regarding migration service disruption for retail and wholesale customers the migration notice period is important regulatory submissions to the expert panel highlighted that ther remains divergent views among industry on whether there can be continued supply of current ullslss alongside an nbn and hence as to whether asset stranding is necessarily an issue iinet and internode part of the terria group for instance argued that existing facilitiesbased competition should be kept operational in parallel with the nbn for minimum of 5 years although internodes managing director simon hackett considers that full copper cutove r is required to ro ll out viable nbn468 optus and telstra argued in their regul atory submissions that 100 per cent node cutover needs to be part of the fibre build469 terrias regulatory submission to the nb n panel submitted that target rollout schedules and transitions that avoid stranding competitive assets could be marke d up as more favourable to bids that imme diately target more competitive existing esas470 iinet471 internode472 aapt and powertel473 submitted that there should be outside in deployment these parties argued that an outsidein network deployment would best serve disadvantaged consumers and reduce the effect of stranded assets by allowing owners of existing infrastructure to retire their investments efficiently and reduce the need for compensation the south australian government suggested that stranded assets should be phased out over period of time so that competitors can recoup some of their investment or alternatively mechanism should be create d to compensate providers for stranded assets the nsw department of commerce favoured roll out focusing initially on areas of high demand to generate both

246geographic approach issues and scenarios the current payback period on new dsla msmsans is understood to be between 18 and 24 months474 some access seekers have expresse d concerns that an immediate nbn roll out in the currently most competitive areas will result in their excha nge based investments being written off this would be due to an insufficient time to recoup investment costs ie dslamsmsans will become stranded by the fibre rollout before the cost recovery period telecommunications firms investing in dynamic industry would usually be expected to factor into thei r business plans the risk of technological obsolescence in the context of transition and migration arrangements to the nbn the central issue is that the geographic approach to the rollout promotes competition and does not serve to disrupt the competitive process in esse nce geographic approach that promotes competition would ensure that endusers can migrate smoothly between service providers or products the australian competition tribunal said in its assessment of telstras ulls undertaking that we accept that access seekers do not have an limited right of access to telstras ulls or the right to prevent network modernisation 475 however the tribunal also stated that access seekers ought not to be placed in position where their substantial investments in infrastructure might be isolated and made redundant as result of the network owners timing and location of network upgrades476 given that unbundled services ulls and lss provide for greater level of competitive pressure than pure resale compe tition there would be an incentive for vertically integrated nbn operator to ploy fibre to those which have access seeker dslams and msans in order to eliminate ulls and lss competition some parties have been open about their desire to progress the fibre upgrade as soon as contract is awarded in early 2009477 relative to the expansive land mass of australia most commercially attracti ve are situated within small densely inhabited geographic areasie within metropolitan population centres accordingly some proponents may seek to deploy in these areas first to better r ecover the costs of investment which may also have the effect of removing ulls and lss competiti on even if that is not the purpose 474 on p 73 of its final decision on telstras wholesale line rental local carriage

network probity clearance 247alternatively terria suggestedin submissions to the senate select committee public hearing on the nbnthat areas that are currently under serviced relative to other parts of australia should be the firs t focus of the nbn and that the network should be rolledin from underserviced ar eas rather than ro lledout from already better serviced areas478 the senate select committee reached similar view in its interim report479 given that the rfp asks proponents to indicat the extent to which they are able to prioritise areas that cannot currently access minimum speeds of 12 mbps it is relevant whether proponents can outline an approach to phasing out ulls lss provisioning that best limits the loss of value of competitive assets there are also considerable number of c onsumers in metropolitan areas who cannot currently access broadband at minimum speeds of 12 mbps despite having choice of providers due mainly to their distance from the exchange consequently requiring rollout to begin in areas without broadba nd speeds of 12 mbps may not require that deployment begins in rural areas first in any case and related to points noted above if access seekers can readily obtain access to equivalent new services and part icularly if they can obtain access for equivalent or better terms and conditions than they get currently access seekers may be less concerned bout asset stranding the discussion below outlines three possible geographic approaches to the rollout as well as the possible incentives for the ccessful proponent under each approach and the resulting implications 1 start in rural and regional areas before finishing in metropolitan regions the outsidein approach if the rollout commences in regional ar eas service providers who have deployed access technologies in metropolitan areas will be better placed to fully recoup their investments this is because the longer time periods until assets in metropolitan would be made redundant would better allo w for the costs of these assets to be recovered this would likely avoid the poten tial lowering of competition via increased costs to access seekers should they not be ab to fully recover their investments the disadvantages of this approach largely lie in the fact that the benefits of the nbn will be slow to be delivered to the majority of endusers as such for the initial years of the nb n rollout the successful proponent might not be able to recover enough of its costs imp acting the financial viability of the project this is because there will be relatively little demand for services and the revenue generated might be too low to cover expenditures the principal competition concern 478 terria media release terria presents evidence to senate select committee hearing on national broadband network 8 october 2008 available online httpwwwterriacomauwww4881001127displayarticle08oct20 08terriapresentsevidence tosenatesel1001627html 479 senate select committee on the national broa dband networkinterim report december 2008 p 72 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 248in this scenario largely stems from the c oncern that costs will be raised industry widefor instance that the nbn operator will pass on these increased costs to its wholesale customers which in turn will be passed on to endusers in higher prices further issue is that the successful pr oponent would upgrade in regional areas where the incumbent is the only service prov ider this may entrench the proponent in rural and regional areas as the main w holesale provider of telecommunications services furthermore if the successful pr oponent is vertically integrated it may be able to use this to entrench its position in the retail market as well 2 begin in metropolitan areas and then go out to rural and regional areas the insideout approach this approach has the advantage of deliver ing nbn services to the majority of end users in australia as soon as possible fu rther via increased traffic on the network the successful proponent should be able to recover larger amount of its costs during the initial stages of the build however the insideout approach may strand the dslammsan assets of service providers if they do not have sufficient to appropriately consider investment decisions in this scenari dslam operators would not have had enough time to fully recover investments made and would f ace increased costs the increased cost to access seekers is likely to have competitive detriment on the market as they may find it harder to compete with the nbn operato r where it is vertically integrated however as noted above this may not be concern if access s eekers are able to readily obtain access to equivalent new serv ices on appropriate terms and conditions another possible issue might arise if the nb n builder sought to stop part way through the rollout after depl oying to urban areas 3 commencing in where there is currently access seeker infrastructure given that there are number of without competitor infrastructure in both regional and metropolitan australia the dvantage of this approach is that the successful proponent will still largely be able to decide on the geographic approach to the rollout this could apply for some pe riod of time before switching to more conventional insideout or outsidein ap proach the approach may mitigate some of the potential concerns about asset st randingwhich as mentioned above may have competitive detriment on the market as access seekers would find it harder to compete with the nbn operator the disadvantages of this approach are larg ely found in the loss of scale efficiencies through having the initial peri od build focused on sparsely located or less attractive building in dispersed areas may also reduce the benefits of systematic rollout overall this third option could be consid ered hybrid approach the successful proponent would be obliged during the initial part of the rollout say 6 months to begin rollout in with competitive infrastructure this would ensure that every access seeker receives minimum notice period given that these exchanges have not been focal point for strong infr astructurebased competition this approach confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 249is also likely to be consistent with the rfp s expressed desire to prioritise areas that cannot currently access mini mum speeds of 12 mbps after the initial period the successful pr oponent might want to begin deploying in with competitive infrastructure unde r this scenario the successful proponent might be asked to simultaneously publis h detailed migration notice about the pending work when it publishes the first project schedule which would likely be soon after an nbn contract is signed this third option might not be necessary where there was significant lag time between signing the nbn contract and the commencement of widespread rollout however in such circumstance it could provide an appropriate approach to pl anning test rollouts of infrastructure i6 points of interconnection in addition to issues about the timing and ro llout of transition nd migration there are also relevant considerations about the eff ect of transition to the nbn on the points of interconnection between networks point of interconnection poi refers to an agreed location which is physical point of demarcation between the networks of two or more service providers480 calls or data between the two service provide rs are handed over at the poi confirmation on the location and number of po is well before migration is likely to be relevant consideration presently some access seekers have existing investments in backhaul transmission at existing excha nge buildings where backhaul facilities operated by access seekers are alr eady in place they may prefer to interconnect close to existing pstn exchange points for the nbn poi issues are relevant consideration as interconnection as close as possible to existing investments is likely to facilitate smooth migrat ion if pois need to be moved and information on the move or technical configurat ion is withheld or insufficiently detailed then access seekers costs might be raised to the point where they were not able to provide services this would not promote competition the number of pois may not necessarily change markedly the issue regarding existing backhaul infrastructure is more prominent where the nbn operator is not the existing incumbent the nbn operator may seek access to exchange buildings on the transmission ring along with th ducts leading into the exch ange which are likely to be the current location for access seekers backhaul interconnection equipment to install pois however the present incu mbent may choose to deny access to these exchange buildings making it difficult for access seekers to interconnect with the nbn and as result compete regardless of the identity of the successful proponent details of the number and location of pois in the nbn will most lik ely provide access seekers with greater certainty about the implications for existing backhaul infrastructure 480 see for example accc declaration inquiry for the ulls pstn ota and cllsfinal determination july 2006 p 67 which contains definition of poi for the purposes of th declared pstn originating and terminating access services confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 250i7 mechanisms for ensuring compliance once transition and migration regime is established it is relevant to consider the possible ways that it could be ensured that the regime is adhered to by the successful proponent an approach to establishing viable alternative to an oversight body might be found in the rfps requirement for an information strategy481 the information strategy could provide the mechanism for providing disclosure of rollout milestones critical paths and key deci sion points and how this info rmation is to be published without this clarity there would be the pot ential for anticompetitive harm such as excessive delays to the rollout the government could link its financ ial contribution to compliance with commitments made under both the informati on strategy and the project schedule in addition key performance indi cators kpis could be used which would be designed to provide for high level of upfront tail and guard against the potential for deliberate or inadvertent anticompetitive discrimination by the successful proponent against access seekers the kpis could c over commitments to equivalent andor minimum standards on the provision of appr opriate information to all access seekers and downstream users about the rollout sc hedule these kpis could link funding to the successful proponent meeting range of both short and longterm goals thus providing positive financial incentives rather than financial penalties should the successful proponent not meet its obligations under the kpis through for instance failing to provid required minimum notice peri ods the government could withhold funding until the behaviour was rectified however well defined transition and gration regime which provides for detailed project schedule transparent migration processpossibly via use of notice of migrationalong with practical approach to ensuring compliance would significantly lessen concerns bout the potential for the roll out of the nbn to disrupt the competitive functioning of telecommunications markets sufficiently certain transition timetable would allow access seekers to smoothly transition to an alternative service havi ng systematic process should clarify the time in which investment costs can be r ecovered reduce the uncertainty of the upgrade and provide access seekers with the relevant information to make decision on investing in infrastructure such tran sition schedule would need to be supported with appropriate notice of specific migration activity proponent advancing transition nd migration framework with these characteristics would most likely create leve l of confidence for stakeholders that fair and reasonable outcomes will be achieved avoid asset stranding and address other concerns discussed above for instance the geographical approach to the rollout is less crucial if the successful proponent provides sufficien tly detailed project schedul and notice of migration 481 rfp schedule 2 clause 147 confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 251further forecasts and notices would provide access seekers with certainty in relation to their capital investment planning both in relation to curren t unbundled services and in relation to future capital works in prep aration for the nbn interconnection system interfaces etc i8 conclusion the transition to the nbn could have significant competitive implications transit ion and migration should be conducted in way that promotes competition if not rollout of the network could instead lead to signi ficant competitive detriment as the rollout could be conducted in such way that damages the competitive constraint provided by access seekers the key transition and migration consid erations relate to the following project schedule migration and notice the immediate start to the rollout and the geographic approach taken points of interconnection compliance and oversight access seekers and enduser customers need to be able to smoothly migrate service provision from copper to fibre ie to the new services delivered over the nbn any approach to transition and migration should ensure that both w holesale and retail end users receive sufficient time and informati on to best ensure c ontinuity of service between the copper network and the nbn issues relating to rollout forecasts ngth of notice periods and content of any migration notice provided and commitments to equivalence and nondiscrimination are significant for ensuring that the rollout occurs appropriately and not in an anti competitive way an appropriately specified and systematic tr ansition and migration regime can lead to significant competitive benefits including greater certainty for access seekers in making decisions on investing in infrastructure clarity around the time in which investme nt costs can be recovered which would lead to less immediate asset stranding greater certainty for all parties in ne gotiating access arrangements for the nbn and continuity of service in this regard equivalence and nondiscri mination of both information and service availability are important principles for th rollout central principle might be an obligation on the successful proponent to give an equivalent period of notice and equivalent notice content to access seekers to that which it gives itself any confidential only for individuals with national broadband network probity clearance 252equivalence commitments would be in addition to sufficient minimum notice period equivalence in information and notice woul d better achieve rollout which did not lead to possible stranding and financial damage to access seekers that would reduce their ability to compete together well devised project schedule and notice of migration supported by transparent information strategy would allow access seekers to undertake planning of their own customer migration such as equipment purchases workforce planning and customer marketing and interaction concerns about competitive harm stemming from the geographic approach to the rollout may be lessened if these transiti on and migration documents are detailed non discriminatory and transparent the proposed initial rollout period is an important pe riod to consider the successful proponent will most likely begin deploying fibre as soon as possible after being awarded the nbn contract leaving access ekers with potentially little official notice to avoid this poten tial problem the successful proponent might be askedin the first part of the rollout period to begin in areas with competitive infrastructure dslamsmsans th is approach has two benefits it allows access seekers with competitive infrastructure time to transi tion from unbundled provision over the c opper network to the nbn it allows access seekers greater time to r ecoup the costs incurred from investment in this infrastructure finally it will be necessary to consider the approach that is taken to the points of interconnection under the new network the cation of pois will be important to assess seeker parties ability to continue to provide services over the nbn
