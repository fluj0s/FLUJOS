reconstitution system asrrs in 1985 the chief of staff of the army established the army survival recovery and reconstitution system asrrs to ensure the continuity of essential army missions and functions asrrs doctrine was focused primarily on response to the worst case 1980s threat of massive nuclear laydown on conus as result of confrontation with the soviet union b the end of the cold war and the breakup of the former soviet union significantly reduced the probability of major nuclear attack on conus but the probability of other threats has increased army organizations must be prepared for any contingency with potential for interruption of normal operations to emphasize that army continuity of operations planning is now focused on the full allhazar ds threat spectrum the name asrrs has been replaced by the more generic title continuity of operations coop program 32 the allhazards threat army coop plans must ensure that the army remains capable of continuing missionessential operations during any situation including military attack terrorist activities and natural or manmade disasters b examples of threats having the capability to incapacitate normal operations include 1 nuclear attack massive or limited portions of the former soviet union retain formidable nuclear capability with weapons that may be targeted against the united states several other potentially hostile nations are expected to be able to produce and deliver nuclear weapons11442 terrorist activities involving chemical biological nuclear or conventional weapons and materials 3 natural disasters natural events such as hurricanes floods earthquakes etc can devastate army facilities and command and control infrastructures 4 technical or manmade disasters and accidents events such as fires nuclear power plant accidents collapse of large structures and aircraft crashes can cause army facilities to become unusable 33 operational objectives ensure that army elements to include macoms foas and subordinate organizations retain the capability to perform essential unilateral and joint missions and functions across the full spectrum of conflict civil emergencies and natural or manmade disasters b ensure that leadership principals and supporting staff retain the capability to 1 support the essential missions of higher headquarters 2 coordinate with missionessential external organizations and agencies 3 if required conduct residual capability assessments 4 if required reestablish essential external connectivity 5 if required recover operational capability 6 if required reconstitute resources and restructure forces11557 allocate resources in support of essential missions and functions 8 develop timely recommendations in support of senior level decisionmaking and prepare and present command briefings and reports as required 9 provide guidance and support to army forces committed to and supporting the situation 10 support the coordination or provision of department of defense dodmilitary support to lead federal agency andor other civil authorities during domestic disaster or emergency 34 the coop environment regional threats such as limited military attack technological disaster civil disturbance or terrorist activity may render all or portion of headquarters unusable b with adequate warning time the survivability and effectiveness of key leaders andor their successors can be improved by moving them to an emergency relocation sitesor other alternate locations along with designated staff representatives to continue the execution of essential missions and functions c the effects of the situation may tend to be felt most significantly in local areas rather than nationwide d much of the conus infrastructure telecommunications and automation will remain intact though portions of peacetime automation and communications systems may be severely disrupted and unavailable for an unknown length of time116635 decentralized command and control coop plans shall provide for redundant decentralized command and control structure capable of continuing essential operations and if required recovering or restoring an operational capability throughout the conus 36 restoration of command and control following an event which disrupts conus communications priority must be given to restor ing communications between hqda its macoms and field operating activities foa and other dod and federal organizations and agencies the emphasis should be on restoring the lines of authority and communications that existed previously if this is not possible an attempt should be made to establish ad hoc lines of authority and communications on decentralized regional basis centered on the federal emergency management agency fema regional headquarters or disaster field office dfo b army elements should attempt to reestablish communications with in order of priority 1 higher headquarters 2 alternate location of higher headquarters 3 macom headquarters 4 alternate location of macom headquarters 5 joint state area command 6 fema region headquarters117737 leadership succession hqda macoms and foas will designate successors for command authorities and other key person nel designated successors the order of succession specific responsibilities and authorit and conditions under which succession will occur will be described in the coop plans 38 emergency relocation group erg coop plans should consider the designation of an emergency relocation group erg that will move to an alternate location when the primary headquarters is threatened or longer viable erg members should be selected to provide the best mix of senior leaders and supporting staff to execute essential functions regardless of the type of emergency or crisis that causes execution of the coop plans b as required erg members must be capable of 1 surviving or rebuilding capability to command and control essential functions 2 reorganizing and reallocating army resources 3 providing essential planning and support to the plans of higher headquarters 4 coordinating with appropriate representatives of osd the joint staff other services and federal and civil sectors of

subordinate organizations 311 prepositioned information and duplicate emergency files deployed erg may be required to operate in an austere environment in which the majority of automation and communications systems external to the ers are unreliable or not available under these conditions erg members must rely on information prepositioned at the ers to obtain the last known status of resources organizations facilities plans programmed and other critical record s documents needed in an emergency situation b some external databases may not be immediately accessible from the ers or alternate command center acc in an emergency coop planning must identify responsibilities and procedures for capturing critical information from selected databases during normal operations and periodically prepositioning the information at the other locations to provide historical record which the erg can us to begin to assess residual capabilities and execute essential missions and functions 312 operational security opsec2200a the success of coop planning relies on denying access by unauthorized parties to information on coop plans procedures capabilities and facilities b
