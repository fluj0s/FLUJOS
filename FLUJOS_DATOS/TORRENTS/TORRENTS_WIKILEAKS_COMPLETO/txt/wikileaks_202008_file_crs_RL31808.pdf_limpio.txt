whole from year to year over the last 12 years the share has ranged from 0 to 47 see table 1 in crs report rs20177 airport and airway continuedc these amounts are in addition to the 50 million nnual

fmcsa appropriation was 81 million less th an requested congress provided an additional 1115 million for grants to states for motor carrier safety activities under fhwa miscellaneous appropriations f nhtsas fy2004 request includes 100 million transferred from fhwa this funding was previously provided through the fhwa but administered by nhtsa therefore the difference between budgetary resources available to nhtsa for fy2003 and its fy2004 request is 131 million not 231 million g in addition to amtraks fy2003 appr opriation congress postponed amtraks repa yment of 100 million loan from the dot the fy2004 conference agreement would again postpone that repayment h the figures do not reflect 14 million in permanent appropriations therefore the total resources for rspa for fy2003 may be seen as 119 million and the total funding for fy2004 as 132 million i rescissions of unobligated previous years contract authority have been subtracted from this total b ecause rescissions of prior years contract authority have impact on the budgetary resources available for the current fiscal year the total resources available could be seen as 559 billion for fy2003 enacted federal aviation

to be computed later by the office of management and budget this is 440 million increase in funding over the fy2003 enacted level of 135 billion this amount reflects 065 re scission to which some parts of the faa budget were subjected the amount also differs slightly from the amount proposed in the house bill hr 2989 just over 14 billion and in the senate bill s 1589 that provided 1397 billion the majority of the increased funding in pl 108 199 and each of the other b ills would be used for operations maintenance om expenses with the exception of some program adjustments there are

as one of the federal governments prin cipal economic policymakers and its financial manager revenue collector and producer of currency coinage and stamps its role in law enforcement is now much more limited at its most basic level of organization the department consis ts of departmental offices and operating bureaus the depar tmental offices are responsible for the formulation and implementati on of policy and the manageme nt of the department as whole while the operating bureaus carry out specific duties assigned to the department the bureaus typically account for more than 95 of the departments employment and funding with one notable exception the bureaus can be divided into those having financial responsibilities and those engaged in law enfo rcement in recent decades financial

enacted for fy2003 11018 billion after adjusting for the transfer of functions to dhs and the justice departme nt according to budget documents the administrations top priorities for treas ury operations in fy2004 were to bolster irss efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with tax laws improve the departments overall efficiency by further streamlining operations and elevate the departments role in federal efforts to co mbat money laundering and disrupt financial networks supporting internati onal terrorist activities under the newly configured treasury accounts the irs

39 on september 9 2003 two of the amendments were related to tr easury appropriations for fy2004 one introduced by representative jim cooper would have reduced proposed funding from 100 million to 25 million for controversial irs pilot program to require some taxpayers claiming the earned income tax credit to certify the residency status of the qualifying child they plan to claim beginning with the 2004 tax year and divert the 75 million in sa vings to programs aimed at improving compliance among large and mediumsized business taxpayers it failed by vote of 219 to 192 the other amendment was introduced by representative bernie sanders and would have barred the treas ury department from usin g funds appropriated under hr 2989 to assist in overturning th judicial ruling in case known as

the house for fy2004 according to the committees repor t on the legislation srept 108146 most of the difference between s 1589 nd the administrations budget request and the housepassed version of hr

income tax credit compliance eitc program resulting in drop in recommended funding for the initiative in fy2004 of 55 million in addition s 1589 would have spent nearly 8 million more than the administration has requested for treasurys departmental offices substantial share of this recommended increase would have gone to the office of international ffairs 27 million and the office of terrorist finance and fi nancial crimes 23 million s 1589 also denied the administrations proposed merger of the oig and the tigta into new office known as the inspector general for treasury but for different reason than the one expressed in the report on hr 2989 the senate appropriations committee opposed the merger mainly because the duties and responsibilities of oi g and tigta remain vastly different in substance and are not conducive to being integrat ed instead it recommended an increase in funding for oig of 16 million and for tigta of 38 million in fy2004 but like hr 2989 the bill

the annual adjustment goes into effect automatically pay adjustment of 22 is scheduled for the fficials of the three branches effective january 2004 however because the gene ral schedule basic pay

each federal agency to the labor department which administers the program and disburses the benefits the costs of ad ministration are covered by appropriation directly to the labor department the administration again proposed various changes in feca that it broached in the 107th congress the aspect that would affect agency budgets governmentwide is to charge administrative costs in the same manner as benefit costs ie through the appropriation of each employing agency the stated intention is to make each agency explicitly bear the full cost of their employees claims thus bolstering their incentive to improve workplace safety the administrative surcharge would be around 35 of benefit costs calcula ted from the administration budget for fy2004 which contemplates 88 million in administrative costs to service 2532 million in program benefits most of the surcharge would be paid by the two agencies that account for more than 60 of feca claims the us postal service and the

second section 647a also apparently would require consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions under circular a76 the differential is not used in streamlined co mpetitions the conve rsion differential is the lesser of 10 million or 10 of the pe rsonnel costs of the governments meo110 however since the circular may not have less stringent requirements than law section 647a which has requirement that is more stringent than the circulars concerning the application of the convers ion differential to st reamlined competitions apparently would take precedence s ection 647a would direct the competitive sourcing official cso to consider how the conversion differen tial would affect the contractors cost111 under section 647a2 this official would consider whether the cost of performance of the activity or function by contract would be less costly to the executive agency by 10 million or 10 of the governments personnel costs whichever is less left unstated is the criterion or standard against which the cso should compare the cost of c ontractor performance to deter mine if it is less costly to the agency additionally it remains to be seen whether or how performance decision which i nvolve s completing the streamlined competition form could take into account the conversion differential112 could csos consideration override performance decision it seems that both the circular and section 647a would apply to standard competitions however unlike the circumstances surrounding streamlined competitions the more stringent requireme nt for standard competitions is found in the circular therefore ag encies would continue to dd the conversion differential to the cost of the nonincumbents perfo rmance on the standard competition form which is

administration policy on hr 2989 stated that if the final version of the bill contained provisions weakening current sanctions against cuba the presidents senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill since the early 1960s us policy toward cuba has consisted largely of efforts to isolate the communist government of fidel castro through comprehensive economic sanctions including trade emba
