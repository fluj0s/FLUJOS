defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828trade agreement monitoring and enforcement issues for congress summary trade agreement monitoring and enforcement refers to us efforts to gauge the effect of agreements dealing with international trade and to ensure that each signatory nation complies with the provisions of such agreements if other signatory nations fail to fulfill the provisions of their agreements american businesses may be placed at competitive disadvantage in addition the perception that other countries fail to live up to their commit ments in trade agreements undermines support for trade liberalization efforts congress also has interest in trade agreement monitoring and enforcement because of complaints from us companies when provisions of agreements are not implemented and due to the rising us trade deficit nearly 300 international trade agreements are currently in force to which the united states is party these include 26 wto agreements the north american free trade agreement 26 other agreements with more than one signatory nation and 238 bilateral agreements with countries such as japan china canada and israel us monitoring and enforcement occurs on several levels first is the gathering of data and investigation into foreign trade barriers or unfair trade practices that might violate trade agreements with the united states or us trade law second is attempts to resolve such alleged violations through consultations and negotiations third is to take unresolved violations through formal dispute resolution processes such as those under the world trade organization and the north american free trade agreement in response to concerns over the effectiveness of us government monitoring and enforcement activities congress has provided additional funding for federal agencies including the us department of commerce the office of the us trade representative ustr and the us departments of agriculture and state both the department of commerce and ustr created trade monitoring and compliance units in 1996 proposals also have been made to create congressional trade office whose responsibilities would include monitoring trade agreements in the congress the issue of compliance and monitoring of trade agreements was raised during the debate over granting permanent normaltradingrelations pntr status to china and its entry into the world trade organization the 106th congress created uschina security review commission to review the national security implications of trade and economic ties with china it also required an annual assessment of chinas compliance with its wto trade obligations the policy issues for congress surrounding the monitoring and enforcement of international trade agreements focus on three basic problems the first is whether sufficient resources and the governmental organization exist to accomplish the task the second and related issue is whether new data and information should be generated

congress trade agreement monitoring and enforcement refers to us efforts to gauge the effect of agreements dealing with international trade and to ensure that each signatory nation complies with the provisions of such agreements this has become concern because in trade agreements the united states generally accords foreign businesses greater access to us markets in exchange for trade liberalization in foreign markets if other signatory nations fail to fulfill the provisions of their agreements american businesses may be placed at competitive disadvantage relative to businesses in the foreign countries in addition the perception that other countries fail to live up to their commitments in trade agree ments undermines support for trade liberalization efforts congress also has interest in trade agreement monitoring and enforcement because of complaints from us companies and due to the rising us trade deficit the us governments monitoring and enforcement activities for international trade are primarily centered in the office of the us trade representative and us departments of commerce and state and for agricultural products the department of agriculture the departments of the treasury labor justice interior energy defense transportation health and human services as well as agencies such as the international trade commission and environmental protection agency and others also play role the monitoring and enforcement process occurs on several levels with respect to monitoring the federal government attempts to identify instances in which foreign laws regulations and practices may be inconsistent with trade agreements these government activities include gathering data and conducting investigations into foreign trade barriers or unfair trade practices that might violate agreements with the united states or us trade law once apparent violations are identified the federal government attempts to resolve them through consultations negotiations or the application of us trade remedy laws if the violation is covered by international trade agreements with dispute resolution mechanisms the us trade representative must take such unresolved violations through formal international dispute resolution processes such as those under the world trade organization wto and the north americ an free trade agreement nafta the wtos strengthened dispute resolution mechanism unlike the process under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt that it replaced in 1996 is designed to provide finality this mechani sm provides means for violations of wto agreements to be resolved through consultation and quasilitigation process in response to concerns over the effectiveness of us government monitoring and enforcement activities the 106th and previous congresses appropriated additional funding for those purposes to the us department of commerce the office of the us trade representative and the us departments of

trade office s 274 107th congress baucus in the congress the issue of compliance and monitoring of trade agreements was raised during the debate in 2000 over granting permanent normaltrading relations pntr status to china and its entry into the world trade organization many members raised concerns that chinas record for complying with past trade agreements was mixed at best the law granting pntr status to china pl 106286 contains provisions requiring an annual assessment of chinas compliance to its wto trade obligations in the spring of 2000 the clinton administration also announced an initiative aimed at ensuring chinas wto compliance and requested additional funding1 the fy2001 appropriations bill for the departments of commerce justice and state pl 106553 included nearly 16 increase for the office of the ustr so it could hire 25 new employees primarily to monitor and enforce trade agreements2 these budgetary and enforcement issues may arise again in the 107th congress the 106th congress also established uschina security review commission to review the national security implications of trade and economic ties between the united states and china pl 106398 and appropriated 3 million for it for fy2001 background globalization faster and cheaper communications reduced shipping costs and the development of world markets have combined to give international trade and investment larger role in us economic life currently americans export about 1 trillion worth of goods and services or about 10 of us gross domestic product while they import about 14 trillion of goods and services creating trade imbalance of roughly 400 billion world exports of goods and services have reached 7 trillion foreign direct investment in us businesses and real estate has been running at about 300 billion each year the international rules that govern most international trade and investment are estab lished in agreements of the world trade organization wto if such agreements are signed by all members they are considered to be multilateral if they are signed number of but not all the members they are referred to as plurilateral with several countries the large number of wto members currently 140 and the fact that wto rules represent negotiated consensus among those members means that wto agreements contain only those provisions with worldwide support when consensu s on new trade liberalization cannot be reached nations often turn to bilateral or regional trade agreements that augment or exceed wto requirements or are with countries which are not members of the wtohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs3 the us department of commerc maintains database of nearly 300 international trade agreements currently in force for which the united states is party these include 26 wto agreements the north american free trade agreement nafta 26 other agreements with more than one signatory nation eg with the european union or such as the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and 238 bilateral agreements with individual countries such as japan china canada and israel many of the bilateral agreements focus on single manufactured product or area eg textiles barley intellectual property rights or deregulation and include enforcement mechanisms because they are technically written accords of negotiations some may not involve trade liberalizing measures or obligations most us trade agreements contain variety of provisions that are aimed at removing barriers to american companies attempting to gain access to foreign markets compliance with the provisions of such agreements by the foreign signatory nations depends primarily on actions by the governments of the nations signing the treaties particularly in reducing import tariffs or abolishing nontariff barriers that have been imposed by the government compliance becomes more complex however if the relevant barriers rest in industry structures or private actions that hinder access by foreign companies gaining access to some markets for example has been described as peeling an onion when one barrier is stripped away another appears at another level some have asserted that trade agreements should be judged by their results if official trade liberalization results in increase in imports into the foreign country or rise in foreign market share then it may be questioned whether or not the trade liberalization actually occurred of course changes in trade flows depend also on efforts by exporters demand by buyers and macroeconomic conditions opening door does not mean someone automatically enters likewise opening market does not mean us exporters automatically gain sales or market share still in bilateral agreements that are aimed at lowering import barriers that have been keeping us products from particular market in the mediumterm trade liberalization would be expected to have some impact on import flows until recently the monitoring and enforcement of trade agreements by the federal government was somewhat ad hoc process that depended first on us exporters or other interested parties to make and document complaints these complaints if corroborated by the government were then taken to the applicable foreign government or trade body and attempts were made at resolution resolution often depended on us leverage and the cooperation of the foreign government if the problem involved an alleged violation of multilateral agreement under the wto or its predecessor the general agreement on tariffs and trade or it violated an agreement that contained dispute settlement mechanism the us government could lodge an official complaint through the appropriate mechanism the ustr also could selfinitiate complaint under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 as amended or similar provision the weakness of this process became apparent during the 1990s when various studies attempted to determine the results of trade agreements particularly those withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs4 3 for example see american chamber of commerce in japan making trade talks work lessons from recent history tokyo accj 1997 this was updated in 2000 and published as making trade talks work an ontheground analysis of usjapan trade agreemen ts by american business tokyo accj 2000 the 2000 study found that of 63 trade agreements between the united states and japan 53 were considered fully or mostly successful while 47 fell short of this standard 4 for an extensive review of organizational aspects of the probl em see us general accounting office international trade strategy needed to better monitor and enforce trade agreements gaonsiad076 march 2000japan3 the problems the studies uncovered were first that the government had central repository for trade agreements many of the agreements were not published and there was federal agency that kept copies of all trade agreements and monitored compliance this occurred because most of the agreements did not require senate approval and many were simply announcements written accords that stated the results of negotiations or memoranda of understanding second it often was essential to keep the pressure on the foreign government to fully implement the agreements made third there was onestop shop type of organization and there were insufficient agency personnel to handle the increasing number of trade complaints that were being raised fourth regularized process existed for us businesses to determine whether the market access problems they encountered were covered by particular trade agreement4 as result in the mid1990s the us trade representative ustr and the department of commerce doc created trade agreement monitoring and enforcement units within their agencies the department of agriculture already had organizations that performed these functions for agricultural trade the chronology of actions that led to the creation of the monitoring and enforcement units at doc and ustr are summarized in the accompanying box monitoring and compliance the us governments moni toring and compliance process for international trade agreements is aimed at ensuring that benefits of such agreements are accorded to us businesses this section deals only with industrial and service sectors not agriculture the process requires four primary steps the first is to determine whether benefits are being denied us exporters usually in response to complaint by us businesses the second is to determine the appropriate avenue for possible resolution the third is to consult with and negotiate with the foreign government to resolve the issue if satisfactory results are not forthcoming the fourth step is to litigate the issue through an appropriate dispute resolution process at the wto or other institution in some cases the united states may impose trade sanctions if the dispute is not resolved the department of commerce provides the gateway for complaints by us business about foreign trade problems dealing with industrial products and services it seeks to ensure that benefits of trade agreements accrue to us interests through activities in three areas outreach monitoring and compliance the first step in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs5 5 on internet at httpwwwmacdocgovtccdataindexhtmloutreach program is to provide information on existing trade agreements the doc does this primarily through its internet website which includes database of the texts of nearly 300 trade agreements currently in force and which can be searched by both trading partner and subject5 creation of the trade agreement monitoring and enforcement units in the office of the us trade representative and department of commerce 1979 executive order 12175 by president jimmy carter implemented reorganization plan 3 that assigned operational responsibility for monitoring compliance with international trade agreements to the department of commerce 93 stat 1382 1988 section 301 of the omnibus trade act of 1988 19 usc 2411 classified violations of trade agreements as being subject to mandatory action by the ustr to enforce us rights under the agreements or eliminate such violations section 306 19 usc 2416 required the ustr to monitor the implementation of trade agreements and if such implementation was not satisfactory to take action as indicated in section 301 authority was given however under which private parties could trigger us government review of foreign compliance the act also established super 301 special 301 section 1377 and title vii january 1996 ustr mickey kantor announced the establishment of permanent monitoring and enforcement unit at the office of the us trade representative july 1996 the department of commerce created the market access and compliance mac unit that included the trade compliance center tcc march 1999 president clinton issued executive order 13116 that reinstituted super

in both the united states and in more than 80 overseas posts 8 the docs commercial service maintains network of international trade specialists located in almost 100 cities in the us and puerto rico to help american small and mediumsized companies export their products and conduct business abroad 9 the department of commerce maintains 51 district export councils comprising nearly 1600 business and trade experts who volunteer to help us firms develop export strategiessystem and worldwide network that gathers intelligence on the operations of trade agreements because of the large number and complexity of trade agreements the doc basically adheres to the concept that if the foreign countries are taking the required official actions and there are complaints from ame rican business interests the trade agreements should be working if business interests do have complaints they can report them to the doc through the tcc trade complaint hotline on the doc website6 the doc also casts wider net to gather information on possible violations through its us foreign com mercial service officers7 country and industry desks within the doc and sources that have information on export problems such as us export assistance centers8 and district export councils9 private sector sources for information on trade barriers include doc liaisons with more than 65 trade associations and labor groups around the country contacts in the us chamber of commerce and american chambers of commerce overseas the us and foreign business press sources as well as direct calls and letters from

appropriate eg from the national institute of standards and technology data are gathered and technical analysis is made in order to achieve voluntary compliance efforts at persuasion begin small and gradually escalate as they are passed up the administrative ladder in most cases the office of the ustr becomes involved in consultations with the foreign country at times the us president may be asked to bring up compliance issue with the relevant foreign head of state if these efforts fail the ustr may pursue formal negotiations and possible dispute settlement actions enforcement the ustr coordi nates the administrations active monitoring of foreign government compliance with trade agreements and pursues enforcemen t actions using dispute settlement procedures and applying the full range of us trade lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs7 10 in 1998 to ensure that the efforts of the departm ent of commerce and us trade representative would complement rather than compete with or duplicate each other the two agencies signed memorandum of understanding aimed at clarifying the division of their functions it states that the ustr unit focuses its attention on trade agreement implementation and pursuing enforcement actions using dispute settlement procedures and applying the full range of us trade laws that ustr administers the commerce unit focuses on analyzing foreign trade barriers identifying possible trade agreement violations and determining ways to ensure that the united states is getting the full benefits of its trade agreements see the secretary of commerce

role although for some specific sectors the department of commerce department of agriculture treasury or other government agency can take lead or coleading role for example in construction and automobile negotiations with japan the department of commerce took the colead with the ustr if consultations and bilateral negotiations fail the ustr will decide whether to pursue formal enforcement actions these are done in two arenas unilaterally under us trade laws and instruments and through formal dispute resolution procedures under the wto or nafta for possible violations regarding nonimplementation of wto agreements the ustr can raise complaints in committees the wto general council has established to monitor implementation of each wto agreement for example since the wto has an agreement on intellectual property it also has an intellectual property committee these committees often provide the ustr with its first opportunity to raise concerns about implementation without having to begin the process of dispute settlement they are used regularly for informal dispute settlement and to monitor compliance and implementation11 for possible violations of trade agreements or unfair trade practices with significant effect on us business interests the enforcement process usually begins with the pursuit of remedies under various us trade laws and instruments these include five instrume nts which grant the united states authority to suspend or withdraw benefits of trade agreement concessions and impose duties or import restrictions in response to unfair trade practices or violations of trade agreements these five instruments are section 301 of the trade act of 1974 to address unfair foreign government measures actually sections 301309 as amended 19 usc 2411 super

special 301 for intellectual property rights protection and market access section 182 of the trade act of 1974 sec 1377 of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 for telecommunications trade problems and title vii of the 1988 trade act for problems in foreign government procurement reinstituted by executive order 13116 the section 301 provision allows private parties to petition the ustr to investigate or for the ustr to selfinitiate an investigation into injurious foreign trade practices it also authorizes the ustr to take actions to remove the objectionable measures the early stages of the section 301 process include monitoring and compliance efforts discussed in the previous section if violation of an international trade agreement is involved the ustr must initiate consultations with the offending country under the agreements dispute settlement provisions in the case of violation of wto agreement the ustr takes the case to the wtos dispute settlement mechanism if the case is resolved the ustr may terminate the section 301 investigation but must continue to monitor implementation if the case does not involve trade agreement violation the ustr is authorized but not required to act if the ustr pursues settlement but one cannot be reached within specified period 12 to 18 months for most cases the ustr is required to determine whether to retaliate trade retaliation usually takes the form of 100 tariffs on selected imported products from the offending country in an amount approximately equal to the us trade losses resulting from the trade barrier when section 301 is used independently of the wto dispute settlement mechanism some us trading partners have complained that it involves unilateral action uses the threat of sanctions to force countries to negotiate and under certain circumstances contains deadlines that are inconsistent with wto obligations section 301 cases that are not violations of trade agreements often lay the foundation for future trade agreement negotiations under the super 301 priority foreign unfair trade practices and title vii government procurement provisions the ustr is required to take more proactive action to identify the most significant unfair foreign trade practices facing us exports and to focus us resources on eliminating those practices the annual process is laid out as follows on march 31 the ustr submits to congress the national trade estimate report an analysis of trade barriers facing us products and services around the world by april 30 the ustr reports to congress in its super 301 report

investigation period is 18 months for practices involving wto agreement to accommodate completion of wto dispute settlement proceedings 6 months for other discriminatory government procurement practices and 12 months for other priority foreign country practices as with any section 301 investigation if agreement is reached the ustr must determine whether the practice under investigation is actionable under section 301 ie that it violates trade agreement or is unjustifiable unreasonable or discriminatory and burdens or restricts us commerce if the practice is deemed actionable the ustr must also determine what retaliatory action if any should be taken12 related to trade agreement monitoring and compl iance are us government activities aimed at ensuring compliance by foreign firms and governments with us domestic trade laws particularly those that deal with dumping sales in us markets at prices below foreign costs of produc tion and subsidies excessive foreign government assistance to exporting industries these fall under efforts primarily by the us department of commerce and us international trade commi ssion to enforce us antidumping and countervailing duty laws when these laws are violated and result in serious injury to us industries remedies are generally imposed unilaterally by the us government these actions intersect with the monitoring and enforcement of international trade agreements because the wto has an antidumping agreement that discourages injurious dumping and permits remedies as long as they are not protectionist with respect to injurious domestic subsidies the wto agreement on subsidies and count ervailing measures generally makes them actionable under wto dispute settlement procedures13 over time the ustr has come to view its disputeresolution responsibilities in an increasingly larger context as both policyrefining and policysetting mechanism that is it uses dispute resolution as mechanism for learning both how to write agreements in the future to avoid ambiguity and how to establish favorable precedent which if used in relation to one country especially developing country will serve as an example to promote compliance by other developing countries14 each year the ustr publishes national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers nte that includes monitoring information on trade agreements the nte

congress surrounding the monitoring and enforcement of international trade agreements focus on three basic problems the first is whether there are sufficient resources and an appropriate government organizational structure to accomplish the task the second and related issue is whether new information is needed to determine whether trade agreements are being fully implemented third is the effectiveness of various monitoring and enforcement approaches and whether the dispute settlement process at the wto should be changed resources and organization the availability of sufficient resources organization and coordination to monitor and enforce trade agreements turns primarily on budget and staffing the ustr in particular faces staffing constraints it is relatively small organization located in the executive office of the president with fy2001 budget of 295 million as part of the white house it is subject to pressures by those advocating smaller government to decrease staffing levels the 106th congress increased funding for hiring more lawyers and other staff based on the offices growing workload some have suggested that any continuing ustr staffing constraints might be alleviated through more personnel being seconded from other agencies or by using nongovernmental legal staff under contract as is done by the department of justice as for the department of commerce some of its increased resources devoted to monitoring and compliance have come from other divisions within the department in march 2000 study of the monitoring and enforcement of trade agreements the us general accounting office reported that officials at the ustr and doc as well as department of agriculture stated that steady declines in staff resources had limited the agencies monitoring and enforcement activities they also said that gaps in staff expertise had hindered their efforts to analyze and respond to compliance problems18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs11 compliance with trade agreements became particular issue during consideration of chinas accession to the wto in this respect pl 106286 hr 4444 106th congress provides for three primary measures the first is statement that it shall be the objective of the united states to obtain as part of the protocol of accession of the peoples republic of china to the wto an annual review within the wto of the compliance by the peoples republic of china with its terms of accession to the wto 22 usc 6931 the second measure authorizes additional resources for the us department of commerce ustr and us department of agriculture for monitoring and enforcement of us trade agreements and trade laws with respect to the prc 22 usc 6941 the third measure requires an annual report by the ustr beginning one year after chinas entry on compliance by china with commitments made in connection with its accession to the wto includin g both multilateral commitments and any bilateral commitments made to the united states 22 usc 6951 the 106th congress also established uschina security review commission to review the national security implications of trade and economic ties between the united states and china pl 106398 and appropriated 3 million for it for fy2001 another approach to staffing and organization that has been proposed would be to create congressional trade office in the legislative branch to deal with trade issues this trade office would deal with the whole range of trade issues including trade agreement monitoring and compliance in the 107th congress senator baucus introd uced s 276 that would establish congressional trade office the bill is based on findings including 1 that foreign country performance under certain trade agreements has been less than contemplated and in some cases rises to the level of noncompliance 2 that the credibility of and support for the united states governments trade policy is to significant extent function of the belief that trade agreements made are trade agreements enforced and 3 that given the accession of the peoples republic of china to the wto congress must play key role in ensuring full and continuous monitoring of chinas compliance with its commitments the bill would establish congressional trade office that among other duties would monitor compliance with major bilateral regional and multilateral trade agreements by consulting with the affected industries and interested parties analyzing the success of agreements based on commercial results recommending actions including legislative action necessary to ensure that foreign countries that have made commitments through agreements with the united states fully abide by those commitments and annually assessing the extent to which current agreements comply with environmental and labor goals this proposal not only would establish legislative organization somewhat akin to the congressional budget office to deal with trade issues but it would require anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs12 19 us trade deficit review commission the us trade deficit causes consequences and recommendations for action november 14 2000 p 28090analysis of the success of trade agreements based on commercial results this would go beyond the basic premise that trade agreement is working if there are complaints to the contrary it also would require an assessment of the extent to which agreements comply with environmental and labor goals although this may pose problems with the vast majority of agreements that do not contain such provisions data and information accurate data and information are required to assess compliance with trade agreements and to determine the effect of international trade on the us economy with respect to this issue the congressionally mandated us trade deficit review commission concluded in its november 2000 report that the federal statistical system does not provide adequate or timely data on international trade and finance the system is not gathering all the information needed to understand the evolving economy or can the system ensure that all of the data are accurate the commissio n reported that the undercount in us exports could be overstating the us trade deficit by as much as third it also found that imports also are undercounted the commission concluded that without accurate data to properly understand the effect of trade policy oversight of that policy and the formulation of future policy are made more difficult and that problems with international trade statistics may provide distorted view of the health of us industries facing foreign competition the commission called for comprehensive improvements in us statistical gathering system s more accurate data on services trade financial flows intrafirm trade lowvalue exports and software exports its recommendations included higher funding for key statistical agencies the integration of the agencies most actively involved in economic statistics into single independent agency the automation of import and export reporting and an expansion of the quarterly survey of international trade in services19 monitoring and enforcement third policy issue centers on the effectiveness of various monitoring and enforcement approaches the task of monitoring all us trade agreements is gargantuan task even with extensive cooperation from other governments countries may not have the organization or culture to implement international trade agreements fully current methods of uncovering problems may be insufficient or formal dispute settlement procedures may not be operating satisfactorily another problem is that countries in transition such as china may not have complete centralized control over local customs or other officials who implement the laws these officials often are underpaid and are faced with opportunities for corruption they may not feel constrained by laws promulgated by the central government especially if such laws negatively affect economic sectors under their control the ustr and other organizations have been providing technical assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs13 20 see for example esserman

countries to ensure that key international trade agreements are implemented on schedule20 still adherence to the rule of law rather than the rule of people appears weak in certain countries full implementation of trade obligations may require cultural shift that takes time in such cases it is not clear that filing numerous complaints with the wto or politicizing disputes would be as effective as it is when dealing with similar problems with other nations currently the us monitoring and enforcement effort relies heavily on complaints by businesses and other interests actually engaged in exporting to or doing business in the foreign country given the magnitude of the task this is practical method of operation the problem is that companies attempting to gain market share may be reluctant to register complaints they may fear retribution by host government officials who often can exercise considerable discretion in administering trade laws or approving business activities they also may not want to damage perceptions of their product by projecting the image that the company needs foreign government assistan ce to sell its products the staff of the ustr and doc have attempted to circumvent this problem by becoming more proact ive by routinely reviewing trade agreements for compliance their limited resources however requires that priorities be set and monitoring and enforcement efforts be balanced with other trade responsibilities21 in the early 1990s us trade negotiators attempted different method of monitoring trade agreements with japan negotiators tried to include objective criteria to measure results of trade agreements in what clinton administration officials called resultsoriented trade policy but what others generally referred to as manag ed trade this approach stemmed partly from what had been viewed as successful market sharing arrangement in semiconductors in which japan agreed to market share target for foreign semiconductor sales japan however refused to extend the method to other industries for fear of trade retaliation should the objective criteria not be met22 the attempts at quantify ing results of trade agreements however did shift negotiating goals in these cases away from focus on lowering official trade barriers toward taking those actions includin g but going beyond the lowering of trade barriers that would have the greatest apparent impact on actual trade flows they also clarified the necessity for negotiators to make explicit what products were covered in the negotiations and what data should be collected to evaluate the success of the effort traditionally trade negotiations and agreements would be deemed successful if trade barriers actually were lowered managed trade attempted to go beyond thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs14 23 american chamber of commerce in japan making trade talks work 2000 p 34 24 for background and current cases see wto internet site at httpwwwwtoorgenglish

increased sales in the newly opened market by foreign companies with competitive products although it is unlikely that any country will currently agree to market share targets especially if they carry the threat of trade sanctions should they not be met the managed trade debate did elucidate the need for better monitoring of actual trade flows resulting from trade agreements in its 2000 review of usjapan trade agreements the american chamber of commerce in japan again called for trade negotiators to establish clear measurable goals for trade agreements where appropriate and credible and mechanisms for joint governmentindustry monitoring of the implementation of trade agreements23 even when trade agreement includes an enfor cement mechanism the enforcement process can be both tortuous and unpredictable the major international enforcement process used by countries is the wto dispute resolution mechanism24 see figure 1 this mechanism has worked well in certain cases but several problems have become apparent first is that the consultation process often becomes superficial and pro forma as neither side wants to reveal too much about its case the consultation process may just buy time for the defendant country second problem with the wto dispute resolution process is that the panelists may not in the view of the united states be sufficiently experienced in trade policy and issues to make satisfactory judgements currently panelists are proposed by the wto secretariat and may not be opposed except for compelling reasons third problem is that the wto does not have agreements in all areas of potential problems such as in competition policy25 this may allow benefits of trade liberalization to be nullified by private parties for example country may lower its official tariff rates but private local firms can engage in collusive or other anticompetitive behavior that denies foreign firms the benefits of the market opening measures this may be allowed by foreign governments because such collusive behavior may not violate local antitrust laws this was the contention of the united states in the fujifilmkodak wto case with japan26 since the wto agreements currently do not cover antitrust issue s rules for competition policy might be considered in new round of multilateral negotiations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30828crs15 27 for case in point see crs report rs20130 the useuropean union banana dispute by charles hanrahanfigure 1 the world trade organizations dispute settlement mechanism fourth problem is that even when the united states wins case the defendant country can stall or refuse to change the offending policy in that case the wto can authorize the united states to impose trade sanctions which usually take the form of 100 import duties on products from the defendant country the net result is that us import barriers rise and hence costs to us consumers and the trade barrier in the defendant country remains27 even though the wto dispute settlement process is not without problems the united states has won most of the cases it has filed there the united states howe ver also has lost most of the cases brought against it this is not surprising since cases that end up in the wto tend to be those that have reasonable probability of success by the complainant as of january 17 2001 of the 56 complaints the united states

review commission completed its study of the causes and consequences of the us trade deficit and issued its recommendations with respect to monitoring and enforcement of trade agreements the consensus recommendation from the commission evenly split between republicans and democrats was to fully enforce us international trade laws and the international agreements that we have entered into while trying to ensure that the nations we trade with fully enforce the intern ational agreements they have entered into30 the methods of enforcement however differed among the commissioners the democratic commissioners recommended that the us 1 adopt and enforce policies to attack hidden and nontariff barriers in countries such as china and japan 2 improve enforcement of fair trade laws including the creation of new agency to selfinitiate fair trade complaints 3 take measures to reorganize government trade initiatives 4 create congressional trade office and 5 require regular trade assessment from the doc and an analysis of progress on wto implementation from the office of the ustr31 the republican commissioners recommended 1 that trade agreements be subject to the same resultsbased evaluations that the federal gove rnment is now subject to pursuant to the 1993 government performance and results act 2 that us trade policy with respect to japan involve greater emphasis on compliance 3 that increased funding be provided for staffing of doc and ustr monitoring and compliance efforts and 4 that us trade policy agencies be organized to put increased emphasis on enforcement32 the enforcement of international trade agreements however does not occur in political and strategic vacuum such activities affect other aspects of international relations widely publicized trade disputes that reach
