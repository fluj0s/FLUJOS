disappointed in us position ref london 2548 classified by ambassador louis susman for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf summary prime minister brown continues to press hard for international adoption of tobin tax despite being aware of us opposition to the tax he has raised this issue and bonuses on several occasions directly with the ambassador and said that he saw cooperation on financial services and afghanistan as the critical elements of usuk relationship brown first highlighted the tobin tax at the november g20 ministerial in st andrews and subsequently told ambassador that he was disappointed that treasury secretary geithner publicly refused to support the uk position the political opposition in the uk also is questioning the lack of us support the pm is using the issue for domestic political gain but also for reasons of social justice the uk may feel emboldened on this issue given french foreign minister kouchners proposal at cop15 for an international tax on financial services for programs for poverty reduction and climate change and would likely criticize the us if there were further international movement on this issue end summary prime minister raises tax and bonuses with ambassador 2 cnf prime minister brown continues to press hard for international adoption of some form of tobin tax on financial transactions despite being fully aware of us opposition to the tax in recent speeches to major business groups at the commonwealth summit and in press conferences the pm has emphasized that tobin tax must be among the options explored to ensure that taxpayers do not bear the cost of future bank bailouts the prime minister has raised this issue several times with ambassador susman most recently during the ambassadors call to discuss the afghanistan strategy on november 30 and in thanksgiving call from the pm to the ambassador the prime minister has stated that he saw coordination of our actions on afghanistan and financial services as the cornerstones of the ukus bilateral relationship and has expressed disappointment that on the latter the us has not been as supportive as he had hoped we expect that the pm will become emboldened to push harder for the tax after frances foreign minister kouchner at the copenhagen cop15 proposed 0005 percent tax on financial transactions to fund poverty reduction and combating climate change in developing countries 3 cnf the prime minister also has raised with the ambassador the issue of bank bonuses and has repeatedly queried what the us government position would be if goldman sachs among others announced large bonuses the issue of bonuses is coming to head in the uk this week with the chancellor announcing new measures during his december 9 prebudget report this issue will reported septel background brown at st andrews 4 cnf during the november 67 g20 ministerial in st andrews prime minister brown unexpectedly focused on the tobin tax tax on financial transactions as one of the key measures that should be explored to ensure that financial institutions and not taxpayers would in the future bear the costs of risks they take as reported in reftel the prime minister chancellor darling and other hmg officials had been previously informed about the us opposition to such tax however the pms staff nevertheless highlighted the tax in prebriefing the press on his speech strategy that backfired when the press focused on the lack of support from the us other governments and the imf comment we believed at the time that the pms close advisor shriti vadera who longer is officially working in government was behind the push for the tobin tax recently roland rudd head of the thinktank business for new europe and wellconnected in the labour party verified that vadera was the invisible hand behind the scenes end comment immediately after the meeting in st andrews the prime minister called the ambassador and expressed his disappointment that treasury secretary geithner had so publicly declined to support the pms proposal continuous campaign 5 sbunf the prime minister chancellor darling and financial services authority chairman lord turner have since st andrews continued to draw attention to the tobin tax in november 25 commonwealth summit press briefing the pm stated that to make banks more accountable we can look at an insurance scheme we can look at the creation of resolution funds we can look at asking banks to hold more capital we can look at global levy on transactions and that he would raise these options with his commonwealth partners in his november 23 speech to the confederation of british industry brown also emphasized the global levy as an option to rebuild trust between banks and the societies they serve turner in speech at the british embassy in paris on november 30 said that policymakers should not exclude consideration of taxes on financial transactions he also acknowledged however the limitations of such tax it would not prevent all or even most of the rent extraction in the financial sector nor would it would create the perfect amount of liquidity in the system darling in bbc radio interview on november 8 admitted that it would be difficult to reach an international agreement on global banking tax but it was an idea that had to be considered opposition joins the bandwagon 6 cnf labour party officials are not the only ones expressing disappointment with the us position on the tobin tax baroness shirley williams and lord paddy ashcroft two respected liberal democrats recently told emboffs that they were bewildered and disappointed by us opposition conservative party leaders have not addressed the tobin tax in their position papers or remarks opposition leader david cameron did state in november 19 press conference that the problem with the tobin tax is that if we applied it here and others didnt follow we would lose lots of companies that would simply go elsewhere it is important to remember that financial services is not just the city there are hundreds of thousands of people employed in banks building societies and insurance firms throughout the country 7 cnf the uk financial sector has been rather muted in its comments preferring to remain silent unless and until the government makes an actual proposal jp morgan officials told us that the firm is opposed to the idea of tobin tax and is particularly concerned about the difficulty of implementation which would need to be universal to avoid regulatory arbitrage they also said there would be intense lobbying to exempt some transactions from tax predicting that us treasuries other government bonds and sovereign debt would be excluded from such tax the tax would be even more discriminatory since it would only target transactions of private firms and individuals 8 cnf comment the prime ministers position is largely being driven by domestic politics as way to be seen as punishing the banks but there is also an element of social justice and need to fill gaping budget deficit the recent announcement by the french fm plays on the social justice aspect we expect the pm will continue to press this issue and will criticize the us
