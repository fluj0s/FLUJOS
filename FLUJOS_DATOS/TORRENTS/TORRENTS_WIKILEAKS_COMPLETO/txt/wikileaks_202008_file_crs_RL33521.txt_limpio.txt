specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division carol glover information research specialist knowledge services group gasoline prices causes of volatility and congressional response summary the high price of gasoline has been and continues to be driving factor in consideration of energy policy proposals despite passage of the massive energy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 pl 10958 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 hr 6 pl 110140 numerous other proposed initiatives came under active consideration in the second session of the 110th congress measures proposed included opening the outer continental shelf for oil and gas drilling regulation of speculation in energy markets and policies concerning the strategic petroleum reserve large number of factors combined to put pressure on gasoline prices including increased world demand for crude oil and limited us refinery capacity to supply gasoline the war and continued violence in iraq added uncertainty and threats of supply disruption added pressure particularly to the commodity futures markets concern that speculation added volatility and upward pressure was frequently cited in recent months decline in the value of the dollar compared to other currencies increased the dollar price of oil on futures markets the gasoline price surge stimulated much legislative activity but until the last year or so there was not the sense of the extreme urgency of previous energy crises in part this may be due to the fact that there was been physical shortage of gasoline or lines at the pump as there were after the arab oil embargo in 1973 and the iranian revolution in 1979 at that time there was expectation that prices were destined to grow ever higher and many believed that the worlds supply of oil was running out such views have been less prevalent during the current runup but the continued and unrelenting increase in crude oil prices to record levels even discounting inflation led many to suggest that changing world market conditions may cause permanent or at least chronic shortages of petroleum production capacity others continued to expect that growth in demand would moderate and production increase to meet demand as it did following the shortages of the 1970s the continuing high prices led to further search for legislative remedies this report after analyzing

congressional response most recent developments gasoline and crude oil prices surged to record levels in may 2008 but as the summer driving season ended they moderated somewhat and then plunged as economic worries cut consumption see figure 1 cumulative consumption of gasoline for the first 311 days of 2008 was about 3 less than the same period in 2007 despite passage in december 2007 of the energy independence and security act hr 6 pl 110140 the main provisions of which were an increase in the corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for automobiles and light trucks and an increase in the requirement for the use of renewable fuels in gasoline the second session of the 110th congress continued active consideration of various energy proposals when the congress broke for the november elections it had passed legislation affecting oil and gas leasing on the outer continental shelf ocs energy taxes and the strategic petroleum reserve spr but it had also considered legislation regarding price gouging and speculation in energy futures markets and also dealing with oil market manipulation by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec background and analysis legislative activities the persistence of high gasoline prices led to broad spectrum of proposed new legislation in the first session of the 110th congress despite passage of the major energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 many members continued to explore variety of measures to increase supply and reduce demand in the short term and to reduce the impact of high prices on consumers as well as revisit longerterm policies that were left behind in the process of reaching agreement on pl 10958 one such proposed policy was increasing cafe standards for automobiles and light trucks and the energy independence and security act of 2007 hr 6 pl 110140 resolved decadeslong debate by setting new standards and procedures for meeting them pl 110140 also increased the requirement to use renewable fuels in gasoline including advanced biofuels such as cellulosic alcohol starting in 2016 however number of proposals included in one or more versions of energy legislation in 2007 were dropped from the final bill and those issues remained of interest to the congress during the second session crs2 with gasoline prices soaring new wave of legislative proposals appeared in the congress prominent among them were bills to suspend the federal gasoline and diesel transportation tax during the summer driving season by presidential candidates senators mccain and clinton senator domenici introduced bill emphasizing us petroleum production including opening the outer continental shelf ocs and part of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr for oil and gas leasing and encouraging leasing of oil shale deposits senator reid introduced bill which among other measures would impose windfall profits tax on oil companies another tax issue was the effort to extend tax credits for renewable energy production and offset them by increasing taxes on the oil companies numerous bills were also introduced to deal with the possibility that speculation was unreasonably driving up oil prices the house passed several bills identifying and prohibiting price gouging president bushs policy of continuing fill of the spr was opposed in both houses and bill suspending fill became law proposals to sell spr oil in an effort to moderate oil prices were not adopted however the major debate in the second session was the proposal by republicans to open up the ocs for oil and gas leasing this report reviews the major legislative initiatives to deal with the gasoline price issue to put these proposals in perspective it first describes some of the factors that have led to the high prices of both crude oil and gasoline figure 1 average daily nationwide price of unleaded gasoline january 2002november 2008 450 400 350 dollars per gallon 300 250 200 150 100 l l l l l l l 02 03 04

figure 1 climaxed period of almost five years during which gasoline prices demonstrated great deal of regional volatility but less of an increase at the national level in 2004 large number of factors combined to exert pressure on gasoline prices in all parts of the country some of these factors affected the price of crude oil and others the cost of producing and marketing gasoline crude oil prices past energy crises have demonstrated that oil is traded in world market in which events in remote areas affect the price of crude for almost everyone as result the price of crude oil is set through the interaction of world demand and supply major factors in the runup of crude oil prices were the sharply increased consumption of imported oil by china see figure 2 and the continuing possibility of supply disruption either from violence or terrorism in the middle east or from natural disasters like hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 figure 2 chinas oil production and consumption 19862007 8000

downloaded on may 19 2007 httptontoeiadoegovcountrycountry_energy_datacfmfipsch world demand for crude oil grew by 13 in 2007 to 860 mbd world supply was 873 mbd in march 2008 leaving relatively little excess supply to draw on if the market were disrupted by natural or political disasters1 when excess supply on the market is low prices tend to rise and become more volatile 1 international energy agency oil market report april 11 2008 p 1 crs4 some observers have suggested that speculators who have entered the commodity markets in large numbers looking for ways to increase their monetary investments rather than to trade in oil and oil products were causing an unacceptable upward pressure on prices another factor in recent months was been the decline in the value of the dollar compared to other currencies since world prices of oil are quoted in dollars this would have an upward effect on market prices one of the major factors pushing crude prices higher is the perception that as demand increases production capacity will not increase with it most of the spare production capacity in the world market is located in opec countries and as figure 3 shows spare capacity in those countries has been lower than average over the past several years figure 3 opec surplus crude oil production capacity source eia shortterm energy outlook figure 10 may 2008 gasoline prices higher prices for crude oil tend to translate directly into higher prices for gasoline at the peak of the market crude oil accounted for about 72 of the cost of gasoline refining distributing and marketing account for about 16 of the cost of gasoline and taxes account for about 13 however until recently crude oils share of the cost of gasoline has been more typically in the range of 45 to 55 in may 2007 for example with gasoline at 315 per gallon crude oil contributed 46 of the cost refining distributing and marketing 41 and taxes 132 with the collapse of crude prices contribution of crude costs to the gasoline price declined somewhat this trend is illustrated in figure 4 2 energy information administration data based on march 2008 data and base price of gasoline of 324 per gallon

company itself higher costs for any element in the cost of gasoline are likely to be passed on to consumers3 number of factors aggravated the pressure on gasoline prices including limited refining capacity in the united states the range of fuel blends required to meet air pollution requirements and the mandated use of ethanol as an additive perhaps most important us demand for gasoline increased as economic growth continued at least through 2007 however consumption of gasoline for the first 311 days of 2008 averaged 901 mbd compared to 929 mbd during the same period in 20074 see figure 5 3 the price of diesel fuel for transportation has also surged to record levels for details on the relationship between diesel and gasoline prices see crs report rl34431 the disparity between

report november 5 2008 table 10 the 2004 price surge intensified discussion of energy policy and led to further calls for passage of energy legislation however until the climax of the katrina disaster the urgency of previous energy crises had been lacking throughout the period us gasoline consumption continued to rise in part this may be because although the price of gasoline in nominal terms set record in real terms it did not appear to be reaching the level of the iranian crisis years of the early 1980s see figure 6 that is until katrina pushed it toward the 300pergallon mark further unlike the earlier crises there was physical shortage of gasoline and there were lines at the pump except in local disasteraffected areas crs7 figure 6 nominal and real price of gasoline 19502007 and september 2008 source eia annual energy review 2007 table 524 and monthly energy review october 2008 table 94 as figure 7 indicates by the early 1990s the proportion of consumer expenditures on oil and gasoline had declined from the high levels of the 1970s and early 1980s data are not yet available to indicate what effect the price runup starting in 2004 has had on this measure perhaps most important the common view during the earlier crises was that oil prices not only were high but were destined to become ever higher in the coming years because world resources were probably beginning to level off and would decline in the future this view is longer widely prevalent largely because world proved reserves have increased faster than production and are currently more than twice the level at the time of the arab oil embargo in 1973 at the beginning of the current crisis the general expectation was that the price increase was temporary phenomenon in part this may be due to the fact that there has been physical shortage of gasoline or lines at the pump as there were after the arab oil embargo in 1973 and the iranian revolution in 1979 but the continued and unrelenting increase in crude oil prices to record levels even discounting inflation is leading many to suggest that changing world market conditions may have led to permanent or at least chronic shortages of petroleum production capacity the persistent increases in world demand for oil despite higher prices and the inability or unwillingness in many parts of the world particularly in the middle east to develop known existing resources appear to presage continuing tight market in crs8 which production capacity is only slightly greater than demand under those conditions temporary interruptions in production caused for example by local political crises or weather are much more likely than normal to force prices upward figure 7 consumer spending on oil as percentage of gdp 19702004 source eia annual energy review 2006 tables 35 and d1 others continue to expect that growth in demand will moderate and production will increase to meet demand as it did following the shortages of the 1970s they argue that the market price of oil appears to be much higher than production costs and is being sustained by the expectation of continued strong demand in the indefinite future in addition they point to large profits flowing to oil producers and political pressure to invest those profits in increased production policy options congress has considered numerous energy policy initiatives and enacted many of them with the continuing pressure of rising prices however energy policy has once again become the focus of attention both in the congress and on the campaign trail policy options include efforts to ameliorate the effects of high prices in the short term and to attack the longer term problem the latter options come in three major forms to reduce consumption by increased efficiency without having negative effect on the economy to substitute alternative fuels at cost comparable to the oil crs9 they replace and to encourage production of more oil either in this country or abroad the choice of these options depends to certain extent on how the future of the oil market is viewed those who consider it likely that the present tightness of the market is likely to continue as described above tend to support alternative fuels and increased efficiency and to denigrate efforts to increase oil production as futile and ineffective compared to the growth in world demand which they expect to continue indefinitely those who view the present tightness of the world market as an aberration that can be relieved with adequate investment in new production capacity view any move to increase supply anywhere in the world as positive signal that the tightness and volatility of the world oil market can be eased and prices can more closely reflect the cost of production oilrelated legislation reducing consumer impacts and regulating oil markets number of proposals are aimed at easing the impact of high prices on consumers or are aimed at the oil industrys pricemaking policies gas tax moratorium bills introduced by senator mccain s 2890 and senator clinton s 2971 would have suspended federal gasoline and diesel transportation taxes for the summer driving season and the proposals were topic in the presidential campaigns of the two candidates senator obama also campaigning for the democratic presidential nomination criticized both proposals similar bills were introduced in the house but the issue was never taken up for details see crs report rl34475 transportation fuel taxes impacts of repeal or moratorium by robert pirog and john w fischer price gouging the rapid increase in gasoline prices following the katrina disaster led to allegations of price gouging pl 10958 included provision requiring the federal trade commission ftc to conduct an investigation into price gouging in increased gasoline prices the issue reemerged in the 110th congress as gasoline prices surged past 300 per gallon on may 23 2007 the house passed the federal price gouging prevention act hr 1252 the bill would have banned the sale of gasoline at unconscionably excessive prices during energy emergencies declared by the president and impose heavy fines and imprisonment for violations the white house complained that the bill could result in gasoline price controls and threatened to veto it but the house vote of 284141 indicated enough support to override veto the senate in passing its version of hr 6 the creating longterm energy alternatives for the nation clean energy act of 2007 on june 21 2007 included pricegouging provision similar to that in hr 1252 however the provision was not included in the final version of hr 6 which became pl 110140 the consumerfirst energy act s 2991 contained provision on price gouging similar to the previously considered measures crs10 speculation in the oil market the possibility that speculation has unreasonably driven up oil prices either because of illegal manipulation or because speculative bubble is underway has led to the introduction of much legislation to increase oversight or regulate speculation the 2008 farm bill food conservation and energy act pl 110234 contains provisions expanding the role of the commodity futures trading commission cftc but many other bills were considered that would have addressed other perceived problems on june 26 2008 the house passed the energy markets emergency act hr 6377 which would direct the cftc to curb excessive speculation price distortion and other activity that is causing major market disturbances in the senate majority leader reid proposed consideration of s 3268 the stop excessive energy speculation act of 2008 but disagreement on how to treat amendments on the floor blocked action similar bill the commodity markets transparency and accountability act of 2008 hr 6604 was approved by the house agriculture committee july 24 2008 it failed to get 23 of the vote under suspension of the rules on the house floor july 30 but passed the house under regular rules september 18 by vote of 283133 for details see crs report rl34555 speculation and energy prices legislative responses by mark jickling and lynn j cunningham strategic petroleum reserve authorized in 1975 spr consists of caverns formed out of naturally occurring salt domes in louisiana and texas in which nearly 700 million barrels of crude oil are stored its current capacity is 727 million barrels and it is authorized at 1 billion barrels the purpose of the spr is to provide an emergency source of crude oil that may be tapped in the event of presidential finding that an interruption in oil supply or an interruption threatening adverse economic effects warrants drawdown from the reserve program costs for the spr in recent years have been dedicated principally to maintaining spr facilities and keeping the spr in readiness should it be needed since fy1999 any fill of the spr has been with deliveries of royaltyinkind rik oil to the spr in lieu of cash royalties to the federal government on offshore production through fy2007 royaltyinkind deliveries to the spr have totaled roughly 140 million barrels and forgone receipts to the department of the interior are estimated to be 46 billion doe has projected deliveries of rik oil during fy2008 of 191 million barrels and 1170 billion in forgone revenues continued fill of the spr with royaltyinkind oil became controversial in the th 110 congress critics argued against adding oil to the spr when markets are tight and prices remain high they argued further that the additional oil adds little to us energy security supporters of rik fill argue that the fill rate is too little to have discernible impact on markets and that currently high refinedproduct prices are sustained by factors other than crude supply which is more than ample at this time legislation was introduced in the second session hr 5146 s 2598 to suspend rik fill the house bill would also have mandated sale of 13 million barrels of spr oil during fy2008 with the proceeds to be spent on number of energy efficiency and alternative fuel programs both bills established conditions including significant decline in crude oil prices that would have to be satisfied crs11 before rik fill could be resumed on may 13 2008 the house passed 38525 similar bill the strategic petroleum reserve fill suspension and consumer protection act hr 6022 which would have suspended spr fill until the end of 2008 unless the price of oil dropped below 75 per barrel the senate passed the bill on the same day and it became pl 110232 on may 19 further move regarding the spr was the consumer energy supply act of 2008 hr 6578 introduced by representative lampson the bill would have required the president to release 70 million barrels of highquality crude oil from the spr over the next six months move which proponents said would lower gasoline prices the house took up the bill on july 24 2008 under suspension of the rules which required 23 vote in favor for passage the vote was 268157 not enough to pass the bill for details see crs report rl33341 the strategic petroleum reserve history perspectives and issues by robert bamberger energy tax proposals several legislative proposals including senator reids consumerfirst energy act s 2991 included windfall profits tax on oil companies reacting to the record profits recorded in recent years the provision was not passed in either house however for details see crs report rl34689 oil industry financial performance and the windfall profits tax by salvatore lazzari and robert pirog oil industry tax issues were indirectly involved throughout the second session during consideration of large tax measure which included among other measures extension of tax credits for renewable energy house sponsors of the tax proposals insisted on including measures to offset the costs of various provisions and among the offsets were reductions in tax benefits previously granted oil and gas companies the senate declined to include offsets and the tax bill appeared unlikely to pass but the senate attached it to its version of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 hr 1424 pl 110343 with only small offset provision affecting the oil and gas industry and that version was finally approved and became law for details see crs report rl33578 energy tax policy history and current issues by salvatore lazzari mid to longterm supply and demand most proposals affecting supply and demand of crude oil and gasoline would not affect the current shortterm crisis but would be aimed at longer term trends fuel economy corporate average fuel economy cafe standards also have long history of controversy going back to their establishment in the 1970s when congress passed the energy independence and security act hr 6 pl 110140 in the first session the issue was largely resolved for the time being and did not emerge significantly during the second session for details see crs report rl33413 automobile and light truck fuel economy the cafe standards by brent d yacobucci and robert bamberger anwr oil and gas exploration and development of part of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr has been controversial for many years this was part of the early proposals for legislation that eventually became the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 but was dropped in the face of strong opposition in both houses crs12 support for the action grew gradually in the following years along with technological developments that advocates claimed would reduce the environmental impact of development numerous attempts to open the region for leasing have been made and both the house and the senate at various times approved measures that included leasing provisions but none of them have survived to become law for more details see crs report rl32838 arctic national wildlife refuge anwr legislative actions through the 110th congress first session by anne gillis m lynne corn and elizabeth roberts savings goals number of legislative proposals would have set goals for reducing oil consumption an example is the enhanced energy security act of 2006 s 2747 introduced by senator bingaman may 4 2006 which would have required the director of the office of management and budget to develop an action plan to save 25 million barrels per day mbd in 2016 7 mbd in 2026 and 10 mbd in 2031 alternative fuels in his january 31 2006 state of the union message president bush asserted that the united states is addicted to oil and set the goal of replacing more than 75 of oil imports from the middle east by 2025 the main thrust of the presidential initiative was to increase funding for research in producing ethanol from plant fiber biomass rather than from corn for improved batteries for hybrid automobiles and for hydrogen fuels in his next state of the union speech on january 23 2007 the president went further setting goal of reducing gasoline consumption by 20 in 10 years through combination of more stringent fuel economy standards and setting mandatory renewable fuels standards of 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels by 2017 about five times the current consumption the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 set target of 75 billion gallons by 2012 on june 21 2007 the senate passed its version of hr 6 the creating long term energy alternatives for the nation clean energy act of 2007 including provision requiring production of 36 billion gallons of ethanol in 2022 the final version of the bill pl 110140 set modified standard that starts at 90 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008 and rises to 36 billion gallons by 2022 of the latter total 21 billion gallons is required to be obtained from cellulosic ethanol and other advanced biofuels for more details see crs report rl34265 selected issues related to an expansion of the renewable fuel standard rfs by brent d yacobucci and randy schnepf ocs leasing the moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the outer continental shelf ocs except in the central and western gulf of mexico and some parts of alaska was subject to increasing controversy during the second session the moratorium was maintained both by presidential ban and by provisions included in the annual appropriations measures for the department of the interior which administers oil and gas leasing on federal lands on july 14 2008 president bush lifted the executive ban on the ocs imposed in 1990 by president george h w bush republicans in congress attempted to bring up measures that would open up some parts of the ocs for leasing but were unable to bring their measures to the floor either as standalone bills or as crs13 amendments to other bills appropriations committee chairman obey refused to bring the fy2009 interior appropriations bill before the committee preventing republicans from introducing ocs amendments to it on september 16 the house passed hr 6899 the comprehensive american energy security and consumer protection act which would have opened up the ocs for limited oil and gas leasing the bill passed by vote of 236189 despite objections by republicans that it was too restrictive the senate did not take up the bill with most of the nondefense fy2009 appropriations bills including interior not considered the congress took up continuing resolution to fund those programs until march 6 2009 on september 24 the house passed hr 2638 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 without provision
