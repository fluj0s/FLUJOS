holy land ref moscow 517 b moscow 1255 classified by acting political counselor robert patterson for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary the return to russia of historic properties in jerusalem and the west bank and the end of the visa regime for travel to israel are the latest indicators of deepening russiaisrael relations that depend significantly upon personal contacts as well as official channels the properties which will be used to establish russian consulate in jerusalem and cultural and religious centers will enhance russias soft power by increasing the russian presence at time when immigration to israel has declined russia continues to benefit economically from these emigres many of whom have established businesses in israel that trade with russia or have returned to their homeland to work in russias booming economy the end of the visa regime is expected to significantly increase personal and economic contacts between these countries that currently enjoy deep cultural ties and the strongest political relationship in their often stormy history close ties to israel do not appear however to have had much impact on moscows pragmatic positions on issues of concern to tel aviv such as arms sales to syria end summary israel and palestinians return russian property 2 u russia will receive several properties in jerusalem and the west bank from the palestinian authority pa and israeli government which are returning land that russia originally acquired in the nineteenth century for the construction of orthodox churches and facilities for russian pilgrims to the holy land during june ceremony the pa formally gave russia ownership of three plots of land in the west bank that will be the site of new russian cultural and religious centers russian and israeli officials announced in may that they were close to finalizing the terms for russia to take ownership of large compound in jerusalem that includes st sergiev church and an adjacent building originally used as religious mission as one of his last acts as president putin ordered that the gor provide 4 million to restore the church return to the holy land symbolizes russian revival 3 c xxxxx told us that the return of historically russian property in the holy land was symbol of russias postsoviet cultural and religious renaissance the properties which had either been abandoned by the ussr or sold to israel would be used for facilities for religious pilgrims and tourists as well as russian language schools and clinics that would benefit local residents including the large number of russianspeaking israelis the mfa was also considering establishing consulate at the compound in jerusalem xxxxx said that at present russia had only its embassy in tel aviv and small mission in ramallah to handle relations with the pa presence in jerusalem would help provide assistance to the many russian citizens living in israel as well as russian tourists whose numbers presently estimated at 200000 per year were expected to grow significantly after the russianisraeli agreement to end visa requirements became operative in september 4 c xxxxx explained that countries in the region recognized that providing land to russia was means to improve bilateral relations and attract russian tourists in addition to israel and the pa jordan had already given russia land on the banks of the jordan river historically associated with jesus baptism ref lebanon also had property that once belonged to russia although discussion of its return had not begun 5 cxxxxx that gor interest in the holy land property was part of the russian desire to return to the middle east in various ways politically by resurrecting ties with arab states that had been allowed to atrophy during the 1990s diplomatically by enhancing its role in the middle east peace process and culturally by reestablishing physical presence for the russian state and church for russians it was only fitting that the orthodox church should have presence in jerusalem along with the other ancient christian dominations already present the roman catholics and greek orthodox xxxxx said that the pa hoped that giving russia land for cultural and religious facilities would attract russian tourists to the west bank moscow 00001991 002 of 003 working for the glory of russia 6 u xxxxx explained that while the gor would formally own the properties in israel and the west bank the nongovernmental imperial orthodox palestine society iops would run the cultural and religious facilities although the gor referred to the iops founded in 1872 as one of the oldest russian ngos the organization is not independent of the government the head of russias audit chamber sergey stepashin is chairman of the iops and mfa middle east department deputy director oleg ozerov heads its international section the mfa and iops signed memorandum of cooperation in june to facilitate gor assistance to the organizations efforts to develop russias humanitarian scientific and cultural relations with states in the middle east during june address fm lavrov highlighted iops role in peoples diplomacy that supplemented official political contacts he praised iops for helping russias spiritual revival and demonstrating that the country was an influential and respected power lavrov closed in order to worthily return to the holy land we must workto the glory of russia 7 u iops will depend financially upon russian oligarchs including roman abramovich and israeli resident arkadiy gaidamak both of whom reportedly agreed to the gor request that they pay expenses related to acquiring the compound in jerusalem russian emigres bridge between russia and israel 8 c xxxxx said that the immigration of russian jews to israel created bond between the two countries that had profound impact on russiaisrael relations this did not mean that those who fled soviet antisemitism had pressured their new homeland for closer ties with the country that had repressed them instead they created in israel center of russian culture and formed bridge between the countries xxxxx said that many russianspeakers in israel maintained strong ties to their homeland and some had even returned the israeli embassy estimated that tens of thousands of israels russianspeakers currently live and work in moscow xxxxx said that he personally knew many russianspeaking israelis who came to participate in russias economic boom with their knowledge of russian language and culture plus university degrees and business experience gained in israel europe or the us they could easily find opportunities here emigres create warm feelings for israel 9 cxxxxx differentiated the jews who fled soviet oppression and antisemitism in the 1970s and 1980s from those who left in the 1990s to avoid the chaos and uncertainty of postsoviet russia the latter group did not leave as ideological enemies and maintained positive feelings for their homeland thanks to cable television and the internet they have been able to maintain contact with russia while this has been the experience of russian immigrants who landed in different countries xxxxx said it was especially acute in israel where russianspeakers were oneseventh of the population this played well within russia where russian cultural foothold in the middle east generated warm feelings toward israel during israels 2006 war with lebanon russian television showed russianspeaking israeli soldiers which helped heighten russian sympathy for israels situation xxxxx cited public opinion polls that showed russians were more inclined to have favorable opinion of israel than the us 10 c xxxxx said that immigrants to israel and elsewhere extended russias cultural reach which the gor recognized as means to project at least the perception of influence for example the world congress of russian jewry an organization that represents russian jews in 35 countries and receives government support met in may in jerusalem where russian federation council member boris shpigle said that russian jews must cultivate special relationship with their homeland xxxxx stressed that with the exception of ukraine and the baltic where russia had serious political concerns the gor saw its compatriots abroad not as fifth column but as bridge between their homeland and adopted countries in israel country of which some of russias biggest oligarchs were citizens the gor hoped this would provide opportunities for investment and give russia access to israeli technology israeli investment might also come to moscow 00001991 003 of 003 russia as it did in the case of lev levayev whose development company is reportedly undertaking largescale projects in moscow and will expand its existing jewelry factory in perm xxxxx thought russiaisrael trade which is estimated at 23 billion in 2006 could be several times higher immigration to israel is dead 11 c while russia continues to benefit from the presence of its existing emigres in israel russian immigration to israel is all but dead according to leonard terlitskiy the hebrew immigrant aid societys representative in the cis terlitskiy who was among the first jews to leave the ussr during the brezhnev era told us that anyone who wanted to leave has already left the russian economy offered enough opportunities and antisemitism is not the problem it once was allowing jews to remain where they face less chance of becoming victim of terrorism than they would in israel russian daily vremya novestey reported that in 2007 only 6700 people immigrated from the cis to israel compared to 34000 in 2001 meanwhile 38000 israeli nationals were known to have returned recently to live in russia and the cis 12 c xxxxx thought that the prospect of visafree travel to israel would allow russian jews to visit israel and develop an affinity for the country and their compatriots there without the need to emigrate members of moscows jewish community recently told vremya novestey that they saw need to emigrate and could always visit israel on holiday russia maintains pragmatic policies 13 c observers noted that despite the increasing cultural proximity of russia and israel the gor maintained its pragmatic stance on weapons sales to syria and contacts with hamas despite israeli opposition this stemmed from moscows ability to compartmentalize aspects of foreign policy that fostered relations with israel and syria simultaneously xxxxx joked that perhaps israel had evened the score through military sales to georgia including unmanned aerial drones the shooting down of which recently contributed to increasing tensions between moscow and tbilisi ref b xxxxx and israeli emboffs told us separately that military sales to georgia were not an irritant in russiaisrael relations although the gor had asked israel not to sell offensive weapons systems to tbilisi beyrle
