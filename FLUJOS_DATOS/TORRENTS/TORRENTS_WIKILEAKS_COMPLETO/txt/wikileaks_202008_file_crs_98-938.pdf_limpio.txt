congress summary in each of the past four fiscal years fy1996fy1999 congress has directed the administration to reduce the size of the department of defense dod acquisition workforce defined as the employees who participate in th development and procurement of weapons equipment and provisio ns for the military services these mandates reflect view in congress that the workforce has not been downsized in proportion to the decline in of the ove rall defense budget in general nor of the acquisition portion of the defense budget in particular as congress and the administration have debated the future of the defens acquisition workforce participants have encountered basic questions what precisely is t he dod acquisition workforce how many people are in it and what exactly are their functi ons at present there is commonly accepted definition of the dod acquisition wo rkforce previous attempts within the decade to define the workforce have produced estimates ranging from 25000 to 582000 personnel in early 1997 dod hired the jefferson solutions group private consultin g firm to define the size and composition of the acquisition workforce jefferso n solutions issued its report in september 1997 it estima ted that the overall workforce included about 189000 people and that the largest acquisition workforce grou p consists of scientists and engineers about 43 p ercent followed by computer systems analysts and logistical and program managers about 16 percent and contractors purchasers or procurement support personnel about 15 percent notably the study did not address the issue or provide statistics on the extent to which dod relied on privatesector contractors to perform acquisitionrelated functions in response to section 912b of the fy1998 defense authorization act deputy secretary of defense for acquisition and technology jacques s gansle r issued memorandum to defense agencies on november 20 1998 having determined that dod would use modified version of the definition used by the packar d commis sion report each agency is required to conduct functional workforc analysis revise its personnel count and report findings by december 30 1998 currently two major questions confront congress in regard to the acquisition workfor ce first should the new definition constructed by the jefferson solution s group be adopted formally if so it will result in significant reduction in dod s official count of acquis ition personnel second to what extent will savings achieved through reductions be offset by additional unanticipated costs such costs ma include 1 hiring contractors to perform acquisitionrelated functions previousl performed by government employees 2 separation costs such as early buyouts retirements and severance pay and 3

congress has directed the administratio n to reduce the size of the department of d efense dod acquisition workforce the dod employees who participate in the development and procurement of weapons and equipment for the military services cin the fy1996 defense authorization act congress directed th administr ation to reduce the workforce by 15000 people by october 1 1996 and by total of 25 percent compared to the 1995 figure over period of five years the act also required the secretary of defense t report to congress on ways to restructure functions among dod s acquisition departments and agencies cin the fy1997 defense authorization act congress directed th administration to redu ce the workforce by an additional 15000 people by october 1 1997 and stipulated that thi s reduction was to be in the form of actual acquisition personnel not just acquisition positions cin the fy1998 defense authorization act congress directed th administration to redu ce the workforce by an additional 25000 people by september 30 1998 but permitted the secretary of defense to waive portion of this reduction if her certifies to congress by june 1 1998 tha t such reducti ons would adversely impact military readiness and acquisition efficiency the act also required dod to submit report to congress by april 1 1998 that provides plan for future acquisition policy includin g future opportunities to restructure and streamline dods acquisitio n organizations workforce and infrastructure cin the fy1999 defense authorization act congress directed th administration to reduce the workforce by 25000 acquisition personnel by octobe r 1 1999 lowering it to 12500 personnel if the secretary f defense certifies that such reduction would cause an adverse effect n military readiness or management of the acquisition system these mand ates to reduce the size of the dod acquisition workforce reflected congress view that the workforce has not been downsized enough that reductions continue to l ag in proportion to the decline in the size of the overall defense budget in general and the acquisition portion of the defense budget in particular as result according to this view dod has spent m ore than

reducing the workforce has been viewed as necessar requirement for eliminating wasteful spending and providing dod with increase d funding for other priorities congressional interest in reducing the size and associated costs of the do d acquisition workforc has been energized by certain outside reports the may 1995 report of the dod commission on roles and missions for exam ple noted that while privatesector defense contractors had undertaken largescale reorganization s adjusting to reduced level of defense spending little corresponding reduction had been made in the number of dod acquisition organizations or personnel 1 congress and dod are presently at dds over the need for further reductions in the defense acquisition workforce dod now believes that it has exceeded it s congressional mandates to reduce the acquisition workforce and that furthe r acquisition personnel reductions will have an adverse impact this concern wa s expressed in 1997 report to congress required by the fy1996 defens authorization act dod stated that in fy1996 it had reduced the acquisitio n workforce by 23802 personnel militarycivilian excluding certain depot trade skill personnel

personnel reductions have undercut its effort to manage the acquisi tion workforce and have adversely impacted military readiness in appeals to the fy 1999 defense authorization bill dod asked3 congress to recon sider house section 901 which requires that by october 1 2001 dod would phasein reductions of an additional 70000 defense acquisitio n personnel dod believed th at section 901

efine the acquisition workforce and examine dods efforts to restructure acquisition organizations gao concluded that dod has been reducing its acquisition workforce at f aster rate than its overall workforce and is on schedule to accomplish 25percent reduction by the fiscal year 2000 however potential savings from these reductions cannot b precisely tracked in dods budget in addition some of the potential savings from acquisition workfor ce reductions may be offset by other anticipated costs such cos ts include those for contracting with private entities for some services previously performed by government per sonnel ie substituting one workforce for another 7 such confli cting opinions on the size of the defense acquisition workforce and the potential savings to be achieved stem from an inability to define it over the past three years as congress and the administration have debated the future of th defense acquisition workforce policymakers have sought to answer the basi c question what precisely is the dod acquisit ion workforce how many people are in it where in dod are they located and what exactly are their functionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98938crs4 public law 101510 national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1991 title xii8 defense acquisition workforce improvement act november 5 1990defining the defense acquisition workforce there is commonly accepted definition of the dod acquisition workforce this has led to confusing and contentious discussions about the workforce its siz and compo sition the significance of reductions dod has made and the potentia l impact of carrying out further reductions historical perspective there have been at least seven attempts in recent years by congress and dod to define what constitutes the defense acquisition workforce each attempt was based on study which used differing combinations of occupational and organizationa l codes and produced estimates of the size of the workforce ranging from 25000 to 582000 perso nnel it is important to note that these studies were performed over period of more than decade period during which there have been significan t changes in th size of the defense budget the size of the procurement portion of the defense budget the numbe r of uniformed military personnel and the total number of dod civilian employees an estimate of the acq uisition workforce that appears large or small in an absolute sense should be considered in light of the defense polic changes that have occurred currently the most commonly accepted estimates agree d upon by congress and dod range fr om about 106000 to 270000 personnel the first is an estimate f personnel whose positions fall under the defense acquisition workforc improvement act dawia dawia is the basis for nearly all of dods education training and career development programs for the acquisition workforce congress enacted dawia in the fy1991 defense authorization act it is codified in chapter8 87 title 10 of the us code

noted data in this table were derived from dr james s mcmichael director of acquisition education office of the secretary of defense according to dr mcmichael the defens manageme nt report estimated the workforce count at 582000 in june 1989 dod and the defens management data c enter have used the same algorithm to arrive at the figure of 582000 when needed they apply this algorithm to the database to obtain comparable count dods current estimate is 375000 this definition also includes organizations which the secretary of defense may determine to have predominately acquisition mission current approaches in dods personnel system members of the acquisition workforce can b identified by using any of three basic approaches either alone or in combination 1 identification by occupational codes such as gs1102 contractin g specialist contracti ng specialists are most often thought of as the acquisition workforce they are the public face that is most often associated wit h directly buying dod goods and services from aircraft carriers to 600 toilet seats some contracting specialists directly purchase goods and services others manage the buying process between dod and defense contractors still others develop supervise and monitor dod contracting policy not l occupational codes howe ver can be neatly classified as either inside or outside the acquisition workforce some managers engineers and scientists fo r example are involved in acquisitionrelated activities but also perform othe r functions for example manager may be primarily responsible for bas operations and serve as critical support for the daytoday running of th military installation 2 iden tification by organizational codes which reflect the mission of th office in which the person works such as the defense reutilization an d marketing service drms which is responsible for dods surplus and excess propert programs drms workers routinely acquire goods and services fo r disposal within feder agencies these goods and services are longer needed by dod throughout the defense establishment some workers are directl involved in buyi ng and selling while others support this process for example auditors may have some oversight authority for the financial managemen t process within military installation but have responsibility for th contracting process they may not be involved with the actual buying r selling either directly or indirectly there are also personnel that perfor m acquisitionrelated functions in organizations that do not have an acquisition mission while other personnel are assigned to an organization with n acquisitionrelated mission but are not involved in the acquisition process for example child care worker responsible for the installations day car center would be unlikely to have responsibility f or procuring goods and services thus the organizational codes are not always an undisputed identifierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98938crs7 the following regulations

acquisitionrelated functions and determines that based on empirical evidence the worker should be considered as part of th acquisition community the data is then entered in to an information system and dod counts that individual as performing acquisitionrelated functions th direct identification method may be considered the most re liable but it is also the most timeconsuming according to dod military and civilian positions that are categorized as part of the dod acquisition system fall in to one of 14 acquisition position categories as established by the undersecretary of d efense for acquisition and technology each acquisition position category has standards set according to its level of complexity definitions of each category of acquisition posit ions can be found in dod instruction 500058r and dod manual 500052m 9 although the definition of each acquisition position category appears in do d instruction manuals the number of positions made it difficult for congress t determine just how many different individuals ccupied each position as well as what duties each in dividual performed within the framework of defense acquisition congress sought n objective source for definition of what constituted the defense acquisition workforce and directed dod to create new definition that woul d answer these questions jefferson solutions report at 1997 hearing on the dod acquisition workforce before the militar procurement and readiness subco mmittee of the house national security committee hnsc dod was asked to create new definition of the acquisition workforc e10 that could be accepted and used by all participants in the debate to carry out thi s task dod hired the jefferson solu tions group management consulting firm based in washington dc and headed by dr allan v burman former administrator of the office of federal procurement policy ofpp jefferson solutions issued its report in september 1997 the report used data gathered from the defense manpower data center dmdc and from in terviews with officials from the office of the secretary of defen army navy air force defensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98938crs8 this table includes 13 occupational specialties not included in the 1986 packard commissio n11 report jefferson solutions applied the original packard definition to the current workforce most personnel were employed in acquisition organizations as defined by dod instruction 500058manpower data center defense logistics agency staff from the senate arme d services committee sac and the house national security committee hnsc and analysts from the general accounting office gao and the congressiona l budget office cbo the report examined two approaches for classifyin g acquisition workforce personnel 1 identifying personnel serving in acquisitio n organizations identified in dod in struction 500058r and 2 identifying personnel designated as part of the defense acquisition workforce improvement ac t dawia the report reached the following conclusions relying exclusively on acquisition organizations resulted in too broad definition as it included employees that do not perform acquisitionrelate d functions such as police officers firefighters health care personnel or who perform variety of functions that are not limited to acquisition excluding organizations that did not qualify as acq uisition organizations would overlook personnel within these organi zations that perform acquisitionrelated functions such as contractors auditors and quality assurance experts since there are only 10554 4 acquisition personnel whose positions fall within statutory requirements for inclusion under dawia using dawia as n identifier would exclude many personnel who perform acquisitionrelate d functions the jefferson solutions report adopted definition for the acquisitio n workforce that revised and expanded on the definition used by the 1986 packar d commission see table 1 the new definition includes 1 all personnel employed in certain defense cquisition occupations regardless of the mission of the particular defense agency in which they work and 2 ll personnel in acquisition organizations who are employed in certain acquisition support occupations the report recommended t hat dod adopt this new definition of the acquisition workforce ensure that th definition is applied in uniform and consistent manner across dod and the services and validate the data results through an independen t agency such as the dmdc to ensure that the data is accurate and complete th report recommended that dod be given an opportu nity to adjust the personnel count on casebycase basis the report also recommended that dod broaden it s definition of employees covered by dawia to include all members of the newly defined defense acquisition workforce as illustrate d in the following table the various occupational codes included in the new definition contained total of 177613 people the study group increased this figure by 65 percent to account for administrative and clerical support that the study group believed were underestimated in the data bringing the total defens acquisition personnel

privatesector contractors while the department of the nav traditionally has relied more heavily on its own inhouse acquisitio n organizationspertinent observations the jefferson solutions report wa s narrowly focused on the task of developing workable definition of who and what constituted the acquisition workforce th study combined both occupational and organizational data elements most of th occupations selected for the acquisition workforce were also located in acquisitio n organizations the study revealed that the largest acquisition workforce grou p consisted of scientists and engineers about 43 percent followed by compute r systems analysts and logistical and program managers about 16 percent an d contractors purchasers or procurement support personnel about 15 percent notably the report did not provide statistics on the extent to which dod used private sector contractors to perform acquisitionrelated functions lack of thi s information could handicap the task of estimating the total cost of acquisitionrelated activities carried out for dod and could hinder policymakers in getting complete understan ding of the workforce composition in its 1996 report on the defens acquisition work force gao pointed out that savings resulting from staff reductions in acquisition organizations particularly reductions of engineering architectural r computer personnel may have been offset by increases in spending on privatesector contractor s gao reached the same conclusions in 1998 report on defens e12 acquisition organizations that since 1995 do d support service contracts increased for occupational fields with the largest personnel reductions and that any potentia l savings may be offset by contracting for services previousl performed by government personnel13 since the military services also rel on contractors to varying degrees the lack14 of data on contractor support could complicate the task of making crossservic comparisons it raises the possibility that simple acrosstheboard reduction in the dod acquisition workforce could impact the military services disproportionately due to the congressional mandate to develop workable definition for th defense acquisition workforce dod must decide whether to use th recommendations of the jefferson solutions report further observation is that dod must conside r whether the methodology used in

the wake of the jefferson solutions report and legislation in the fy 1998 and fy 1999 defense authorization bills congress will confront number of important issues regarding the defense acquisition workforce including the following adequacy and usefulness of new definition should congress adopt the definition of the defense acquisition workforc presented in the jefferson solutions report if so it will result in significan t reduction in the dods official count of defense acquisition personnel if it is t adopted the d ebate on just how many acquisition personnel exist will be prolonged and probably put dod further behind in its efforts to streamline the workforce how much will the new definition help dod and congress to identif redundancies streamline the workforce and achieve savings they must determine to their satisfaction that the findings of the jefferson solutions report are accurate and thorough they will presumably seek agreement on the overall number f acquisition workforce personnel as well as the diversity of skill s represented whether the process based on this particular definition f the workforce will ultimately achieve savings depends on variety of factors including the fate of personnel and positions classified as nonacquisitionrelated will savings be achieved through attrition reductionsinforce removals early buyouts or retirements or will personne l shortages result in an unexpected rise in overtime cost s will newer less experienced workers result in greater inefficiencies with ultimately increased personnel costs will individuals be usefully absorbed into nonacquisitionrelated functions withi n dod will pot ential savings be offset by associated administrative costs as well as costs of increased service contracts for work previously performed by governmen t personnel 15 once new definition is accepte d dmdc the defense agency responsible for the collection and maintenance of automated databases on manpower personnel training and financial movement can collaborate with dod to provide furthe r analyses an d recommendations to congress with dmdcs assistance the findings of the jefferson solutions report could be validated thus enabling dod to mak reasonable adjustments to the person nel figures if such adjustments prove necessary coordinating this function with dmdc would make it easier for dod to perfor m

streamline dods acquisition organizations workforce an d infrastructure dod was directed to identify areas where overlap duplication and redundancy existed among the various acquisition organizations and to presen t alternative consolidation options methods for performing industry oversight an d quality assurance and ways to shorten the procurement cycle for goods and services section 91 2c also required dod to explore new opportunities for building cross service and crossfunctional arrangements within the military services and defens agencies consider current and future needs for acquisition personnel including hiring systems that provided an alternative to the current civil service and mak recommendations for legislative remedies that would be necessary to implement policy and procedural changes the secretary was also required to provide an assessment of th recommendations in the jefferson solutions report as well as discussion f potential legislative changes viewed necessary to implement policy changes in april 1 998 the secretary of defense submitted to congress the repor t required by section 912c the report titled actions to accelerate the movement to the new workforce vision proposed the establishment of five categories of new initiatives described in the report as part of the secretary of defenses vision for16 the future acquisition workforce they are 1 restructure research development and testing 2 restructure sustainment 3 increase acquisition workforce education and training 4 integrate paperless operations and 5 other future focus areas rather than provide comprehensive review of acquisition organizations an d functions as mandated in sections 912c and d the secretary proposed th formation of future task forces and focus groups to study

education training and career developmen t programs in fy1998 dod requested budget of 100 million for dawia congress appropriated 95 million to broaden the membership of dawia fro m 105544 personnel to 189183 personnel suggests that congress will have t appropriate more funds for acquisitionrelated education training and caree r development programs there are adv antages and disadvantages to increasing dawia membership it will cost more money initially in the long run however the investment shoul d eventuate in better trained dod acquisi tion workforce under dawia dod has developed an organized nd systematic approach to career development and training opportunities with appropriate benchmarks at each level of complexity within each program category by identifying dawias certification requirements as th benchmark for all acquisition personnel training nd development activities it appears that all acquisition support personne l many of whom have been historically excluded from training and development due to dawia certification and requirements will have greater access to pportunities for promotion advance and growth the theory holds that this should conduce toward superior inhouse defense acquisitio n workforcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98938crs14 conclusion congress will determine perhaps through the oversig ht process if dod has met both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law as described in section 912c of the fy1998 defense authorization act or section 931 of the fy 1999 defense authorizati on act notably dod leaders who have called for revolution i n business affairs have been legislatively requi red to explore innovative and significant changes to make its acquisition process more efficient this includes explorin g potential overlap and duplication of processes within dods acquisitio n organizations in the various defense agencies and military services listed in appendix d ultimately it is congres s that will decide if such changes have been undertaken and if so whether the size and composition of the acquisition workforce have been adjusted appropriatelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98938crs15 selected bibliography us
