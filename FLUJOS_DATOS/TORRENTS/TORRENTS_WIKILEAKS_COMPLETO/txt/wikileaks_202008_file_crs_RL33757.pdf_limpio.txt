armys and marine corps equipment has been employed in what s been described as the harsh operating environments of iraq and afghanistan where the heat sand and dust as well as operational rates w ell in excess of peacetime rates have taken heavy toll on the armys and marines equipment reequipping reserve nd national guard units that in many cases were underequipped to start with and then requi red to leave their equipment in theater also presents challenges to the services the army and marine corps are also undertaking efforts to reequip their pr epositioned stocks wh ich were drawn upon to provide equipment for use in afghanista n and iraq there are also concerns that the army and marines have not always aggressively pursued the best force protection equipment available and the army has been questioned on its efforts to improve the standard soldier assault ri fle congress in its appr opriation authorization and oversight roles may be faced with some of the following issues what are the department of defe nses dods and the services plans to reequip reserve forces so that they are sufficiently resourced for domestic missions and to properly train for deployments to iraq and afghanistan what is the current state of pr epositioned stocks that have been drawn down again to support the iraq surge what type of equipment is being used to restoc k prepositioned stocks and is this equipment fully operational or in lesser state of readiness how many mraps does dod intend to procure have bureaucratic diffi culties attributed to the army and dod had an adverse impact on

are also actively pursuing the acquisition of new equipment based on wartime experiences the army and marines have number of equipmentrelated ch allenges to rectify which may require significant funding nd management efforts historical persp ective on equipment equipping army and marine units s been longstanding concern of congress that has taken on added importance as weapons and equipment have become exponentially more sophisticated and expensive with few exceptions almost all army and marine corps units ve historically faced equipment shortages in these cases units either made do with

equipment than th eir active duty counterparts and much of this equipment tended to be older models protracted conflicts like afghanis tan and iraq serve the purpose of identifying what equipment works nd what equipment does not as well as identifying requirements for new equipment in the later case the wars in iraq and afghanistan have genera ted requirements for new equipment such as mine resistant ambushproof mra p vehicles protracted conflicts also dramatically increase equipment operational usage rates resulting in reduced useful life and increasing repair and replacement requirements equipping the force there are number of dimensions to equipping army and marine corps units that are examined in the following sections equipping units might appear to be relatively straight forward exercise but there are variety of factors involved funding is perhaps the foremost issue as funding is often limited requiring the services often to make tradeoffs between equipment needed to sustain operations and equipment for reorganization or modern ization efforts another issue is that even if funds are readily available th equipment might not be army officials maintain that for some systems it can ta ke up to three years after receiving funding before they can be fielded to units3 equipping units to their authorized levels prior to units being deployed on operations the army and marine corps typically attempt to bring these units up to their authorized levels of both personnel and equipment in terms of equipping forces there are number of op tions available the first option is to requisition the needed equipment through each services respective supply chain but this option may not be practical if units equipment needs are significant or if the unit does not have great deal of time before it deploys other options for equipping units include crossleveling and drawing quipment intheater when unit deploys these other two options will be discussed in greater detail in following sections equipping units above authorized levels both the army and marines are providing their units with additiona l equipment over and above their peacetime authorized levels which is placing sign ificant equipment demands on both services4 the army maintains that its brigade combat teams bcts are operating over much wider geographical area than they were desi gned for and

of equipment in theater primarily to conserve strategi c transportation assets and reduce costs but also to ensure that units are adequately equipped when deployed this initiative called theater

armored vehicles individual soldier body armor and equipment used to counter imp rovised explosive devices the marines have also directed that equipment needed for oef and oif be left in theater as previously noted because mission requirements require add itional equipment beyond units peacetime equipment allowance the marines have developed expanded equipment packages in theater for deploying units both services have also set aside pools of equipment to rapidly replace equipment damaged and destro yed during operations the army refers to this pool of equipment as theater sustainment stoc

press release house armed services committee approves fiscal year 2008 defense authorization billmay 9 2007 p 7 to train units and could slow the nationa l guards domestic response to disasters or terrorist incidents45 recent reports suggest that national guard soldiers training for deployment to iraq and afghanistan are not able to train with the same rifles hmmwvs night vision and other types of equipment that these soldiers will be issued when they arrive in theater which has raised questions as to how well these units will be able to function in combat when they are provided equipment that they are not familiar with46 the army has reportedly pl edged to spend 21 billion over the next four years to reequip the nationa l guard but some are concerned that this equipment will instead be deployed to iraq to support the surge instead of being used to reequip depleted national guard units at home as they prepare to support domestic missions and train for overseas deployments47 given these concerns congress might decide to examine dods and the armys plans to reequip national guard its such an examination could focus on how units will be reequipped to deal with domestic res ponsibilities and also how these units will be provided with the sa equipment that they will receive upon deployment for homestation training in the united states this examination might also examine how dod and the army plan to bring the reserves aggregate equipment level from about the current 40 vel to at least the 80 level that guard and reserve leadership have called an acceptable level to meet both domestic and overseas requirements48 the state of prepositioned stocks49 some in congress have expressed alarm in both the extended duration of time that dod has allocated to recons titute prepos itioned stocks as well as lack of comprehensive plan to reconstitute these st rategic assets in its version of the fy2008 national defense authoriz ation act hr 1585 the house armed services committee requires dod to submit an annual report on the status of us prepositioned stocks including funding requirements inte nded future strategic use of these stocks and strategic risk mitigation plan if these stocks are used before fully replenished there are other potential cons iderations related to preposition stocks that congress might decide to review will the army and marines reconstitute preposition stocks with equipment such as armored security vehicles asvs mraps and other specialized equipment developed in response to wartime needs or will the services instead replenish prepositioned stocks to prewar authorization standards another consideration is the r eadiness status of equipment being used forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33757crs14 50 information in this

the equipment being used in dods current restocking efforts is in poor c ondition and requires extensive maintenance how many mraps does dod intend to procure on november 30 2007 the marines redu ced their mrap requirement from 3700 to approximately 2300 vehicles50 the marines cited six factors in their decision ied attacks were dramatically down over the preceding six months the relatively heavy mrap cannot operate or pursue the enemy off road in confined areas or across most bridges reduced need to put marines on hi ghthreat roads through the use of persistent surveillan ce and airlift of supplies counterinsurgency focus require s marines dismount and interact closely with the local populace mraps associated with surge forces were longer needed mrap sustainment numbers were lower due to fewer than expected combat losses the marines reduction in its mrap requirement fro m 3700 to 2300 was anticipated to result in potential cost savings of approximately 17 billion in fy2008 and fy2009 the army is also expected to cut number of mraps from its current 10000 vehicle requirement but has not yet publically committed to specific requirement51 the army also cited decreasing casualties and ied attacks over the previous sixmonths as well as the need to dismount nd interact with the populace as factors in reducing its original mrap requirement while decreasing mrap requirements based on the improving tactical situation in iraq and in anticipation of reduction in troop levels can be considered prudent management by dod at some point dod w ill need to establish firm requirement for the total number of mraps to be procuredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33757crs15 replacement for m16m4 carbines allegations that the successor of the armys m16m4 carbine the heckler kochs xm8 assault rifle was cancelled due to bureaucratic conflicts among army and dod acquisition officials might be an issue for congressional examination some may question why the army remains committed to upgrading an almost 50 yearold weapon when other dod organizati ons such as special operations units have adopted other weapons that are c onsidered more reliable and effective in combat than the m4 carbine it can be argued that the army has exhibited tendency to pursue incremental improvements to legacy systems such as repeated addon armor upgrades to hmmwvs inst ead of fully examining and rapidly procuring commerciallyavailable systems that prove to be more effective than current systems
