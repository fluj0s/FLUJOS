c ohesion may be challenged by socialist demands for increases in pe nsions and other social programs relations with the european union and nato in hopes of boosting the ds and other pr oeuropean parties in the may 11 2008 elections the european union signed stabilization and association agreement saa with serbia on april 29 2008 the agreement would grant trade concessions to serbia it would also provide framework for enha nced cooperation between the eu and serbia in variety of fields including help in rmonizing local laws with eu standards with the perspective of eu membership serbias new government plans to submit the saa for ratification by the parliament and then move forward quickly with its implementation it hopes to gain eu member candidate stat us in late 2008 or early 2009 an ambitious if perhaps unrealistic goal at the insistence of the netherlands and belgium the implementation of provisions of the saa will not start until all eu countries agree that serbia is cooperating with the international criminal tribunal for the fo rmer yugoslavia icty serbia made substantial progress in this regard when it detained indicted war criminal radovan karadzic on july 21 2008 karadzic is expect ed to be transferred to the icty in late july or early august however it is unclear whether the netherlands and belgium will now permit early implementation of some provisions of the saa or whether fellow indictee ratko mladics transfer will be required as well ties between most eu countries and serb ia have been strained over kosovo at least 20 of the 27 eu countries have recogniz ed kosovo including key countries such as britain france germany and italy few eu countries including greece cyprus slovakia romania and spain have declined to recognize kosovos independencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22601crs4 these countries are either tr aditional allies of serbia or have minority populations for whom they fear kosovo independence could t an unfortunate precedent or both serbia has recalled its amba ssadors from countries recognizing kosovo prime minister cvetkovic has vowed to take ll legal and diplomatic meas ures to preserve kosovo as part of serbia however the new g overnment has announced that it will send its ambassadors back to eu countries that reco gnized kosovos independence reversing the previous governments actions and signaling that it does not want to isolate serbia while continuing to oppose kosovos independence serbia has opposed the deployment to kos ovo of eulex an euled lawandorder mission that will monitor advise and if necessary overrule the actions of kosovo authorities eu leaders appear to hope that the election of proeu government in belgrade will lead to improved cooperation in kosovo between serbia and the eu but this remains to be seen it may be difficult for serbia to square its desire to join the eu with rejection and even obs truction of key eu mission nato in december 2006 serbia joined natos partnership for peace pfp program pfp is aimed at helping countries come closer to nato standards and at promoting their cooperation with nato pfp membership is prerequisite if country wishes to join nato in the future serbia s new government s pledged to enhance cooperation with nato th rough the pfp program there is lack of consensus in serbia on whether the country should seek nato membership president boris tadic and his ruling democratic party have favored joining nato the socialists also part of th government have opposed nato membership as have the opposition dss and radicals due in part to mories of natos 1999 bombing of serbia public opini on polls have shown that onl about onequarter of the serbian public favor nato mbership at its april 2008 bucharest summit nato said it would consider granting serbia an intensified dialogue with the alliance if belgrade requests one if rbia requests and receives an intensified dialogue it could eventually be followed by membership action plan which would lay out in detail what steps serbia would need to take to beco serious candidate for nato membership us policy serbia has played key role in us policy toward the balkans since the collapse of the former yugoslavia in 1991 us official s came to see the milosevic regime as key factor behind the wars in the region in the 1990s and pushed successfully for economic sanctions against serbia on the other hand the united states drew milosevic into the negotiations that ended the war in bosnia in 1995 the united states bombed serbia in 1999 to force belgrade to relinquish control of kosovo where serbian forces had committed atrocities while attempting to suppress revolt by ethnic albanian guerrillas us officials hailed the success of serbian democrats in defeating the milosevic regime in elections in 2000 and 2001 the united stat has seen democr atic and prosperous serbia at peace with its neig hbors and integrated into euroatlantic institutions as an important

security assistance for serbia as well as joint military exercises and other militaryt omilitary contacts in 2005 the administration granted dutyfree treatment to some products from serbia under the generalized system of preferences gsp however there remain difficult issues in usserbian relations one is serbias failure to fully cooperate with the icty since fy2001 congress has conditioned part of us aid to serbia after certain date of the year on presidential certification that serbia has met seve ral conditions the most important be ing that it is cooperating with the icty the certification process typically affects only modest portion of the amount allocated for any given year due to the fact that the deadline for compliance is set for date in the spring of the fiscal year and that humanitarian and democratization aid are exempted us officials hailed the arrest of indicted war crimin radovan karadzic on july 21 2008 former bosnian serb army ch ief ratko mladic and another serb goran hadzic are the only two remain ing icty indictees at large4 the most serious cloud over u sserbian relations is th problem of kosovo the united states recognized kosovos i ndependence on februa
