indicated that taxcut legislation will be high priority on the legislative agenda for the 106 congress consideration of suchth legislation is subject to two different sets of budget enforcement procedures first under the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended the house and senate are required to adopt an annual budget resolution budget resolution policies ar enforced by points of order when individual spending and revenue measures ar considered the house and senate may use various means to waive or set aside these points of order if the budge t resolution adopted in 1999 does not recommend tax cut the n revenue legislat ion implementing such policy generally would be subject to point of order in the senate it would require 60 votes to waive such point of order in addition the senate has augmented its procedures with special payasyougo point of order that requires revenue and direct spending legislation to be defici t neutral over 10 years such point of order also would require 60 votes to b waived the budget resolution may include opt ional reconciliation instructions directing among other things that the house ways and means and senate financ committees develop taxcut legislation reconciliation leg islation is considered under expedited procedures in the house and senate any taxcut legislation considered in the senate outside of the reconciliat ion process is subject to filibuster and 60 votes would be needed to invoke cloture the seco nd set of enforcement procedures was established under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended under the 198 5 act taxcut legislation as well as any other legislation affecting revenues or direc t spending is subject to payasyougo paygo requirement the net effect of all such legislation enacted during session as recorded on paygo scorecard may not re duce the surplus or increase the deficit or else sequester woul d automatically occur reducing nonexempt direct spending programs by amount s sufficient to eliminate the violation in order to pass significant taxcut legislation in the 106 congress withou tth incurring paygo violation unde r current procedures any revenue loss beyond the existing credits on the paygo scorecard would have to be offset by other revenue increases reductions in direct spending or combination of the two tw alternatives to this app roach include 1 by means of other legislation changing the budget enforcement rules or eliminating them altogether and 2 using directe d scorekeeping provision in the taxcut leg islation to instruct the director of the office of manage ment and budget not to record the revenue losses on the payg scorecard such provision however could require waiver of the prohibition i n section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act against certain legislatio n changing the budget process in the senate the waiver would require 60 voteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009contents background 1 revenues and revenue legislation

involve businesslike or marketoriented activities or payments from one federal account to anothertaxcut legislation applicable budget enforcement procedures background the house and senate considered si gnificant taxcut legislation during the 105th congress but adjourned with unfinished business in this area in 1997 the two houses passed the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 1053 4 august 5 1997 111 stat 788 1103 in response to budget resolution policy calling for an 85 billion tax cut over fy19982002 in 1998 disagreements between president clinton and congress and between the house and senate over the appropriateness of tax cut and its size coupled with the f ailure to adopt budget resolution for fy1999 stymied action on taxcut legislation on september 26 the house passed the taxpayer relief act of 1998 hr 4579 measure containing fiveyear tax cut amounting to about 80 billion but the senate took action on it before the 105 congress adjourned th instead scaleddown package of tax changes was included in the omnibu s consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 october 21 1998 the house and senate leadership have indicated that taxcut legislation will be high pri ority on the legislative agenda for the 106 congress the purpose of thisth report is to assess briefly the procedural context for action on such legislation revenues and revenue legislation most of the revenues of the federa l government arise automatically each year under permanent law revenues also called receipts are income derived principally from the governments exercise of its sovereign powers they consist main ly of individual and corporate income taxes and social insuran ce taxes such as the social security payroll tax in addition revenues include excis taxes customs duties and tariffs certain fines fees and user charges gifts and donations and certain other income1 although the majority of revenue laws are permanent each congress typically considers many different measures affecting revenues the purposes behind thes measures may range from routine extensions of expiring provisions and mino r technical modifications in current law to major policy changes i nvolving redistribution of the tax burden while most revenue legislation considered during session s modest or even negligible effects on the federal budget the house and senat usually consider at l east one or two measures that have significant revenue impacthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009crs2 measures with significant revenue impact usually involve changes in income social insurance or excise taxes rather than changes in fees tariffs and other forms of income some measures ch as the economic recovery tax act of 1981 make deep tax cuts others such as the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 provide large tax increases an d still others such as the tax reform act of 1986 are intended to be revenueneutral over multiyear period but may change revenue s markedly in any given year jurisdiction and procedure in the ho use jurisdiction over revenue matters generally and other specific revenue matters is vested in the ways and mean s committee by clause 1s of rule x similarly in the senate paragraph 1i of rule xxv assigns jurisdiction over revenue matters generally and other specifi c revenue matters to the finance committee both committees also have jurisdiction over considerable portion of direct spending ie spending that is controlled outside of the annual appropriations process which includes such programs as socia l security and medicare revenue measures often are constrained in their sco pe solely to revenue matters such measures may range from the imp osition or waiver of single tariff to extensive changes in the internal revenue code sometimes omnibus measures dealing with direct spending programs may include one or more revenue titles along with title s containing di rect spending and other legislative provisions for example legislation pertaining to social security or medicare may contain provisions dealing with payroll taxes and other revenue features pertinent to the program as well as provision s dealing with the programs eligibility criteria and benefit pay ments in some instances such as for highway and aviation spending the ways and means committee an d finance committee develop the re venue portion ie excise taxes of the legislation while other house and senat committees develop the spending portion during the 1980s and 1990s the ways and means committee and the finance committee also have developed revenue r econciliation bills in response to reconciliation directives in the annual budget resolution the constitution in article i section 7 requires that revenue measure s originate in the house by custom the annual appropriations acts originate in the house as well in the house the jurisdictio n of the ways and means committee as well as the prerogative of the house to originate revenue measures is protected by rule xxi clause 5b of the rule effectively bars other house committees from reportin g legislation containing any tax or tariff measure and prohibits such amendments from being offered to other committees legislation similarly the clause bars hous consideration of revenue provisions added by the senate to housepassed measure not reported by the ways and means committee th senate has comparable rule specifically to protect the finance committees jurisdiction but its jurisdiction i s protected in the same manner as the jurisdictions of the other committees unde r senate rules and practices generally in addition the house changed rule xxi in the 104 congress to require ath threefifths vote to pass legislation containing an increase in federal income tax rates and to bar retroactive increases in federal income tax rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009crs3 framework for budgetary enforcement two separate sets of enforcement procedures have bearing on th consideration of taxcut legislation first the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended established points of order t hat can be raised against legislation in violation of budget resolution policies second the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 th budget enforcement act of 1997 and other laws established the sequestratio n process to enforce discretionary spending limits and payasyougo requirement sequestration involves automatic acrosstheboard reductions in spending if certain budgetary goals are not met enforce ment under the 1974 congressional budget act applies to individua l measures as they are considered by the house and senate the 1985 balance d budget act is enforced by the executive in strict conformance with statutor requirements at the end of session after congressional action has ceased on th basis of the net effect of all enacted legislation neither set of enforcement procedures is absolutely binding the house an d senate sometimes waive provisions of the 1974 act during the consideration f legislation on few occa sions congress and the president have enacted legislation suspending canceling or modifying sequester that had taken effect there have been sequesters in recent years congressional budget process the congressiona l budget process entails consideration each year by the house and senate of budget res olution that establishes congressional budget policies over multiyear period covering five or more fiscal years the budget resolutio n focuses on budget policies at an aggregate level specific program decisions are left to the committees with jurisdiction over revenue and spending programs in som years the house and sena use an optional reconciliation process to implement key budget resolution policies congre ssional budget resolution under established budget resolutio n practices any significant taxcut policy should be reflected in the regular annua l budget resolution considered by the house and senate if procedural difficulties ar to be avoided as required by section 301a of the 1974 act the taxcut polic would be reflected in the budget resolution primarily in 1 the aggregate revenue levels and 2 the amounts by w hich the aggregate revenue levels should be changed in this case reduced the aggregate revenue levels fo r the first fiscal year and the sum of all the fiscal years covered by the budget resolution are enforced by point of order in sectio n 311a of t he 1974 act under this approach the aggregate revenue levels for these two time periods serve as floors any legislation that would cause the estimate d levels of total revenues to fall below the floors would be subject to point of orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009crs4 this waiver as well as simil ar senate waivers requires the affirmative vote of three2 fifths of the members duly chosen and sworn ie 60 of the 100 senators in instance s when some senate seats are vacant the required number of votes for waiver could be less than 60 the point of order would not apply if declaration of war was in effect3 in its current form the senate rule is section 202 of the fy1996 budget resolutio n4 hconres 67 104 congress 109 stat 10191021thfailure to provide for tax cut in the initial budget resolution generally would make legislation providing such tax cut subject to point of order in the senate it would require 60 votes to waive such point of order aside from waiving th e2 point of order the only way to avoid it wou ld be to adopt second budget resolution reflecting taxcut policy during the early 1980s however congress abandoned3 the practice of adopting more than one budget resolution in ye ar due to the difficulty of doing so several years ago the senate adopted payasyougo rule as part of budget resolution to augment statutory procedures discussed below applicable to direct spending and revenue legislation the rule requires that direct spending and4 revenue legislation be deficit neutral but it differs from the statutory requirement in two respects first the test of deficit neutrality applies solely to the measure under consideration at the time not to the net effect of all legislation enacted during th session s econd the rule covers longer time framenot just to the first year and the sum of the five years covered by the budget resolution but to an additional five years as well the senates 10year payasyougo rule remains in effect through fy2002 unless the senate choose s to extend it in order to waive the rule 60 votes are required reconciliation legislation beginning in 1980 the house and senate hav regularl used the reconciliation process to enact major components of budge t resolution policy reconciliatio n is an optional process authorized by section 310 of the 1974 act under which legislation implementing budget resolution policies i s considered in an expedited fashion with significant time limitations and restrictions on amendments reconc iliation involves two separate steps in the first step reconciliatio n directives are included in the budget resolution in the case of tax cuts for example reconciliation directives could instruct the house ways and means committee an d the senate finance committee to reduce revenues by specified amounts over th period covered by the budget resolution in the second step the instructed committees submit legislative recommendations to their respective budget committees the budget committees then combine the legislative recommendations usually in single omnibus bill without an substantive revision th reported reconciliation bill usually is modified significantly during initial floor action and subsequent conference proceedingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009crs5 see page 81 of the conference report hrept 104612 june 7 19965 for more information on the rule see the senates byrd rule against extraneous6 matter in reconciliation measures by robert keith crs report 97688 gov update d september 9 1998 30 pagesin some cases the house and senate have pursued revenue changes unde r reconciliation separately from spending changes choosing not to incorporate bot h types of chang into single omnibus bill for example in the 1982 reconciliation process revenue changes were included in the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 while spending changes were included in the omnibu s budget reconciliation act of 1982 pl 97253 similarly the 1997 reconciliation process led to the enactment of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 as well as the taxpayer relief act of 1997 reconciliation directives may even provide for the possibility of action on more than one reconciliation bill containing significant revenue provisions in 1996 fo r example the reconciliation directives in the budget resolution for fy199 7 hcon res 178 104 congress anticipated the possibility of three separat eth reconciliation bills section 201a which pertained to reconciliation directives t house committees identified separate submissions for 1 welfare and medicai d reform and tax relief 2 medicare preservation and 3 tax an d miscellaneous direct spending reforms the threestage interdependen t reconciliation procedure was intended to allow for consideration of taxcut bill in concert with reconciliation bills achieving savings in dicare medicaid welfare and other direct spending programs as the joint explanatory st atement accompanying the conference report on hconres 178 indicated the house conferees note that the mult ireconciliation process provides maximum flexibility to achieve the changes in spending and the tax relief assumed in thi s conference report for exampl any of the spending or revenue changes assumed in the first bill couldif not enacte dbe achieved in the third bill moreover the reconciliatio n committees are permitted to exceed the savings assumed in each of the reconciliation bills nevertheless the process still requires reconcile d commit tees ultimately to meet their targets whether incrementally through th separate reconciliation bills or solely through the third bill5 one option available under this approach was to consider ta xcut legislation after the cuts had been paid for by the enactment of spending reductions in the senate the byrd rule section 313 of the 1974 congressional budget act bars the inclusi on of extraneous matter in reconciliation measures legislation6 providing tax cut for the years covered by the budget resolution is accommodated by the byrd rule so long as the estimated revenue effects of the legislation ar consistent with the amounts of the reconciliation directives but tax cuts extending beyond this period would be considered extraneous under section 313b1e in most ma jor tax bills revenue changes generally are permanent in nature accordingly this portion of the byrd rule potentially threatens major taxcu t legislation in the senate unless it is circumvented in some f ashion waivers of the byrdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009crs6 see the remar ks of senator domenici in the congressional record of may 21 19977 at page s4873 the paygo procedures remain in effect for four additional years through fy20068 to deal with the outyear effects of legislation considered through fy2002 the paygo procedures exclude the offbudget social security trust funds and the9 postal service fund although the total federal budget incurred surplus in fy1998 70 billion for the first time in 29 years and surpluses in the total federal budget are projected well into the future the onbudget portion of the federal budget remains in deficit som argue that the paygo procedures would cease to apply if the onbudget portion of the federal budget moved to surplus social security spending interest on the public debt and certain other mandator y10 spending is not considered to be direct spending for these purposesrule require 60 votes with regard to consideration of the taxpayer relief act f 1997 the senate considered the bill under unanimous consent agreement tha t required the taxcut effects of the bill to be considered in conjunction with the direct spending savings of the other reconciliation bill the savings in the othe r7 reconciliation bill the balanced budget act of 1997 were rgely permanent in nature too and of fset the tax cuts therefore point of order under the byrd rule wa s avoided major revenue legislation also has been enacted since 1980 outside of th reconciliation process for example the social security amendments of 1983 intended to raise revenue and the tax reform act of 1986 intended to be defici t neutral over multiyear period were not reconciliation bills any taxcut legislation considered in the senat outside of the reconciliation process however is subject to filibuster and 60 votes would be needed to invoke cloture payasyougo procedures section 252 of the 1985 balanced budget act as amended imposes payas yougo paygo requirement on reve nue and direct spending legislation considered through fy2002 when paygo legislation is enacted its effects on the deficit or8 surplus are registered by the director of the office of management and budge t omb on multiyear paygo scorecard under the paygo process revenues and direct spending for fiscal year from new laws when combined with the balance on the paygo scorecard for that year from prior laws must not result in ne t increase in the deficit or net reduction in the surplus revenue reductions or direct9 spending increases are allowed so long as they are offset by the carryover balances or other new paygo laws violations of the paygo requirement as determined in sequestration report prepared by the omb director trigger paygo sequester at the end of congressional session under ch sequester automatic reductions would be made in direct spending programs sufficient to eliminate any estimated net increase in the deficit or net reduction in the surplus although all direct spending is taken int account in determining whether paygo sequester is necessary only smal l10 subset of direct spending programs would be subject to the required spendin ghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009crs7 reductions reductions for the largest direct spending program subject to paygo sequester medicare are limited to four percent by the 1985 act in addition to controlling revenue and direct spending legislation throug h paygo procedures the 1985 act also ts statutory limits on discretionary spending ie spending controlled through the annual appropriations process th enforcement procedures for the paygo requirement on the one hand and th discretionary spending limits on the other are separated by firewall saving s made on one side of the fire wall cannot be used to the advantage of programs on the other side for example the cost of taxcut legislation could not be offset b reductions in annual appropriations acts in order to avoid paygo sequester at the beginning of each session the president issues as part of his annua l budget submission preliminary sequestration reports covering both the payg requirement and the discretionary spending limits these reports provide an earl warning regarding the possibility of sequesters at the end of the session and th potential magnitude of any actions that ght be necessary to avoid them an update report is required to be issued in august and the final report is required to be issued within 15 days after congress adjourns the most currently available information obtained from the omb fina l sequestration report for fy1999 shows paygo credit of about 3 billion fo r fy2000 with smaller credits for each of the following years consequently th current paygo scorecard would allow taxcut legislation or legislation increasing direct spending to be enacted without triggering sequester but such legislatio n would have to be quite modest in its impact in order to pass significant taxcut legislation in the 106 congress withou tth incurring paygo violation unde r current procedures any revenue loss beyond the existing credits on the paygo scorecard would have to be offset by other revenue increases reductions in direct spending or combination of the two as an alternative to this approach some members favor changing the budge t enforcement rules so that reductions in disc retionary spending could be used to offset revenue losses from tax cut or eliminating the paygo requirement altogether so long as surpluses are projected finally the house and senate could avail themselves of the approach used by the house in the taxpayer relief act of 1998 hr 4579 section 607 of the bill s passed by the house on september 26 1998 simply instructed the omb directo r not to make any estimates of changes in receipts on the p aygo scorecard from the enactment of hr 4579 under section 607 d the measure been enacted into law the tax cuts would have taken effect and paygo sequester would have occurred any legislation that directly or indirectly changes the budget process i s prohibited by section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act unless it wa s reported by the house or senate budget committee as appropriate or unless th committee was discharged from further consideration this prohibition therefore needed to be waived so that the house could consider the directed scorekeeping provision in section 607 of hr 4579 the house did so by adopting special rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009crs8 hres 552 that waived all points of order against consideration of the bill in the senate 60 votes are required to waive points of order under section 306
