caibs findings about th tragedy and recommendations on the future of the shuttle program all quotations ar from the caib report unless otherwise notedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21606crs2 1 the space transportation system ststhe space shuttleconsists of an airplanelike orbiter two solid rocket boosters srbs on eith er side and large cylindrical external tank that holds cryogenic fuel for the orbiters main engines the srbs detach from the orbiter 2 Â½ minutes after launch when their fuel is spen t fall into the ocean and are recovered for refurbishment and reuse the external tank is not reused it is jettisoned as the orbiter reaches earth orbit and disintegrates as it falls into the indian oceanwhat caused the columbia accident the board recognized early on that the accident was probably not an anomalous random event but rather likely rooted to some degree in nasas history and the human space flight programs culture p 9 therefore it also looked at political nd budgetary cons iderations compromises and changing priorities over the life of the shuttle program and places as much weight on these causal factors as on the physical cause p 9 the physical cause was damage to columbia s left wing by 17 pound pi ece of insulating foam that detached from the left bipod ramp that connects the external tank1 to the orbiter and struck the orbiters left wing 819 seconds after launch the foam strike created hole in reinforced car boncarbon rcc panel on the leading edge of the wing allowing superheat ed air perhaps exceeding 5000of to enter the wing during reentry the extreme heat caused the wing to fail structurally creating aerodynamic forces that led to the disintegration of the orbiter described in detail in chapters 2 and 3 regarding organizational causes the board concluded the accident was rooted in the space shuttle program s history and culture including the original compromises that were required to gain approval for the shuttle subsequent years of resource constraints fluctuating priorities schedule pressures mischaracterization of the shuttle as operational rather than developmental and lack of an agreed national vision for human space flight cultural traits and organizational practices detrimental to safety were allowed to develop including reliance on past succe ss as substitute for sound engineering practices organizational barriers that prevented effective communication of critical safety information and stifled professional differences of opinion lack of integrated management across prog ram elements and the evolution of an informal chain of command and decisionma king processes that operated outside the organizations rules p 9 the board found that there is broken safety culture at nasa pp 184189 schedule pressure pp 131139 related to construction of the inte rnational space station budget constraints pp 102105 and workforce reductions pp 106110 also were factors the board concluded that the shuttle program has operated in challenging and often turbulent environment p 118 it is to the credit of space shuttle managers and the shuttle workforce that the vehicle was able to achieve its program objectives for as long as it did p 119 should the shuttle continue to fly the board concluded that the present shuttle is not inherently unsafe but the observations and recommendations in this report are needed to make the vehicle safe enough to operate in the coming years p 208 caib supports return to flight for the space shu ttle at the earliest date consistent with anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21606crs3 overriding consideration safe ty p 208 nasa has target of marchapril 2004 for return to flight and adm gehman stated in an interview on pbs the newshour with jim lehrer on august 26 that he saw reas on why nasa could not meet that schedule the caib report contains 29 recommendati ons listed below23 technical and six organizationalof which 15 must be implemented before the shuttle returns to flight status the others are continuing to fly recommendations assuming the shuttle will be used for years to come the board recommended that if the shuttle is to be used beyond 2010 that it be recertified p 209 but the board said it reached an inescapable conclusion because of the risks inherent in the original design of the space shuttle because the design was based in many aspects on now obsolete technologies and because the shuttle is now an aging system but still d evelopmental in character it is in the nations interest to replace the shuttle as soon as possible as the primary means for transporting humans to and from earth orbit p 210211 emphasis in original why did nasa decide not to obtain imagery from dod satellites to assess the damage central question during the investigation was why nasa did not ask the department of fense dod to image the shu ttle with its high resolution ground or spacebased systems to help assess whether the orb iter had been damaged by the foam the board found pp 140172 that thr ee requests for imagery were made by nasa engineers but through incorrect channe ls plus there were several missed opportunitieswhen managers coul d have pursued the issue one request did reach the appropriate dod personnel but nasa canceled th request 90 minutes later the board concluded that the likely sequence of even ts was that the chair of sts107s mission management team mmt after informally learning that there had been request for imagery called three other mmt members and determined that none knew of requirement for imagery caib cited flawed analysis of the extent to which the orbiter might have been damaged by the foam that was too readily accepted by program managers low level of concern by program managers lack of clear co mmunication lack of effective leadership and failure of the role of safety personnel as reasons why the imagery was not obtained whether such images would in fact have shown the damage remains unclear but the board recommended that such images now be taken on all shuttle missions could the crew have been saved the board concluded that the crew died from blunt trauma and hypoxia lack of oxygen after the crew cabin separated from the rest of the disintegrating shuttle and itself disintegrated there was explosion p 77 the board asked nasa to evaluate two options for returning the crew safely if the degree of damage had been understood early in the mission repairing the damage onorbit or rescuing the crew with anot her shuttle mission the repa ir option while logistically viablerelied on so many uncer tainties that nasa rated this option high risk p 173 the rescue option was considered challenging but feasible p 174 what are the echoes of challenger former shuttle astronaut sally ride served on the rogers commission that investigated the january 1986 challenger accident which claimed the lives of seven as tronauts and on caib during the columbia investigation she said she heard echoes of challenger as it became clear that the accident resulted from nasa failing to recognize that technical failu re bipod ramp foam shedding that had occurred on previous s huttle flights could have safetyofflight implications even if the earlier missions were completed successfully in the case ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21606crs4 challenger it was erosion of seals orings between segments of the solid rocket booster which had been noted on previous missions some engineers warned nasa not to launch challenger that day because unusually cold weather could have weakened the resiliency of the orings they were overru led caib concluded th at both accidents were failures of foresight and the parallels between them demonstrate that the causes of the institutional failure responsible for challenger have not been fixed if these persistent systemic flaws are not resolved the scene is set for another accident and that while individuals must be accountab for their actions nasa s problems cannot be solved simply by retirements resignations or transferring personnel p 195 caibs recommendations and observations caibs 29 recommendations are compiled in chapter 11 of its report adm gehman stated at the boards august 26 press conference that there is hierarchy in the recommendationsall have equal weight the board so made 27 observations in chapter 10 following are abbreviated vers ions of the recommendationsseparated into those that must be implemented prior to return to flight and those that are continuing to fly recommendationsand observations some have been combined for brevity return to flight rtf recommendations caib recommends that nasa initiate an aggressive program to eliminate all external tank foam shedding initiate program to increase the orbiters ability to sustain minor debris damage develop and implement comprehensive inspection plan to assess the structural integrity of the rcc panels supporting structure and attaching hardware develop practical capability to inspect and effect emergency repairs to the orbiters thermal protection system tps both when near the international space station and when operating away from it and accomplish an onorbit tps inspection upgrade the ability to image the shuttle during its ascent to orbit obtain and downlink high resolution images of the external tank after it separates from the orbiter and of certain orbiter thermal protection systems ensure that onorbit imaging of each shuttle flight by department of defense satellites is standard requirement test and qualify bolt catchers used on the shuttle require that at least two employees ttend final closeouts nd intertank area hand spraying procedures when applying foam to the external tank require nasa and its contractors to use th industrystandard

implement an agencywide strategy for leadership and management training that provides more consistent and integrated approach to career development general deals supplemental views air force brig gen duane deal caib member wrote supplement that is scheduled to be published in volume ii as appendix d some of the views in the supplement were reported by the media on au gust 27 caib supp lied copy of the document to crs emphasizing that it repres ents supplemental not dissenting views gen deal expressed concern that nasa may not fully implement the caibs recommendations and particular ly its observations history shows that nasa often ignores strong recommendations without cultu re change it is overly optimistic to believe nasa will tackle something relegated to an observation when it has record of ignoring recommendations he said the supplemen t is written from the perspective of someone who fears the caib report has bypassed some items that could prevent the next accident from occurringthe next oring or the next bipod ramp he believes the observations should have been characterized as strong signals that are indications of present and future problems rather than weak signals that could indicate future problems among the areas he listed as needing further attention are quality assurance unresponsive management staffing levels grade levels inspector qualifications
