3773 and the house amendment to the senate amendment to hr 3773 include amendments to the foreign intelligence surveillance act the house amendment differs in number of ways from the senatepassed version of the bill for ex ample the senate amendment to hr 3773 provides in new section 701 of fisa that nothing in the definition of electronic surveillance under subsection 101f of fisa 50 usc 1801f shall be construed to encompass surveillance that is targeted in accordance with proposed title vii of the foreign intelligence surv eillance act fisa at person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states the house has parallel provision in its bill the two bills differ in their treatment of the role of the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc with respect to procedures for acquisitions for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information of the contents of communications of us persons and nonus persons cated outside the united states in the absence of an emergency aut horization the house amendment requires prior approval by the fisc of the app licable targeting procedures minimization procedures and certification before the attorney general and the director of national intelligence dni may authorize acquisition of the contents of communications of nonus persons reasona bly believed to be located outside the united states the fisc would have 30 days after certification is submitted to review the certification and the targeting and minimization procedures and to approve or deny an order regarding such an acquisition the house b ill also requires the attorney general in cons ultation with the dni to adopt guidelines to ensure compliance with limitations imposed by the bill on such acquisitions and to ensure that an application is filed under section 104 or 303 of fisa if required by that act the guidelines are to be submitted to the fisc the congressional intelligence committees and the house and senate judiciary committees under the house bill if the fisc finds that the certification satisfies statutory requirements and targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with statutory standards and constitutional requirements under the fourth amendment the fisc is to approve the certification and use of the procedures for the acquisition in non emergency situation if the fisc finds that certification or applicable procedures fall short of these requirements the c ourt would deny the order identify any deficiency in the certification or the pro cedures and provide the government with anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34533crs5 opportunity to correct such deficiency if the attorney general and the dni determine that an emergency situation exists that immediate action by the government is required and that time does not permit the completion of judicial review prior to the initiation of an acquis ition they may authorize the acquisition and submit certification to the fisc as soon as possible but in event more than seven days after the determination is made in the context of an emergency authorization the fisc would enter an order directing th government at the governments election and to the extent required by the fiscs or der to correct any deficiency within 30 days or cease the acquisition in contrast the senate bill does not require prior approval by the fisc of applicable certifications targeting pr ocedures and minimization procedures in connection with the acquisition of communi cations of nonus persons abroad nor does it require adoption and submission of co mpliance guidelines rather the senate bill requires submission of certification or targeting or minimization procedure or an amendment thereto to the fisc within five days of making or amending the certification or adopting or amending the procedure where the attorney general and the dni determine that immediate action is required and time does not permit preparation of certification prior to in itiation of an acquis ition the senate bill requires the attorney general and the dni to prepare the certification including such determination within seven days after the determination is made if the fisc finds that certification meets statutory re quirements and targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with statutory requirements and meet constitutional standards under the fourth amendment th fisc would enter an order approving continued use of the procedures involved if the court finds that the required standards are not met then the fisc woul d enter an order directing the government at the governments election and to the exte nt required by the fisc order to correct any deficiencies within 30 da ys or cease the acquisition the house provides that nothing in its bill is to be construed to require an application under sec tion 104 of fisa for an acqui sition that is targeted in accordance with new section 703 of fisa at nonus person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states the senate bill has similar language both bills provide for targeting of us persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states for up to 90 days pursuant to fisc order if statutory criteria are met such an or der could be renewed for additional 90 day periods upon submission of renewa l applications meeting the same standards in the case of an emergency authorization by th attorney general of an acquisition each bill requires notice to fisc judge by the attorney general or his designee at the time the decision is made to conduct such an acquisition and requires the filing of an application for fisc order within ven days of the attorney generals authorization of the emergency acquis ition applicable minimization procedures would apply to such an acquisition in th absence of judici order approving an acquisition originally authorized by the ttorney general on an emergency basis the acquisition would terminate when the in formation sought is

the exclusivity of fisa as means of engaging in electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information the h ouse amendment would add new section to fisa providing that the pro cedures of

amendment to this act or chapters 119 121 or 206 of title 18 united states c ode the senate amendmen t to hr 3773 would add new section fisa providing that the procedures of chapters 119 121 and 206

somewhat both bills would also permit federal officers who engage in electronic surveillance or physical searches to obtain foreign intelligence information to consult with federal state or local law enforcement pers onnel to coordinate to investigate against international prolif eration of weapons of mass destruction while both the house and the senate provide prospective limitations of liability for those who furnish aid to the gove rnment in connection with acquisitions authorized under their respective bills they differ in their treatment of electronic communication service providers who
