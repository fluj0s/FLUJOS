universities christine m matthews resources science and industry division september 26 2008 abstract an august 2008 report of the nsf reveals that for the academic year 2006 approximately 330 of the black science and engineering doctorate recipients had earned their bachelor degrees at an hbcu while hbcus have played an important role in providing the undergraduate preparation for many of those black students entering highly specialized science and engineering disciplines forecasts indicate that their eﬀorts at attracting retaining preparing and graduating students in the sciences and engineering may need to be expanded in order to respond to changing demographics september 2006 report of the department of education ed states that between 2004 and 2015 enrollment in degreegranting institutions is projected to increase 27 for black nonhispanic students 42 for hispanic students 30 for native americanalaskan natives 28 for asianpaciﬁc islanders and 6 for white nonhispanic students these groups the new majority on which the economy must increasingly rely have traditionally been underrepresented in the sciences compared to their fraction of the total populationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34435g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

institutions were established after the war several with the public support of land grants thr ough the freedmans bureau19 the national landgrant colleges act of 1862 pl 37108 otherwise known as the 1862 morrill act provided public lands to various states for the purpose of constructing educational institutions20 funds appropriated under this act were distributed to the states with the intention that they would foster equal educational opportunities for all students especially newly freed blacks21 however the landgrant higher education system resulting from the 1862 morrill act failed to provide equal educational opportunities black students were excluded from enrolling in traditionally white institutions funds from the morrill act began to flow systemically to schools offering only allwhite education congress attempted by various legislation to force racial equality including equality of educational opportunity however th us supreme court initiated series of interpretations of

held that the 14th amendment only protected against direct di scriminatory action by state government22 second morrill act was passed in 1890 which included language mandating states with dual systems of higher education to provide landgrant institutions for both systems as result 19 institutions were established as black landgrant institutions enrolling those black students who had been excluded under the 1862 legislation while there was the creation of two landgrant systemsone established under the 1862 landgrant act 1862 morrill act and the other under the 1890 landgrant act second morrill actthe level of support for the 1890 institutions both federal and state never approximated the level received by the 1862 landgrant institutions 23 in particular during the expansion of program offerings and disciplines at the 1890 institutions the disparity in funding for research infrastructure between them and the earlier established institutions severely limited their efforts to support basic and applied research 24 in written testimony before the house committee on agriculture in support of legislation providing assistance to 1890 institutions the honorable harold ford noted that the 1890 institutions were never adequately funded the way they should have been by the various states with assistance from the various states and federal government the 1862 institutions were permitted to thrive and expand while the 1890 ins titutions received meager funding from both their respective state and federal government furthermore the 1890 institutions were not eligib to participate in the facilities programs provided in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the federal government under the research facilities act of 1963 only the 1862 landgrant institutions were permitted to participate in this program not until 1967 did the federal government start to provide research funds to the 1890 programs these funds were for research projects and not for constructing research facilities 25 g5g149g138g156g156g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g10g4g5g23g156g561 the diversity of hbcus parallels that of othe r institutions of higher education hbcus

the national science foundation nsf provides data on federal academic science and engineering support to colleges and universities in six categories research and development rd fellowships traineeships and training grants rd plant facilities and equipment for instruction general support for science and engineering and other science and engineering activities 33 an important issue in the academic community and in science and technology policy in general is the distribution of federal rd funds to colleges and universities major criticism of federal rd funding patterns is that there is concentration in certain colleges and universities restricting the development and expansion of scientific and technical capabilities in other institutions in an analysis of 650 researchperforming institutions nsf found that the top 100 institutions accounted for approximately 80 of all academic rd funding in fy2006 those institutions falling in the top 100 category showed only minimal changes in more than 20 years 34 the charge is that the elite institutions haves continue in their status and the lessprestigious research institutions havenots continue to struggle for research funding35 while various measures of equity can be calculated based on the number of institutions geographic distribution student enrollments science and engineering students graduate students and so forththe following analysis will examine federal obligati ons for rd to hbcus as percentage of all institutions receiving rd expenditures an october 2007 report of the nsf reveals that in fy2005 908 us colleges and universities received rd support 36 of that total 72 are hbcus37 trend data reveal that these research performing hbcus have not shared proportionately in the distribution of federal rd obligations to colleges and universities38 although funding to hbcus has increased in the past 33 other science and engineering activities are defined as technical conferences teacher institutes and programs geared to increase the scientific knowledge of precollege and undergraduate students such activities comprise some of the building blocks of science education and future research capability

renovation in order to be used effectively for research in the science and engineering disciplines the nsf survey revealed that for fy1996 and fy1997 approximately 15 of hbcus initiated repairrenovation projects and 14 began major construction projects in the 1998 survey hbcus reported 3310 million in construction and repairrenovation projects and campus infrastructure projects that

of research space increased the most in engineering and the agricultural sciences during the period 1988 to 1998 research space increased in every field except the medical sciences in medical schools and computer science an additional analysis of the 29 hbcus reveal ed that in 1996 and 1997 11 of the 29 hbcus initiated research facility construction projects the same number of institutions that

testimony before the house science committee sebetha jenkins president jarvis christian college stated that given the demographic changes taking place in this nation investing more in hbcus is in actuality about the future prosperity of this nation59 jenkins proposed the establishment of program for minority institutions that is similar to the experimental program to stimulate competitive research epscor epscor is designed for those states and institutions that are perceived as being the havenots and are in the most need of rd support 60 this proposed epscorlike program would build new and expanded capacity and capability for minorityserving institutions key elements of the epscorlike program would be technical assistance and the development of partnerships between major research institutions and minority serving institutions this initiative would s upport also an hbcu centers program for the education and training of professionals in the scientific and technical disciplines jenkins and others in the academic community believe that an epscorlike program would stimulate the competitive rd capacity of hbcus success of the hbcu centers would be dependent on unfettered resources with funding being provided until the centers were selfsustaining the viability of any academic institution is function of its ability to provide quality education for its student population data reveal that many hbcus have provided their black student population with quality education especially in the scientific and technical disciplines in testimony before the house committee on education and labor dorothy cowser yancy president johnson c smith university stated that hbcus today represent only 4 of all higher education institutions but they graduate approximately 30 of all africanamerican students 40 of african american students receiving fouryear degree in science technology engineering and mathematics and 50 of african american teachers the successes were achieved despite the fact that in recent years federal support for hbcus has only increased in very modest amounts and in spite of the fact that hbcus continue to r eceive significantly less funding for research facilities and programs than their historically white counterparts 61 however these institutions are faced with an increased challenge of attracting and preparing an increasingly larger number of blacks in the scientific and technical disciplines demographic data show student population and workforce increasi ngly composed of minority groups that have been historically underrepresented in science mathematics and engineering shirley ann jackson president rensselaer polytechnic institute contends that this demographic pattern may affect the development of the scientific and engineering workforce and consequently the conduct of rd during the 21 st century62 the success of research programs at hbcus is inextricably 59 house committee on science and

fostering additional scientific talent63 the national academies report rising above the gathering storm states increasing participation of underrepresented minorities is critical to ensuring highquality supply of scientists and engineers in the united states over the long term as minority groups increase as percentage of the us population increasing their participation rate in science and engineering is critical if we are just to maintain the overall participation rate in science among the us population perhaps even more important if some groups are underrepresented in science and engineering in our society we are not attracting as many of the most talented people to an important segment of our knowledge economy 64 the distribution of federal funding for hbcus is one of the critical issues facing these institutions some say that past and current policies have not provided effective remedies for their problems of infrastructure necessary to develop strong scientific programs many hbcus are attempting to expand their research capacity by developing expertise in areas such as homeland security and national defense cyberinfrastructure environmental observatories food security energy expenditures genomics and material science they contend that improved funding for facilities and instrumentation is needed to strengthen the capability of these colleges and universities to contribute to the nations longterm economic vitality while many hbcus have engaged in strategic planning in order to obtain more competitive research base congress may continue to consider options that would bring hbcus closer to an equal footing with other institutions and enable them to move toward full partnerships in conducting research this issue may be examined when assessing the capacity of hbcus and other minorityserving institutions to contribute to the health of the nations higher education system and in producing an increasingly larger number of trained scientific and technical personnel needed to meet the challenge of highly competitive international economy 65
