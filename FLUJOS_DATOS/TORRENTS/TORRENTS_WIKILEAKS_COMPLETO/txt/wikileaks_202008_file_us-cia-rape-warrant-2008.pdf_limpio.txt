washington hotel room 7212 located at 1919 connecticut ave nw washington dc this hotel is located in the district of columbia 31 on october 10 2008 i met with warren at his place of employment in northern virginia to inform him of the allegations leveled against him by v1 and v2 during this meeting warren agreed to cooperate with the investigation warren admitted during this meeting that he had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with v1 and v2 at his residence in algiers algeria warren informed that his personal lap top computer was in his hotel room located at the washington hilton hotel and that photographs of v1 and v2 were probably on his personal lap top computer following this meeting warren voluntarily surrendered his cell phone and digital camera which were located in his rental car to for forensic analysis that analysis uncovered multiple photographs of v1 and v2 along with various other women he declined consent to the seizure or search of his personal computer 32 i know based on my training and experience including specific training provided to by the diplomatic security training center regarding the collection of electronic data that electronic data located on lap top or desk top computer can be easily deleted destroyed or altered within seconds based upon this information i instructed two d ss special agents to immediately begin surveillance on warrens hotel room while i began to prepare an affidavit for search warrant to search his hotel room for his personal lap top prior to my completion of the requisite documents needed to obtain search warrant warren arrived at his hotel room fearing that warren might attempt to destroy or alter any evidence located on his lap top computer i ordered the two dss special agents to ask warren to surrender the computer into their custody warren then provided the agents with hp pavilion entertainment personal computer model number dv 2500 serial number 2ce80929m3 the computer was transported by these agents to the united states attorneys office f or the district of columbia located in washington dc where it was received and where it presently is located 33 on october 13 2008 ds special agents executed search warrant on warre ns residence in algiers algeria during the search agents recovered among other items apple martin mix multiple data storage devices including multiple computer hard drives memory cards valium and xanax and handbook on the investigation of sexual assaults probable cause to search the lap top computer 34 on october 7 2008 i spoke with toxicologist on duty in the chemistry unit of the fbi laboratory this toxicology expert has over 7 years of experience in the investigation of drug facilitated sexual assaults and she explained that the victims symptoms were consistent with drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults the expert also explained that due to the sedative properties of these drugs victims often have memory of an assault only an awareness or sense that they were violated common effects are sensations of drunkenness that do not correspond to the amount of alcohol consumed unexplained gaps in memory altered levels of consciousness disorientation sickness and the feeling of paralysis some victims of date rape drugs remember brief periods of awakening where they are aware of their surroundings and can sometimes speak but are unable to move 35 through the toxicology expert i learned that drugs which are commonly used to facilitate sexual assault are prescribed sleeping medications muscle relaxants anxiety pills xanax and valium which are then converted from pill form to powdered form ghb gammahydroxybutyrate schedule 1 drug under the controlled substances act is nervous system depressant used for euphoric and sedative effects diluted in waterbeverages ghb is produced commercially in very limited and tightly controlled quantities under the name xyrem i also learned that industrial solvents such as gbl gammabutyrolactone and bd 14butanediol are sold in liquid form as floor stripper fish tank cleaner ink stain remover ink cartridge cleaner and nail enamel remover ghb can be produced easily by combining gbl with either potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide and instructions for ghb production are available on the internet furthermore once ingested into the human body the human body will convert the gbl into ghb 36 the expert relayed that these substances are commonly sold over the internet and are mixed in the victims drinks usually without their knowledge to mask the salty taste these drugs are rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the body detectable levels remain in the urine for 8 to 12 hours and in the blood for 4 to 8 hours symptoms of these drugs appear within 15 to 30 minutes of ingestion and the effects persist for 3 to 6 hours it was also relayed by the expert that information on how to obtain and use the above described substances to facilitate sexual assaults can be found on the internet 37 v1 and v2 reported experiencing similar symptoms associated with the ingestion of substances described in paragraphs 32 and 33 and since the reported incidents occurred approximately eight months apart there is reason to believe that warren maintains these substances and other items associated with the preparation of the substances in his residence on continuing basis 38 as noted above w1 stated that warren video taped v1 on the night of the party and v2 stated that warren took photograph of her in his residence on the night of the alleged sexual assault using his cellular telephone i know from my training and experience that digital photographs taken by means of cellular telephones digital cameras and video cameras can be transferred to and stored in other digital storage media including but not limited to computers thumb drives and compact discs 39 in light of 1 v2s statement that warren took photograph of her on the night of her alleged assault 2 the toxicologists opinion that information concerning how to obtain and use chemical substances to facilitate sexual assaults may be found on the internet and 3 the toxicologists opinion that these chemical substances are sold ove r the internet and 4 warrens statement that v1and v2 probably are on the laptop computer i have probable cause to believe that evidence of warren s sexual assaults may be stored on warrens laptop computer based on my knowledge training and experience including the experience of other agents with whom i have spoken i know that computer files or remnants of such files can be recovered months or even years after they have been downloaded onto hard drive deleted or viewed via the internet electronic files downloaded to hard drive can be stored for years at little or cost even when such files have been deleted they can be recovered months or years later using readily available forensics tools when person deletes file on home computer the data contained in the file does not actually disappear rather that data remains on the hard drive until it is overwritten by new data therefore deleted files or remnants of deleted files may reside in free space or slack space that is in space on the hard drive that is not allocated to an active file or that is unused after file has been allocated to set block of storage space for long periods of time before they are overwritten in addition computers operating system may also keep record of deleted data in swap or recovery file similarly files that have been viewed vi the internet are automatically downloaded into temporary internet direct ory or cache the browser typically maintains fixed amount of hard drive space devoted to these files and the files are only overwritten as they are replaced with more recently viewed internet pages thus the ability to retrieve residue of an electronic file from hard drive depends less on when the file was downloaded or viewed than on particular users operating system storage capacity and computer habits 40 based upon my training and experience and information related to by agents and others involved in the forensic examination of computers i know that computer data can be stored on variety of systems and storage devices including hard disk drives on computer i also know that forensic search of computer may take several weeks to complete searching computer systems is highly technical process which requires specific expertise and specialized equipment there are many types of computer hardware and software in use today it may be necessary to consult with computer personnel who have specific expertise in the type of computer software application or operating system that is being searched b searching computer systems requires the use of precise scientific procedures which are designed to maintain the integrity of the evidence and to recover hidden erased compressed encrypted or password protected data computer hardware and storage devices may contain booby traps that destroy or lter data if certain procedures are not scrupulously followed since computer data is particularly vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional modification or destruction controlled environment such as law enforcement laboratory is essential to conducting complete and accurate analysis of the equipment and storage devices from which the data will be extracted c the volume of data stored on many computer systems and storage devices will typically be so large that it will be highly impractical to search for data during short period of time single megabyte of storage space is the equivalent of 500 doublespaced pages of text single gigabyte of storage space or 1000 megabytes is the equivalent of 500000 doublespaced pages of text storage devices capable of storing 160 gigabytes gb of data are now commonplace in desktop computers consequently each nonnetworked desktop computer found during search can easily contain the equivalent of 80 million pages of data which if printed out would result in stack of paper over four miles high further 160 gb drive could contain as many as approximately 150 full run movies or 150000 songs d computer users can attempt to conceal data within computer equipment and storage devices through number of methods including the use of innocuous or misleading filenames and extensions for example files with the extension jpg often are image files however user can easily change the xtension to txt to conceal the image and make it appear that the file contains text computer users can also attempt to conceal data by using encryption which means that password or device such as dongle or keycard is necessary to decrypt the data into readable form in addition computer users can conceal data within another seemingly unrelated and innocuous file in process called steganography for example by using steganography computer use r can conceal text in an image file which cannot be viewed when the image file is opened therefore substantial amount of time is necessary to extract and sort through data that is concealed or encrypted to determine whether it is evidence contraband or instrumentalities of crime conclusion 41 based on the foregoing i have probable cause to believe that on or about september 2007 and on or about february 17 2008 within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states andrew warren committed the offense of aggravated sexual abuse in violation of 18 usc 2241b2 and 2242 in addition based on the forgoing i have probable cause to believe that evidence and instrumentalities relating to these crimes as further described in attachment b will be on andrew warrens hp pavilion personal computer model dv 2500 serial number 2ce80929m3 located within the district of columbia ________________________________________ special agent scott banker diplomatic security service united states department of state sworn to and subscribed before on this _______
