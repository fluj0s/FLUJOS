summary this short report provides information on belaruss history political and economic situation human rights record foreign policy and us relations with belarus it will be updated when necessary history belarusians are descendants of slavic tribes that migrated into the region in the ninth century the beginnings of their development as distinct people can be traced from the 13th century when the mongols conquered russia and parts of ukraine while belarusians became part of and played key role in the grand duchy of lithuania in 1569 the grand duchy merged with poland ushering in over two centuries of polish rule poland itself was divided in the late 18th century and belarusian territories fell to russia ruling powers ie poles and russians tried to culturally assimilat belarusians and pushed them to the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder as result belarus did not develop substantial national movement until the late 19th century in the chaos in the final months of world war i the belarusian democratichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95776crs2 republic was established in march 1918 with german military assistance after the defeat of germany in november 1918 the red army seized the country and established the byelorussian soviet socialist republic in january 1919 in 1922 belarus became one of the republics of the ussr its territory almost doubled when stalin annexed parts of poland to belarus in 1940 as part of the molotovribbentrop pact with hitlers germany after the war part of this territory was returned to poland belarus was devastated by world war ii which killed 25

electorate voted in favor of preservation of the union belarus was one of the founding members of the commonwealth of independent states political situation virtually all political power in belarus is in the hands of strongman aleksandr lukashenko in belaruss july 1994 presidential elections lukashenko who was running on populist anticorruption platform crushed prime minister vyacheslav kebich taking 8034 of the vote conflict between new belarusian parliament elected in 1995 and an increasingly authoritarian president led lukashenko to call national referendum on novembe r 24 1996 to approve new constitution drafted by the belarusian leader under the new charter lukashenkos original fiveyear term would be extended until 2001 he would also gain the right to appoint half of the constitutional court and the electoral commission both of which have shown some independence from lukashenko in the past the new constitution would create smaller weaker twochamber parliament some of whose members would be appointed by lukashenko lukashenkos plan provoked strong opposition in the parliament and antilukashenko demonstrations in minsk however lukashenko prevailed in the referendum by an overwhelming majority of over 70 of the vote lukashenko opponents including the former head of the electoral commission claimed the vote was marked by fraud lukashenko signed his constitution into law and dissolved the old parliament the council of europe the european union eu and the organizati on for security and cooperation in europe osce condemned the november 1996 referendum as illegitimate and unfair in october 2000 belarus held parliamentary elections many opposition figures refused to participate after the lukashenko regime refused to allow them access to state run electronic media or participate in the central or local electoral commissions once again the council of europe the eu and the osce strongly criticized the elections as not free and fair the osce and western governments have demanded that lukashenko address the institutional weakness of the parliament as compared to the vast powers held by lukashenko and his administration belarus held presidential elections on september 9 2001 belarusian opposition groups chose trade union leader vladimir goncharik as their joint candidate to run against lukashenko lukashenko was declared the winner with 756 of the vote over hancharyk with 154 osce observers condemned the vote as not free and fair due to lack of media freedom harassment of opposition candidates and supporters lack of independence and transparency in the counting of votes and other factors while lukashenko may not have won free and fair vote nevertheless he appears to retain significant support among some sectors of the population in may 2001 surveyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95776crs3 1 us department of state office of research belarusians divide by age over lukashenko and their countrys future july 10 2001 2 us state department press statement department officials meet with wives of disappeared belarusian politicians july 18 2001commissioned by the state department 42 of those polled said that they would vote for lukashenko if elections were imminent opposition leader scored higher than 25 lukashenkos support is strongest among voters over 60 those with less than secondary education and those living in rural areas he enjoys less support among those under 30 among those with college degrees and residents of the capital minsk one clue to this social split in support for lukashenko may be the fact that while twothirds of those polled said economic conditions in belarus were fairly bad or bad 91 gave lukashenko credit for ensuring that pensions were paid on time1 while younger people are dismayed at the lack of economic opportunity in lukashenkos belarus many elderly voters may be content that they can eke out predictable if very modest existence lukashenko also espouses sovietera values social egalitarianism suspicion of the west that are popular with elderly voters human rights and freedoms the 2000 state department human rights report said that belaruss human rights record is very poor it notes that government security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens beat detainees and monitored the activities of opposition politicians and other segments of the population the government harassed independent media and forced them to close the government used force to break up political demonstrations the judiciary is not independent the state department report notes that trafficking in women is problem in belarus one of the most disturbing human rights issues in belarus is the fate of former parliament chairman viktor gonchar his associate anatoly krasovsky former interior minister yuri zakharenko and russian television cameraman dimitry zavadsky all of them disappeared in 1999 all had been involved in opposition activities or criticized the lukashenko regime gonchar disappeared in september 1999 hours after lukashenko delivered speech ordering the security services to crack down on opposition scum in july 2001 two investigators from the belarusian prosecutors office charged that the four men were killed by death squads created by the lukashenko regime state department spokesman said that the united states found these charges to be credible2 in february 1998 the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce opened mission in belarus the missions task is to monitor belaruss progress toward democracy and respect for its obligations as member of the osce and advise minsk on how to improve its record in these areas the mission has had very limited success in persuading lukashenko to move toward more democratic political system during the september 2001 presidential election campaign lukashenko accused the mission of being nest of spies aimed at overthrowing him httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95776crs4 3 eiu country profile belarus may 31 2001economy belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former soviet union although some small enterprises have been privatized the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy remain almost entirely in government hands the private sector made up only 20 of gdp in 1999 reliance on lax fiscal and monetary policies to prop up inefficient stateowned industry and agriculture has led to an increase in inflation despite government wage and price controls average annual consumer price inflation was estimated at 168 for 2000 belaruss currency the rubel has plummeted nearly 40 in value against the us dollar since 1998 cumulative direct foreign investment in belarus remains low mere 290 million through february 2001 economic output has been artificially sustained by government subsidies real gdp grew by 6 in 2000 these measures have also permitted belarus to keep official unemployment levels at just over 2 although real unemployment is likely significantly higher real wages and pension have also gradually increased although they remain at very low levels3 belarus is burdened by the consequences of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster chernobyl spewed large amounts of radiation over onefifth of the countrys arable land the belarusian economy has been propped up by cheap energy imports from russia as well as the ability to export its products to russia under advanta geous terms the russian natural gas firm gazprom has accepted belarusian goods in exchange for gas deliveries and subsidized prices belarus nevertheless has managed to accumulate debts even under this favorable arrangement in june 2001 the russian government announced that it was releasing 32 million of 100 million loan to belarus to stabilize its currency the international monetary fund and world bank cut off loans to belarus in 1996 due to the countrys lack of reform efforts in april 2001 the imf started program to monitor belaruss economy in cooperation with the belarusian government in september 2001 the world bank approved 22 million social infrastructure project foreign policy and defense lukashenkos main foreign policy priority has been increasing integration with russia lukashenko strongly favors close political economic and military ties with russia which he sees as way to help belarus surmount its economic difficulties and as natural development for two peoples with common history since 1995 lukashenko has signed several agreement and treaties with russia to establish union between the two states the most recent treaty was signed in december 1999 its calls for steps toward forming with moscow an economic union with common market currency monetary budget tax and customs systems the treaty calls on the two countries to coordinate their policies in wide variety of other fields including foreign policy defense human rights social policy and many other areas the treaty calls for the setting up of union institution s including supreme state council that includes the heads of state joint council of ministers and joint parliament the treaty makes clear that both states will retain their own sovereignty and national institutions however russianbelarusian integration has remained largely rhetorical so far the main obstacle to integration is belaruss poor economic reform record and the reluctancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95776crs5 of russian economic reformers to provide additional massive subsidies to belaruss ailing economy unless belarus engages in economic reform along russian lines integration may continue to lag russian firms have reportedly opened discussions with belarusian leaders about acquiring key belarusian enterprises if the lukashenko regime decides to privatize them in the near future the belarusian leader has moved his countrys defense and foreign policies into close alignment with russias lukashenko strongly opposes nato enlargement and was fierce critic of nato air strikes against serbia in 1999 small number of russian troops remain in belarus in part to run naval radio station and an early warning radar station in 2000 russian strategic bombers

authoritarian state department spokesm an sharply criticized lukashenkos november 1996 referendum saying it was not conducted in free or fair manner and that it lacked legitimacy the united states and other western governments do not recognize the legitimacy of the new constitution and legislature approved in 1996 or of lukashenkos tenure as president after the expiration of his original term in
