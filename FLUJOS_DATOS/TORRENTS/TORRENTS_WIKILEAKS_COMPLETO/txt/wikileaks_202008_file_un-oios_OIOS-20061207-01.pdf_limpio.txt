increase in the warehouse costs relied on the fact that its proposal was based on 6000 troops and not on 15000 troops this was the exact concern ex pressed in the dpkos original technical evaluation

fixed warehouse costs for 14500 troops in their initial proposals the failure of the procurement service to secure similar fixed costs when dealing with the subject company facilitated this companys

that the liberia contract was drafted in an ambiguous way allowing for the effort to recoup sums of money through subsequent amendments and ter charges the task force further concludes that mr

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 64 xii findings 174 the task force finds that the procuremen t exercises held in connection with the food rations contracts for unmil and unmee were severely ta inted and the integrity of the process severely undermined by the nefa rious actions of officials of the subject company ihc and mr yakovlev the unit ed nations procurement officer the subject company through the collective effort of number of its officials and with the assistance of procurement officer within the organisation fr audulently secured and obtained sensitive and confidential united nati ons documents and financial information of its competitors from the facility in which the bid submissions were maintained by acquiring this confidential and sensitive in formation the subject company corrupted the procurement exercise and compromised the inte grity of the process through the benefit of such information the company was thereaft er able to redraft and replace its own financial submissions securing the liberia and eritrea c ontracts these efforts perpetrated in hotel room just few bloc ks away from the united nations headquarters where the bidding exercises took place consti tuted fraudulent effort to achieve the contracts through corrupt means and illegal acts these ac tions firmly undermined the integrity of the procurement process and the ultimate overriding goal of the selection of company through fair independent objective and honest means 175 further the subject company acted in fraudulent manner in securing additional sums of money under the contracts by artificially lowering its initia l costs to gain an improper advantage over its competition in furtherance of its effort to secure the united nations contracts and thereafter seeking cont ract amendments to cover costs which it asserted were originally not c ontemplated however it is ev ident that the ultimate sums paid by the organisation after the execution of the amendments exceeded the projected sums of its competitors for these very same services which were clearly expected to be incurred at the time of the bidding exerci these efforts to achieve additional compensation through the backdoor were assi sted by mr yakovlev who was primarily responsible for drafting advancing and curing the execution of the contract amendments that were implemented to the significant benefit of the subject company and to the detriment of the organisation 176 the task forces investigation further tablished numerous instances when ihc through its president mr testa obtained and further disseminated confidential united nations documents and proprietary and sensi tive information of competing vendors in connection with number of ongoing and an ticipated procurement exercises of the organisation mr testa in fact acknowledged taking poss ession of confidential united nations documents while visiting the united nations offices and lifting documents from copy machines in the united nations headquarter s the task force finds it particularly disturbing that individuals other than united nations pr ocurement officers had such access and ability to obtain c onfidential and sensitive information of the procurement service on repeated basis and that procurement offici als assisted the effort 177 based upon all the facts and circumstances as well as reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom it is eviden t that at least some of the confidential documents and oios procurement task force report on the subject company ihc and certain staff members redacted and strictly confidential ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 65 information obtained by the subject company ihc and mr testa were provided to them by mr yakovlev the procurement officer who was entrusted with the possession of the confidential financial submissions at the current time the task force has not yet identified evidence that ither the subject company or ihc bestowed upon mr yakovlev anything of value in exchange for his effo rts in this regard however mr testa acknowledged pursuing business venture w ith mr yakovlev while mr yakovlev was employed by the united nations as procurement officer which constituted clear conflict of interest and viol ation of relevant rules and re gulations of the organisation mr yakovlev never disclosed this business venture to the orga nisation or recused himself from handling procurement exercise s in which ihc and the subject company were involved further in this regard ihc has admitted employing mr yakovlevs and providing mobile phone to mr yakovlev in connection w ith this business endeavor that mr yakovlev used for period of veral years while employed with the united nations during this time ihc was acting as vendor intermediary on behalf of number of companies seeking to do busines s with the organisati on and as party to contracts with the organi sation in its own right 178 the amendments to the liberia contract proposed by the subject company were accepted by the procurement service as result of efforts by mr yakovlev in favour of the subject company despite the poor performa nce of the company in its execution under the contracts united nations procurement officers st aff member 4 staff member 1 and staff member 2 failed to exercise sufficient duty of care over mr yakovlev to ensure that the amendments in the liberia c ontract were properly justified and that they were executed in the best interests of the or ganisation at the time staff member 4 and staff member 1 conceded that they lacked confidence in mr kovlev and held concern about his ethics it should be noted th at staff member 1 and staff member 2 agree in principal with the ta sk forces conclusions in this regard and they should be credited for their accepta nce of responsibility 179 as result of the deficiencies noted above the contract amount was unnecessarily increased in excess of us2 million and the organisation suffered financial losses of at least us860000 180 the task forces investigation did not fi nd any basis to suppor t allegations that staff member 5 and staff memb er 6 engaged in any inappropr iate conduct in favour of the subject company or esko however the investigation revealed that for period of at least seven months mr picco served as the chairman of the board of ihc while serving as undersecretarygen eral at that time ihc ac tively sought to achieve united nations business and was representing various vendors in their efforts to secure united nations contracts in this regard mr picco appears to have suffered from conflict of interest xiii conclusions 181 by orchestrating scheme to obtain va luable united nations contracts through fraudulent means the subject company and the officials who participated in this effort oios procurement

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 66 identified herein committed criminal acts the subject company also violated and caused to be violated united nations pr ocurement rules which prohibit the united nations vendors from engaging in corrupt prac tices during the procurement process the conduct of the subject company caused financia l loss to the organisation in excess of us860000 in relation to the liberia contract alone394 182 the task force concludes that by so liciting receiving and exchanging significant number of conf idential united nations documents ihc and the subject company acted in an improper and unlawfu l manner and corrupted the procurement exercise and the integrity of the procurement process 183 ihc and mr testa further compromised th integrity of the procurement process by engaging in joint busines s venture with mr yakovlev this relationship existed while ihc was acting as

represented vendor participating in proc urement exercise during this time ihc provided mr yakovlev with tangible and intangible benefits 184 the task force concludes that by favouring the subject company in the procurement process and by committing the ac ts described above mr yakovlev violated the staff regulations 12b and 12e as we ll as procurement manua l sections 421 in that he failed to act in the best intere sts of the organisation and failed to uphold the highest standards of honesty compet ence integrity and truthfulness 185 the task force concludes that by provi ding confidential information and documents to the subject company mr yakovlev participated in the scheme to defraud the organisation and violated the staff regulations 12b 12g and 12e as well as section 4154a of th procurement manual 186 by engaging in joint business pursuit with vendorintermediary and accepting communication device paid for by the vendor intermediary and utilizing it for his own purposes as
