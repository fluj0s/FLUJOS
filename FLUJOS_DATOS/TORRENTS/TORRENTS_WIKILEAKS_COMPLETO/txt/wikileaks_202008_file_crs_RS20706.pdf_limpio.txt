internal revenue code dealing with small business taxes long term health care insurance and pensions and one entitled the methamphetamine anti proliferation act which involves criminal enforcement of drug laws5 also omitted is the controversial schumer amendment added by the senate which renders nondischargeable any debt that results from any judgment entered in state or federal court for damages to clinic or violation of the civil rights of individuals providing or obtaining reproductive health care services other provisi ons reported to have been added during negotiations such as provision that would favor renttoown busine sses and an amendment to the fair debt collection act that would exempt some debt collection activities from the act appear to be omitted the homestead exemption the provisions of hr 2415 track the house version more closely the bill imposes lengthened residency requirements to take advantage of state exemptions it extends to seven years the period for which assets converted to an otherwise exempt homestead may be proven to be fraudulent transfer it caps homestead exemptions under state law at 100000 for homestead acquired within two years of filing except for farmers hence the state opt out program for bankruptcy exemptions remains intact but debtors will be discouraged from provable fraudulent conversions and conversions within two years of filing 307 308 322 among the consumer reform provisions included are the means test the heart of the consumer reform provision the complicated means test which would create legal presumption of abuse of chapter 7 and require some debtors to reorganize under stricter chapter 13 or refrain from filing remains intact there are howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20706crs3 6 for example presumed abuse would exist if the debtors current monthly income is not less than the lesser of i25 percent of the debtors nonpriority unsecured claims in the case or 6000 whichever is greater or ii10000 102a2 in other words debtor who can pay the lesser of 100 month or 25 of unsecured debt or 16666 per month over 60 months would be ineligible this revision appears to compromise between the monetary limits of the earlier house amount 100month and the senate amount 250month adjustm ents to the means test criteria details6 debtor may rebut the presumption of abuse by demonstrating special rather than extraordinary circumstances although the term remains undefined the calculation of permissible monthly living expenses remains pegged to irs national standards and local standards and the debtors actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as other necessary expenses issued by the internal revenue service for the area in which the debtor resides debtor may also subtract an allowance of up to 5 of the irs food and clothing categories individualized expenses may include private school tuition of up to 1500 per year charitable and religious contributions of up to 15 of the debtors gross annual income administrative expenses and reasonable attorneys fees 102 reaffirmation agreements more closely tracks the senate version which imposes enhanced requirements for approval of reaffirmation agreement when the debtor is not represented by counsel requires us attorney and fbi to investigate abusive reaffirmation practices creates presumption of undue hardship if the debtors monthly income less expenses does not leave enough to pay the reaffirmed debt but exempts credit union creditors from the presumption the provision is silent on the question of authorizing or prohibiting class actions 203 pensions exempt from creditors the bill retains the provisions from the house and senate bills that would clarify and expand the law to provide that retirement accounts that are tax exempt under the internal revenue code are exempted from the debtors estate subject to 1000000 cap 224 the provision adopted by the senate that appeared to allow debtors to waive the retirement exemption is omitted 303 definition of household goods adopts the senates more restrictive defin ition to include only 1 radio 1 television 1 vcr and 1 personal computer but only if used
