congress summary this report complements and supports crs issue brief ib10041 by summarizing action on more than 100 renewable energy bills introduced during the 107th congress in the first session much of the action on renewable energy provisions focused on the two omnibus energy policy bills hr 4 and s 1766 hr 4 includes renewables provisions that would authorize research and development rd funding provide alternative fuel tax incentives create residential solar tax credit extend the renewables production tax credit and fund renewables with income derived from development of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr the renewable energy provisions of the house bill are derived primarily from several comprehensive bills and contain many if not most of the renewable energy recommendations in the administrations national energy policy report hr 4 passed the house on august 2 2001 similarly the renewable energy provisions of s 1766 are derived primarily from several comprehensive senate bills the senate bill contains several provisions that address areas in hr 4 such as authorization for rd funding and requirements for alternative fuels also s 1766 has several renewables provisions that are not in the house bill they include renewable energy portfolio standard transmission access net metering federal purchase requirement production incentive for local government and support for international technology deployment it remains to be seen whether s 1766 will be amended to incorporate additional renewable energy provisions from other bills s 1766 was introduced on december 5 2001 other action in the first session focused on appropriations bills that fund renewables programs at the department of energy doe and at programs of certain international agencies loans grants and other provisions in farm bills and other bills that address for example business loans and federal agency measures for each bill listed in this report there is brief
