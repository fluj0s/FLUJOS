appropriations for international affairs recent developments in february 2008 when the administration sent its fy2009 budget request to congress the department of state also provided its estimates of the fy2008 emergency supplemental funds by account some funds differ from that in the legislation because the department allocated some supplementals into the regular base funding when less than requested in the regular budget was received the state departments estimates of pending fy2008 supplemental funds are also related to instances where congress directed certain uses for the supplementals that were not part of the state departments supplemental request on december 26 2007 the president signed into law the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act hr 2764pl 110161 hereafter

operations congress approved 1123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in the omnibus bill in addition to regular fy2008 funding in many instances the amounts approved for

accompanying hr 2764 with regard to destination and are marked as na crs8 iraq reconstruction assistance4 until the passage of the omnibus fy2008 appropriations bill nearly 42 billion in us funds had been appropriated to support all facets of iraq reconstruction almost all this funding was appropriated in annual supplemental legislation for fy2008 the administration made request for security assistance in its regular defense budget proposal but asked for roughly 392 million under state and foreign operations appropriations in both the june 2007approved house and september 2007approved senate versions of the fy2008 state and foreign operations legislation hr 2764 congress rejected the administration request for iraq therefore funding for iraq reconstruction in fy2008 was expected to come almost entirely from an emergency supplemental measure administration supplemental request for iraq reconstruction the administrations fy2008 emergency supplemental appropriations request revised on october 22 2007 included 49 billion in funding for iraq reconstruction reconstruction aid has two main components security aid funded with department of defense dod appropriations and politicaleconomicsocial sector assistance funded with state and foreign operations appropriations the request for dod reconstruction appropriations totaled about 37 billion it would chiefly fund the training and equipping of iraqi troops under the iraq security forces fund isff and reconstruction grants provided under the commanders emergency response program cerp the cerp allows military commanders to support wide variety of economic activities at the local level from renovating health clinics to digging wells to painting schools provided in the form of small grants cerp also funds some infrastructure efforts longer supported with other us assistance such as repair or provision of electric generators and construction of sewer systems commanders are able to identify needs and dispense aid with few bureaucratic encumbrances more recently the cerp has paid salaries to the socalled sons of iraq formerly known as the concerned local citizens mostly sunnis who are joining with us forces to provide security the october budget revision added 100 million request to the dodfunded iraq freedom fund account for the task force to improve business and stability operations in iraq the task force funded at 50 million under the previous supplemental appropriations legislation seeks to stimulate the economy and create employment for iraqi citizens by rehabilitating some of the roughly 200 stateowned enterprises that comprised large portion of the iraqi economy prior to the us occupation news reports have suggested some difficulty with the program resulting from the lack of electricity the insecure environment and lack of enthusiasm from us companies that had been expected to invest in the facilities among other reasons5 4 prepared by curt tarnoff specialist in foreign affairs for more detailed discussion of the us program of assistance to iraq see crs report rl31833 iraq reconstruction assistance by curt tarnoff 5 us falters in bid to boost iraqi business washington post august 24 2007 in iraq continued crs9 under the state and foreign operations appropriations budget the fy2008 emergency supplemental request would direct 12 billion toward iraq 797 million in the economic support fund esf 159 million in the international narcotics and law enforcement incle and 195 million in the migration and refugee assistance mra and 80 million in the international disaster and famine assistance idfa accounts esf is the primary source of funding for the assistance provided by the provincial reconstruction teams prts which have grown under the surge to 31 including 13 newly established eprts embedded prts embedded with us combat battalions and concentrated mostly in baghdad and anbar province the eprts are intended to help stabilize areas secured by us and iraqi forces by supporting local smallscale employmentgenerating economic projects using esffunded community development grants job training and microloan programs among other activities prts also utilize esf to increase the capacities of local government officials to spend iraqiowned capital funds allocated by the iraqi government for infrastructure programs at the national level esf supports ministerial capacity development agriculture and private sector reform and the strengthening of democratization efforts the october budget revision added another 25 million to the esf supplemental request and proposed authorization language to allow the administration to establish new iraq enterprise fund based on the model created for east europe and the former soviet union enterprise funds are us governmentfunded private sectorrun bodies that primarily provide loans or equity investments to small and medium business in the former communist countries enterprise funds also encouraged growth of the private sector including support for mortgage lending markets and establishment of private equity funds the most successful example the polish fund made many profitable investments helping companies grow that otherwise were unable to obtain financial support in the period just after the fall of communism some of the funds however have been much less successful either by taking on poor investment risks or unable to locate promising businesses because of the poor business climate or competition from other private sector funding sources some observers question the usefulness of the funds because their ostensible development purpose seems often to conflict with pressures for economic profit the incle account largely would support rule of law and corrections programs the administration request was expected to fund prison construction something that congress has sometimes cut from previous requests the request was also intended to extend judicial reform and anticorruption efforts to the provinces the mra request would address the continuing refugee crisis in the region an estimated 20 million iraqis have fled the country and another 22 million have been displaced due to sectarian violence and instability the ida program would provide medical care food shelter and other relief to refugees and displaced people fy2008 emergency funds were also requested for operational costs not included in the reconstruction aid total for staffing and administering reconstruction programs 679 million for prt and 458 million for usaid operations 5 continued one mans mission impossible cnn moneycom september 4 2007 crs10 congressional action on iraq reconstruction in fy2008 consolidated appropriations in its consideration of the regular and supplemental requests for iraq reconstruction congress treated the two facets of reconstruction security and economic quite differently on the one hand congress did provide substantial part 19 billion of the administrations 37 billion defense appropriations supplemental request for security reconstruction aid it appropriated half of the request for the iraq security forces fund and nearly half of the request for the cerp on the other hand with few discrete exceptions all involving humanitarian programs congress in section 699k of division j the state and foreign operations part of the omnibus appropriations specifically rejected almost all regular or supplemental economic assistance to iraq providing only about 250 million it approved efforts to fund humanitarian demining 16 million drawing on regular nadr funds assist refugees and internally displaced persons drawing on supplemental mra funds and offer disaster relief drawing on supplemental idfa funds and it provided 5 million for the marla ruzicka war victims fund and 10 million for the rescue of iraqi scholars drawing on regular esf funds but the latter reportedly not yet allocated in the end congress appropriated 24 of the total international affairs budget supplemental request for iraq reconstruction which with fy2008 regular and dod emergency appropriations brings iraq reconstruction funding since 2003 to 448 billion however until the 2nd tranche of the supplemental is considered us funding for prt operations and programs and wide range of other programs designed to support the surge and enhance the capacity of the iraqi government to address its own needs will have to rely on available fy2007 funds pending fy2008 supplemental the administration is seeking the remainder of its emergency iraq

background afghanistans political transition was completed with the convening of parliament in december 2005 but in 2006 insurgent threats to 6 prepared by rhoda margesson specialist in international humanitarian policy and kenneth katzman specialist in middle eastern affairs crs12 afghanistans government escalated to the point that some experts began questioning the success of us stabilization efforts in the political process new constitution was adopted in january 2004 successful presidential elections were held on october 9 2004 and parliamentary elections took place on september 18 2005 the parliament has become an arena for factions that have fought each other for nearly three decades to debate and peacefully resolve differences afghan citizens have started to enjoy new personal freedoms particularly in the northern and western regions of the country that were forbidden under the taliban women are beginning to participate in economic and political life including as ministers provincial governors and senior levels of the new parliament the next elections are planned for 2009 the insurgency led by remnants of the former taliban regime escalated in 2006 after several years in which it appeared the taliban was mostly defeated us and nato military commanders have had recent successes in counterinsurgency operations but the taliban continues to present considerable threat to peace and security in parts of afghanistan slow reconstruction corruption and the failure to extend afghan government authority into rural areas and provinces particularly in the south and east have contributed to the taliban resurgence political leadership in the more stable northern part of the country have registered concerns about distribution of reconstruction funding in addition narcotics trafficking is resisting countermeasures and independent militias remain throughout the country although many have been disarmed the afghan government and us officials have said that some taliban commanders are operating across the border from pakistan putting them outside the reach of usnato forces in afghanistan in 2007 the administration unveiled the reconstruction opportunity zones roz in afghanistan and the border regions with pakistan an initiative to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped isolated regions the united states and partner stabilization measures focus on strengthening the central government and its security forces and on promoting reconstruction while combating the renewed insurgent challenge as part of this effort the international community has been running prts to secure reconstruction despite these efforts weak provincial governance is seen as key obstacle to democratic afghanistan and continues to pose threat to reconstruction and
