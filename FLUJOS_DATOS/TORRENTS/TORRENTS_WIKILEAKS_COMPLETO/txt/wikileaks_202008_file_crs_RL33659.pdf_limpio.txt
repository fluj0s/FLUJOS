of the construction process may be of interest to the 110th congress the united states border patrol usbp deploys fencing which aims to impede the illegal entry of individuals and vehicle barriers which aim to impede the illegal entry of vehicles but not individuals along the border the usbp first began erecting barriers in 1990 to deter illegal entr ies and drug smuggling in its san diego sector the ensuing 14 milelong san diego primary fence form ed part of the usbps prevention through deterrence strategy which calle d for reducing unauthorized migration by placing agents and resources directly on the border along population centers in order to deter wouldbe migrants from entering the country in 1996 congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which among other things explicitly gave the attorney general now the secretary of the department of homeland security broad authority to construct barriers along the border and authorized the construction of secondary layer of fencing to buttress the completed 14 mile primary fence construction of the secondary fence stalled due to environmental concerns raised by th california coastal commission in 2005 congress passed the real id act that authorized the secretary of the department of homeland security dhs to waive all legal requirements in order to expedite the construction of border barrier s dhs has announced it will use this waiver authority to complete the san diego fence the secure fence act of 2006 directed dhs to construct 850 miles of dditional border fencing this requirement wa s subsequently modified by the consolidated appropr iations act 2008 pl 110161 which was enacted into law on december 26 2007 the ac t requires the secretary of homeland security to construct fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border while the san diego fence combined with an increase in agents and other resources in the usbps san diego sect or has proven effec tive in reducing the number of apprehensions made in that sector there is considerable evidence that the flow of illegal immigration has adapted to this enforcement posture and has shifted to the more remote areas of the arizona desert nationally the usbp made 12 million apprehensions in 1992 and again in 2004 sugges ting that the increased enforcement in san diego sector has had little impact on overall apprehensions in addition to border fencing the usbp depl oys both permanent and temporary vehicle barriers to the border temporary vehicle barriers are typically chained together and can be moved to different locations at the usbps discretion permanent vehicle barriers are embedded in the ground and ar meant to remain in one location number of policy

geographical reality and in response to the large numbers of unauthorized aliens crossing the border in the area in 1990 the usbp began erecting physical barrier to deter illegal entries and drug smuggling the ensuing primary fence covered the first 14 miles of the border starting from the pacific ocean and was constructed of 10foothigh welded steel9 operation gatekeeper the primary fence by itself did not ve discernible impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens coming across the borde r in san diego as result of this operation gatekeeper was fficially announced in the san diego sector on october 1 1994 the chief elements of the operati on were large increases in the overall manpower of the sector and the deployment of usbp personnel directly along the border to deter illegal entry the strategic plan called for three tiers of agent deployment the first tier of agents wa s deployed to fixed positions on the border the agents in this first tier were charged with preventing illegal entry apprehending those who attempted to enter and genera lly observing the border second tier of agents was deployed north of the border in the corridors that were heavily used by illegal aliens the second tier of agents had more freedom of movement than the first tier and were charged with containing nd apprehending those aliens who made it past the first tier the third tier of agents were typically assigned to man vehicle checkpoints further inland to apprehend the tr affic that eluded the first two tiers as the department of justice inspector general report notes given gatekeepers deterrence emphasis many agents were ssigned to firsttier fixed positions along the border these agents were instructed to remain in their assigned positions rather than chase alien traffic passing through adjacent areas prior to gatekeeper such stationary positions we re relatively rare10 operation gatekeeper resulted in sign ificant increases in the manpower and other resources deployed to san diego sector agents received additional night vision goggles portable radios and fourwh eel drive vehicles and light towers and seismic sensors were deployed11 according to the former ins between october 1994 and june of 1998 san diego sector saw the following increases in resources usbp agent manpower increased by 150 seismic sensors deploy ed increased by 171 vehicle fleet increased by 152

strategy that were the maincomponents of operation gatekeeper the usbp estimated in 1998 that the entire 66 miles of border patrolled by the san diego sectors agents could be brought under control in five years 13 sandia national laboratory study according to cbp the primary fence in combination with various usbp enforcement initiatives along the san diego border region ie operation gatekeeper proved to be successful but fiscally and environmentally costly14 for example as unauthorized aliens and smugglers breached the primary fence and attempted to evade detection usbp agents were often forced to pursue the suspects through environmentally sensitive areas it soon became apparent to immigration officials and lawmakers that the usbp needed among other things rigid enforcement system that could integrate infrastructure ie multitiered fence and roads manpower and new t echnologies to further c ontrol the border region the concept of threetiered fence system was first recommended by 1993 sandia laboratory study commissioned by the former immigration and naturalization service ins according to the sandia study the use of multiple barriers in urban areas would increase the usbps ability to discourage significant number of illegal border crossers to detect intruders early and delay them as long as possible and to channel reduced number of illegal border crossers to geographic locations where the usbp was better prepared to deal with them15 the sandia study further noted that segments of the border could not be controlled at the immediate border due to the ruggedness of the terrai n and recommended the use of highway checkpoints in those areas to contain liens after they had entered the country illegally16 the study concluded that aliens attempting to enter the united states from mexico had shown remarkable resiliency in bypassing or destroying obstacles in their path including the existing primary fence and postulated that threefence

appropriations bill for fy2005 during conference language was revised in hr 1268 so that the secretary was authorized but not required to waive all legal requirements instead of all laws deemed necessary to ensu re construction of the security barriers the conferees also added provisions to the real id act which made waiver decisions effective upon publication in the federal register and permitted federal court review of waiver decisions only in limited circumstances the conference version of hr 1268 was enacted on may 11 2005 29 some courts for instance have found th notwithstanding phrase not dispositive in determining the preemptive effect of statute see eg ep paup v director owcp 999 f2d 1341 1348 9th cir 1993 oregon natural resources council v thomas 92 f3d 792 796 9th cir

real id act of 2005 pl 10913 division b27 the secretary of dhs was given broad authority to waive legal requirements that might othe rwise delay the construction of the security barriers described under 102 of iirira specifically the secretary of dhs is authorized to waive all legal requirements necessary to ensure exped itious construction of these security barriers28 such waivers are effective upon publication in the federal register federal district courts are provide d with exclusive jurisdiction to review claims alleging that the actions or decisions of the secretary violate the us constitution and district court rulings may be reviewed only by the supreme court the scope of this waiver authority is substantial whereas iirira had previously authorized the waiver of nepa and requirements the real id act authorizes the waiver of all legal requirements determined necessary by the secretary for the expeditious construction of author ized barriers and only allows judicial review for constitutional claims this waiver authority appears to apply to all barriers that may be constr ucted under iirira that is both to barriers constructed in the vicinity of the border in areas of high illegal entry and to the barrier that is to be constructed near the san diego area furthermore these claims can only be appealed to the supreme court ie there is intermediate appellate review whose review is discretionary some have expressed concer n with the apparent breadth of the waiver provision and the limited scope of judicial review of waiver decisions as passed into law the

that they may not be exercised in way that violates other specific provisions of the constitution williams v rhodes 393 us 23 29 1968 31 some of these waiver provisions grant the president or the head

cong rec h557 daily ed february 10 2005requirements although the term legal requirement is not defined it cannot grant the secretary the authority to unilaterally waive persons constitutional rights30 the provision has been construed by secr etary chertoff to apply to the waiver of laws in their entirety along with re gulations and requirements deriving from or relating to such laws congress commonly waives preexisting laws but the new waiver provision uses language and combin ation of terms not typically seen in law most waiver provisions have contained qualifying language that 1 exempts an action from other requirements contained in the act that authorizes the action 2 specifically delineates the laws to be wa ived or 3 waives grouping of similar laws also common are waiver provisions that contain reporting requirements or restrictions which appear to limit their breadth31 one waiver authority that appears analogous to that contained in the real id act is 203 of the transalaska pipeline authorization act as amended which authorizes the secretary of the interior to waive all procedural requirements in law related to the construction of the transalaska pipeline and limits judicial review to constitutional claims32 although some argue that the waiver au thority can extend to any law including those seemingly unrelated to building fence eg civil rights or child labor laws the provision is tempered by the requirement that the secretary must determine the law subject to the waiver is necessary t ensure expeditious construction of the barriers in other words the secretary may be confined to laws that in effect will impede the construction of the fence not those that only tangentially relate to or do not necessarily interfere w ith construction for example because child labor laws would not prevent the secretary from expeditiously constructing the fence it follows that the secretary does not have the authority to waive these protections this interpretation is buttressed by the legislative history of the real id act which indicates that several members called for the waiver provision because of laws that were complicating and ultimately preventing the completion of the fence33 the decision to waive law nonetheless is so lely in the secretarys discretion until such time that dhs waives an applicable law however it must follow all

appendix j enumerates the laws waived by the secretary for this purpose the secure fence act the secure fence act pl 109367 wa s signed into law on october 26 2006 the act directed dhs to construct twola yered reinforced fencing and additional physical barriers roads lighting cameras and sensors along five stretches of the southwest border cbp has estimated that these stretches of fencing total roughly 850 miles40 of the southern border the five stretches of the border that dhs was required to fence were the 20 miles ar ound tecate ca from calexico ca to douglas az from columbus nm to paso tx from rio tx to eagle pass tx and from laredo tx to brownsville tx the act designated the roughly 370 mile portion of the fence between calexico ca and douglas az priority area and directed dhs to ensure that an interlocking surveillance camera system is installed along this area by may 30 2007 and that the fence is completed in this area by may 30 2008 the act also designated 30mile stretch around laredo tx as priority area and directed dhs to complete this fencing by december 31 2008 the requirements enacted by the secure fence act were modified in the 110th congress by the consolidated appropr iations act fy2008 pl 110161 which was enacted on december 26 2007 the act makes number of modifications to 102 of iirira significantly increasing the secretary of homeland securitys discretion as to where to c onstruct fencing along the sout hwest border whereas the secretary was previously required to inst all roughly 850 miles of reinforced fencing along five stretches of the southwest bor der more general requirement has now been imposed on the secretary to construct reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional physical barriers roads lighting cameras and nsors to gain operational control of the southwest border41httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33659crs11 41 continued act as enacted does not specify that reinforc ed fencing be at least 2 layers see pl 104208 div c 102b as amended by pl 109367 3 42 ibidthe act further specifies that the secretary of homeland security is not required to install fencing physical barriers roads lightin g cameras and sensors in particular location along an international border of the united states if the secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location42 the act also amends the provision s of iirira 102 concerning fence construction in priority areas by requiri ng the secretary of homeland security to identify either 370 miles or other mil eage along the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and eff ective and to complete construction of fencing in identified areas by december 31 2008 this language replaces the prior language of iirira 102 concerning prior ity areas which had been added by the secure fence act the consolidated appropriations act does not modify the existing waiver provision or limitation on judicial review contained in iirira 102 but does impose new consultation requi rements on the secretary of homeland security when carrying out duties under this section and cond itions appropriations under the act upon compliance with these requirements specifically the secretary is required to consult with the secretaries of the interior and agriculture state and local governments indian tribes and property owners to minimize the impact on the environment culture commerce and quality of life in areas near where fencing is to be constructed the act specifies that this consultation requireme nt does not create or negate any right to legal action by an affected person or entity the san diego sandia fence in 1996 construction began on the seconda ry fence that had been recommended by the sandia study with congressional appr oval the new fence was to parallel the fourteen miles of primary fence already c onstructed on land patrolled by the imperial beach station of the san diego sector and included permanent lighting as well as an access road in between the two layers of fencing of the 14 miles of fencing authorized to be constructed by iirira nine miles of

and usbp apprehensions apprehension statistics have long been used as performance measure by the usbp however the number of apprehen sions may be misleading statistic for several reasons including the

was constructed beginning in fy1996 figure 1 shows the stark decrease in apprehensions at the imperial beach station from fy1992 to fy2004 the majority of the decrease occurred in the four year period from fy1995 through fy1998 and coincided with operation ga tekeeper which as previously noted combined the construction of fencing along the border with an increase in agents and other resources

selected urban areas as part of the usbps overall strategy of rerouting illegal migration away from urban areas towards geographically isolated areas where their agents have tactical advantage over bor der crossers two main types of border fencing have been construc ted primary fencing located directly on the border along several urban areas nd sandia fencing also known as secondary or triple fencing in san diego additionally the usbp has begun installing permanent vehicle barriers in various segments of the border vehicle barriers are designed to impede the entry of vehicles while allowing i ndividuals and animals to cross the border freely as such they have lower nvironmental footprint than border fencing steps prior to construction several considerations come into play whenever the usbp contemplates construction along the border there are number of steps that must be taken before the construction process can begin these steps include but are not limited to determining what the environmental impact of the construction will be acquiring the land needed for the fence acquiring the materials that will be used for the fence and securing the assistance of the

usbps enforcement activ ities along the border were nominal and the environmental conseque nces of illegal crossings went largely unnoticed as illicit trafficking escalated however so did the usbps activities and enforcement footprint including the construction of fe ncing and other barriers although the san diego fence reportedly reduced the number of aliens attempting to drive across the open border and consequently the enforcement footprint to stop such activities it did little to block the flow of foot traffic55 illegal aliens of ten damage habitat by cutting vegetation for shelter and fire causing wildfires increasing erosion through repeated use of trails and discarding trash56 environmentalists claim that the usbps enforcement activities including th pursuit of illegal aliens use of offroad vehicles and construction of roads and fences compound the degradation57 the real id act will allow the dhs secretary to waive any legal requirements needed to expedite the construction of border fencing until such time that dhs waives an applicable law however it must follow all legal requirements normally imposed on federal agencies including for exam ple nepa documentary requirements land acquisition the construction of fen ce along the border necessarily requires the government to ac quire some type of interest in the land the san diego border fence for example is to exte nd approximately 150feet north of the international boundary58 current immigration law authorizes the secretary of dhs to contract for and buy any interest in land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the international land border when the secretary deems the land essential to control and guard the border against any violation of immigration law59 it also authorizes the secretary to accept any interest in land along the border as gift and to commence condemnation proceedings if reasonabl purchase price can not be agreed upon with respect to the san diego border fence the law requires the secretary

fencing72 and picket fencing73 have been constructed in limited areas74 historically the agency has largely focused on using th landing mat fencing as primary fence and the sandia fence as secondary fence landing mat fencing landing mat fencing is composed of army surplus carbon steel landing mats which were used to create landing strips during the vietnam war the landing mats form pane ls 12 feet long 20 inches wide and 14 inch thick which are welded to steel pipes buried 8 feet deep every 6 feet along the fence each mile of fencing requires the use of 3080 panels75 there are about 5 miles of surplus landing mat fencing remaining as of 200676 according to the usbp sites that feature landing mat fencing include the following usbp stations campo ca yuma az nogales az nac az douglas

the united states from mexico some of these barriers are temporary and can be moved to different locations wh needed others are permanent barriers the main purpose of vehicle barriers is to prevent smugglers from easily driving their vehicles across the border permanent vehicle barriers permanent vehicle barriers as their name suggests are not designed to be moved but rather are permanent installations permanent vehicle barriers are typically steel posts or bollards that are excavated 5 feet deep and inserted into poured conc rete base the posts alternate in above ground height in order to dissuade individua ls from forming ramp over the barrier they are spaced so as to allow foot and animal traffic but not vehicular traffic the usbp recently began building permanent vehicle barriers in the yuma sector with substantial stretch slated to be built along the organ pipe cactus national monument when linked with the 30 mile s of vehicle barriers built by the national park

temporary vehicle barriers are typically built from welded metal such as railroad trac k but can also be c onstructed from telephone poles or pipe these barriers are built so that they cannot be rolled or moved manually they can only be moved with fo rklift or frontend loader they are usually built at usbp stations and transported to areas of high vehicle entry where they are placed and chained together88 the main advantage of the temporary vehicle barriers is their ability to be redeployed to different areas to address changes in smuggling patterns the main disadvantage of these barriers is that they are easier to compromise than permanent vehicle barriers current status in fy2007 dhs unveiled new program called sbinet89 that will deploy mix of personnel technology

construction of barriers along the border including but not limited to their effectiveness overall costs compared with benefits possibl diplomatic ramifications unintended consequences and the locations in which th ey are to be constructed although these issues apply to all potential barriers at th border due to the focus on border fencing in the current congressional debate this section will focus its analysis on the potential policy issues surrounding the constr uction of fencing at the border effectiveness proponents of border fences point to th substantial reduction in apprehensions along the san diego sector as tangible proof that fences succeed in reducing cross border smuggling and migration where they are constructed103 opponents attribute part of the decrease in apprehensions to the increase in manpower and resources in the sector and pointing to the increase in apprehensions in lesspopulated sectors contend that the fence only succeeds in rerouting unauthorized migration and not in stopping it104 the usbp for its part states that border fencing is force multiplier because it allows its agents to focus enfo rcement actions in other areas the usbp has also stated that the fencing constr ucted in urban areas has helped reroute unauthorized migration to less populated ar eas where its agents have tactical advantage over border crossers as previously noted the number of usbp apprehensions in 2004 were almost identical to the number of apprehensions in 1992 the main difference is that san diego account ed for the majority of apprehensions in 1992 whereas in 2004 tucson and yuma sectors accounted for the majority of apprehensions possible issue for congress concerns the overall effectiveness of border fencing especially if it is not constructed across the entir border in question in the limited urban areas where border fencing has been constructed it has typically reduced apprehensions however there is also strong indication that the fencing combined with added enforcement has rerouted illegal immigrants to other less fortified areas of the border additionally in the limited areas where fencing has been erected there have been numerous br eaches of the border fencing and number of tunnels discovered crossing underneath the fencing it stands to reason that even if border fencing is constr ucted over significant portion of the land border the incidences of fence breaches and undergr ound t unnels would increase possible policy options to address these issues c ould include mandating that border fencing be highly tamperresistan t or directing cbp to i nvest in tunneldetection technologieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33659crs33 105 as previously noted on pages 1921 these numbers reflect corps

the areas along which i ndividuals could cross the border it may stand to reason that the fencing will be s ubjected to more breaches and other attempts to compromise than the fencing that has already been constructed this may mean that the costs of maintaining border fencing that is widely deployed in the future will be higher than they have been thus far for the limited deployment the corps estimates do not include the costs of acquiring the land or most labor costs since construction would be done by dod these could well turn out to be significant expenses if private contract ors are used to construct the fencing as per dhs fy2007 congressional budget justifications th congressional budget office cbo has estimated that border fencing would cost 3 million mile to construct and that maintenance would total r oughly 15 of the overall project costs per year106 however the cbo does not elaborate on what is included in those estimates dhs predicts that the san diego fence will ve total cost of 127 million for its 14mile length when it is completed roughly 9 million mile construction of the first 95 miles of fencing cost 31 million or roughly 3 million mile while construction of the last 45 miles of fe ncing is projected to cost 96 million or roughly 21 million mile107 however these costs may be somewhat misleading due to the following factors constructi on of the fence was delayed for an extended period of time the remainin g construction involves fillin g relatively large gulch which may be more complex than the average stretch of border and dhs

border hurling stones and other items over the fence at usbp agents and vehicles in the yuma sector for example agents patrolling along the fence are deployed in armored vehicles known as warwagons to protect themselves from rockings and other forms of assault which are common in that area information obt ained during crs site visit to yuma sector in august 2005 proposing to use private contractors to ex pedite the constructi on process which may increase the labor costs and thus may increase the overall project costs some have argued that building fences on the border is too expensive and would consume funding that would be better spent on hiring additional agents or deploying additional technologies to the border108 others maintain that the costs of fencing are negligible compared to the costs of illegal immigration and that fencing has been proven effective at decreasing illegal immigration in those areas where it has been deployed109 the usbp has testified that for border control for border security we need that appropriate mix its not about fe nces its not about border patrol agents its not about technology its about all of those things110 at issue for congress is how best to allocate scarce border security resources while safeguarding homeland security does border fencing represent the best investment of border security funding and what is the ppropriate mix of border secu rity resources how much will maintaining border fencing cost in the future and which agency will be responsible for this maintenance will us ing private contractors to expedite the construction of border fencing increase or decrease the costs fence design congress mandated the design of the border fence in san diego in iirira many different fence designs could be deployed to the border and each have their relative strengths and weakne sses concrete panels for example are among the more costeffective solutions but usbp agents cannot see through this type of fencing the usbp testified about their preference for fencing that can be seen through so as to identify the activity occu rring on the mexican side of the border and thus preserve their tactical advantage over potential border cro ssers and to better avoid potential rockings111 or other violent incident s sandia fencing has been effective in san diego and can be seen through but is among the more expensive fencing options

border hearing july 20 2006 113 fencing the border hearing july 20 2006 114 interview with cbp congressi onal affairs september 13 2006fencing is relatively economical but more easily compromised112 if fencing is to be constructed along the border an issue c oncerns what kinds of fencing should be constructed in order to maximize its deterrent effect and its utility to the usbp while minimizing the costs associated with its construction and maintenance fence location the usbp has testified that border fencing is most effective for its operational purposes when deployed along urban areas113 in these areas individuals crossing the border have short distance to cover be fore disappearing into neighborhoods once they have entered neighbor hoods it is much more difficult for usbp agents to identify and apprehend unauthorized liens also from populated areas it is relatively easy for unauthorized aliens to find transportation into the interior for these reasons all of the border fencing c onstructed by the usbp to date has been built in urban areas butting the border such as san diego nogales and paso in rural areas the usbp testified that it has tactical advantage over border crossers because they must travel longer di stances before reach ing populated areas according to cbp fencing is manpower in tensive because agents must continually check the fence for breaches and for illega l activity this does not represent problem in urban areas because the usbp stations are typically located near the border in those areas in some of the more rural areas of the border where the nearest towns and usbp stations may be many miles away from the border this would mean that agents would need to spend much of their working day commuting from the nearest usbp station to the fence location114 additionally because the border fencing constructed to date has been built along urban areas it has been relatively easy to house the individuals involved in its construction if border fencing is extended into the more remote areas of the border the costs of its construction may increase due to the need to bring the indivi duals and goods needed to build the fence to these areas for extended periods of time lastly some areas of the border are prone to severe weather effects such as flash flooding that could compromise any permanent structures constructed there very practical issue concerns what areas of the border should be fenced should fencing be restricted to urban or semiurban areas in order to give the usbp tactical advantage over border crossers or should fencing be c onstructed along any geographical area of the border that f eatures large numbers of unauthorized immigration in rural areas should fencing be limited to areas of high illegal entry in order to impede individuals from cro ssing the border or should fencing be constructed as deterrent in any area even those featuring low levels of illegal entry should fencing be deployed in sectors wh ere the distance betw een the nearest usbp station and the fence requires agents to sp end most of their day commuting should fencing be deployed to the northern borde r as well as the southwest border will building fencing along more remote or nvironmentally harsher areas of the border increase the construction costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33659crs36 115 charles f wheatley study of withdrawals and

have these costs been factored into estimates of border fencing costs will eminent domain be used to confiscate land from individuals who do not wish to have fencing built on their lands the

only those who qualify under an exception or were provided land by statute have valid fee title claims within the reserved strip if lands were mistakenly granted sold or transferred to private parties these conveyances could be void because as general rule rights can not be acquired in lands actually embraced in legally valid withdrawal115 compensation under the fifth amendment for private landowners may not be owed if private claims are not legitimate because the proclamations do not cite any supporting au thority some question the presidents implied or inherent constitutional powers

assuming the pr oclamations are vali d the reservations may provide the first 60 feet of necessary space for fence construction in many areas however the two layer fenc ing constructed to date

government and the rest of the world124 there are number of po ssible issues for congress to consider involving the potential diplomatic ramifications of constructing barriers along the border do the gains in border security outweigh the risk of alienating mexico and canada should the mexican or canadian governments opinions or wishes be taken into account when border fe ncing is concerned given the need to coordinate intelligence and law enfor cement activities at the border should maintaining cordial working relationships with mexico and canada take precedence over sealing the border with physical barriers environmental considerations great deal of debate has been ar ound the environmental impacts of border fencing the addition of fences along the southwest border according to some could harm sensitive environments adversely affect critical habitat for protected species and block migratory patterns for animals indeed these concerns were among the many voiced by the ccc in its objection to the completion of the san diego border fence after immigration offici als the ccc and the envi ronmental community could not agree on fence design congress passed waiver language in the real id act that allows the secretary of dhs to waive all legal requirements necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barri ers and roads in the vicinity of the us border the secretary used this pr ovision to waive number of primarily environmental laws see appendix in order to complete the san diego border fence dhs maintains however that it will follow best management practices throughout construction and will be mindful of the environmental impacts that might occur125 nonetheless the secretarys broad waiver au thority has many worried about potential fen ce projects along other areas of the southwest border some argue that fence along the arizona border could be especially destructive to endangered jaguar and sonor an desert pronghorn populations that usually roam this area because it would fragment native bitat and ultimately reduce gene pools126 officials from the us fish and wildlife service however have said that it is too early to speculate about the potentia l

2004migration127 others note that unauthorized migration negatively impacts the environment and believe th at the construction of fenc ing could actually have beneficial impact for protected lands if it reduces the number of unauthorized migrants traversing through environmentally sensitive lands as congress debates immigration reform and the addition of new border fences members will undoubtedly be called upon to ba lance national secur ity interests with environmental protections because there doe s not appear to be clear consensus on the environmental impacts of border fencing there is some interest in study of the issue128 the effects of the san diego border fence for example may help scientists better understand and predic t potential environmental consequences elsewhere should fencing be expanded along the sout hwest border congre ss may be interested in environmentally sensitive alternatives to normal fencing and whether they can effectively limit illegitimate crossborder traffic some argue that vehicle barriers may be less intrusive because they allo w unimpeded wildlife movement but can limit damaging vehicular traffic129 congress may also call on the secretary to cooperate or coordinate certain activities with the environmental community since the secretary could waive many environmental requirements130 legal considerations the building of barriers along the inte rnational border has raised number of legal issues most stem from requirements posed by environmental laws before the passage of the real id act waiver provisi on for example the sierra club and other environmental groups challe nged under the national envi ronmental policy act the federal governments plan to co mplete the san diego border fence131 the lawsuit alleged among other things that the g overnments final environmental impact statement did not address the entire 14mile border infrastructure system and inadequately addressed the parts that were evaluated after secretary chertoff exercised the waiver authority the court dismissed the environmentalists lawsuit in december 2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33659crs40 132 laws that allow district court ruling to be appealed directly to the supreme court include 13 usc 141 illegal use of census data 15 usc 29 sherman act violations 18 usc 700 flag desecration violations 42 usc 1971 vo ting rights violations and 42 usc 2000a5 civil rights violations 133 see supra at 10with respect to the secretarys use of the waiver authority the provision allows legal redress only for constitutional violations and limits review to the district courts of the united states though the supreme c ourt retains discretiona ry appellate review over district court decisions in esse nce an individual could not sue dhs for bypassing the environmental impact st atement requirements of the national environmental policy act law it has waived because that would be statutory violation but an individual could sue fo r the taking of property without just compensation as provided by the fifth am endment should district court make ruling that decision can only be appealed if the petitioner files petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court and the court in its discretion chooses to grant certiorari in other words there is intermediate appellate court review guaranteed as of right to petitioner appeal directly from district court to the supreme court rarely appears in law132 still when congress determines particular class of cases to be of great public import it is not unprecedented for it to require prompt review in the highest court of the land as pr eviously discussed the sierra club and defenders of wildlife brought suit in the us district court for the district of columbia in late 2007 challenging the constitutionality of the waiver authority provided to the secretary of homeland security by the real id act but the court rejected plaintiffs constitutional challenge and dismissed the claim133 consequently the plaintiffs have filed petition for writ of certiorari to the us supreme court which is still pending unintended consequences considerable evidence shows that the usbps historical strategy of prevention through deterrence whereby agents and resources including border fencing and other barriers have been concentrated along urban areas and areas traditionally featuring high levels of ille gal entry has succeeded in changing the flow of illegal migration while san diego ca and paso tx were hi storically the two sectors that featured the most apprehensions and the highest levels of illegal immigration since the mid1990s and the advent of oper ations gatekeeper and hold the line in those sectors the more remote geographical areas of the arizona border have become the hotspots for illegal migration into the united states one unintended consequence of this enforcement posture and the shift in migration patterns has been an increase in the number of migrant d eaths each year on average 200 migrants died each year in the early 1990s compared with 472 migrant deaths in 2005 another unintended consequence of this enforcem ent posture may have been relative increase compared with the national average in crime along the border in these more remote regions while crime rates in san diego and paso have declined over the past 15 years the reduction in crime rates along the more rural areas of the border have lagged behind the nati onal trends another unint ended consequence of the border fencing has been the proliferation of tunnels dug underneath the border in san diego where the doublelayer sandia fe ncing has been constructed smugglershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33659crs41 have dug numerous tunnels underneath the bor der fence one such tunnel was almost kilometer long and was built from reinforced concrete evidence of rather sophisticated smuggling operation possible issue for congress to consider as it debates expanding the existing border fencing is what the unintended cons equences of this expansion could be given the rerouting of migration flows that have already occurred are dhs and the relevant border communities prepared to handle the increased flow of illegal migration to nonreinforced areas is dhs pr epared to deal with an increase in the phenomenon of crossborder tunne ls and other attempts to defeat the purpose of the fencing
