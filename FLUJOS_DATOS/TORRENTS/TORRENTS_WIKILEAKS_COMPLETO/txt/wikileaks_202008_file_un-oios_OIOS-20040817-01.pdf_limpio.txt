without adequate justification in comparison to other cocs of the secretariat unog unov and unon oios found that the unhcr coc is focussed to meet emerge ncy oriented procurement requirements the rules and procedures have been framed to ensure prompt decisionmaking furthermore unlike the recommendatory authority of the other co cs the chairperson of the unhcr coc has decisionmaking authority oios concurs with such an approach the 1999 rules and procedures have undergone numb er of changes or have partly become obsolete formal amendment of the rules and proce dures by the high commissioner is required tentative plenary session of the coc is set on 03 s eptember 2004 to review the coc issues in oios opinion certain revisions should be made t the current rules and procedures so that coc can better meet operational requirements nd further enhance its compliance efficiency and effectiveness the composition of the coc should be modified with better balance between operations and resource managers the regional bureaux as the main requisitioners should be represented the legal officer should become regular member in stead of being an observer some of the current members whose functions and responsibiliti within unhcr are of little relevance to the functions of the coc could be replaced the chang ed composition would enhance the cocs expertise on operational and legal aspects the coc would meet in plenary session and revise the membership of the committee the alternate chairperson should be nominated among the regular members to ensure the continuity and consistency of the coc decisions the proposed revision to the coc membership would address this issue the position of the secretary of the coc within the supply management service may affect the independent functioning of the coc the secreta ry should be independent of sms and report directly to the chairperson of the coc or another fficial in the controllers office furthermore an alternate secretary should be designated in future the coc secretary would report directly to the controller or alternatively to the executive as sistant to the controller also two staff members have been designated as regular alternate s ecretaries to the coc the controller has dual role in the approval of mergency cases as the supervisor of sms the controller approves the request for consid ering cases under emergency procedures as chairperson of the coc the controller has the fina l decision in substance on the case the approval of the emergency procedures may therefore be perceived as facto approval in substance and thus affect the independent review by the other coc members this procedure should be revised the procedure was revised immediately control deficiencies were found in the reporting of related contracts to the coc such as delayed reporting missing reports and overthresho ld orders the new procurement information system should address this issue and strengthen the oversight over related contracts sms would address these issues during the second phase of the msrp the support provided by the coc to the lccs establi shed and functioning in the various field offices is limited there were problems in t he functioning of the lccs like ineligible membership expost facto submissions and approval in excess of delegated authority the coc should establish quality control over the lcc activ ities by ensuring standard operating guidelines and periodic monitoring the controller would shortly issue memo to all re presentatives august 2004 table of contents

in the in order to ident ify best practices and to establish benchmarks iv audit findings and recommendations mandate 8 in accordance with article 1010 of the unh cr financial rules the high commissioner has issued in april 1999 the current rules and procedures of the unhcr committees on contracts by iom381999fom391999 according to section 15 of the rules and procedures they may be amended by the hi gh commissioner upon the recommendation of plenary meeting of the committe on contracts established at headquarters 9 subsequently several changes to the rules and procedures have taken place while according to the 1999 rules and procedures the coc shall be composed of six members the coc currently has only four members furthermore t he emergency procedures per section 13 have been amended and the threshold for the notific ation of related contracts has been revised also after the abolition of the regional directorates in africa the provisions of section 72 on regional committees on contracts hav become partly obsolete these adhoc revisions to its rules and procedures had been incl uded in different sections of the unhcr manual at different times according to iom108200 1 fom105 2001 the revised rules and procedures were placed as an annex to chapter 4 programme management of the unhcr manual the revisions in april 2003 iom 26 2003 fom 262003 were placed as an annex to chapter 2 organisational structur and responsibilities whereas chapter 8 of the unhcr manual supply management only cont ains reference to the rules and procedures governing the cocs 10 while the coc has discussed proposed amend ments to its rules and procedures in four meetings 1055th in october 2001 1057th in vember 2001 1061st in november 2001 and 1095th in november 2002 formal amendment h as taken place in order to ensure proper legal basis for the cocs operation the rul and procedures should be formally amended by the high commissioner 3 recommendation head2right unhcr should formally amend the rules and procedure s governing the unhcr committees on contracts in accordance with section 15 of the current rules to reflect changes made in the past and to achieve more bala nced composition of the coc membership the revised rules and procedures should be included in chapter 8 supply management of the unhcr manual rec01 11 the chairperson accepted the recommendation and ind icated that plenary session of the coc had been tentatively scheduled for 3 sep tember 2004 to discuss and recommend changes for approval by the high commissioner oios will keep the recommendation open until the rules and procedures have been formally mended b composition of the coc membership of the coc 12 based on the audit oios is of the opinion that the current membership of the coc should be reviewed and revised according to sectio n 21 of the rules and procedures the coc shall be composed of six members namely the c ontroller chairperson the head financial resources service the deputy director d the chief pcossdos the head drrmsdci and the chief possdip although the ru and procedures have never been amended the coc is currently composed of only four members the position of head financial resources service having been abolished and the deputy director dos longer attending during the discussions some of the cu rrent members believed that their functions and responsibilities within unhcr were not relevant to the functions of the coc the chief possdip rarely attended any of the coc meetings ven after formal notice by the chairperson the head of drrmsdci regularly sent h is deputy alternate member to attend coc meetings both members did not see any r ationale in continuing as coc members oios concurs that there is evident need for dci and dip to be represented on the coc the membership of dci and dip should therefore be r econsidered 13 oios noted that while dos dci and dip ar represented on the coc as regular members the regional bureaux who are the major re quisitioners are not in order to adequately reflect the views of the bureaux and fie ld offices in the cocs deliberations at least one of the regular members should represent t he regional bureaux the regular membership of the regional bureaux could be on ro tational basis so that all bureaux are represented in the coc at some point in time this would make the coc decisions more representative and authoritative 14 there are currently two exofficio members in coc representative of the internal audit service and the legal officer they attend th meetings as observers due to its independent functions the internal audits exoffi cio capacity is justified however oios does not see why the legal officer should be limit ed to observer status the legal officer should be regular member of coc to effectively re view the legal aspects of the contracts and other procurement activities this would expand the expertise of the coc membership 15 according to section 5 of the rules and pr ocedures three members including the chairperson form quorum with currently only fou r members in the coc it is sometimes 4 difficult to reach quorum during the discussions oios learnt that due to unforeseen work and official missions of some of the members it is sometimes difficult to organise meeting due to lack of quorum oios also noted in the 1078 th meeting on 17 may 2002 there were only two members present and in an emergency case tents purchased for pakistan on 20 september 2001 only two members approved the case instead of three in view of the specific nature of the unhcr functions and the urgency of it s requirements oios suggests increasing the membership of coc to six including t he chairperson with quorum of four members this would provide adequate representation of the various departments of unhcr more flexibility in organising meetings regularly nd would also facilitate reaching quorum 16 the unhcr coc is unique in nature general ly in the system cocs and their chairpersons hcc unog unov and unon have only r ecommendatory authority whereas higher authority takes the final decision on the contract award in unhcr the chairperson of the coc on the basis of the advice by the members has final decisionmaking authority on the case this process drastically sho rtens the time required for decisionmaking and allows rapid response to emergency requiremen ts the chairperson of the unhcr coc has thus critical and decisive role 17 currently the chief budget section serve s as the first alternate chairperson of the coc however he is not regular member of the coc but only an alternate member this arrangement needs to be revised oios review of the 114 meetings indicated that the first alternate chairperson chaired 25 meetings and other coc members chaired 10 meetings considering the critical role played by the chairpe rson the first alternate chairperson should become regular member his continued presence in the coc would ensure continuity and consistency of deliberations and decisions in the absence of the chairperson 18 oios recommended that the unhcr controller in his capacity as chairperson of the coc should initiate revision of the membership f the coc the chairperson stated that the coc would meet in plenary session and revise the membership of the committee with the proposed representation of head of financial rvices as first alternate chairperson member chief of pcos second alternate chairperson member head of drrms third alternate chairpersonmember chief of poss member chief of ess member chief of member and chief of technical support section member the respective section service deputies will serve as alternates to the co c members 19 oios welcomes the intended revision of the membership and will keep recommendation 01 open until the new composition f the membership has been incorporated in the amended rules and procedures the secretary of the coc 20 the main functions of the secretary of the coc are notifying the members about the meetings circulation of documentation and drafting the minutes and circulating the approved minutes of the coc furthermore the secretary is lso responsible for the opening and recording of the bids and tender documents the pos ition of secretary of the coc is presently situated within the supply management service repo rting to the chief logistics unit his reporting officer for the par in oios view the c urrent reporting arrangement may affect the independent functioning of the coc the secreta ry should be independent of sms to maintain the integrity of his functions therefore the secretary should be reporting either 5 directly to the chairperson of the coc or to anothe r official in the controllers office with line responsibility for procurement 21 the review found that since september 2003 alternate secretary has been appointed to the coc as result in april 2004 meeting had to be cancelled due to the illness of the secretary and two cases scheduled fo r that meeting had to be approved using emergency procedures regular alternate secretary needs to be assigned to ensure continuity of the coc functions oios recommended t hat the function of the secretary of coc should be segregated from sms and that the secr etary reports either directly to the chairperson of the coc or to another official in th controllers office sms confirmed that in future the coc secretary would report directly t the controller or alternatively to the executive assistant to the controller also two sta ff members were designated as regular alternate secretaries to the coc c functioning of the committee convening of the meetings 22 the coc meets regularly every friday at 9 00 am oios is satisfied that the coc secretary notified all the members well in advance of the scheduled meetings and the agenda the chairperson reserved the right to cancel meet ing when less than two submissions are received by the coc secretary by the deadline of bmission of proposals in instances when only one proposal was available the consideration of the proposal was normally postponed until the next meeting however in number of ins tances the cancelling of the meeting resulted in recourse to approval under emergency pr ocedures oios has concerns with this practice in such situations the chairperson shoul d determine the urgency of the proposal and convene meeting to give the coc the benefit of di scussing the case and approve the case coc could also use the interactive communication to ols such as telephone conference or mail exchange in its discussions oios recommended that the coc should convene normal meeting to consider single proposal if urgent i n order to avoid unjustified recourse to emergency procedures the chairperson agreed to implement this recommenda tion submissions to the coc 23 oios assessed the timeliness and the compl eteness of the documents submitted by the requisitioners and sms to the coc and found them to be generally satisfactory however there were few shortcomings the desks and the requ esting units had to submit the submissions to the secretary of the coc by 1200 on every wednesday the secretary of the coc would then prepare the agenda and forward t he cases to the coc members in this process the actual time available to the members t review the cases was less than 48 hours before the meeting which is inadequate especially in complex cases sometimes there were more than four cases that require time to review i n few instances cases were submitted on the day before the meeting in order to address this is sue the chairperson of coc emphasized on several occasions april 2003 and december 2002 th importance of timely submission of cases notwithstanding this the submissions were d elayed on several occasions coc should consider revising the deadline to every tuesday noo n for submission of proposals and in coordination with the desks and sms ensure adherenc to the deadline 6 24 oios recommended that the coc should revis the deadline for submission of cases to the coc to every tuesday and request sms to ensu re adherence the chairperson accepted revised submission deadline of tuesday 3 pm instead to comply with the 48hour notice requirement oios welcomes this change 25 regarding the completeness of the proposal s certain inadequacies were noticed there was clear format for the submission of the propo sals in some instances important information was not provided or the necessary docum ents like price evaluation was not properly clarified or the price comparison tables n ot properly validated during the meeting on 4 april 2004 observed by oios team the requisit ioner distributed additional information during the meeting this should have been sent to t he members in advance for adequate review 26 in particular submissions from field offi ces although jointly signed by the head of desk concerned and by the chief sms were not alwa ys clear detailed and complete the proposals from the field need to be thoroughly revi ewed by sms before submission to the coc in order to address the issue of completeness of the proposals sms is drafting checklist oios believes that this would ensure pro per review of the cases by sms prior to forwarding them to the secretary of the coc oios lso suggests that the secretary should do random verification of the proposals for the comp leteness submissions that do not meet the basic formal requirements should be returned t the requesting unit recommendation head2right in order to ensure that submissions to the coc meet minimum requirements the unhcr supply management s ervice and the secretary of the coc should review the prop osals for completeness before transmitting them to the coc mbers in addition sms should develop checklist for field offices for the preparation of coc submissions rec 02 27 sms and coc secretary accepted the recommendation sms would draw checklist andor standard format of coc proposals as guide for field offices and would be communicated in all staff email sms had started d eveloping standard checklists eg for lease agreements and would continue to draft forms of submissions incorporating guidelines set by the coc oios would await the outcome of this exercise attendance at the meetings 28 the quorum of at least three members was genera lly achieved in the coc meetings except on one occasion 1078 th meeting of 17 may 2002 in which only two members attended the meeting oios is also satisfied that t he requisitioners attend the meetings to present the case and clarify the issues raised by t he members however oios is concerned that some of the regular members although present i n headquarters do not attend the meetings instead they send their alternates eg the head drrmsdci and the chief pcosdos regularly sent their alternates to attend the coc meetings oios wishes to highlight that coc members serve in their personal capacity and that alternate members should only attend if the regular members are unav ailable unhcr while reconstituting the coc as recommended in this report should ensure tha t the regular members attend the coc 7 and their alternates attend only in the absence of the regular member minutes of the meetings 29 oios reviewed the minutes of the meetings and n oted that the proceedings of the meetings were recorded and minutes drawn the minut fairly reflected the proceedings and discussions of the cases nonetheless oios found that in the past some minutes were kept only in draft format meeting 1080 1081 1082 108 4 and 1099 without approval oios also noted that the current secretary of the coc has scientiously ensured the proper clearance and approval of the minutes since he assumed his ne w functions emergency procedures 30 according to section 13 of the rules and proced ures emergency procedures will be followed whenever an immediate review on specifi c submission is required and formal meeting cannot be convened in time oios noted that between 2001 and 2003 total of 40 cases 23 in 2001 17 in 2002 and 10 in 2003 whic h constituted 95 percent of all total cases were approved under emergency procedures the tota l amount of these cases was us 248 million representing 15 percent of the financial v alue of the cases for 18 of the cases oios is not convinced that the use of emergency procedur was justified between 14 and 20 december 2002 eight cases were approved under emer gency procedures although exigency existed on the ground that there was c oc meeting during that period three other cases related to the renewal of the annual ai r charter services and could have been foreseen with proper monitoring on 30 april 2002 the coc approved major case of us 876 million purchase of timber for afghanistan u nder emergency procedures in the view of oios contract award of this volume should not ve been approved without the coc meeting and deliberating oios recommended that the head of sms should ensure that emergency procedures are invoked only for justified cases the recommendation was brought into effect immediately 31 oios reviewed the emergency procedure approval process and noted the dual role of the controller as the supervising official of sms the controller approved the request for the consideration of proposal under emergency p rocedures then the proposal is circulated to two other members for approval and fi nally approved by the controller in his capacity as the chairperson of the coc there is risk that the approval of the emergency procedure by the controller may be perceived by the other members as facto approval in substance and may thus affect their review oios re commended that the unhcr controller should delegate the approval of emergency procedure s to the head of sms the recommendation was brought into effect immediately 32 cases approved under emergency procedures are s ubsequently submitted to the coc for information the coc only takes note of these c ases the emergency procedure cases were promptly submitted to the coc except for one case approved on 26 september 2002 which was reported to coc only on 10 january 2003 simila rly in another emergency proposal iraq stockpile on 26 december 2002 the member and his alternate approved the proposal although these are rare cases sms should ensure mely reporting and proper approval of all emergency proposals to the coc 8 expost facto cases 33 between 2001 and 2003 the coc considered and t ook note of 15 cases on an expost facto basis the post facto was attributable to the delayed renewal of longterm contracts local procurement by field offices in excess of the authority delegated to the local committee on contracts and so on considering that the coc ets weekly and that its procedures ensure expedient decisions oios considers the expost fac to cases as unjustified unhcr needs to establish tracking mechanism to monitor the expiry of the longterm contracts and establish proper oversight of the local procurement and lcc ctivities the coc secretary had agreed to take on this additional task related contracts 34 according to section 71 b the coc shall be notified of all contracts with single vendor during period of 12 months which exceed certain threshold oios found certain deficiencies in the reporting of related contracts by sms only 33 related contracts exceeding the procurement threshold total amounts of us 61 million generated by the procurement information system were reported to coc oios found 28 other cases meeting the criteria which had not been reported there were delays in notifying the coc in some cases up to five months the deficiencies are attributable to v arious factors the automatic report generation by unhcr itts without any verification b sms the absence of any logging system of such cases by the secretary of the coc an d input errors in the information system by sms sms should strengthen its information syste m to track the related contracts and report them promptly to the coc oios recommended t hat the sms should enhance its information system so that all related contracts in excess of us 200000 are reported to coc in time sms stated that the implementation of this recommen dation being technical issue was scheduled during the second phase of the msrp d local committee on contracts issues 35 in accordance with 24 of the rules and procedu res the representativechief of mission may establish local committee on contract s lcc in field office the composition of the lcc shall be communicated to the controller and to the head of sms copies of the lcc minutes shall be sent to the secr etary of the coc 36 most unhcr country offices and number of unhc r suboffices have indeed established an lcc however the secretary of the coc had only information on 19 lccs the coc is not aware of how many lccs have been est ablished and functioning in the field offices oios considers this major weakness appa rently many representativeschiefs of mission do not inform the controller of the establi shment and composition of their lcc nor do they sent the minutes of the lcc to the secretar of the coc oios recommended that the unhcr controller in his capacity as chairperson of the coc should request all representatives to inform on the establishment and composition of their lccs and to ensure that the lcc minutes are periodically submitted to the secretary of the coc the controller confirmed that he would shortly issue memorandum to all representatives to this effect 37 according to section 14 of the rules and proced ures the lcc minutes received shall be presented periodically to the chairperson and mbers of the coc this has not been done instead the minutes received were simply file d oios review of the documents 9 received from lccs disclosed that several lccs made compliance errors including ineligible membership expost facto submissions and approval in excess of its delegated authority etc oios suggested that the chairperson of the coc blish quality review mechanism for lccs with results reported periodically to the coc oios recommended that the secretary of the coc should review the quality of lcc minutes re ceived and advise representatives on any improvements needed this recommendation was brought into effect immedia tely as soon as the coc secretary received the lcc minutes and the lcc composition information they were passed on to the chief of pr ocurement and contracts section in sms for review and feedback the quarterly quality revi ew report would be prepared starting the third quarter of 2004 july to september 2004 other issues 38 based on the audit oios highlights the followi ng issues and suggestions for consideration without however making any formal r ecommendations 39 the biannual statistical reports of the coc wer quite informative however the format and content of these reports could be improv ed by including information relating to the emergency cases expost facto cases waiver of com petitive bidding cases framework agreements cases and contract review or revision ca ses this would enhance cocs analytical capability and oversight of special cases in the meeting held on 02 july 2004 the coc secretary submitted these reports in his biannual report for the period january to june 2004 40 there is need for mechanism to address diss enting opinions in the coc under rules the official approving the contract award asg ocss at unhq or dgexecutive director at offices away from headquarters may dev iate from the recommendation of the committee on contracts if this is properly documen ted according to the unhcr procedures the chairperson takes decisions based n the advice of the coc members procedure is foreseen in case the chairpersons cision deviates from the advice given by the majority of the members while in the past mo st decisions have been made on consensus basis oios believes that there is need for for mal procedure in case of dissenting opinion between the majority of the members and the chairpe rson the controller confirmed that any dissenting views would be properly recorded in the future sms suggested that this issue be discussed at the envisaged coc plenary meeting v acknowledgement 41 i wish to express my appreciation for the assis tance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the members of the unhcr coc and the st aff of sms egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services 10
