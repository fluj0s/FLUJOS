orourke specialist in naval affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division navy nuclearpowered surface ships background issues and options for congress summary some members of congress particularly on the house armed services committee have expressed interest in expanding the use of nuclear power to wider array of navy surface ships including the navys planned cgx cruiser section 1012 of the fy2008 defense authorization act hr 4986pl 110181 of january 28 2008 makes it us policy to construct the major combatant ships of the navy including the cgx with integrated nuclear power systems unless the secretary of defense submits notification to congress that the inclusion of an integrated nuclear power system in given class of ship is not in the national interest the navy has studied nuclear power as design option for the cgx but has not yet announced whether it would prefer to build the cgx as nuclearpowered ship 2006 navy study concluded the following among other things in constant fy2007 dollars building navy surface combatant or amphibious ship with nuclear power rather than conventional power would add roughly 600 million to 800 million to its procurement cost the total lifecycle cost of nuclearpowered mediumsize surface combatant would equal that of conventionally powered medium size surface combatant if the cost of crude oil averages 70 per barrel to 225 per barrel over the life of the ship nuclearpower should be considered for nearterm applications for mediumsize surface combatants compared to conventionally powered ships nuclearpowered ships have advantages in terms of both time needed to surge to distant theater of operation for contingency and in terms of operational presence time on station in the theater of operation in assessing whether the cgx or other future navy surface ships should be nuclearpowered congress may consider number of issues including cost operational effectiveness ship construction ship maintenance and repair crew

background issues and options for congress introduction and issue for congress some members of congress particularly on the house armed services committee have expressed interest in expanding the use of nuclear power to wider array of navy surface ships starting with the navys planned cgx cruiser section 1012 of the fy2008 defense authorization act hr 4986pl 110181 of january 28 2008 makes it us policy to construct the major combatant ships of the navy including the cgx with integrated nuclear power systems unless the secretary of defense submits notification to congress that the inclusion of an integrated nuclear power system in given class of ship is not in the national interest the navy has studied nuclear power as design option for the cgx but has not yet announced whether it would prefer to build the cgx as nuclearpowered ship the issue for congress is whether the cgx or other future navy surface ships should be nuclearpowered congresss decisions on this issue could affect among other things future navy capabilities navy funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base background nuclear and conventional power for ships nuclear and conventional power in brief most military ships and large commercial ships are conventionally powered meaning that they burn petroleumbased fuel such as marine diesel to generate power for propulsion and for operating shipboard equipment conventionally powered ships are sometimes called fossil fuel ships crs2 some military ships are nuclearpowered meaning that they use an onboard nuclear reactor to generate power for propulsion and shipboard equipment1 nuclear powered military ships are operated today by the united states the united kingdom france russia and china some other countries such as india have expressed interest in or conducted research and development work on nuclearpowered military ships military ships use of nuclear power is not an indication of whether it carries nuclear weapons nuclearpowered military ship can lack nuclear weapons and conventionally powered military ship can be armed with nuclear weapons nuclear power for surface combatant for surface combatant like cruiser using nuclear power rather than conventional power eliminates the need for the ship to periodically refuel during extended operations at sea refueling ship during longdistance transit can reduce its average transit speed refueling ship that is located in theater of operations can temporarily reduce its ability to perform its missions nuclearpowered surface combatant can steam at sustained high speeds to distant theater of operations commence operations in the theater immediately upon arrival and continue operating in the theater over time all without need for refueling2 in contrast conventionally powered surface combatant might need to slow down for atsea refueling at least once during highspeed longdistance transit might need to refuel again upon arriving at the theater of operations and might need to refuel periodically while in the theater of operations particularly if the ships operations in theater require frequent or continuous movement table 1 shows the unrefueled cruising ranges of the navys existing conventionally powered cruisers and destroyers at speed of 20 knots along with transit distances from major us navy home ports to potential us navy operating areas navy surface combatants have maximum sustained speeds of more than 30 knots speed of 20 knots is moderately fast longdistance transit speed for navy surface combatant for 1 us navy nuclearpowered ships use pressurized water reactors pwrs that are fueled with highly enriched uranium in pwr water flowing through the reactor is heated by the nuclear fuel to high temperature the water is pressurized maintained at high pressure so that it does not boil as it heats up heat exchanger is then used to transfer heat from the radioactive pressurized water to separate circuit of nonradioactive water as the nonradioactive water heats up it turns into steam that is used to power turbines that drive the ships propellers and generate power for shipboard equipment small number of nonmilitary ships have been built with nuclear power in recent decades including the usbuilt commercial cargo ship ns savannah three other commercial cargo ships built in germany japan and the soviet union and several sovietrussianbuilt nuclearpowered icebreakers the four cargo ships are longer in service more recently the center for the commercial deployment of transportation technologies ccdott of california state university long beach has examined the potential costeffectiveness of building new generation of nuclearpowered commercial cargo ships 2 for an aircraft carrier the use of nuclear power permits space inside the ship that would have been used for storing ship fuel to be used instead for storing aircraft fuel or other supplies this lengthens the period of time that carrier can sustain aircraft operations before needing to take on fuel or other supplies crs3 higher transit speed such as 25 knots the unrefueled cruising ranges would be less than those shown in the table because the amount of fuel needed to travel certain distance rises with ship speed particularly as speeds increase above about 15 knots table 1 unrefueled cruising ranges and transit distances in nautical miles unrefueled

expended in combat and other supplies these resupply operations can temporarily reduce the ships ability to perform its missions us navy nuclearpowered ships naval nuclear propulsion program the navys nuclear propulsion program began in 1948 the navys first nuclearpowered ship the submarine nautilus ssn571 was commissioned into service on september 30 1954 and went to sea for the first time on january 17 1955 the navys first nuclearpowered surface ships the cruiser long beach cgn9 and the aircraft carrier enterprise cvn65 were commissioned into service on september 9 1961 and november 25 1961 respectively the navys nuclear propulsion program is overseen and directed by an office called naval reactors nr which exists simultaneously as part of both the navy where it forms part of the naval sea systems command and the department of energy where it forms part of the national nuclear security administration nr crs4 has broad cradletograve responsibility for the navys nuclearpropulsion program this responsibility is set forth in executive order 12344 of february 1 1982 the text of which was effectively incorporated into the us code at 50 usc 25113 by section 1634 of the fy1985 defense authorization act hr 5167pl 98525 of october 19 1984 and again by section 3216 of the fy2000 defense authorization act s 1059pl 10665 of october 5 1999 nr has established reputation for maintaining very high safety standards for engineering and operating navy nuclear power plants the first director of nr was admiral hyman rickover who served in the position from 1948 until 1982 rickover is sometimes referred to as the father of the nuclear navy the current director is admiral kirkland donald who became director in november 2004 he is the fifth person to hold the position current navy nuclearpowered ships as of the end of fy2007 the navys nuclearpowered fleet included all 71 of its submarines and 10 of its 11 aircraft carriers the navys combat submarine force has been entirely nuclear powered since 19904 the navys carrier force is to become entirely nuclear powered in 20085 earlier navy nuclearpowered cruisers in addition to nuclearpowered submarines and nuclearpowered carriers the navy in the past built and operated nine nuclearpowered cruisers cgns the nine ships which are shown in table 2 include three oneofakind designs cgns 9 25 and 35 followed by the twoship california cgn36 class and the fourship virginia cgn38 class the nuclearpowered cruisers shown in table 2 were procured to provide nuclearpowered escorts for the navys nuclearpowered carriers procurement of nuclearpowered cruisers was halted after fy1975 largely due to desire to constrain the procurement costs of future cruisers in deciding in the late 1970s on the design for the new cruiser that would carry the aegis defense system two nuclearpowered aegisequipped options 17200ton nuclearpowered strike cruiser csgn and 12100ton derivative of the cgn38 class design were rejected in favor of third option of placing the aegis system onto the smaller conventionally powered hull originally developed for the spruance dd963 class destroyer the csgn was estimated to have procurement cost twice that of the dd963based option while the cgn42 was estimated to have procurement cost 3050 greater than that of the dd963based option the dd963based option became the 9500ton ticonderoga cg47 class aegis cruiser the first aegis cruiser was procured in fy1978 3 see also 42 usc 7158 4 the navys final three nonnuclearpowered combat submarines were procured in fy1956 entered

initial fuel core for navy nuclearpowered ship is installed during the construction of the ship the procurement cost of the fuel core is included in the total procurement cost of the ship which is funded in the navys shipbuilding budget known formally as the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn appropriation account in constant fy2007 dollars the initial fuel core for virginia ssn774 class submarine costs about 170 million the initial fuel cores for an aircraft carrier which uses two reactors and therefore has two fuel cores have combined cost of about 660 million6 the procurement cost of conventionally powered navy ship in contrast does not include the cost of petroleumbased fuel needed to operate the ship and this fuel is procured largely through the operation and maintenance navy

about fy20179 the navy is currently assessing cgx design options in large study called the cgx analysis of alternatives aoa known more formally as the maritime air and missile defense of joint forces mamdjf aoa the navy initiated this aoa in fy2006 and planned to complete it in fy2007 nuclear power was an option studied in the aoa the navy at one point stated preference for basing the cgx design on the hull design of the navys new ddg1000 destroyer which is conventionally powered ship with displacement of about 14987 tons the navy has stated that it wants to equip the cgx with combat system featuring powerful radar capable of supporting ballistic missile defense bmd operations10 the navy has testified that this combat system is to have power output of 30 or 31 megawatts which is several times the power output of the combat system on the navys existing cruisers and destroyers11 this suggests that in terms of power used for combat system operations the cgx might use substantially more energy over the course of its life than the navys existing cruisers and destroyers as discussed later in this report ships lifecycle energy use is factor in evaluating the economic competitiveness of nuclear power compared to conventional power reactor plant for nuclearpowered cgx the navy testified in 2007 that in the navys 2006 study on alternative ship propulsion systems see section below the notional mediumsized surface combatant in the study which the study defined as ship with displacement between 21000 metric tons and 26000 metric tons used modified version of onehalf of the reactor

officials to the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 crs7 developed for its new gerald r ford cvn78 class aircraft carriers also called the cvn21 class12 the fordclass reactor plant like the reactor plant on the navys existing nimitz cvn68 class aircraft carriers is twin reactor plant that includes two nuclear reactors13 the mediumsized surface combatant employed modified version of onehalf of this plant with single reactor this suggests that if the cgx is ship with displacement of 21000 or more metric tons its reactor plant could be modified version of onehalf of the fordclass reactor plant this approach would minimize the time and cost of developing reactor plant for nuclearpowered cgx in the ford class the initial nuclear fuel cores in the two reactors are to be sufficient to power the ship for onehalf of its expected life of 40 to 50 years in nuclearpowered cgx the navy has said the initial fuel core in the single reactor would be sufficient to power the ship for its entire expected life of 30 to 35 years since the two fuel cores for an aircraft carrier cost about 660 million in constant fy2007 dollars see previous section on initial fuel cores the cost of single fuel core for cgx might be about 330 million in constant fy2007 dollars construction shipyards nuclearcapable shipyards two us

is not certified to build nuclearpowered ships16 recent navy studies for congress the navy has conducted two recent studies for congress on the potential cost effectiveness of expanding the use of nuclear power to wider array of surface ships these studies are the 2005 naval reactors quick look analysis and the more comprehensive and detailed 2006 navy alternative propulsion study each of these is discussed below 2005 naval reactors quick look analysis the 2005 nr quick look analysis was conducted at the request of representative roscoe bartlett who was then chairman of the projection forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee since renamed the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee the analysis concluded that the total lifecycle cost meaning the sum of procurement cost lifecycle operating and support cost and postretirement disposal cost of nuclearpowered version of largedeck lhatype amphibious assault ship would equal that of conventionally powered version of such ship if the cost of crude oil over the life of the ship averaged about 70 per barrel the study concluded that the total lifecycle cost of nuclearpowered surface combatant would equal that of conventionally powered version if the cost of crude oil over the life of the ship averaged about 178 per barrel this kind of calculation is called lifecycle cost breakeven analysis the study noted but did not attempt to quantify the mobilityrelated operational advantages of nuclear propulsion for surface ship17 15 ingalls built its nuclearpowered submarines at its older east bank facility ingalls newer west bank facility has been used for building conventionally powered surface ships principally surface combatants and largedeck amphibious ships 16 in addition to building 12 nuclearpowered submarines northrop grumman states that ingalls facilities allowed ingalls to participate in submarine overhaul and refueling by the time the shipyards nuclear facility was decommissioned in 1980 11 us navy attack submarines had been overhauled andor refueled at ingalls source northrop grumman chronological perspective on northrop grumman ship systems at httpwwwssnorthropgrummancomcompanychronologicalhtml 17 us naval nuclear propulsion program briefing entitled nuclear and fossil fuel powered surface ships quick look analysis presented to crs on march 22 2006 the analysis concluded that total lifecycle costs for nuclearpowered versions of largedeck aircraft carriers lhatype amphibious assault ships and surface combatants would equal those of conventionally powered versions when the price of diesel fuel marine dfm delivered to the navy reached 55 80 and 205 per barrel respectively since the cost of dfm delivered to the navy was calculated to be roughly 15 greater than that of crude oil these figures corresponded to breakeven crudeoil costs of about 48 70 and 178 per barrel respectively crs9 2006 navy alternative propulsion study the more comprehensive and detailed 2006 navy alternative propulsion study was conducted in response to section 130 of the fy2006 defense authorization act hr 1815 pl 109163 of january 6 2006 which called for such study see appendix the study reached number of conclusions including the following in constant fy2007 dollars building navy surface combatant or amphibious ship with nuclear power rather than conventional power would add roughly 600 million to 800 million to its procurement cost for small surface combatant the procurementcost increase was about 600 million for mediumsize combatant defined as ship with displacement between 21000 metric tons and 26000 metric tons the increase was about 600 million to about 700 million for an amphibious ship the increase was about 800 million18 although nuclearpowered ships have higher procurement costs than conventionally powered ships they have lower operating and support costs when fuel costs are taken into account ships operational tempo and resulting level of energy use significantly influences the lifecycle cost breakeven analysis the higher the operational tempo and resulting level of energy use assumed for the ship lower the cost of crude oil needed to break even on lifecycle cost basis and the more competitive nuclear power becomes in terms of total lifecycle cost the newly calculated lifecycle cost breakeven costranges which supercede the breakeven cost figures from the 2005 nr quick look analysis are as follows 210 per barrel to 670 per barrel for small surface combatant 70 per barrel to 225 per barrel for mediumsize surface combatant and 210 per barrel to 290 per barrel for an amphibious ship in each case the lower dollar figure is for high ship operating tempo and the higher dollar figure is for low ship operating tempo 18 in each case the cost increase is for the fifth ship in class being built at two shipyards crs10 at crude oil cost of 7415 per barrel which was market price at certain points in 2006 the lifecycle cost premium of nuclear power is 17 to 37 for small surface combatant 0 to 10 for medium sized surface combatant and 7 to 8 for an amphibious ship the lifecycle cost breakeven analysis indicates that nuclearpower should be considered for nearterm applications for mediumsize surface combatants and that lifecycle cost will not drive the selection of nuclear power for small surface combatants or amphibious ships nuclearpowered mediumsize surface combatant is the most likely of the three ship types studied to prove economical depending on the operating tempo that the ship actually experiences over its lifetime compared to conventionally powered ships nuclearpowered ships have advantages in terms of both time needed to surge to distant theater of operation for contingency and operational presence time on station in the theater of operation19 potential issues for congress in assessing whether the cgx or other future navy surface ships should be nuclearpowered congress may consider number of issues including cost operational effectiveness ship construction ship maintenance and repair crew training ports calls and forward homeporting and environmental impact each of these is discussed below cost development and design cost the cost calculations presented in the 2006 navy alternative propulsion study do not include the additional upfront design and development costs if any for nuclearpowered surface ship as discussed in the background section if the cgx displaces 21000 or more metric tons the navy could have the option of fitting the cgx with modified version of onehalf of the ford cvn78 class aircraft carrier nuclear power plant this could minimize the upfront development cost of the cgx nuclear power plant if the cgx is not large enough to accommodate modified version of onehalf of the fordclass plant then new nuclear plant would need to be designed for the cgx although this 19 source statement of the honorable dr delores m etter assistant secretary of the navy research development and acquisition et before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee on integrated nuclear power systems for future naval surface combatants march 1 2007 pp 45 crs11 new plant could use components common to the fordclass plant or other existing navy nuclear plants the cost of developing this new plant would likely be greater than the cost of modifying the fordclass plant design procurement cost for the cgx as mentioned in the background section the navy has stated preference for basing the design of the cgx on the design of its new ddg1000 class destroyer which is conventionally powered ship this approach could result in conventionally powered cgx design with procurement cost similar to that of the ddg1000 if conventionally powered cgx were to have procurement cost equal to that of the ddg1000 design then nuclearpowered cgx might cost roughly 32 to 37 more than conventionally powered cgx20 if conventionally powered cgx were to have procurement cost greater than that of the ddg1000 then the percentage procurement cost premium for nuclear power for the cgx would be less than 32 to 37 the 2006 navy study states that for mediumsize surface combatant that is larger than the ddg1000 an additional cost of about 600 million to 700 million would equate to procurement cost increase of about 22 if building navy surface combatant or amphibious ship with nuclear power rather than conventional power would add roughly 600 million to 700 million to its procurement cost then procuring one or two nuclearpowered cgxs per year as called for in the navys 30year shipbuilding plan would cost roughly 600 million to 1400 million more per year than procuring one or two conventionally powered cgxs per year and procuring force of 19 nuclearpowered cgxs would cost roughly 114 billion to 133 billion more than procuring force of 19 conventionally powered cgxs for purposes of comparison the navy has requested total of 137 billion for the scn account for fy2008 for submarines and aircraft carriers the navy in 2007 estimated that building the cgx or other future navy surface ships with nuclear power could reduce the production cost of nuclearpropulsion components for submarines and aircraft carriers by 5 to 9 depending on the number of nuclearpowered surface ships that are built21 building one nuclearpowered cruiser every two years the navy has testified might reduce nuclearpropulsion component costs by about 7 in steadystate production environment the navy testified in 2007 the savings 20 the navy in 2007 estimated that followon ddg1000 destroyers would cost an average of about 19 billion each to procure in constant fy2007 dollars this figure was based on the thenyear costs for the third through seventh ships in the ddg1000 class which the navy wants to procure in fy2009fy2013 these costs were converted into constant fy2007 dollars using january 2007 navy shipbuilding deflator the deflator was provided by the navy to the congressional budget office which forwarded it to crs increasing ships procurement cost from about 19 billion to 25 billion or 26 billion ie increasing it by 600 million to 700 million equates to an increase of 32 to 37 21 statement of admiral kirkland h donald us navy director naval nuclear propulsion program before the house armed services committee seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee on nuclear propulsion for surface ships 1 march 2007 p 13 crs12 might equate to about 115 million for each aircraft carrier and about 35 million for each submarine the navy stated that this is probably the most optimistic estimate22 the navy states that these savings were not included in the cost calculations presented in the 2006 navy study bwxt principal maker of nuclearpropulsion components for navy ships estimated in 2007 that increasing virginiaclass submarine procurement from one boat per year to two boats per year would reduce the cost of nuclear propulsion components 9 for submarines and 8 for aircraft carriers and that adding nuclearpowered cruiser or nuclearpowered largedeck amphibious ship would significantly drive down nuclear power plant costs across the fleet even beyond the savings associated with the second virginiaclass submarine per year23 total lifecycle cost as suggested by the 2006 navy study the totallife cycle cost breakeven analysis can be affected by projections of future oil prices and ship operating tempo future oil prices views on potential future oil prices vary24 some supporters of using nuclear power for the cgx and other future navy surface ships such as representatives gene taylor and roscoe bartlett the chairman and ranking member respectively of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee believe that oil in coming decades may become increasingly expensive or that guaranteed access to oil may become more problematic and that this is central reason for making the cgx or other future navy surface ships nuclearpowered25 ship operating tempo ships average lifetime operating tempo can be affected by the number of wars crises and other contingency operations that it participates in over its lifetime because such events can involve operating tempos that are higher than those of normal daytoday operations ship operating tempo can also be affected by the size of the navy the lower the number of ships in the navy for example the higher the operating tempo each ship might be required to sustain for the fleet to accomplish given set of missions cgx vs mediumsize surface combatant if the cgx is based on the hull design of the 14500ton ddg1000 destroyer which is the navys stated 22 spoken testimony of admiral kirkland donald before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 23 testimony of winfred

httpwwweiadoegovoiafaeoindexhtml 25 see for example the remarks of representative taylor at the hearing of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 crs13 preference then the cgx may be smaller the 21000 to 26000ton mediumsize surface combatant in the 2006 navy study what difference that might create between the cgx and the mediumsize surface combatant in terms of lifecycle energy use and thus lifecycle cost breakeven range is not clear the navy has testified that the medium sized surface combatant in the 2006 study was modeled with radar requiring 30 or 31 megawatts of power like the radar the navy wants to install on the cgx26 operational effectiveness operational value of increased ship mobility what is the operational value of increased ship mobility how much better can ship perform its missions as result of this increased mobility and is there some way to translate the mobility advantages of nuclear power into dollar terms one potential way to translate the value of increased ship mobility into dollar terms would be to determine how much aggregate capability force of 19 conventionally powered cgxs would have for surging to distant theaters and for maintaining onstation presence in theater then determine how many nuclearpowered cgxs would be required to provide the same aggregate capability and then compare the total cost of the 19 conventionally powered cgxs to the total cost of the nuclearpowered cgx force potential other operational advantages of nuclear power are there operational advantages of nuclear power for surface ship other than increased ship mobility one possibility concerns ship detectability nuclearpowered ship does not require an exhaust stack as part of its deckhouse and does not emit hot exhaust gases other things held equal this might make nuclearpowered surface ship less detectible than conventionally powered ship particularly to infrared sensors this possible advantage for the nuclearpowered ship might be either offset or reinforced by possible differences between the nuclearpowered ship and the conventionally powered ship in other areas such as the temperature of the engine compartment which again might affect infrared detectability or the level of machinery noise which might affect acoustic detectability some supporters of building future navy surface ships with nuclear power have argued that an additional operational advantage of nuclear power for surface ships would be to reduce the navys dependence on its relatively small force of refueling oilers and thus the potential impact on fleet operations of an enemy attack on those oilers the navy acknowledges that potential attacks on oilers are concern but argues that the fleets vulnerability to such attacks is recognized and that oilers consequently are treated as highvalue ships in terms of measures taken to protect them from attack27 26 source testimony of navy officials to the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 27 spoken testimony of vice admiral jonathan greenert before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 crs14 another potential advantage of nuclear power postulated by some observers is that nuclearpowered ship can use its reactor to provide electrical power for use ashore for extended periods of time particularly to help localities that are experiencing brownouts during peak use periods or whose access to electrical power from the grid has been disrupted by significant natural disaster or terrorist attack the navy has stated that the cgx is to have total powergenerating capacity of about 80 megawatts mw some portion of that would be needed to operate the reactor plant itself and other essential equipment aboard the ship much of the rest might be available for transfer off the ship for purposes of comparison typical us commercial power plant might have capacity of 300 mw to 1000 mw single megawatt can be enough to meet the needs of several hundred us homes depending on the region of the country and other factors28 skeptics of the idea of using nuclearpowered ships to generate electrical power for use ashore could argue that if the local transmission system has been disrupted the ships generation capacity may be of limited use in restoring electric power if the local transmission system is intact they could argue onshore infrastructure would be required to transmit the ships power into the local system the military or local utility they could argue would likely bear the cost for this infrastructure which would be used only on sporadic basis skeptics could argue that navy ship would be helpful only if the power emergency lasts longer than the time it would take for the ship to reach the connection point if the nearest available navy ship is several steaming days away from the connection point when the power emergency occurs they could argue the ship might not be able arrive before local power is partially or fully restored skeptics could argue that critical facilities in the area of the power emergency such as hospitals would likely be equipped with emergency backup diesel generators to respond to shortterm loss of power29 ship construction shipyards another potential issue for congress to consider in weighing whether the cgx or other future navy surface ships should be nuclearpowered concerns the shipyards that would be used to build the ships there are at least three potential approaches for building nuclearpowered cgxs build them at ngnn with gdeb possibly contributing to the construction of the ships nuclear portions certify ngss andor gdbiw to build nuclearpowered ships and then build the cgxs at those yards 28 see for example the discussion of the issue at httpwwwutilipointcomissuealert printaspid1728 29 for examples of articles discussing the idea of using nuclearpowered ships to generate electrical power for use ashore see jose femenia nuclear ships can help meet us electrical needs us naval institute proceedings august 2004 7880 and linda france using navy nuclear reactors to help power california not worth effort aerospace daily may 4 2001 crs15 build the nuclear portions of the cgxs at ngnn andor gdeb the nonnuclear portions at ngss andor gdbiw and perform final assembly integration and test work for the ships at either ngnn andor gdeb or ngss andor gdbiw these options have significant potential implications for workloads and employment levels at each of these shipyards on the question of what would be needed to certify ngss andor gdbiw to build nuclearpowered ships the director of nr testified that just the basics of what it takes to have nuclearcertified yard to build one from scratch or even if one existed once upon time as it did at pasacagoula and we shut it down first and foremost you have to have the facilities to do that what that includes and i have just some notes here but such things as you have to have the docks and the drydocks and the pier capability to support nuclear ships whatever that would entail you would have to have lifting and handling equipment cranes that type of thing construction facilities to build the special nuclear components and to store those components and protect them in the way that would be required the construction facilities would be necessary for handling fuel and doing the fueling operations that would be necessary on the ship those types of things and then the second piece is and probably the harder piece other than just kind of the brickandmortar type is building the structures the organizations in place to do that work for instance nuclear testing specialized nuclear engineering nuclear production work if you look for instance at northrop grumman newport news right now just to give you perspective of the people you are talking about in those departments it is on the order of 769 people in nuclear engineering 308 people in the major lines of control department 225 in nuclear quality assurance and then almost 2500 people who do nuclear production work so all of those would have to be you would have to find that workforce certify and qualify them to be able to do that30 the director of nr testified that ngnn and gdbiw have sufficient capacity to accommodate nuclearpowered surface ship construction and therefore there is need to make the substantial investment in time and dollars necessary to generate additional excess capacity31 in light of this the navy testified only the first and third options above are viable32 the director of nr testified that 30 spoken testimony of admiral kirkland donald before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 31 statement of admiral kirkland h donald us navy director naval nuclear propulsion program before the house armed services committee seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee on nuclear propulsion for surface ships 1 march 2007 p 13 32 source statement of the honorable dr delores m etter assistant secretary of the navy research development and acquisition et before the seapower and expeditionary continued crs16 my view of this is we have some additional capacity at both electric boat and at northrop grumman newport news my primary concern is if we are serious about building another nuclearpowered warship new class of warship cost is obviously going to be some degree of concern and certainly this additional costs which would be and i dont have number to give you right now but i think you can see it would be substantial to do it even if you could it probably doesnt help our case to move down the path toward building another nuclearpowered case when we have the capability existing already in those existing yards33 with regard to the third option of building the nuclear portions of the ships at ngnn andor gdeb and the nonnuclear portions at ngss andor gdbiw the navy testified that the location of final ship erection would require additional analysis one navy official however expressed potential preference for performing final assembly integration and test work at ngnn or gdeb stating that we are building warships in modular sections now so if we were going to ask could you assemble this ship could you build modules of this ship in different yards and put it together in nuclearcertified yard the answer is yes definitely and we do that today with the virginia class submarine program as you know we are barging modules of that type of submarine up and down the coast what i would want is and sort of following along with what nr director admiral kirkland donald said you would want the delivering yard to be the yard where the reactor plant was built tooled and tested because they have the expertise to run through all of that nuclear work and test and certify the ship and take it out on sea trials but the modules of the nonreactor plant which is the rest of the ship could be built theoretically at other yards and barged or transported in other fashion to the delivering shipyard if i had to do it ideally that is where i would probably start talking to my industry partners because although we have six large shipyards for building large navy ships it is really two corporations that own them and those two corporations each own what is now surface combatant shipyard and they each own nuclearcapable shipyard i would say if we were going to go do this we would sit down with them and say you know from corporation standpoint what would be the best work flow what would be the best place to construct modules and how would you do the final assembly and testing of nuclearpowered warship34 32 continued forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee on integrated nuclear power systems for future naval surface combatants march 1 2007 p 7 33 spoken testimony of admiral kirkland donald before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 34 spoken testimony of vice admiral paul sullivan commander naval sea systems command to the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 crs17 nuclearpropulsion component manufacturers related issue that congress may consider in weighing whether the cgx or other future navy surface ships should be nuclearpowered is whether there is sufficient capacity at the firms that make nuclearpropulsion components to accommodate the increase in production volume that would result from building the cgx or other future navy surface ships with nuclear power on this question the navy has testified right now as i look across the industrial base that provides for nuclear powered ships lets just talk about the components for instance and i just look across that base because we have been asserting earlier that we were going to go to procurement rate of two virginiaclass submarines per year earlier than the currently planned year of fy2012 we had facilitized and have sustained an overcapacity in those facilities to support construction of those additional components so right now it depends on the vendor and which one is doing what the capacity is running right now at probably about 65 percent of what it could be doing on the order of that again it varies depending on the vendor specifically so there is additional capacity in there and even with the addition of second virginiaclass submarine there is still margin in there if you are talking about single cruiser in the early phases of design we still have margin in there that i believe we can sustain that work in addition to the submarine work within the industrial base we would have to look at that in more detail once we determine what the design looks like and the degree to which we can use existing components if you had to design new components that would add little bit more complexity to it but that is rough estimate of what i would provide for you now35 ship maintenance and repair building cgxs or other future navy surface ships with nuclear power could affect the future distribution of navy ship maintenance and repair work because only certain us shipyards are qualified for performing certain kinds of work on nuclear powered ships much of the maintenance and repair work done on nuclearpowered ships is done at the countrys four governmentoperated naval shipyards nsys portsmouth nsy at kittery norfolk nsy at norfolk va puget sound nsy at bremerton wa and pearl harbor nsy at pearl harbor hi ngnn and gdeb also perform some maintenance and repair work on nuclearpowered ships crew training would the navy have the capacity to train the additional nuclearqualified sailors that would be needed to crew additional nuclearpowered ships on this question the director of nr testified that my training pipeline does have the capacity without further infrastructure investment to produce the additional personnel required by future classes of nuclearpowered ships he also stated 35 spoken testimony of admiral kirkland donald before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 crs18 we in looking at the training pipeline there are couple of dynamics that are in work right now first off the nuclearpowered aircraft carrier enterprise is going to be going away in 2013 and that is pretty significant training load just to keep that crew operating36 and also there as the cvn21 carrier class comes on that is as the fordclass carriers come on and the nimitzclass nuclearpowered carriers start to go away the number of people required to crew carriers will decrease because with the ford class we are targeting 50 percent reduction in the reactor department sizing over there compared to the nimitz class so for the foreseeable future the training infrastructure that we have right now will meet the needs to sustain this additional class of nuclearpowered ship if you choose to do it37 port calls and forward homeporting nuclearpowered ship might be less welcome than conventionally powered ship in the ports of countries with strong antinuclear sentiments the navy works to minimize this issue in connection with its nuclearpowered submarines and aircraft carriers and states that us nuclearpowered warships are welcome today in over 150 ports in more than 50 countries worldwide thus allowing our warships to carry out their mission without constraint38 some navy ships are forwardhomeported meaning that they are homeported in foreign countries that are close to potential us navy operating areas overseas forwardhomeported navy ships have occasional need for access to maintenance facilities near their home ports and foreign shipyards are not qualified to perform certain kinds of maintenance work on nuclearpowered navy ships building cgxs or other future navy surface ships with nuclear power might thus affect the number of potentially suitable locations for forwardhomeporting the ships should the navy decide that forward homeporting them would be desirable for purposes of shortening transit times to and from potential operating areas environmental impact conventionally powered ships exhaust greenhouse gases and other pollutants that are created through combustion of petroleumbased fuel they can also leak fuel into the water particularly if they are damaged in an accident such as collision or by enemy attack other environmental impacts of conventionally powered ships include those associated with extracting oil from the ground transporting it to refinery refining it into fuel and transporting that fuel to the ship most of these activities produce additional greenhouse gases and other pollutants 36 the enterprise has oneofakind eightreactor nuclear power plant that creates training demands unique to that ship 37 spoken testimony of admiral kirkland donald before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 38 spoken testimony of admiral kirkland donald before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee march 1 2007 crs19 nuclearpowered ships do not exhaust greenhouse gases and other pollutants created through conventional combustion the environmental impacts of nuclearpowered ships include those associated with mining and processing uranium to fuel reactors and with storing and disposing of spent nuclear fuel cores radioactive waste water from reactors and the reactors and other radioactive components of retired nuclearpowered ships as mentioned in the background section nr has established reputation for maintaining very high safety standards for engineering and operating navy nuclear power plants in addition navy combat ships are built to withstand significant shock and battle damage it is possible however that very serious accident involving nuclearpowered navy ship such as major collision or major enemy attack on nuclearpowered navy ship might damage the ships hull and reactor compartment enough to cause release of radioactivity which may have adverse effects on the environment potential options for congress potential options for congress regarding the issue of whether the cgx or other future navy surface ships should be nuclearpowered include but are not limited to the following some of which might be combined for the cgx or other future navy surface ships direct the navy to provide congress with acquisition plans including annual funding requirements for both conventionally powered and nuclearpowered versions so that congress can assess both plans to equalize the treatment of petroleumbased and nuclear fuel in navy ship procurement costs direct the navy to exclude the cost of initial fuel cores for nuclearpowered ships from the total procurement cost of those ships and to fund the procurement of those cores through an appropriation account other than the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn account direct the navy to build the cgx as nuclearpowered ship provide initial research and development funding to start work on adapting the design of the fordclass aircraft carrier nuclear power plant for use in the cgx and direct the navy to study the option of or begin the process of certifying ngss andor gdbiw to build nuclearpowered ships legislative activity for fy2009 fy2009 defense authorization bill hr 5658s 3001 house the

2008 on hr 5658 the house armed services committee stated this section would amend section 1012 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110181 by requiring that in addition to future ship classes of aircraft carriers major surface combatants and submarines that assault echelon amphibious ships also must be constructed with integrated nuclear power systems if the ships light weight displacement is greater than 15 thousand tons40 the committee believes the future naval force should not be reliant on the availability of fossil fuel for fleet operations removing the need for access to fossil fuel sources significantly multiplies the effectiveness of the entire battle force and eliminates the dependence on foreign nation support of deployed naval forces pages 428429 senate the report of the senate armed services committee on s 3001 srept 110335 of may 12 2008 states with regard to the cgx cruiser that the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 public law 109364 required that the navy include nuclear power in its analysis of alternatives aoa for the cgx propulsion system 39 the sizes of commercial ships are often expressed in deadweight tons while the sizes of navy combatant ships are usually expressed in terms of full load or light ship displacement the terms deadweight tons and light ship displacement are not normally joined together to form single expression of ships size when joined together the two terms can be viewed as being in tension with one another since the first refers to the weight of ships cargo fuel water stores and other loads while the second refers to the weight of ship without these loads 40 this report language which refers to light weight displacement but not to deadweight tons suggests that the inclusion of the words dead weight ton in the section 1013 might be printing error crs21 section 1012 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110181 further requires that cgx be nuclear powered unless the secretary of defense submits notification that inclusion of an integrated nuclear power system is not in the national interest the statement of managers accompanying that act directed the secretary of the navy to submit report with the budget request for fiscal year 2009 providing information regarding cgx design cost schedule industrial base considerations and risk assessment that would reflect the results of the cgx aoa and provide evidence that the navy is on schedule for procuring the first ship of the class in 2011 the secretary of the navy has delayed submission of the cgx report because the cgx aoa which was scheduled to be complete by third quarter fiscal year 2007 remains under review by the navy fundamental considerations regarding the cruisers requirements characteristics technology readiness levels and affordability continue to be studied making it likely that milestone which was targeted for september 2007 will slip into 2009 by all measures there is reasonable path for the nextgeneration cruiser to meet the current schedule for milestone b and award of ship construction contract in 2011 pending completion of the aoa determination of radar requirements ship characteristics propulsion system and an executable program schedule and in view of the delay to program major milestones the activities planned for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 cannot be executed per the schedule reflected in the fiscal year 2009 budget request therefore the committee recommends decrease in the navys request for fy2009 research and development funding of 872 million in pe 64300n and decrease of 336 million in pe 64501n these recommended decreases would maintain the cruiser development activities at the same level as was funded

title 31 united states code the house armed services committee in its report hrept 110146 of may 11 2007 on hr 1585 stated the following in regard to section 1012 this section would require that all new ship classes of submarines cruisers and aircraft carriers be built with nuclear power systems unless the secretary of defense notifies the committee that it is not in the national interest to do so the committee believes that the mobility endurance and electric power generation capability of nuclear powered warships is essential to the next generation of navy cruisers the navys report to congress on alternative propulsion methods for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships crs24 required by section 130 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 public law 109163 indicated that the total lifecycle cost for mediumsized nuclear surface combatants is equivalent to conventionally powered ships the committee notes that this study only compared acquisition and maintenance costs and did not analyze the increased speed and endurance capability of nuclear powered vessels the committee believes that the primary escort vessels for the navys fleet of aircraft carriers should have the same speed and endurance capability as the aircraft carrier the committee also notes that surface combatants with nuclear propulsion systems would be more capable during independent operations because there would be need for underway fuel replenishment page 387 senate the senatereported version of the fy2008 defense authorization bill s 1547 did not contain provision analogous to section 1012 of the house reported version of hr 1585 the report of the senate armed services committee on s 1547 srept 11077 of june 5 2007 did not comment directly on the issue of nuclear power for navy ships other than submarines and aircraft carriers conference section 1012 of the conference report hrept 110477 of december 6 2007 on hr 1585 is the same as section 1012 of the housereported version of hr 1585 see discussion above in discussing section 1012 the conference report stated the navys next opportunity to apply this guidance will be the next generation cruiser or cgx under the current futureyears defense program fydp the navy plans to award the construction contract for cgx in fiscal year 2011 under this provision the next cruiser would be identified as cgnx to designate the ship as nuclear powered under the navys normal shipbuilding schedule for the two programs that already have nuclear power systems aircraft carriers and submarines the navy seeks authorization and appropriations for long lead time nuclear components for ships 2 years prior to full authorization and appropriation for construction the conferees recognize that the milestone decision for the navys cgx is only months away after that milestone decision the navy and its contractors will begin significant design effort and in that process will be making significant tradeoff decisions and discarding major options such as propulsion alternatives this is the normal process for the navy and the department of defense dod to make choices that will lead to producing contract design that will be the basis for awarding the construction contract for the lead ship in 2011 in order for the navy to live by the spirit of this guidance the conferees agree that 1 the navy would be required to proceed through the contract design phase of the program with comprehensive effort to design cgnx independent of the outcome of decisions that the navy or the dod will make at the next milestone decision point regarding any preferred propulsion system for the next generation cruiser crs25 2 if the navy intends to maintain the schedule in the current fydp and award vessel in fiscal year 2011 the navy would need to request advance procurement for nuclear components in the fiscal year 2009 budget request and 3 the navy must consider options for maintaining the segment of the industrial base that currently produces the conventionally powered destroyer and amphibious forces of the navy b certifying yards which comprise that segment of the industrial base to build nuclearpowered vessels or c seeking other alternatives for building nonnuclear ships in the future if the navy is only building nuclearpowered surface combatant ships for some period of time as it builds cgnx vessels and d identifying sources of funds to pay for the additional nearterm costs of the integrated nuclear power system either from offsets within the navys budget from elsewhere within the departments resources or from gaining additional funds for dod overall the conferees recognize that these considerations will require significant additional nearterm investment by the navy some in the navy have asserted that despite such added investment the navy would not be ready to award shipbuilding contract for cgnx in fiscal year 2011 as in the current fydp section 128 of the john warner national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007 public law 109 364 required that the navy include nuclear power in its analysis of alternatives aoa for the cgx propulsion system the conferees are aware that the cgx aoa is nearing completion in which case the navy should have some indications of what it will require to design and construct cgnx class accordingly the conferees direct the secretary of the navy to submit report to the congressional defense committees with the budget request for fiscal year 2009 providing the following information 1 the set of next generation cruiser characteristics such as displacement and manning which would be affected by the requirement for including an integrated nuclear power system 2 the navys estimate for additional costs to develop design and construct cgnx to fill the requirement for the next generation cruiser and the optimal phasing of those costs in order to deliver cgnx most affordably 3 the navys assessment of any effects on the delivery schedule for the first ship of the next generation cruiser class that would be associated with shifting the design to incorporate an integrated nuclear propulsion system options for reducing or eliminating those schedule effects and alternatives for meeting next generation cruiser requirements during any intervening period if the cruisers full operational capability were delayed crs26 4 the navys estimate for the cost associated with certifying those shipyards that currently produce conventionally powered surface combatants to be capable of constructing and integrating nuclearpowered combatant 5 any other potential effects on the navys 30year shipbuilding plan as result of implementing these factors 6 such other considerations that would need to be addressed in parallel with design and construction of cgnx class including any unique test and training facilities facilities and infrastructure requirements for potential cgnx homeports and environmental assessments that may require longterm coordination and planning and 7 an assessment of the highest risk areas associated with meeting this requirement and the navys alternatives for mitigating such risk pages 984 986 hr

to be nuclearpowered44 44 the title viii legislation comprised sections 801804 of the fy1975 defense authorization act hr 14592pl 93365 august 5 1974 88 stat 408409 the legislation was codified at 10 usc 7291 section 801 made it us policy to modernize the strike forces of the united states navy by the construction of nuclearpowered major combatant vessels and to provide for an adequate industrial base for the research development design construction operation and maintenance for such vessels section 801 also stated new construction major combatant vessels for the strike forces of the united states navy authorized subsequent to the date of enactment of this act becomes law sic shall be nuclear powered except as provided in this title section 802 defined the term major combatant vessels for the strike forces of the united states navy section 803 required the secretary of defense to submit report to congress each year along with the annual budget request on the application of nuclear power to such ships section 804 stated that all requests for authorizations or appropriations from congress for such ships shall be for construction of nuclearpowered versions of such ships unless and until the president has fully advised the congress that construction of nuclear powered vessels for such purpose is not in the national interest in which case the president is to provide for congress consideration an alternate program of nuclearpowered ships with appropriate design cost and schedule information title viii was repealed by section 810 of the fy1979 defense authorization act s 3486pl 95485 october 20 1978 92 stat 1623 section 810 of that act replaced the title viii legislation with policy statement on navy shipbuilding policy that did not mandate the use of nuclear power for any navy ships section 810 like the title viii continued crs27 44 continued legislation was codified at 10 usc 7291 it was subsequently recodified at 10 usc 7310 pursuant to law hr 4623pl 97295 of october 12 1982 that amended titles 10 14 37 and 38 to codify recent law 10 usc 7310 was then repealed by section 824a8 of the fy1994 defense authorization act hr 2401pl 103160 of november 30 1993 crs28 appendix section 130 of pl 109163 section 130 of the conference report hrept 109360 of december 18 2005 on the fy2006 defense authorization act hr 1815 pl 109163 of january 6 2006 required the navy to submit report by november 1 2006 on alternative propulsion methods for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships the navy submitted the report to congress in january 2007 section 130 states sec 130 report on alternative propulsion methods for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships analysis of alternatives the secretary of the navy shall conduct an analysis of alternative propulsion methods for surface combatant vessels and amphibious warfare ships of the navy b report the secretary shall submit to the congressional defense committees report on the analysis of alternative propulsion systems carried out under subsection the report shall be submitted not later than november 1 2006 c matters to be included the report under subsection b shall include the following 1 the key assumptions used in carrying out the analysis under subsection 2 the methodology and techniques used in conducting the analysis 3 description of current and future technology relating to propulsion that has been incorporated in recentlydesigned surface combatant vessels and amphibious warfare ships or that is expected to be available for those types of vessels within the next 10to20 years 4 description of each propulsion alternative for surface combatant vessels and amphibious warfare ships that was considered under the study and an analysis and evaluation of each such alternative from an operational and costeffectiveness standpoint 5 comparison of the lifecycle costs of each propulsion alternative 6 for each nuclear propulsion alternative an analysis of when that nuclear propulsion alternative becomes cost effective as the price of barrel of crude oil increases for each type of ship 7 the conclusions and recommendations of the study including those conclusions and recommendations that could impact the design of future ships or lead to modifications of existing ships 8 the secretarys intended actions if any for implementation of the conclusions and recommendations of the study d lifecycle costs for purposes of this section the term lifecycle costs includes those elements of cost that would be considered for lifecycle cost analysis for major
