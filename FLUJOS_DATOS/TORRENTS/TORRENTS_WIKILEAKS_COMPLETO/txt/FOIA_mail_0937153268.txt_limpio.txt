sun 12 sep 1999 122108 0100 attached is discussion document it incorporates material provided by simon shackley umist mike hulme jean has commented on it it is intended to circulate this to consortium partners on monday if you have chance to read it comment on it before it goes that would be good but i recognise that in practice time is too short my apologies for that however i do think there is danger in presenting our partners with too final draft application at this stage and we do need their bright ideas chris please will you liaise with jean to 1 get this document out to outside attendees 2 send out list of attendees 3 give outside people details of where to get the research councils document information for applicants to run the centre web if they dont already have it 4 send out an agenda jean is doing this 5 send out kerrys diagram jean has chris will you also please fax copies of the icer document in your tray to john shepherd southampton 596258 and nigel arnell i dont have fax number for info to others we didnt send soton copy of the icer bid earlier because they were sitting on the fence very many thanks trevor attachment converted ceudoraattachclimate change

ccc cc cbenthamueapjonesueajpalutikofueaplissueamhulmeuea rkturnerueaawatkinsonueakbrownueajdarchueaparrymlaolcom mimeversion 10 contenttype textplain charsetusascii status confidential to env state of play the research councils want 5000 word outline bid by midoctober the councils are putting up 2 million pounds per year for 5 years are nerc epsrc and esrc the research councils are putting the emphasis on solutions to climate change they are clearly not looking for another version of cru the hadley centre or any other existing centre in the uk the focus is downstream of these existing centres much of what they appear to want we anticipated in our jif icer institute for connective environmental sciences bid and indeed we made provisional early strike for the ccc in that bid although the research councils intentions were not known at that point even if the jif icer bid is unsuccessful at this stage we are still optimistic then we will still be able to take advantage of this early thinking in the final ccc bid we are aware of 34 competitors which are mainly consortia of some form our consortium includes umist number of departments southampton number of departments cambridge dept of econometrics sussex science policy research unit cranfield ecotechnology unit complex systems modelling and leeds institute for transport studies there will also be number of institutes associated with us including inst hydrology bas inst terrestrial ecology rutherford appleton laboratory building research establishment john innes centre and possibly other institutes such as the plymouth marine lab the proudman oceanographic lab the hub of this consortium will be uea visiting fellows etc will work in the centre possibly also at secondary centres like umist businessindustry links are important as are links with relevant institutes abroad we anticipate writing in some industrialbusiness partners our philosophy is not to seek to maximise the input of resources to uea or to the consortium in the short term but to build centre which has the credibility and the authority to identify initiate orchestrate research programmes and to include the best people available we see this as the likeliest way to attract longterm funding to ensure the longterm future of the ccc we have fairly clear idea of the science framework of the ccc and together with our partners are now agreeing the research challenges at the moment the research challenges look something like this 1 developing the toolkit given that the centres starting point is to take advantage of the best research internationally extant ongoing and planned it will be necessary to apply refine and develop methods of integration much science and engineering research is focused on specific disciplinary issues this has to be brought together with critical analyses of social and economic factors to design more adaptive and effective policies and more effective and appropriate engineeringtechnology the best aspects of integrated assessments will be applied with uk focus an important part of such assessments will be isolate emerging opportunities for businessindustry afforded by climate change in order to identify competitive opportunities it will be necessary to consider global pressure points existing models need to be linked reduced complexity modelling has significant role the toolkit can also be developed and tested via geographicallyfocused studies for example integrated coastal incl estuaries management which will include risk analysis valuation of coastal environments effects of adaptation softhard engineering solutions on coastline ecologicaleconomic models etc methods to characterisemeasure vulnerability and adaptive capacity the toolkit will also include some of the consultationinclusion techniques outlined in ueas jif bid for icer 2 abrupt changes and extremes climate research on abruptnonlinear changes in underlying climate and on changes in extreme event frequency some of the tools will need to be applied or adapted for this challenge for example vulnerabilityadaptation risk analysis reduced complexity modelling of particular importance is how the possibility of abuptnonlinear change should be assimilated into decisionmaking frameworks perceptionrisk analyses etc it will be necessary to consider the implications of nonclimate shocks political and economic shocks or combinations for example climateweather extremes influencing perceptions amongst business community and politicians leading to sudden shifts of policy investments etc 3 carbon management and technology adoption of clean technology includes alternative energy sources and removal of c from emissions in particular clean technologies and solutions for developing countries link into identifying business opportunities the impacts of clean technologies landscapelifestyle valuation incorporation technological into existing infrastructuresupply networks carbon sequestration options waste c recycling use in building materials longterm storage etc oceans ambitious bioengineering discussions with norwichs john innes centre ongoing b energy efficiency technological including control systems especially when concentrated on one of the scale foci eg the household 4 management of social and technological change factor 4 and beyond 1 we will need to go well beyond factor 4 to stabilise the climate system this programme would analyse and assess different emission trajectories and look at how we would in practice achieve factor 4 it would include assessment of tools such as c trading domestic tradeable carbon quotas regulation and taxation voluntary agreements opportunities for winwin scenarios through resource use minimisation etc also it would look at changes to lowc economy at different scales households smes large firms mncs local to regional to national to global etc to sectoral transport energy supply heavy light manufacturing services finance etc techhnology uptake this includes reducing transport emissions and exploring lowconsumption water energy carbon households what about air traffic the research challenges above are not intended to be allinclusive we intend to use research challenges such as these 4 as examplars of the sort of thingw we will expand upon in the final bid the research councils have emphasised the importance of attracting toprate international scientist as research director they also wish us to name the executive director at this point we believe it should be someone with reputation in climate research in their own right good links etc with the impacts people and with funders as well as being good managerorganiser we anticipate naming mike hulme from what we have heard that will give us an additional advantage over other bids at this point we will welcome your comment input suggestions trevor professor trevor d davies dean school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj united kingdom tel 44
