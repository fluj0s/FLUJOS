summary president bushs announcement on september 6 2006 that 14 highvalue detainees suspected of terrorist activity ve been transferred from locations abroad to the us detention facility at the guantanamo bay naval station confirmed for the first time the existence of secret us prison facilities abroad the subject of previously unsubstantiated media allegations and inve stigations by foreign governments and human rights bodies befo re september the bush administration had neither admitted nor denied the allegations but had defended the related long standing practice of transporting terrorist suspects to other countries through process known as extraordinary rendition president bush stated that more suspects were being held in cia prisons but that the administration reserved the option of establishing overseas prisons to hold and interrogate terrorist suspects that may be captured in the future the arrest transfer deten tion and treatment of persons are governed by web of human rights treaties and in some cas treaties regulating the conduct of armed conflict humanitarian law as well as customary international law related to either category of law in the context of the global war on terrorism gwot there are significant differences of opinion as to wh ich legal regimes govern the arrest and detention of suspected terrorists the bush administration has characterized the arrests and detentions as the wartime capture and internment of combatants and has argued that human rights law is thus inapplicable prior to the supreme courts decision in hamdan v rumsfeld the administration argued that treaties regarding humanitarian law did not apply to the tainees however the supreme court rejected the position that qaeda fighters captured in afghanistan are not entitled to any protection under the geneva conven tions finding instead that all persons captured in the context of an armed conflict are entitled at least to the minimum protections required under co mmon article 3 congress in enacting the detainee treatment act of 2006 pl 109163 prohibited cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees in us custody regardless of their geographical location the

overseas background and legal issues introduction aspects of us tactics in conducting the global war on terrorism have come under increasing international scrutiny as allegations have emerged in recent years of possible illegal activity by us and international intelligence agencies on september 6 2006 in an address that was pa rt of series of speeches on the war on terrorism president bush provided new in formation on the capture and detention of suspected terrorists since september 111 he announced the transfer of 14 terrorist suspects to the us military facility at guantanamo bay from cia custody in locations outside of the united states while the central thrust of the speech promoted the presidents proposal to use military commissions to try terrorists2 it also provided for the first time official acknowledgment of the existence of previously classified international cia program to detain and question suspected terrorists and operatives the washington post and subsequently several other news sources had reported on cia network of secret detention facilities in november 2005 see background section below but u s officials neither confirmed nor denied their existence until the presidents speech according to president bush the cia program remains vital to the security of the united states and has saved innocen t lives by providing key information to intelligence agencies that helped prevent terrorist attacks on the united states identifying further suspects and revea ling details about how qaeda operates president bush stated that the cia program detained only limited number of terrorists at any given time he also said that with the announced transfer of the 14 detainees to guantanamo there are now terrorists in the cia program president bush said he would not reveal where the cias detention facilities had been located how many of them ther were or how many suspects had been questioned under the program he stated th at the program reportedly set up pursuant

practices of us intelligence agencies overseas in europe especially numerous international organizations and human rights groups have been seized with this issue for some time some european officials have said that the president s announcement has given new impetus to the importance of their ongoing investigations and future inquiries in addition as the administration has asserted the right to revive the cia program in the future the topic may not just concern past pr actices but also ongoing policies additional details about th detention and transport of terrorist suspects continue to

the abduction of an egyptian cleric from milan in 20035 other cases as well as national inquiries into local official involvement in terror suspect transfers may follow there are significant differences of opi nion within the world community as to which legal regimes govern the arrest and detention of suspected terrorists the bush administration has characterized the arrests and detentions as the wartime capture and internment of combatants other st ates however may not share the view that the global war on terrorism is an actual armed conflict taking place on all territories in particular with respect to operations carried out on their own territory they may regard their obligations under in ternational law with respect to persons arrested in transported th rough or

battlefiel d operations such as those conducted in afghanistan law enforcement measures are the appropriate means for addressing the terrorist threat under this view at least those suspected terrorists who are captured outside of theater of conventional arme d conflict are entitled to the protection of human rights treaties from this perspective such persons would be entitled in most cases to trial or other process of law to determine the lawfulness of their continued detention many take the position that human rights treaties continue to apply regardless of whether situation of armed conflict exists except for those portions of the treaties that allow states to derogate in an emergency28 and provisions that are superceded by more specifi c provision of humanitarian law29 according to this perspective all captives are protected by human rights law but persons picked up in circumstances of an armed conflict or occupation are to be treated according to humanitarian law30

receiving state that the individual will not be subject to torture but the transferring state may retain some responsibility for ensuring proper treatment after the transfer36 although the right to be free from arre st and detention w ithout established process of law appears to be generally wellrecognized th scope of persons to whom state owes protection from vi olations is less wellestablished generally state is obligated to protect persons within its jurisdiction but there are many types of jurisdiction state may be entitled to exercise and its obligations to persons may vary accordingly for example the iccpr obligates each member to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the pres ent covenant without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex lang uage religion political or other opinion national or social origin property bi rth or other status emphasis added37 it may be argued that the plain text of the iccpr obligates states to protect only those individuals who are both w ithin the territory of state and subject to its jurisdiction in which case states oblig ation may be limited pending on how both territory and juris diction are defined38 if territory is understood to include only the exclusive sovereign territory of state for example state would incur liability for conduct inconsiste nt with the standards set forth in the iccpr if such conduct occurs in an area under its cont rol or administration but outside its boundaries if jurisdiction is underst ood to be territorially based then the term would appear to be redundant unless it can be read to limit the scope of jurisdiction within states territory possibly excluding for example foreign military bases and embassies within the sovereign territory of the state or persons not ordinarily subject to the jurisdiction of its courts such as fo reign heads of state and diplomats under this reading it is possible to argue that neither the united states nor the country on whose territory usrun prison is locat ed has any obligation under the iccpr to persons held there even using narro w definition of jurisdiction however many commentators point out that it would be difficult to argue that state has obligations regarding persons on its territory relative to their potential arrest or removal from
