description secret 13113 weapon to aircraft interface u jdam is designed to interface and communicate with the host aircraft via milstd1760 class ii primary interface signal set the weapon and host aircraft are mated for digitalcommunication using standard or improved umbilical interface cable at the suspension pylon the associated hardware to accomplish fuzing safeandarm functionality is independent of and not specific to the jdam weapon system 114 design philosophy 1141 storage usage and maintenance concept u jdam is designed for simplicity and low maintenance the jdam service life specification is 20 years on the shelf in the storage container and 10 years once the storage container isopened there is requirement to track jdam captive ca rriage usage or to perform recurring maintenance jdam weapon is used until either it is expended or it declares an internal failure weapon utilization tracking for captive carria ge is neither required nor intended 1142 compatibility and interoperability u jdam is designed for compatibility existing warheads and conventional fuzing components the jdam kit provides access to the pr imary fuze charging well and aft fuze well as well as standard routing for fuze arming wires u navy inventory warheads are shipped with mk122 switch power cables installed in order to use mechanical initiator such as the fzu48 these mk122 power cables are removed and the appropriate fzu power cables are installed in theirplace this process inhibits simple conversion fr om one power system configuration to the other 1143 physical accommodation u jdam is designed for suspension on the host aircraft using standard suspension lug widths provided by inventory warheads or specially mach ined kitspecific suspension equipment the design of the guidance kit is such that jdam weapons may be hoisted for host aircraft loading using either shols winching equipmentor mobile sats loader 12 physical description 121 guidance set u the jdam guidance set consists of tail assembly section including guidance electronics and control fins and three midbody aerosurfaces or strakes that enhance weapon maneuverability the guidance setcomponents when combined with the appropriate tail fuzes and assembled to the appropriate mk83 mk84 blu109 orblu110 gravity bomb warheads form the gbu31 figures 12 and 13 and gbu3235 figure 14 series weapons tail

aerosurfaces u the aerosurfaces or strakes consist of three formed steel panels that attach to and wrap around the weapon warhead the strakes produce aerodynamic lift and provide increased maneuverability since theblu109 warhead is not drilled to accept standard bomb l ugs the gbu31v4b kit incorporates cast aluminum hardback structure into the upper strake panel this har dback provides the appropriate interface for suspension on the delivery aircraft u on thermallyprotected usn bomb bodies minor thermal coat crushing and wear has been noted under the strake panels after exposure to flight loads attention has been paid to strake security tightness which could be reduced by this crushing and allow strake misalignment under flight loads thus reducing the clearance margin for the strake cutout areas or negatively impacting weapon performance however there is experience or data to date to suggest that strakemisalignment due to thermal coat crushing has occurred weapon preflight

11013 weapon operation 131 theory of operation u typically jdam mission and mission support data is prepared before flight using automated planning tools data is stored on memory device for transport to the host aircraft the weapon and aircraft communicate digitally to transfer data regarding ssion parameters and system health and display pertinent information to the aircrew in the cockpit once power is available the weapon preconditions its avionics automatically andaccepts stored data from the host aircraft u whenever the weapon is powered the aircraft transfers n ecessary navigational data to allow the weapon to erect and align its internal navigation system to fine degree the weapon does not attempt to acquire gps data while attached to thehost aircraft this transfer alignment procedure includes threshold aircraft maneuvering to generate the required navigationsolution in the weapon the weapon reports navigation system quality and subsystem health to provide feedback sufficientto support tactical decisions regarding weapon employment the aircraft computes and displays valid launch regions andassociated cues to assist the pilot in obtaining release so lution the host aircraft provides appropriate manual andor automated modes of weapon release u once released jdam performs safe separation maneuver and commences autonomous guidance to the selected target according to the desired terminal parameters initial guidance is inertial only while the gps acquisition process isaccomplished but once valid fix is obtained gps navigationa l information is blended into the weapon guidance solution jdam requires three satellites to derive ground plane 2d position solution and four satellites to obtain positionandaltitude 3d solution the weapon utilizes threedimensional rhumb line navigation referenced to true heading for pointtopoint guidance solution jdam incorporates in its mission software guidance algorithm prioritized hierarchy of mission objectives to maximize weapon effectiveness if an energy deficit is realized after launch 1311 quantity release u the general theory of operations applies to quantity releases with the following distinctions the aircraft computes and displays valid employment cues to assist the pilot in obtaining release solution common to the selected weapons during release the aircraft ensures that minimum separation interval is maintained to prevent bombto bomb collisions once released each jdam weapon guides independently to its assigned target 1312 target of opportunity too u the general theory of operations applies to targets of opportunity too with the following distinctions the too mission usually is not preplanned although general terminal impact parameters andorfuze data may be preprogrammed instead of entered manually in flight aircraftrelative target designations using sensorsspecific to the host aircraft or via networking with sensors exte rnal to the host aircraft are converted into absolute targetin g coordinates for the weapon assuming sufficient threshold precision 132 detailed conce pt of operation u jdam operation is divided into the mission planning weapon preparation initialization and test transfer alignment prere lease release separation dcourse and terminal phases 1321 mission planning u jdam mission planning is accomplished using automated systems specifics are discussed in chapter 3 and annex b mission and gps data are preprogrammed and stored on memory device either memory unit mu or advanced memory unit amu for transport to the host aircraft 13211 mission data u mission data consists of target latitude and longitude specified in or converted to wgs84 coordinates target elevation specified in height above ellipsoid hae or height above mean sea level msl terminal impact heading terminal impact angle and minimum terminal impact velocity specification jdam performance assumes target coordinate s of sufficient threshold accuracy minimum target data set tds consists of latitude longitude elevation and elevation datum each jdam weapon may store up to six preplanned pp and up totwo target of opportunity too missions fuze arm time and functioning delay also may be stored if programmable fuze fmu152 jpf is specified note u due to roundoff errors incurred during conv ersion coordinates speci fied in datum other than wgs84 may lose small amount of precision during weapon conditioningsecret chapter 1 weapon description secret 111u terminal heading and impact angle figure 110 are us ed to tailor the jdam attack against horizontally or vertically oriented target the terminal impact angle defi nes the angle with respect to the horizontal from 0 to 90 degrees at which the weapon attempts to impact the terminal heading defines the angle with respect to true north inthe ground plane from 0 to 359 at which the weapon attempts to impact and is used to tailor the jdam attackagainst horizontally or vertically oriented targets the terminal impact velocity defines the minimum desiredvelocity in feet per second and is used to tailor the displayed jdam valid release envelope to achieve the desiredweapon velocity at

similar to existing bomb tailassembly attachment and config uring the fuzing elements cons istent with existing procedures specification jdam assembly time is not more than 30 minutes per weapon an approved weapon asse mbly manual is available u weapon checkout is accomplished with an angyq79 cmbre common munitions bit reprogrammable equipment this ground test set attaches and operates through the same weapon bus connector used for aircraftinterface figure 111 the cmbre verifies the software loaded in the weapon and updates the weapon softwareautomatically if the cmbre software is more current the cmbre also performs comprehensive test of weaponsubsystems to identify any failures or degrades prior to weapon upload on the host aircraft mission data is notpreloaded in the tail kit

ztod and date from the host aircraftfor use in acquiring gps satellites following release the weapon defaults initially to the mission designated as such duringmission planning or otherwise to the first preplanned mission pp1 following initialization the weapon automaticallyperforms periodic bit and reports the result to the host aircraft an initiated bit ibit may be commanded by the aircrewat any time which requires 20 seconds to complete 1324 transfer alignment u the weapon does not attempt to acquire gps satellites before release since the extreme aft positioning of the gps antenna on the tail kit results in antenna masking by the aircraft structure instead the weaponaccepts periodic transfer alignment messages ptams from the aircraft the ptam consists primarily of position velocity and moment arm data from the aircraft and is used by the weapon to align its onboard ins before release aptam is expected and can be accepted by powered jdam an ywhere from 10 times per second to once every six seconds depending on the host aircraft integration in order to maintain valid ins alignment u the weapon requires gpsquality position velocity and time information from the aircraft in order to align its ins accurately to the wgs84 frame of reference for this reason the aircraft must maintain gpsaided position keeping duringthis transfer alignment txa process if degraded ptam data enters the weapons navigation system its kalman filterscause the inaccurate information to wash out slowly over tim increasing the overall period of reduced weapon navigation accuracy the aircraft is required to perform threshold maneuvers to generate transfer alignment of adequate quality tosupport weapon release normally these maneuvers consist of at least 30 degree heading changes in both directions for atleast 30 seconds in each direction for this reason satisfact ory transfer alignment typically is accomplished only in fligh t the weapon reports to the aircraft the quality of the transfer alignment and of its ins solution 13241 transfer alignment quality u transfer alignment quality is affected by the amount and type of aircraft maneuvering and the quality of information provided in successive ptams to the weapon transfer alignmentquality is reported as numeric value on scale from 1 b est to 10 worst high numeric values generally indicate that the weapon requires additional aircraft maneuvering to achieve satisfactory ins alignment high numericvalues at all jdam stations despite adequate maneuvering also may indicate poor or erratic aircraft navigationquality and could be an indication of gps degradation however chronically high numeric values on isolatedstations can indicate problem with aircraft ptams to that station particularly if other weapons loaded on the aircraft achieve low numeric values at the same time therefore cycling weapon power to reinitiate the transfer alignment to all stations may resolve chronically high numeric cues on single stationsecret chapter 1 weapon description secret 113caution u cycling weapon power results in weapon unavail ability during the rein itialization warmup and satellite reacquisition process which can take as long as 57 minutes aircrew must consider tactical requirements and proximity to launch point before cycling jdam power 13242 ins quality u ins quality is affected by the quality of the transfer alignment and by environmental conditions ins quality is reported as good marginal or unsatisfactory good status indicates that the weapon iscapable of meeting both gpsaided and insonly specifica tion accuracy marginal status indicates that the weapon is capable of meeting gpsaided but not insonly specification accuracy an unsatisfactory alignmentindicates that the weapon is incapable of meeting eith er the gpsaided or the insonly specification accuracy u ins quality is not purely function of transfer alignment quality typically more aircraft maneuvering causes improvement in the transfer alignment quality and as result ins quality however optimum transfer alignment quality still may result in degraded weapon ins quality due to environmental conditions in case such as thisadditional aircraft maneuvering will not improve the ins quality for example if weapon displays 01 margit means that the weapon error estimates have exceeded reas onable expectations for 20 seconds or more or that the weapon is experiencing vibrations that are degrading the ins alignment thus the transfer alignment data is goodbut the weapon ins solution is not caution u jdam ins quality does not acc ount for aircraft navigation quality jdam ins quality may indicate 01 good when the aircraft is not in posains and the weapon navigation quality will not support specification accuracy aircraft nav igation quality must be evaluated as close to the launch point as possible to ensure jdam performance within the expected accuracy 1325 prerelease u in flight the weapon maintains passive captive carriage profile with the control fins locked in neutral position weapon functional operation does not change prior to release regardless of aircraft function or weaponselection jdam weapons continue the transfer alignment process and weapon health reporting in flight the weaponaccepts commands from the host aircraft to modify the assi gned pp mission targeting andor fuzing data assign different existing pp mission or create and assign new manually created pp mission for too modes the aircraft must employ onboard sensors of sufficient precision to automatically designate the target location for the weapon u when jdam weapon is selected for release the aircraft displays envelope cues for valid release if pp mode is selected the aircraft displays preplanned launch point launch h eading and lar if either pp or too mode is selected the aircraft displays dynamic ie flight conditiondependent minimum and maximum ranges direct attack cues and dynamiclar calculated using jdam 6degreeoffreedom lar algorithms stored in the aircraft mission computers the aircraftformats these cues for display in order to provide adequate steering and release point information with which to achieve valid launch condition for the selected mission parameters 1326 release u the aircraft provides automatic or manual release modes in automatic release modes the aircraft calculates valid release point for the weapon using the jdam lar algorithms stored in the aircraft and release isinhibited until this point is reached in manual release modes the aircraft enables release any time regardless of aircraft position with respect to valid weapon envelope in all cases the aircraft inhibits release of failed weapon but permits release of degraded weapon when the weapon station is commanded to release the weapon communicates final health status to the aircraft and the aircraft transmits final transfer alignment update to the weapon the weapon has activephysical operation during the aircraft release sequence the aircraft configures the bomb rack solenoids andor fuze power control as appropriate to ensure that the selected fuze status armed or safe is achieved if quantity release is in prog ress the aircraft ensure that the minimum release interval for jdam is met the aircraft then sends the irreversible command forstation release 1327 separation u at the moment of release the weapon initiates an internal timer during the first moments of flight after release the weapon retains the neutral control fin positions in order to allow for safe separation from the launchaircraft for the gbu31 this period is 1000 milliseconds or one second for the gbu3235 this delay is reduced to 300 milliseconds in order to damp higher postejection transient motions earlier in the weapon flight this early fin turn onmanages early energy usage to damp initial body rates in order to preserve expected terminal energy performance at the end of the prescribed delay the weapon commands the fins to unlock and enables the guidance systemsecret chapter 1 weapon description secret 1141328 midcourse 13281 initial maneuvering u initially jdam only

gpsrm is enabled approximately 3 seconds after release in order to avoid potential gps multipath errors due to aircraft proximity the gpsrm uses 5 channels for sate llite acquisition in lot 3 and prior weapons or 12 channels in lot 4 and subsequent weapons all but one channelacquire and track gps satellite signals using the l1 band the last channel sequences through the satellites trackedby the other channels using the l2 band in order to calculate ionospheric correction values to improve navigationaccuracy this last channel also searches for and r eceives data on any remaining reserve satellites in view u the gpsrm searches the sky for gps satellite signals using gps almanac and ephemeris data and ztod with good gps data the weapon typically acquires its first satellite within one second once the first satellite is located the weapon updates true ztod and satellite ephemeris to aid in acquisition of other satellite signals the jdam then continues to acquire additional satellites typically second satellite within three seconds and third satellite within seve n seconds and to make position measurement corrections an d achieve an accurate gps navigation solution of position velocity and time 13283 navigation scheme u if gps navigation solution is achieved the weapon blends the gps information into the ins navigation solution in order to improve weapon accuracy per specification the weapon nominally incorporates gpsaided navigation update into the guidance algorithm 27 seconds after gpsrm activation that is 30 seconds after weapon release including the delayed gpsrm activation if the weapon time of fall tof is less than 30 seconds then theweapon flight profile is completed using only the weapon ins for navigation to the target if after 30 seconds the weapon does not achieve gps navigation solution it continues using insonly navigation however over time the ins drifts fromthe original alignment at release the weapon commands midcourse guidance in the same way as if gps were available butthe net result is less accuracy as tof increases figure 113 illustrates typical gpsaided jdam flight using the gbu31 1000 millisecond safe separation scheme 13284 guidance control law u during flight the weapon utilizes bl ended control law for weapon guidance in order to achieve the specified impact point and term inal parameters regardless of release

antijamming techniques are limited to the abilityof the gps processor to identify and reject satellite data based on expected and compared values within the variouschannels of the receiver future upgrades of the jdam weapon may include more robust antijamming techniquesincluding improved antenna hardware and dedicated processing changes 1329 terminal u the weapon maneuvers to impact the dmpi acco rding to the selected terminal parameters of impact heading and impact angle in the last one seco nd of flight the weapon autopilot commands zero angle of attack in order reduce the probability of weapon breakup due to case slap and to improve penetration note u actual impact velocity is determined by the total energy at launch and the actual flight profile and isnot actively controlled or adjusted by the weapon during flight the specification of minimum impact velocity tailors the displayed lar in order to meet the computed launch energy requirementsecret chapter 1 weapon description secret 116u if the weapon is launched with an energy deficit for the planned attack the weapon guidance algorithm is designed to trade off the selected terminal parameters while maintaining maximum effectiveness the weapon prioritizes guidance to 1 reach the dmpi latitude longitude elevation then 2 meet terminal impact heading and impact angle then 3 meet terminal minimum impact velocity 14

integration secret 24caution u jdam continuous poweron time should be limited to 45 minutes below 1000 feet msl with ambient temperature at or above 113 degrees f in order to prevent overheating of the jdam gcu components caution u all gbu31 weapons incorporating friction brake tas are required to be powered continuously during flight below 20000 feet msl and airspeeds greater than 082 imn when loaded on any aircraftweapon station in order to detect excessive fin movement 2234 shipboard operations u there are cv operating restrictions specific to jdam but aircraft natops weight and asymmetry restrictions apply the jdam design is baselined on 25 catapultarrestment cycle life but there isno operational limit to the number of catapult launches and arrestments allowed on weapon u application of weapon power is recommended during cat apult launches and arrestments the weapon selfmonitors subsystem health and can detect failures resulting from the associ ated loads especially fin cr eep ie cs fail there is technical data to date to establish that catapult launches degrade the jdam navigation solution over the long term 224 release u jdam release modes include normal and backup modes similar to other stores section 24 details specific controls and displays associated with the release of jdam weapons 2241 primary release modes u jdam weapons may be delivered singly or in quantity in either the manual or autoloft release modes note u the autoloft release mode is not recommended for lowaltitude loft deliveries due to laruncertainties in the dynamic izlar it is recommend ed that the manual release mode be used for low altitude lofts 22411 single release u when manual release mode is selected release is available whenever the ag ready requirements are satisfied when autoloft release mode is lected the jdam weapon at the priority station must satisfy the ag ready requirements and the aircraft lar algorithm must indicated that the weapon is in zone while the bombbutton is depressed in order to initiate the release sequence 22412 quantity release u quantity of up to four jdam weapons of the same variant and same fuze configuration may be released in single pickle th quantity release sequence st eps through aircraft stations as 8273 for releasable weapons in the selected quantity and is independent of the priority station jdam are released at fixed minimum intervalof 300 milliseconds once the release sequence is initiated the sms attempts to release all of the releasable jdam weaponsin the selected quantity the hunggone determination is made only at the end of th release sequence u ag ready is achieved when at least one jdam in the selected quantity has satisfied the ag ready requirements in the manual release mode release is available whenever the ag ready requirements are satisfied in the autoloft releasemode the aircraft lar algorithm must indicate that all weapons in the selected quantity are in zone while the bombbutton is depressed in order to initiate the release sequence see section 24 2242 alternate release modes u in alternate release modes the weapon battery squib is not fired so weapon guidance avionics are not enabled and the release trajectory is comparable to that of an equivalent unguided weapon 22421 emergency jettison u emergency jettison is hardware function with rapid execution time all onboard weapons are jettisoned erasure of sensitive weapon data is attempted it is recommended that whenever possible weapon data be manually erased via the erase jdam option on the stores or jdam formats prior to initiatingemergency jettison 22422 selective jettison u upon initiation of selective jettison the lected weapons includ ing any hung stores are powered up and commanded to erase all sensitive weapon data after the erase command is sent the weapons are jettisoned as soon as possible it is recommended that whenever possible weapon data be manually erased via the erase jdam option on the stores or jdam formats prior to initiating selective jettisonsecret chapter 2 fa18 integration secret 2522424 auxiliary jettison u an auxiliary jettison is recommended only if selective jettison attempts fail with the auxiliary release switch enabled when the selective jettison switch is depressed the aircraft sends auxiliary breech fire commands to the selected racks the aircraft will not attemp t to erase sensitive weapon data it is recommended that whenever possible weapon data be manually erased via th erase jdam option on the stores or jdam formats prior to initiating auxiliary jettison 2243 hung release u hung release or hang fire is an abnormal release in which the weapon is enabled during normal store separation sequence but does not separate from the launch aircraft hung jdam weapon may have anactivated battery and the gcu and tas may be functioning therefore hung jdam may attempt to guide to the targetonce jettisoned average battery life is about 20 minutes theref ore jettison should not be attempted for 30 minutes after hung launch unless absolutely nece ssary furthermore the jdam battery has substantial thermal ffect if hung weapon is recovered the tail section can cause burns if handled without proper protection sufficient cooldown time of one houris recommended to prevent unnecessary injuries warning u during quantity release hung jdam weapon does not inhibit the remainder of the release this may result in an asymmetric load beyond th at authorized for or co ntrollable by the aircraft 23 fuzing 231 available fuze options u several fuze configurations are

fuze arming wire generally is required except for the fmu152 whenauthorized by cognizant directives electrical charging power is applied continuously to the fuze following initiator deployment during release fuze safearm status is controlled through manipulation of the bru32 bomb rack solenoidlatches during the release sequence the sms determines cock pit safearm selections and provides the necessary power to the selected release station racks to power the solenoids open or closed application of an arming impulse results in the appropriate solenoid powering closed to retain the fuze arming wire extracting it from the fuze gag rod and allowing fuzearming following the specified arm delay tim application of safing impulse results in the solenoid powering open to release the fuze

program was conceived from the outset with goal of providing maximum training while conserving operational assets or specifically weapon kits although the cost ofa jdam kit is low compared to other precisionguided munitions desire to preserve weapon inventory reflectedthe lessons learned during combat operations including op eration desert storm when in certain cases demand approached supply limits as well as manufacturing capability therefore in concept borrowed from the agm154jsow program training mode weapon simulation embedded in the aircraft software augments and substantiallyreplaces normal captive carriage training flights with this training mode embedded in scs software aircrews mayrehearse jdam missions with highfidelity simulation using most of the available jdamaircraft interface andwithout requirement to load an actual jdamconfigured weapon onto the aircraft note u although pported by the aircraft scs it is recommended that actual and simulated jdam weapons not be loaded simultaneously on the aircraft u the jdam training mode is programmed to provide realistic presentation to the aircrew of an actual jdam mission the simulation uses the actual lar calculation and display algorithms used for actual jdam weaponssecret chapter 2 fa18 integration secret 249252 requirements 2521 mission planning u mission planning is required for jdam training mode all mission data may be created in the cockpit using the existing jdam control options and display cues however if the onboard memory unit contains valid jdam mission pp andor too data for weapon station 2 it is used for jdam training mode pp missionsconversely if planning mission load specifically for jdam training mode sortie mission data must be created and loaded for weapon station 2 during memory unit download it is recommended that the missions be downloaded to allstations 2 3 7 and 8 for inflight flexibility 2522 aircraft preflight u jdam store is required jdam training mode simulation is available for every valid jdam station the training mode is supported by closing the aircraft bomb rack hooks on at least one stationprior to flight for each training station c0 weapon code is loaded into the wip although not required to enable jdam training mode it is recommended that va lid fuze code also be entered for each training station this prevents continual dud cue in the hud due to the undefined fuze settings note u load x advisory may indicate that at least one jdam training station is coded as c0 but hasopen vice closed bomb rack hooks note u jdam training stores on the outboard wing stations do not enable active oscillation control aocwhen wingtip stores are present 2523 cockpit setup u jdam training mode is selected by selecting the sim option pb15 on the stores format if valid jdam training stations are inventoried the sms presents jdam training weapon option on thestores format the jdam option enables the jdam formats and the simulated jdam interface note u the sim option is available on the stores format only if the master arm switch is in safe 253 interface 2531 control options and display cues u all jdamrelated formats

timer u the gps warmup timer is simulated fully during weapon initialization the timer appears on the stores and jdam formats for one minute following weapon powerup during which it simulates acountdown from 1000 minutes to 730 minutes and then is removed from the displays 25313 jdam bit u jdam bit is simulated for jdam training stations either individually or simultaneously per the existing bit format interface the simulation runs for 20 seconds bit failures are displayed 25314 available missions u up to six pp and two too missions are supported for each training station missions loaded for station 2 are used for all training stations 25315 jpf fuzing u if jpf tail fuze code is entered the efuz option on the stores format and the jpf option on the mission data format are availabl to control and modify jdam fuzing selections 25316 prerelease steering cues u all preplanned if available and dynamic lar cues steering cues on the hud ag and hsi formats are presented

presented and calculated using computed tof based on the current flight conditions and selected simulated arm time 25318 quantity releases u quantity releases are supported in jdam training mode the stores format step option is fully functional care should be taken when manually defining mission data for quantity releases to avoidan invalid null intersection izlar ie inzone cues and release capability 25319 weapon release u typical jdam launch delay is implemented during simulated weapon release upon simulated jdam release freeze data is captured pos tlaunch time is activated and the priority station steps automatically if more than one training station is availabl the training weapon station is not removed at release and is available for subsequent selection and release 2532 training limitations u although great deal of fidelity is included in the jdam training simulation the following limitations currently exist 25321 weapon status and health cues u weapon and weapon subsystem failures degrades are not presented furthermore degraded weapon navigation solution quality does not occur jdam training stations always indicate an 01good navigation quality status the typical transfer alignment procession from 10 unst to 01 good is notprovided 25322 postrelease recovery of training mode u if only one training jdam station is selected then after simulated release cycling ie unboxing and boxing the j dam training weapon option on the stores format may be required in order to recover jdam training mode 25323 erroneous gps data cues u even if gps data is included in the mission planning download jdam training station 2 will always display gps keys and gps data cues this idiosyncrasy does not affectjdam training mode operation for weapon station 2 25324 freeze data limitations u freeze data is provided for the first simulated release of each training jdam station loaded on the aircraft freeze da ta functionality for any station can be reset for subsequent simulated releases by cycling the jdam training weapon option on the stores format 25325 erase jdam option u the erase jdam option is removed from the stores and jdam formatssecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3130 mission planning note u this chapter provides discussion of the overall jdam mission planning process actual jdam mission planning procedures and checklists are provided in annex b 31 preplanning considerations 311 weapon viability u the first and most important decision regarding jdam employment is determining its viability of use while jdam offers variety of advant ages over other inventory weapons for many strike scenarios mission success in terms of singleround jdam accuracy depends on two key environmental factors 3111 gps environmental factors u weapon gps denial can occur in threat gps jamming or ea6b band 4 or 6 jamming environment and can result in imuonly guidance to reduce the inaccuracies associated with imuonlyguidance shorten the weapon tof to 28 seconds or less or increase the number of jdam employed there is nopractical workaround for launch aircraft gps denial launch aircraft gps denial causes inaccurate aircraft positionhandoff to the weapon therefore if mission calls for jdam as the best weaponeering solution and the possibility foraircraft gps denial is high then choose another weapon 3112 maneuvering factors u jdam is susceptible to transfer alignment errors induced by aircraft navigational uncertainties particularly gps denial when combined with rge vertical velocity changes gps denial due to airframe antenna masking ie inverted flight is germane when gps altitude is lost the fa18cd reverts to barosmoothedinertial altitude as the nextbest source however the barometr ic lag error associated with high vertical rates induces system altitude inaccuracy should posains pos ition keeping be lost causing reversion to posins the aircraft navigation system requires 22 seconds to recover gpsaided solution after returning to posains position keepingdue to filtering within the ins this is the minimum delay before the jdam weapon can be expected to receive txa with gpsaided position and velocity information this delay does not include filtering delays in the weapon itself u any altitude inaccuracy requires time to wash out of the w eapons kalman filter if the weapon is released with an erroneous altitude then miss distance increases particularly for low terminal impact angles although the weapon cancorrect txa handoff errors of reasonable magnitude af ter launch given gps and sufficient tof specification accuracy is not assured unless gpsquality handoff is provid ed therefore if radical defensive aircraft maneuvering to include inverted flight combined with large vertical velocities is required in the target area within minutes of theexpected launch point such that posains can be recovere d for at least 30 seconds prior to the launch point then it is recommended that jdam not be released unless the potentia l for wide miss can be tolerated this consideration includes the potential necessity for either preemptive or r eactive antimissile defense maneuvers andor highdive roll ins if high altitude ingress and release profile can be employed to reduce the threat risk and at the same time increasejdam tof then jdam viability is increased 3113 targeting accuracy u jdam requires target coordinates mensurated to at least 72 meter tle in order to meet its specification cep if this threshold targeting accuracy cannot be met or if supplied coordinates cannot beverified in terms of guaranteed targeting accuracy then the strike mission planner must consider the efficacy ofemploying jdam balanced against the possibility of mission failure due to miss distance andor collateral damage 312 weapon exploitation u there are several capabilities inherent in the jdam weapon system that may be exploited when planning and executing the strike mission these capabilities combine for high probability ofmission success by providing extremely flexible weaponeeri ng solutions against targets regardless of environmental conditions andor target area threat levels 3121 autonomous guidance u there is launch aircraft support after jdam release this provides the flexibility to minimize aircraft vulnerability in highthreat target area using only the achievement of valid release point as the maj or planning factor in the target areasecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 323122 high offboresight targeting u there is requirement to aim ballistically or otherwise point jdam at the desired impact point since the aircraft provides situational display of the ppizlar and launch point regardless ofaircraft orientation the aircrew possesses sufficient cues to rrive at prevalidated release point without ever pointing at the target assuming the other preplanned launch conditions can be met this capability provides an excellent means ofattacking defended targets while skirting the edge of the highrisk radius about the target this capability is best exploitedby executing pp missions as planned because dynamically computed realtime targeting cues are available only when thetarget is within limited area about the aircraft heading thus limiting the offboresight advantage 3123 programmable impact conditions u jdam can execute threedimensional attack against point target using terminal heading and impact angle to define the approach to the target jdam also can accept minimum terminal impact velocity to optimize damage effects this programmability provides an excellent means of tailoring attacks againstvertically or horizontally oriented hard or soft targets 3124 flexible fuzing u an important improvement brought with the jdam system is the addition of the fmu152 jpf with it inflight cockpit programmability in flight affords the aircrew credible ability to create an effective strikemission in real time also the strike planner is presented with an unprecedented selection of arm times and functionaldelays with which to weaponeer missions this provides flexible and effective fuzing solution for variety of missions 3125 shaped trajectory u since jdam does not fall ballistically but rather follows controlled shaped midcourse trajectory single launch point may be defined to release quantity of jdam at targets widely separated and on differentaxes at release for the same reason single jdam quantity may be employed to strike both horizontally and vertically oriented targets in the same release this force multiplication capability provides the option of reducing the total aircraftrequirement by employing single aircraft to attack several targets 3126 point targeting u since jdam is targeted precisely using pointtarget bomboncoordinate scheme and ballistic dispersion is not consideration single jdam weapon may be employed against target that otherwise wouldrequire stick of several ballistic weapons this force multip lication capability provides the option of reducing the total aircraft requirement by employing single weapon to attack single target in weapons incorporating the 12channel gps receiver more satellites are available to calculate horizontal and vertical position and veloc ity and to correct time errors this results in both better horizo ntal and vertical position accuracy 3127 allweather guidance u since jdam navigates using an internal ins and gps radio signals weather andor other obscuring environmental conditions do not affect weapon accuracy or operation this capability allows the option to avoid deferring or canceling strikes due to problematic conditions in the target area 313 planning factors u in addition to the strike planning factors standard to other weapons jdam strike planning also considers sources for the target coordi nate gpsrelated factors and guided trajectory factors 3131 target altitude datum selection u the hae height above ellipsoid elevation datum is recommended over the msl elevation datum as gpsaided weapon jdam naturally references hae which is referenced externally to theearth based on the mean curvature of the globe as opposed to msl which is referenced to mean surface datum sea level msl coordinates are converted to hae for use with the weapon if hae coordinates are used then one additional error contribution truncation during conversion is avoided 3132 launch parameter selection u launch parameter selection is influenced first and foremost by the weaponeering requirements for given mission ie weapon ergy requirements and secondly by the tactical threat environment when flexibility is available launch parameters may be chosen to optimize jdam performance as follows 31321 launch altitude and airspeed u it is recommended that jdam be employed at as high an altitude and as fast an airspeed as tactically feasible for the weaponeering solu tion this results in better weapon accuracy due to more gps tracking time and better weapon navigation solution accuracy mo re flexible launch decision due to larger lar and better terminal parameter control due to more energysecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3331322 launch point u it is recommended that jdam be released from point near the heart of the ppizlar envelope ideally 75 deep along the launch axis avoiding the edge of the ppizlar reduces many uncertainties andincreases weapon energy management margins 31323 launch axis heading u if terminal impact heading is defined then it is recommended that whenever possible the launch axis heading be as close as possible to the terminal impact heading in order to maximize the lar depending on where the release point is within the envelope in relation to minimum and maximum range it is possible thateven with over 30 degrees of heading change the typical launch point around 75 deep remains within the lar note u jdam does not attempt to fly along the specified rminal impact heading for any prescribed range but instead maneuvers only to impact the targ et along the azimuth specified by the heading 31324 launch attitude u level releases are optimum for jdam in many cases dives and lofts actually reduce the standoff range of jdam for given release condition figures 3 1 and 32 the weapon seeks prescribed flight trajectory based on its current position relative to the target so the additional energy potentially expended in nulling flight pathdeviations from its optimum profile can cause reduced performance also dive release profiles do not improve jdamterminal performance in terms of impact velocity penetration depth or overall effectiveness and in many instances reduceit therefore dive deliveries are t recommended except in certain cases of tactical necessity in summary it is recommended that level release be planned and employed whenever feasible release angle 30g176ranges in feetrelease angle 0g176 figure 31 typical effect of dive release on jdam lar u u release attitude changes the overall weapon flight trajectory to the target figure 33 but since the weapon flies to fixed coordinate it does not affect the final impact point 3133 terminal parameter selection u terminal parameter selection is influenced first and foremost by the weaponeering requirements for given mission when flexibility is available terminal parameters may be chosen tooptimize jdam performance 31331 terminal impact angle u steeper terminal impact angles result in better accuracy because gps navigation is more accurate in the horizontal ground plane latitude and longitude than in the vertical plane altitude due to higheruncertainty in the gps vertical solution therefore it is recommended that target be designated and attacked as horizontal rather than vertical whenever the choice existssecret

influences jdam in three ways first the flight profile of the weapon from the aircraft to the target changes with terminal impact angle figure 34 s econd as terminal impact angle is increased the maximum and minimum launch ranges decrease with net effect of significantly smaller displayed lar and the lar itself shifts closerto the target thus providing less standoff conversely shallower impact angle expands the displayed lar and shifts itaway from the target thus providing more standoff available the lar will again shrink as the impact angle is becomesacutely shallow third given fixed launch point as the term inal impact angle is increased the weapon terminal velocity decreases since the weapon expends additional energy through induced drag flying flatter profile to the terminal divepointsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 35u it is recommended that terminal impact angle of 65 degrees or more be selected against horizontally oriented target and less than 30 degrees be selected against vertically orie nted target in order to provide tactical utility for the weap on lar for very low angles less than 30 degrees or very high angles approaching 90 degrees only small increase in weaponeffectiveness is gained with large reduction in lar this is particularly true with respect to low impact angles where great deal of energy is required to achieve even minimum unch

nonalignment on jdam lar u 3134 target coordinate generation u target location error tle comprises large portion of the total jdam system error as such highly accurate coordinates improve overall mission effectiveness by improving weapon accuracy tothe greatest degree there are several sources that provide mensurated target coordinates each of which having uniquecharacteristics coordinates obtained for jdam mission always should be appended with an accuracy statement or tle note that stated tle usually is threshold of coordinate accu racy for example standard coordinate set with tle of 72 meters which is the assumption for jdam accuracy specificatio ns listed in section 141 is guaranteed to be accurate to at least 72 meters even though it may be less than 72 meters from truth see section 3421 3135 tot selection u along with terrain masking jamming and magr system errors uere pdop contributes to the uncertainty in gps position fix annex strike planners must consider pdop effects toreduce the risk of missing the target causing collateral damage andor forcing restrike that induces further risk although pdop spikes may be shortlived their coincidence with tot cannot be ignored pdop predictions forany given geographic location on any given day and at any given time are valid up to days in advance since pdopcannot be controlled good pdop prediction and avoidan ce are germane by avoiding pdop spikes the position navigation component of total system error may be reduced u whenever feasible it is recommended that tot for jdam missions be planned when the pdop for the target location is minimum within the allowable strike window the strike planner is interested in pdop sensitivity wrt time on targettot that is what the pdop at tot is and how much it changes as tot is varied this may accomplished on tampsonly by replanning the mission using different totsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 37u pdop is represented in tamps planning by circular reference

default is standard day conditions with winds standard current weatherconditions current may be available and are only as current as the update uploaded by the tamps administratornote that even if current weather is uploaded the data may not include winds if current weather is not availablethen historical winds may be used historical the tamps lar model can utilize manually entered winds orhistorical seasonal average winds manually edited winds may be copied from route to route u jdam lars are based only on ground speed not winds aloft after jdam is released the weapon guidance and control logic calculates the flight path to the target if the actual winds encountered during the tof differ from release winds so much that they cause an energy deficit for the weapon it employs an energy priority scheme to maximizeeffectiveness see section 1329 note u stored wind data ie stores format wi nds option is ignored in jdam lar calculation 314 weaponeering 3141 weapon effects 31411 blast u blast generally is associated with kkill blast is highly catastrophic damage mechanism but generally is very localized with small mean area of effec tiveness mae blast is strongly influenced by warhead size and fuzing and is less affected by terminal impact angle terminal heading and terminal impact velocity to maximize jdam blast effects employ gbu31v2b at impact angles of 65 degrees or greater with instantaneous or very shortfunctional delay fuzing to contain collateral damage effects employ terminal impact angle as high as possible terminalheading that optimizes the blast direction short functional delay and the smaller gbu3235 warhead 31412 fragmentation u fragmentation generally is associated with firepower mobility or lossoffunction kill fragmentation is less catastrophic damage mechanism than blast but provides much greater mae fragmentation effects are strongly influenced by fuzing terminal impact angle and as impact angle shallows terminal heading fragmentation is less affected by terminal impact velocity to maximize jdam fragmentation effects employ either the gbu3235 or gbu31v2b both have similar fragmentation effects at impact angles of 65 degrees or greater withdsu33 proximity fuzing collateral damage is not considered against fragmentation objectives figure 37 illustratestypical fragmentation effects with and without 20foot proximity fuzing 31413 penetration penetration generally is associated with hard target lossoffunction kills penetration usually is coupled with blast andor overpressurization in terms of damage mechanism with very small mae and the associatedneed for precision penetration effects are influenced heavily by terminal impact velocity and angle of attack at impact and to lesser degree by terminal heading and terminal impact angle although both are important in terms of target orientation note u terminal impact velocity and penetration is function of weapon launch energy and thus isinfluenced primarily by altitude and airspeed at release terminal impact velocity is not controlled oraffected by the selected minimum impact velocity this value is used to tailor the ppizlarsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret

37 typical effect of proximity fuzing on fragmentation u u in order to maximize jdam penetration effects employ the gbu31v4b at impact angles of 75 degrees or greater for horizontal targets or at 35 degrees for vertical targets using the fmu152 jpf to select an appropriate functional delaycalculated for the desired penetration depth from the wide selection available the fixed 60millisecond delay of thefmu143 fuze is considered liability when weapon eering to achieve specific penetration depth note u terminal impact angle less than 35 degrees against vertical target provides little additional penetration but significantly affects the valid release envelope for any given flight condition byconstricting the maximum and minimum employment ranges 31414 denial u denial generally is associated with loss of acce ss functionality denial usually is coupled with blast and to lesser degree with fragmentation in terms of damage mechanism denial effects are influenced heavily by fuzingand are also affected by terminal impact velocity in terms of depth of burial to maximize denial effects employ the jdam appropriate to the delivery requirements soft or hard target at impact angles of 65 degrees or greater to minimize bomb skip or breakup due to case slap using the fmu152 jpf to select functional delay appropriate for the desired period ofdenial the ability to select an independent functional delay for each jdam allows the strike planner to create series of single releases or quantity release agains t target that could deny it effectively for up to 24 hours if jpf is usedsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 393142 fuzing components selection u several fuzing components are available for jdam applications however it is recommended that the fmu152 jpf be employed whenever available the following optionscurrently are available 31421 fmu152 u the fmu152 jpf is recommended for all jdam applications due to its inflight programmability and the flexibility it provides in weaponeering target cases use of the fmu152 jpf requires themk122 mod 0 electrical safety switch the fzu55 mechanical initiator is not supported on the fa18 the jpf is hardened sufficiently for use in hardtarget penetration roles u the fmu152mk122 electrical fuzing configuration offers four advantages over the fmu139fzu48 mechanical fuzing configuration the first is cockpit programmability th second is much wider variety of arm time and functioning delay settings for weaponeering the third is dual functionality with backup default mode should primary digital controlbe lost or disabled the fourth is mission planning and downloading of fuze settings reducing the overall cockpit workloadfor the aircrew u the fmu152 offers programmable and inflight cockpitselectable arm time and functioning delay settings otherwise not available on the fuze faceplate since it is desirable to back up programmed arm time and functioning delay settings inthe event of serial communication failure to the jpf it is recommended that whenever possible arm time and functioning delay be selected from the available fuze faceplate subset such that if the default faceplate values become necessary theweaponeering case remains valid 31422 fmu139 the fmu139 provides adequate jdam support and requires the use of the fzu48b mechanical initiator use with the mk122 switch for jdam applications is not authori zed the fzu configuration provides authorized arm times in excess of 10 seconds which relieves the constraints imposed on the mk122 configuration by safe escape limitations as calculated by the slic the fzu configuration also allows for unrestricted tof which relieves the 60second tof restriction imposed on the mk122 configuration due to therated fuze capacitor discharge rate u the fzu48 mechanical fuzing configuration offers two advantages over the mk122 electrical fuzing configuration the first is that arm times greater than 10 seco nds are authorized this allows for less restrictive deliverie s above 20000 feet msl due to safe escape considerations with arm times of 10 seconds or less the second is that plannedtime of fall tof may exceed 60 seconds which is the maximum tof allowable with the mk122 switch due to thefmu139 capacitor specified discharge rate the disadvantage of the fzu48 configuration is that fuze options only arepreset via faceplate settings before flight and are not modifiable in flight u the fmu139bb variant is recommended over the fm u139ab variant the bb variant is of more recent manufacture thus has lower shelf life age and is constructed with slighter more reliable and durable componentsthe two variants are functionally identical 31423 fmu143 u the fmu143 with the fzu32 provides limited hardtarget penetration capability the fixed 60millisecond delay of the fmu143 fuze is cons idered liability when w eaponeering hardtarget penetration case as compared to the hardt arget flexibility inherent in the fmu152 jpf u the advantage of the fmu143fzu32 configuration over the fmu152mk122 configuration is relief of tof limitations the disadvantage of the fmu143 is fixed arm time and functioning delay when weaponeering specific cases 31424 dsu33 u the dsu33 annex d provides reliable air burst function with an operational fixed height of burst specification of 5 to 35 feet furthermore by selecting functioning delay in conjunction with the dsu33 it ispossible to attack targets above ground that are shielded for example against an aboveground target shielded by thick jungle canopy the dsu33 can detect the upper tree line and provide proximity signal to the fuze and use of theappropriate functioning delay permits the bomb to freefall through the tree canopy for an aboveground burst prior to bombburial u use of dsu33 in quantity releases must be considered car efully in terms of bomb fratricide due to proximity bursts this includes dmpis assigned by the tamps qrm in the si ngletarget quantity release module see section secret chapter 3 mission planning secret 310u when the dsu33 is used in conjunction with the fmu139 general purpose fuze two important limitations exist g183 if the fmu139 is configured with the mk122 electrical safety switch the dsu33 functions according to the polarized voltage received from the aircraft like the fmu139 fuze itself the dsu33 proximity function isenabled using the same voltage encoding used to select th faceplate functioning delay thus there is way to separate functioning delay and proximity fuzing using the fmu139 and mk122 configuration whenweaponeering it is recommended that instantaneous fuzing be selected on the fuze faceplate inst this allows the aircrew the option of selecting either contact fuzing by selecting the efuz inst on the stores format or selecting proximity fuzing by selecting efuz vt1 on the stores format g183 if the fmu139 is configured with the fzu48 initiator the dsu33 always is enabled and cannot be overridden as cockpit control options are prov ided or relevant since the dsu33 uses arming lanyards for mechanical fuze control 3143 bomb fratricide avoidance u the jdam weapon system does not diminish the existing risk of bomb fratricide with existing inventory warheads warhead fragment ation and dispersion are not affected directly by the jdam guidance system or kit therefore jdam weaponeering solutions even though created by automated tools such as tampsand slic must be screened by the strike planner for the possibility of sympathetic detonations in order to introduce thesteps necessary to reduce the risk to acceptable levels in par ticular use of the dsu33 proximity sensor in quantity release s against single target greatly increases the risk of bomb fratricide and must be planned carefully u mk84 fratricide study determined the probability of sympathetic detonation exceeds 10 inside of 150 feet warhead proximity but exceeds 50 inside of 50100 feet warhead proximity the study assumed instantaneous detonation vicepartial bomb burial flat earth with aboveground objects and purely perpendicular fragment impacts therefore these values represent very conservative planning assumption the probability of fratricide among blu109 warheads issignificantly lower because the thicker bomb case reduces fragmentationfragment velocity as well as case penetrationcharacteristics and because functioning delay of greater than zero typically is employed which result in bomb burial prior to detonation u thus very low probability exists for warheads arriving at 1000 feet per second more than 150 milliseconds apart or at 500 feet per second at more than 300 milliseconds apart the f a18 aircraft releases jdam weapons at fixed interval of 300 milliseconds but the shaped jdam trajectories can result in the weapons arriving at the target closer than the releaseinterval and in some cases in sequence different from release thus jdam minimum release interval cannot be used asthe sole mitigation for fratricide on the other hand jdam can partially offset fratricide risk through the use of its command terminal impact parameters by carefully selec ting valid and compatible terminal headings and angles rudimentary bomb deconfliction can be effected however the resulting reduction in lar and particularly in intersection lar must be carefully balanced against the net effect in preventing fratricide u therefore it is recommended that whenever possible quantity releases against single target be planned with sufficiently spaced release intervals furthermore it is r ecommended that dsu33 proximity sensors not be used as the fa18 minimum release interval is insufficient to adequately prevent bomb fratricide finally when the jdam attack is against an area target in addition to the qrm automatic dmpi allocation consideration should be given to the conservativeuse terminal headings and varied terminal impact angles but not at the expense of valid lar adequate to supportsuccessful release of the jdam quantity in zone 32 planning tools 321 overview u primary jdam mission planning is accomp lished using the tactical automated mission planning system tamps tamps uploads mission and gps data as bulk data file onto mu which is hand carried to the aircraft the mission data is transferred automatically to the aircraft and to the onboard jdam weapons when power is applied however other resources not integrated into tamps are required to complete all mission planning tasks therefore disciplined methodology is required 322 hardware u the jdam mission planning technique is highly automated jdam mission planning requires access to both tamps workstation and generic personal computer pc workstationsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3113221 tamps workstation u the tamps workstation hosts the tamps software the fa18 and jdam software modules and various data relevant to jdam mission planning before jdam mission can be planned the workstationmust be readied by loading current gps almanac and crypto keys basic discussion of these procedures follows checklists for accomplishing these tasks are contained in annex b 32211 gps almanac loading u gps almanac data should be loaded onto the tamps workstation once per week due to satellite irregularities it is difficult to predict the cons tellation far in advance and almanac can become stale st ale almanac impacts the jdam mission by increasing the amount of time required for the aircraft to locate and acquire gps satellites u gps almanac data may be downloaded directly via precision lightweight gps receiver or plgr anpsn11 almanac data retrieved in this way requires conversion to the navstaralm format which may be accomplished using standard windowsbased pc running the plgralmexe software another method for obtaining gps almanac is viainternet download annex b lists several trustworthy unclassified sites that provide navstaralm in the proper formatfor immediate download to floppy disk these internet almanac files are updated externally via plgr each monday or tuesday if monday is designated holiday u it is recommended that whenever feasible gps almanac be downloaded directly from gps satellite almanac data retrieved from other sources such as downloads off the internet may not be free of transcription errors or as fresh as theassigned date indicates if downloading is the only viable method it is recommended that professional military site beused regardless of where the navstaralm file is obtained it must be reviewed to ensure that it is not corrupted the downloaded file may be viewed in windows notepad if the data doesnt appear in tabular form it shouldnt be used u although jdam does not use the gps almanac uploaded from tamps into the mu the gps almanac must be maintained current in tamps in addition to supporting other gps weapons like slam and jsow gps almanac in tamps is required for jdam mission planning to support gps pdop calculations for cep estimation in support ofweaponeering note u gps almanac data typically is downloaded into tamps by the tamps administrator 32212 gps crypto key loading u gps crypto keys may be loaded manually or automatically the latter is recommended and is the only practical method two weeks of crypto keys are selected for jdam bulk data file download the current week and the upcoming week based on the date in the tamps workstation internal clock u the following common errors in loading gps crypto keys are presented in the order of frequency of occurrence g183 u wrong key type should be weekly vice yearly or monthly cvw vice gov and akata1001 vice akat1101 do not rely on an automatic selection of key type select the key type explicitly g183 u wrong week crossed kyk13 channels g183 u wrong key nongps key erroneously entered as gps key g183 u wrong system time tamps should be set by administrator referenced to zulu gmt time g183 u wrong crypto period g183 u wrong short title for cyz10 prevents keys from loading u weekly gps rollover occurs at 0000z sundays there are known crypto key anomalies associated with event nonstandard loading procedures are not required for correct mission data creation and successful loading of gps crypto keys an mu upload on saturday night for sunday mission is not required manipulation of the system clock to tricktamps into successful download is not authorized and could result in mission failures due to corrupted mission datasecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 312caution u do not tamper with the jdam sy stem time in order to control gps crypto key status tamps relies on the correct time and date for other important functions such as weaponeering and gps pdoppredictions u specific procedures for correct gps cryp to key loading are provided in annex b 3222 pc workstation u common pc workstation is required for safe escape computational software and is desirable to accomplish other useful mission planning tasks the pc must be windowsbased but is not required to be networked all supporting data is contained in the software additional pc file maintenance is required 323 software 3231 minimum versions u minimum software versions for jdam mission planning are

accomplished using the jsowjdam cmpm v621 in tamps this reference uses jmem data and methodology to provide both an ssp d for single weapon or p d calculation for multiple weapons the most accurate method of weaponeering involves both the cmpm and jaws v20 the basic mission is planned with thecmpm but the weaponeering module is ignored except for date and tot to account for gps pdop on

cmpmcalculated cep 32322 gbu31v4b planning tools u basic mission planning for the gbu31v4b blu109 variant is accomplished in manner similar to that of the gbu 31v2b and gbu3235 weapons the gbu31v4b is weaponeered using pceffect software which is included with jaws v20 softwaresecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3133233 cmpm overview u the jsowjdam cmpm provides common automated interface for both the jsow and jdam weapons the cmpm provides means to define desired mean point of impact dmpi select release conditions calculate weapon andor mission effectiveness and upload mission data onto an mu for storage and transportfor the jdam weapon the cmpm also supports the creation of missions that employ quantity releases against one or agroup of dmpis in order to ensure that all steps of the mission planning checklist is accomplished the cmpm provides apulldown menu smart checklist as guide for jdam mission planning annex b u when planning jdam missions the cmpm fulfills the majority of requirements including weaponeering the jdam cmpm weaponeering module uses jmem data and methodology to calculate the probabilities of destruction for both single and multiple weapons against target the cmpm provides jdam smart checklist to guide the planner through jdam mission planning annex b once mission is planned with the cmpm the data isdigitally transferred to the tamps fa18 mpm where it is combined with other mission planning data such asroute of flight refueling points gps keys and almanac data with which to build the final bulk data file note u the jdam cmpm weaponeering module has two impor tant limitations first there are limited sets of target classessubclasses from which to select second the cmpm does not accurately take intoaccount bomb burial for instantaneous detonations and may provide an optimistic damage estimate 33 data requirements 331 bulk data files u each jdam weapon carried aboard the fa18 aircraft can carry its own individual bulk data file this bulk data file consists of eight target data sets and one set of up to two weeks of gps crypto keys thetarget data sets are broken down into six pp and two too missions the bulk data file is initially created in the cmpmthis data file is output by the cmpm with space built in for gp s crypto keys the bulk data file is selected for uploading into an aircraft weapon station file on the mu using the fa18 mpm when jdam bulk data file the jsowjdam preprocessor writes the gps crypto keys into the bulk data file and prepares the file for loading on the mu up to fourindividual bulk data files may be loaded on the mu in order to support up to four valid jdam weapon stations the fa18mpm also assigns default startup missions for each station if not specified explicitly by the mission planner 332 minimum jdam targeting data u in order to function jdam requires specific data minimum target data set tds is required to launch jdam weapon that guides successfully to the desired mean point of impactdmpi however several supporting mission planning functions such as weaponeering generation of gps predictionsetc may be required to provide the level of effectiveness to achieve full mission success 3321 target data set u jdam requires gpsquality latitude longitude and elevation coordinates mensurated with sufficient precision in the wgs84 datum see annex the jdam specification coordinate requirement ie tle forthreshold accuracy is 72 meters the only real measure of how accurate coordinates must be is the overall weaponeered effectiveness against the selected target allowable coordinate formats are dd g176 mm ssss or dd g176 mmmmm for the ground plane jdam also requires an elevation coordinate referenced explicitly either to height above ellipsoid hae ormean sea level msl altitude coordinates entered in msl are converted to hae automatically by the weapon using aninternal gpsrm algorithm 3322 gps crypto keys u minimum tds will allow the weapon to guide to the target but without the required gps data navigation the weapon relies on ins only and the specified gpsaided accuracy cannot be achieved thereforein real sense gps usage is critical to true weapon effec tiveness and gps crypto keys are the most critical gps data jdam cannot navigate on the coarse acquisition signal cacode therefore weapon release without gps crypto keys results in insonly navigation and its associated accuracy degradation u the fa18 aircraft interface supports manual entry and editing of jdam data from the cockpit however practical method of entering valid gps crypto keys in real time has been demonstrated the only feasible method is bulk datatransfer of mission data from mu even in reactive scenarios where it is anticipated that jdam will be manuallyprogrammed in the air the weapon still requires mu mission data load generated by tamps in order to obtain gpscrypto keys it is recommended that jdam weapons be load ed with two weeks present week and future week of gps crypto keys the proper crypto key is the weekly akat a1001 which is loaded into the tamps system using thestandard cyz10 unit connected to tamps workstation serial portsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 314note u gps crypto keys are required for jdam mission planning tamps will not upload mission bulk data onto the mu in the absence of gps crypto key but instead will provide message warning of nogps crypto keys successful upload is indicated by the absence of this warning method 333 other targeting data 3331 terminal impact data u terminal impact parameters may be provided to tailor the weapon profile and trajectory into the target to maximize the desired damage m echanism the cmpm may be used to program values for terminal heading terminal impact angle and minimum terminal impact velocity if values are specified the weapon uses default values terminal heading value is recommended only for vertically oriented targets 3332 target classification data u if the cmpm is used to weaponeer the mission certain target parameters are required these include target hardness hard medium or soft and target orientation vertical horizontal or buried in order to calculate p d mean area of effectiveness mae is required mae is calculated automatically by selecting target class and subclass from the cmpm list and specifying the desired kill level mae also may be entered manually forareatype targets target height length and width are required figure 38 if the jdam quantity release manager is used to distribute aim points the target dimensions and longaxis azimuth is required north orientationwidth lengthaxis figure 38 mae dimensionality u 3333 target offset data u dmpi may be defined as an offset from mensurated coordinate this offset is specified as range bearing and relative elevation change if values are specified the offset is assumed to be zero caution u the centroid of the target for single target quan tity release cannot be fined using offset data because the offset field is used by tamps to generate each desired mean point of impact dmpiwhen generating the quantity release dmpis the qrm will overwrite any offset data which may result in wide misses andor undesirable collateral damage caution u offset elevation must be entered in the aircraft as absolute elevation for the desired impact point in contrast to the differential elevation with respect to the offset reference point expected by the tamps cmpm confusion over the elevation entry format between the aircraft interface and the tampsinterface may result in wide misses and undesirable collateral damagesecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3153334 jpf data u if an fmu152b jpf is used fuze arm time and functional delay settings may be selected to load automatically into the bulk data file if values are specified jpf defaults to preset values if serial communication withthe jdam exists and defaults to the faceplate settings if serial communication with the jdam does not exist 334 other mission data u in order to weaponeer jdam the cmpm generates cep prediction for specified release parameter jdam cep is based on the over all weapon system error and is affected by several factors see section 142 other mission planning data may be provided or specified to tamps that does not contribute directly tonavigation to the target but contributes to weapon effectivene ss against the target by accounting for the various variable erro r components of the jdam system the weapon requires the following data to maximize its effectiveness 3341 tle estimate u tle estimate is provided to tamps to account for true position error tle may be calculated by the shipboard apps detachment that provides the mensurated coordinates for dmpi tle can beconsidered constant across dppdb cell therefore if tle s already been calculated for particular cell that time consuming step does not have to be repeated for another dmpi within that cell this is an advantage of dppdb usage 3342 tot and date u tot and date provide tamps with reference to calculate the pdop which accounts for gps systemic error an accurate tot provides effective weaponeering in terms of calculating the p d for specific release or recommended release to achieve desired p d 3343 gps almanac data u the jsowjdam cmpm uses gps almanac data in the weaponeering process to calculate pdop or gps system error for the given tot and da however gps almanac data is forecast and predictive gps ephemeris data on the other hand is downloaded directly from the satellites in real time making it more accurate insatellite position error estimate and availability therefore jdam does use gps almanac data made available by tampsfor storage on the mu rather jdam receives gps ephemeris data directly from the aircraft magr at regular intervals caution u with the tamps system core version 62k and earlier do not select the gps almanac upload option when mission planning this option corrupts the aircraft magr almanac due to weeknumber formatting incompatibility which can cause very long lays up to 45 minutes in aircraft acquisition of gps satellites and in turn may render all loade d jdam weapons effecti vely unusable for given mission this deficiency is corrected with tamps system core version 621 and subsequent 34 methodology 341 overview 3411 general mission planning considerations u in order to minimize the overall planning and execution effort while maximizing the capability of jdam weapons the following considerations are recommended wheneverpossible g183 u plan and execute jdam missions in wgs84 coordinates g183 u use steeper dive angles ie 60 g176 or more to increase jdam accuracy g183 u attack target as horizontal target if choice exists g183 u avoid using terminal heading to minimize lar constraints g183 u avoid dive deliveries as they do not significantly enhance penetration but reduce weapon lar g183 u avoid loft deliveries at medium to high altitudes as they actually decrease standoff range larsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3163412 general jdam mission planning flow u planning jdam attack with multiple weapons on multiple aircraft can be extremely complex and confusing in the planning phase to simplify the process the following general planningrules are recommended g183 u establish good consistent naming convention for routes and missions in order to simplify planning g183 u plan each target as an individual weapon route and give it simple name g183 u plan which aircraft will attack which set of dmpis and write it down g183 u use the quantity release manager to generate ro utes for targets requiring more than one weapon g183 u use the quantity release manager to gr oup weapon releases for each aircraft g183 u establish consistent convention for placing missions in dataloads to simplify execution g183 u use the mission packagesdataloads option 342 creating new jdam route 3421 target coordinate generation u weapon coordinates either may be passed explicitly or must be mensurated implicitly from an assigned target in either case the coordinates must meet the minimum standard of accuracy for jdamemployment section 142 there are several sources that provide mensurated target coordinates each of which having unique characteristics specification accuracy requires tle of 72 meters expected accuracy improves with smaller tle and worsens with larger tle currently the only acceptable afloat method for mensurating jdamquality coordinates isthe controlled method using diwsa workstation or precision targeting workstation ptw 34211 digital point position database dppdb u dppdb currently is one of two recommended sources for acquiring jdam target coordinates the advantages of d ppdb are good accuracy superior to photobased references mensuration directly into the wgs84 datum without conversion the capability of conversion into another datum andapplication for almost all targeting requirements caution should be exercised in ensuring that the proper datum isrequested and received u the national imagery and mapping agency nima is developing the dppdb as deployable imagerybased product to support pointtargeting imagery is provided on 8mm tape and can be hosted on the digital imagery workstation diwsa or precision targeting workstation ptw u product known as digital precision strike suite dpss is system contained within linereplaceable avionics unit for direct inclusion in strike aircraft dpss borrows the dppdb technology of linematching to mensurate targetcoordinates from referenced and indexed imagery by mathematical association in this system target image template inthe appropriate format is entered into the dpss unit and target coordinate can be generated in real time the goal is tointegrate dpss with onboard sensors and aircraft data processing in order to provide true realtime gpsquality toocapability in strike aircraft the fa18cd is not scheduled to integrate dpss however other tactical aircraft may usedpss to mensurate coordinates and pass the coordinates to shooter fa18cd aircraft 34212 nima points program u the nima points program currently is one of two recommended source for acquiring jdam target coordinates nima is very accurate graphic imagery figure 39 it provides the best possiblecoordinate accuracy ie lowest tle for specific known location and may be mensurated directly into the wgs84 datum without conversion the disadvantage of nima is that coordinates may not be available for routine or lessprominent targetssecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 317 figure 39 typical nima points program product u 34213 point precision database ppdb u ppdb also known as mk85 may be used but is recommended only as last resort the mensuration source is photographic and accuracy is marginal for jdam applications coordinates are delivered in the wgs84 datum 34214 maps and charts u standard ground navigation maps and charts are notoriously inaccurate and imprecise especially with regard to elevation and ther efore are never appropriate for jdam targeting 34215 databases and publications u encyclopedic databases and publications may be used for jdam targeting only if the datum and source are verifiable these sources ldom were compiled with the intention of providing target quality coordinates 34216 tasking messages u tasking messages may be used but only if the datum and source are verifiable often tasking messages arrive with assigned tle and referenced datum at minimum the producer the source the datum the accuracy statement and the date of the message should be verified 34217 tomcat tactical targeting t3 u under certain flight conditions the f14 with its lantirn pod can produce jdam targeting coordinates this data is not used in real time referred to as tomcat tactical targeting t3 f14 lantirn pods can generate lece50quality wgs84 coordinates in dd g176 mmmmmm format with elevations referenced to hae if validity checks of the t3 coordinate data and cele figures are determined to satisfactory degree the coordinates may be used for jdam mission t3 coordinate manipulation is discussed in sections b122 and b124secret chapter 3 mission planning secret 318u the following criteria derived from the postflight review of lantirn video must be applied to determine the validity of the derived t3 coordinates and cele g183 u 1 message must be present in the pod data block lower left quadrant g183 u the target bearing in the target data block lower right quadrant must be within 30 degrees of either the aircraft heading displayed above the steering bar or the reciprocal of aircraft heading if this specific criterion is not met then the lantirn line of sight depression angle relative to the horizon displayed in the pod data block lower leftquadrant must be greater than 60 degrees indicating overflight of the target g183 u the combat laser must be selected ie t posted g183 u the target location must be relative either to the area track crosshairs or the point in the center of the point track box g183 u the slant range to the target must be less than 131 nautical miles and the aircraft altitude must be less than 25000 feet msl 34218 fa18cd airborne sensors u although airborne sensors conveniently provide realtime coordinates through computed transformations of sensed angles and range the current state of fa18cd tactical airborne sensors issuch that coordinate accuracy tle exceeds the minimum requirement for gps guidance this renders fa18cd aircraftsensors unusable for jdam employment either in realtime or as secondparty targeting source 3422 route definition u route is created for each target using the cmpm according to the smart checklist see annex b route consists of at least an impact point and release point with release conditions the last of which must be applied before tamps will consider the route complete tle is specified as provided with the target coordinates impactparameters are specified or accepted as default 3423 weaponeering u weaponeering may be accomplished using either the native cmpm function or an external application note u the correct tamps ground plane option must be selected when entering accuracy probabilities 34231 cmpm functionality u the cmpm has two important limitations first it has limited selection of target classes and subclasses for specifying mean area of effectiven ess mae second it does not accurately account for bomb burial for instantaneous detonations and may provide an optimistic damage estimate 34232 fuzingrelated messages u when mission planning gbu31v2b mission configured with the fmu139 and fzu48 fuzing configuration certain cmpmgenerated messages are not valid in all cases as described below u the cmpm warning regarding level delivery of jdam above 20000 feet msl should be ignored instead refer to slic v20 or v21 to determine if planned livery is authorized with respect to safe escape u the cmpm caution the jdam mpm calculated time of flight exceeds the maximum time for the selected fuze type should be ignored the cmpm assumes incorrectly that whenever the fmu139 fuze is selected the mk122 electricalsafety switch is being used in this assumed configuration mandatory tof limit of 60 seconds is imposed however thelimitation is not applicable in the fzu48 configuration this anomaly is corrected in cmpm 70 and subsequent 3424 launch parameters u launch parameters are specified once target impact and launch parameters are defined the cmpm calculates the irlar and izlar the cmpm then tailors the izlar to approximate the ppizlarto be displayed on the fa18 hsi format with this presentation figure 310 valid launch point may be chosensecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 319note u warnings that the cmpm is unable to calculate ac lar should be ignored if valid aci6dof lar is generated and the launch parameters are within the attack axis and azimuth restrictions stated inthe fa18 tactical manual irlar target cmpm izla r ppizlar launch point figure 310 cmpm lar presentations u 3425 trajectory parameters u once route is defined crossrange and downrange travel and azimuth angle figure 311 must be recorded for use in safe escape determination this is accomplished manually in the cmpm using the range and bearing tool distance units in feet to measure on the scr een if the release is onaxis crossrange travel is zero and clicking on the release point and dragging to the target measures downrange travel if the release is offaxis downrangetravel is measured along release heading and crossrange travel is measured perpen dicular to release heading azimuth angle is the angle between the release heading and terminal head ing for headingundefined releases this angle is zero 343 quantity release 3431 overview u quantity release is defined as more than on jdam weapon released by one aircraft against one or more targets several guidelines simplify the process of planning strikes involving multiple targets andor aircraft themost important recommendation for simplification is to load all mu devices identically whenever possible this providesmission commonality and allows fewer required backup mu devices for the strike other ways to simplify this type ofmission planning exist each target should be planned as an individual weapon route and be assigned simple name it isrecommended that the plan of which aircraft is to attack which set of dmpis should be decided and written down for reference before the planning process begins matrix kn eeboard card formatted to reference the weapons and targets among the various release aircraft should be generated and carri ed in every cockpit to permit effective backup of primary missions or switching to secondary missions note u in order to plan quantity release at least one route must be defined firstsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 320targetcrossrange traveldownrange travel launch point heading at launchheading at launch terminal headingazimuth angle weapon trajectory figure 311 jdam trajectory parameters u 3432 cmpm quantity release manager qrm u the qrm offers several benefits in planning for both single target and multipletarget jdam quantity releases the qrm multiple weaponsmultiple target mode may be used togenerate routes for targets requiring more than one weapon the qrm multiple weaponsmultiple target mode may be used to group weapon releases for each ai rcraft however the qrm is not required to plan quantity of jdam the same information generated by the qrm for single and multiple targets can be calculated by hand and used to construct jdamquantity release the qrm also has limitations that may make it cumbersome for simple quantity delivery u when route is added to quantity release set copy is made and two versions of the route will exist editing one copy of the route will not apply the changes to the other copy when route is removed from the quantity release set thatcopy is deleted and single copy will exist on tamps but will not include any changes made to the qrmcopied routefurthermore route that has been added successfully to quantity release set may be edited only through the qrm caution u if the qrm is closed via the close manager button without first selecting ok or apply then any changes to the quantity release will be lost 3433 singletarget quantity release u ballistic dispersion characteristic of unguided munitions does not exist as such in guided weapons in jdam ballistic dispersion is re placed with the analogous concept of gps dispersion which is the effect of gps system error ie pdop and inherent autopilot error since gps pdop is function of time date andglobal position jdam weapons launched at the same time against the same target coordinates effectively experience thesame gps system errors and tend to impact in the same locatio n governed by the pdop at that time therefore for most single target quantity releases it is desirable to introduce artif icial dispersion into the targeting solution by selectivel distributing dmpis about the desired target dop is discussed in detail in annex 34331 singletarget qrm mode u the singletarget qrm mode distributes jdam weapons over single target that requires multiple jdam to achieve desired p d this distribution is calculated geometrically using the userspecified target width length and axis of orientation and centered bout the target centroid figure 312 which are the coordinates contained in the tdssecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 321 target width tamps inputtarget length tamps inputtarget axis tamps input userdefined target centroid latlongelev basic route dmpis1 s2 routesqrmcalculated offsets bearing range elevation figure 312 qrm dmpi distribution u 34332 singletarget qrm use u prior to entering the singletarget qrm mode the base route for the target is constructed in the base route the latitude longitude and elevation of the target is specified for the centroid of the targe t along with the target class subclass width and length dimensions and axis of orientation caution u the centroid of the target for single target quan tity release cannot be fined using offset data because the offset field is used by tamps to generate each desired mean point of impact dmpiwhen generating the quantity release dmpis the qrm will overwrite any offset data which may result in wide misses andor undesirable collateral damage u if the cmpm is used to weaponeer the attack solution then the desired level of damage is selected the singletarget qrm computes the number of jdam weapons required up to four to achieve the desired p d note u the singletarget qrm limitation of four weapons for p d weaponeering may result in an invalid case if the specified target size and desired damage level is calculated to require five or more dmpis u once the number of weapons is determined the singletarget qrm then calculates the distribution of the dmpis across the target and builds corresponding weapon route for each dmpi these routes are labeled identically to the base route name with sn suffix appended where n is digit fr om 1 up to 4 for each dmpi created in these sn routes mission data is identical to that of the base route except that individual offset data sets are stored in each route caution u if singletarget qrm base route includes any offset data the offset will be lost when overwritten by the individual dmpi offs ets as the sn routes are created this will result in miss distances for each weapon in the quantity release by the m agnitude of the origi nal target offsetsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3223434 multipletarget quantity release u the overriding concern in designing quantity release against multiple targets is ensuring that valid release point is available as selected targets become more widely dispersed laterally ie the cumulative angle off the aircraft launch heading increases the available area for an inzone release for all the weaponsbecomes small it is recommended that for typical launches near the heart of the altitude and airspeed envelope targetdispersal be limited to 2 nautical miles however the cmpm may be used to investigate larger target dispersal and varied launch conditions in order to achieve the desired targeteering 34341 multipletarget qrm mode u the multipletarget qrm mode provides the capability to plan single aircraft release of multiple jdam weapons against more than one dmpi the multipletarget qrm synchronizes release conditions altitude airspeed heading and release point and cal culates an intersection ppizlar that represents valid in zone region shared by every weapon in the quantity release 34342 multiple target qrm use u like the singletarget qrm the multipletarget qrm requires that the base route for each target be constructed already master rout is designated among the target routes the multipletarget qrm calculates an intersection of the valid izlar of all the lected routes copies of each route are saved with identical name that of the master route but with mnn suffix appended where nn are digits from 01 up to the number ofroutes included in the quantity release in these mnn rout target information is identical to the original routes but contain the release location and conditions of the selected master route so each mnn route has the calculated intersection lar saved with it this intersection lar is displayed on the hsi format as the ppizlar figure 313 note u in order to for tamps to calculate the intersection lar launch point must be selected that falls graphically on the screen within the intersection of the individual route lars tamps intersection lar aircraft hsi ppizlar figure 313 multiple target quantity release lars u u once quantity release has been created the multipletarget qrm provides practical method of simultaneously changing the release conditions for every route in the selected quantity disadvantage of the multipletarget qrm is thatit effectively freezes route target data thus in order to ed it target data for one or more routes in the quantity the ori ginal target route must be edited and the entire quantity release process must be repeated however the multipletarget qrmstill may be used to edit the common release point and conditions 344 completing the mission plan 3441 aircraft data u after route data has been saved in the cmpm aircraft data may be added including relevant waypoints such as ingress route to the launch point note u every jdam preplanned launch point and target aimpoint is displayed independently of aircraftwaypoints also steering to preplanned launch point is available automatically in the aircraft withoutthe requirement for creating an aircraft steering waypoint specifically for it u with scs 15c and subsequent the fa18 aircraft automati cally stores the coordinates of the selected jdam weapon in waypoint files 5154 according to table 3b in order of the priority release station these waypoints may be utilized during mission planning but will be overwritten as jdam stations are selected for release and typically should be reservedduring aircraft mission planningsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 323aircraft weapon station target waypoint file 85 1 25 2 75 3 35 4 table 3b jdam target waypoint files u u when an mu download is requested gps crypto keys automatically are appended to the bulk data file on the mu caution u tamps will not load the bulk data file onto the mu if valid gps crypto keys are not available on the tamps workstation but instead will post gps cr ypto keys not available caution there is indication that the mu loaded successfully except for the absen ce of the aforem entioned caution caution u with the tamps system core version 62k and earlier do not select the gps almanac upload option in the fa18 mpm while mission planning this option corrupts the aircraft magr almanacdue to weeknumber formatting in compatibility which can cause very long delays up to 45 minutes in aircraft acquisition of gps satellites and in rn may render all loaded jdam weapons effectively unusable for given mission this deficiency is corrected with tamps system core version 621 andsubsequent 3442 safe escape validation u for all live warhead jdam deliveries the only tool authorized for safe escape calculation is the stick length interactive calculator or slic safe escape for both single and quantity releases is validated using the slic planning tool the slic provides the same information provided in the authorized fuze arming timesmaximum stick length tables typically found in the fa18 tactical manual the authorized fuzearming times and maximum stick lengths ensure that in the event of weapon detonation at the selected fuze armingtime the probability of hit on the launch aircraft is within acceptable limits note u safe escape tables for jdam are not included in the fa18 tactical manual u the slic minimum release altitudes keep the aircraft above the maximum fragment envelope for target elevations between sea level and 5000 feet msl for target elevations greater than 5000 feet msl the release altitude recoveryaltitude for dives must be maintained at least 5000 feet above the target elevation 34421 safe escape factors u safe escape is based on the fuze arm time the type of warhead the weapon flight profile and aircraft postrelease maneuvering ie relative path s from the release point ultimately safe escape is function of aircraftweapon separation at earliest fuze arming time several conditions degrade safe escape commonexample is maximum range high altitude straight and level re lease with straight and level recovery using 10second arm time the minimum allowed in this case the long downrange travel reduces the bomb fall as it extends downrange toachieve terminal parameters so the bomb flies nearer to the airc raft so the aircraft basically flies directly over the weapo n as it arms high release altitude aggravates the condition the lower air density allows earlyburst bomb fragments totravel further and faster increasing the requirement for safe escape separation at bomb arm time 34422 slic limitations u the slic jdam impact angle option only has three choices for angles not listed explicitly the slic must be run for impact angle values that bracket the desired impact angle the shortestresulting stick time must be used for authorized stick length for example if 45 degree impact angle is desiredslic only has options for 25 65 and 85 then the slic must be run for impact angles of 25 and 65 the worstcase result is the authorized sticklength interpolation of results is not authorizedsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 324u the slic v21 and prior only supports safe escape calculation for 10 and 14 second arm times arm times less than 10 seconds are not authorized 20 second arm time may be select ed but restrictions with respect to the 14 second arm time calculations shall apply note u slic v21 and prior do not provide an option for safe escape planning with an fmu139 set for 14seconds arm time in this case the fmu152 option with 14 seconds arm time may be selected and usedresults are valid for the fmu139 slic 30 includes 14second option for fmu139 34423 unauthorized releases u safe escape cannot be violated therefore if the slic issues ua response ie unauthorized for the specified release the release must be modified fuze arm time may be increased or breakaway maneuver after release may be specified also changing the order of release may place the worstcase weapon in the bestpossible position this is acco mplished by moving the defined missions into jdam on other weapon stations slic version 30 and subsequent automatically recommends mission distribution among jdam release stations to provide safe escape if an unauthorized release is calculated in order to support safe escape it is recommended to always use the longestarm time possible for the mission while preventing dud due to tof and to employ breakaway maneuver away fromthe target if possible which is inconsequential to the launchandleave jdam weapon u to perform its calculations the slic requires crossrange and downrange travel in feet and azimuth angle in degrees for each planned release these values are measured in the cmpm since slic and tamps run on different host machinesthe tamps values must be copied on paper and transferred manually into the slic 3443 stores limitations u stores carriage and release limitations ar available in the fa18 tactical manual or the appropriate flight clearance automatic stores limitation determination is available using the automated tactical manualsupplement or atacs version 30 and subsequent the jdam slic 30 is integrated with atacs 30 to provide asingle reference software program 345 nonexpiring bulk data file 3451 utility u there are many instances when generic nonexpiring bulk data file is desirable one example is if inflight realtime targeting is expected over long pe riod of time bulk data file with arbitrary information still requires using the cmpm the nonexpiring bulk data file allows the cmpm to be bypassed but still loadsgps crypto keys on the mu the nonexpiring data load can be created once in advance and does not expire until three days after the expiration date entered in the load this load provides gps crypto keys to jdam weapons withthe remainder of jdam mission data entered manually in real time by the aircrew in the cockpit 3452 creation u before nonexpiring bulk data file can be cr eated at least one route of some kind first must have been created and stored in th cmpm the following steps are used g183 u open the jsowjdam cmpm g183 u choose any available oparea the resulti ng data load is available in any oparea g183 u create new mission package and name it appropriately eg dummy g183 u enter mission package date that corresponds with the route date of any available route g183 u select that same available route as pp1 g183 u change the mission package date to date far in the future this may be over year in advance g183 u build the bulk data file and save itsecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 3253453 employment u once nonexpiring data load has b een created the jsowjdam cmpm may be bypassed in timecritical situation the nonexpiring data load may be loaded for all jdam stations using themu init file option in the fa18 mpm the aircraft jdam dsply format shall display pp1 valid for all weaponstations included when loading the mu while pp2 through pp6 shall be crossed out however all jdam ppmission slots are available for entering mission datasecret chapter 3 mission planning secret 326u this page intentionally blanksecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 4140 tactical employment 41 target designation 411 pp missions u target and offset data terminal impact parameters and fuze settings if using jpf may be defined either during mission planning or entered manually in flight pp mission target designation simplyconsists of selecting the desired jdam station and pp mission combination and verifying the targeting and fuzingdata stored in the weapon although not typical to the concept of operations stored pp data is required andmissions may be created manually including manual insertion of gps crypto keys provided that gpsquality targetcoordinates are available if jdam mission is created manually only dynamic cues and not preplanned cues areavailable in the cockpit 412 too missions u too target designation is automated and is performed in real time using aircraft sensors or systems terminal impact parameters and fuze settings if using jpf may be defined during missionplanning or entered manually in flight too target data is not stored when designating using onboard sensors theaircraft automatically performs the required transformation from polar coordinates of relative bearing and range fromthe aircraft to planar coordinates of absolute latitude longitude and elevation using the aircraft navigationalalignment for reference if created manually or designated in real time only dynamic cues and not preplanned cuesare available on the hsi format section 2411 4121 sensor as coordinate generator u there are several factors that affect the usefulness of sensor as jdam target coordinate generator first sensor command and cont rol must be sufficiently precise second the sensor platform must be sufficiently integrated with the sensor and the weapon third the sensor must possess sufficient point and rangemeasurement accuracy finally aircraftsensor positioning must meet threshold pointing criteria in order to relieve pointing uncertainty due to glancing angles this factor is not platformdependent but rather scenariodependent and sensor dependent u the fa18cd aircraft provides capable automated interface with which to perform the required coordinate transformations for jdam targeting and to pass critical targeting information to jdam weapon it also possessesexceptional sensor integration and adequate sensor command and control with which to precisely designate point target however fa18cd sensors currently do not meet the jdam threshold accuracy specification caution u jdam too targeting currently is not recommended for the fa18 aircraft due to inherent sensorsystem inaccuracies unless mission failure or collateral damage due to wide misses can betolerated 4122 too operation 41221 too designation u jdam too coordinates may be created or updated in the fa18cd aircraft using waypoint designations visual hud designations or realtime sensors designations from flir radar etccoordinates cannot be entered manually into too target data set the too ufc option on the mission dataformat section 249210 provides ufc entry of terminal impact parameters only only offset and terminal impactparameters may be entered or edited manually for too mission note u when prosecuting thirdparty target the delivered target coordinate should be manually enteredinto pp mission for direct target designation rather that into an aircraft waypoint for subsequent toowaypoint designation even if precise waypoint entry is available 41222 too targeting u when jdam too mode is selected designation of target causes the aircraft to pass the designated target as too coordinate to every jdam station in the currently selected quantity or the priority station if noquantity is selected once too has been designated the coordinate is displayed continuously on the mission dataformat section 249 for each selected too mission this too coordinate is updated and passed to the same weapons whenever the designation is slewed or is automatically updatedsecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 4241223 too retargeting u stepping to another jdam station or canceling target designation causes the too target coordinate to be retained in the selected weapons too mission without further update such thatchoosing particular weapon and too mission recalls any previously designated target for that too mission thisallows for designation of different too target for each jdam weapon loaded on the aircraft and for each toomission in each weapon the net result is the ability to designate and store for later attack up to two targets for eachjdam weapon loaded on the aircraft if too mission containing stored coordinates is selected when another target designation is created the stored target coordinates are overwritten with the coordinates of the new targetdesignation 41224 waypoint too updating u when too is designated directly from waypoint file coordinates are assigned using the waypoint coordinates and elevation too coordinate updates are not performed as long as thewaypoint designation is maintained if sensor slaved to the waypoint is used to update or slew the designation thetarget coordinates are updated according to the sensor inpu ts the most important impact of this action is the possible significant change in the target elevation as the co mputation switches from stored to sensed therefore it is recommended that slewing waypoint designation using slaved sensor update be accomplished as early in the attack as possible to allow the weapon elevation solution to settle after any potential jump prior to release 41225 radar too updating u at the automatic ira inverse ranging algorithm update point at 175 miles range updated target coordinates are not passed automatically to the weapon which otherwise denies the bestavailable targeting accuracy this is corrected by manually slewing once inside of the 175 mile update range whichcauses updated target coordinates to be sent to the too missions of the selected jdam stations u if an expanded ground map is frozen via the attk format frz option target designation slewing results in updated too coordinates however the radar image does not update when frozen so the jdam too coordinatedoes not include updated sensor information typically associated with manual radar slewing if the frz option isdeselected inside of the ira range then any manual slew results in radar ranging update 42 prerelease 421 navigation system quality u jdam employment is optimized with gpsaided weapon guidance the weapon requires accurate time and date in order to s earch for locate and lock onto gps satellites after launch within the specification time to first fix ttff jdam weapons receive time synchronization from the aircraftand if the aircraft system time differs sufficiently from actual ztod weapon acquisition of satellites after launchmay not occur and accuracy will not exceed the higher ins only accuracy specification the weapon always selects gps information for use in navigation if it becomes available in the cases where gps guidance is not available if tof is less than 30 seconds or if gps is denied then the weapon continues to navigate using only the ins due to the drift rate ofthe ins after the transfer alignment ceases after release accuracy degrades as function of time figure 17 therefore inorder to ensure the best possible weapon performance and maintain capability to prosecute attacks using less than30 seconds tof weapon ins quality becomes tactical consideration also neither aircraft nor weapon navigationquality is conditional interlock checked by the fa18cd airc raft prior to proceeding with jdam release the aircraft and the weapon permit release regardless of aircraft gps availability andor weapon ins quality 4211 transfer alignment maneuver u during transfer alignment the aircraft must maneuver to generate navigation quality in the weapon ins adequate to support release normally this maneuver consists of two legs of at least 90 seconds with at least 30 degrees of heading change in between once the weapon navigation status quality achieves 01good dedicated maneuvering is longer required during long periods of nonmaneuvering straight and level flight thenavigation status quality may degrade requiring additional maneuvering to reestablish 01 good caution u jdam ins quality does not acc ount for aircraft navigation quality jdam ins quality may indicate 01 good when the aircraft is not in posains and the weapon navigation quality will not support specification accuracy aircraft nav igation quality must be evaluated as close to the launch point as possible to ensure jdam performance within the expected accuracysecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 43u if weapon ins quality stalls at value less than 01 good then recycling weapon power restarts the transfer alignment process this should be accomplished only after ensuring that the aircraft position keeping source is posains to prevent seeding the transfer alignment with inaccurate data caution u cycling weapon power results in weapon unavail ability during the rein itialization warmup and satellite reacquisition process which can take as long as 57 minutes aircrew must consider tactical requirements and proximity to launch point before cycling jdam power note u selection of jdam weapon option before achieving posains with 2digit herr and verr values causes jdam weapon transfer ali gnments to be seeded with inaccurate position information the weapon may require up to 45 minutes to filter out the bad data resulting inpotentially degraded weapon accuracy during th at period jdam weapon power should be selected after achieving posains with 2digit herr and verr otherwise jdam powershould be cycled after achieving posains with 2digit herr and verr values 4212 weapon ins quality u the weapon ins quality is the main concern prior to release transfer alignment quality is critical to satisfactory weapon performance jdam accuracy is only as good as the referenceframe in which it operates although the transfer alignm ent quality cue presents worthwhile information to the aircraft for preparing jdam weapon for release the ins quality determines the tactical employment doctrine weapon accuracy specifications are presented in section 142 sections 1324 and 24627 discuss jdam navigation system status and fa18 cockpit cues u if the ins quality is reported as good then the weapon is capable of meeting both the gpsaided and ins only accuracy specifications and may be released anywhere in the aircraft izlar regardless of tof if the insquality is reported as marg then the weapon is capab of meeting only the gpsaided accuracy specification and not the insonly accuracy specification and should be released only in the aircraft izlar when tof exceeds30 seconds in order to ensure gps aiding if the ins qu ality is reported as unst then the weapon is incapable of meeting either the insonly or gpsaided accuracy specifications and should not be released 422 gps status determination u gps status includes both gps availability and gps quality 4221 fa18 gps status determination u the fa18cd aircraft provides marginal indications of gps status particularly on the display formats associated with jdam employment if gps data becomes invalid for aircraftnavigation support when ifa is selected on the navigation mode switch then the aircraft navigation system transitionsto posins position keeping if an invalid gps conditio n exists for 65 seconds or more the aircraft posts pins advisory on the display containing caution and advisory messages therefore gps degradation may bedetermined by the presence or absence of pins advisory or posins position keeping cue however these cues are insufficient to determine if the requirement for jd am specification accuracy is met jdam specification accuracy requires herr and verr values less than 100 feet each posains position keeping is available withherr and verr values less than 230 feet each u gps herr and verr values may be observed directly on the hsidataacft format this method of verifying the necessary conditions to achieve jdam specification accur acy is tactically poor herr and verr values are located two sublevels down on the hsi format this format contains other tactical information commonly occupies the less visible himpcd display head and often is not used in favor of the sa format therefore the location of these important values is considered tactical liability in the fa18 aircraft caution u jdam ins quality does not acc ount for aircraft navigation quality jdam ins quality may indicate 01 good when the aircraft is not in posains and the weapon navigation quality will not support specification accuracy aircraft nav igation quality must be evaluated as close to the launch point as possible to ensure jdam performance within the expected accuracysecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 444222 jdam gps status determination u jdam mission planning tools automatically evaluate the availability and quality of gps to the weapon only in terms of gps satellite visibility and predicted pdop however the status of gpsavailability to jdam weapon cannot be determined by the fa18cd aircrew prior to release jdam does not attemptgps acquisition and tracking until after it is released from the ai rcraft gps degradation present in the terminal target area may have effect on the launch aircraft at the release point thus prediction or determination of gps availability to the weapon after release in terms of gps denial or other external factors must come from an external source as the aircraft andor aircrew cannot accomplish this autonomously 42221 effects of gps quality on jdam u large gps uncertainties must be avoided near the launch point as any inaccuracies in the aircraft navigation solution propa gate via transfer alignment into the weapon navigation solution and require time to wash out of the weapon kalman filter similar problem occurs if the gps cryptokeys are dumped expire or fail the resulting degrada tion in gps accuracy due to loss of the encrypted pcode known as ycode data may have the same effect of rge gps uncertainties note that loss of ycode does not necessarily result in loss of posains position keeping as long as selective availability dithering is suspended therefore aircraft navigation quality should be monitored as regularly as possible and then checked as close to thelaunch point as tactically feasible if the aircraft displays large 3digit herr and verr values then jdamemployment is not recommended unless the possibility of large miss distances can be tolerated as specificationaccuracy is not expected u the requirement for gpsquality transfer alignment may be explained by dividing the problem into two simple cases for tof of less than 30 seconds gps aiding is unavailable to the weapon the weapon relies on insonly navigationhowever the ins quality in the weapon is substandard due to the accuracy uncertainty in the ins transfer alignment hand off therefore the weapon frame of reference which includ the sensed launch point and the target location is inaccurate with respect to truth with an inaccurate start and finish poi nt specification accuracy is not ex pected to be met for tof of greater than 30 seconds gps aiding is available to the weapon however when the jdam attempts acquisition of gpsit must be assumed that the weapon experiences the same gps uncertainties that the aircraft experiences if the aircraft doesnot have gpsquality information then the jdam wont either and with degraded navigation the specified weaponaccuracy is not expected to be met 42222 effect of gps availability on jdam u in general the primary tactical consideration is whether or not gps will be unavailable to the weapon through denial or malfunction after release if jdam is expected toacquire gps then tof of 30 seconds or more allows gps acquisition and provides more accurate guidance this is balanced by the potential magnitude of the handoff error should the aircraft experience gps unavailabilityconversely if jdam is not expected to acquire gps then tof of less than 30 seconds allows the weapon to preserve specification accuracy and weapon accuracy continue s to degrade as function of tof again an ins only release presumes gpsquality 100foot or better herr and verr transfer alignment from the aircraft inorder to achieve specification accuracy 4223 gps antenna masking u section 311 discusses the considera tions associated with jdam performance when gps is denied which can include the case of gps antenna masking due to maneuvering misses on the order of 100 to400 meters were experienced during testing when presumably inaccurate handoffs due to gps antenna maskingspecifically highdive rollin maneuvers conspired with poor gps pdod and reduced tof to sufficiently degrade the weapons navigation solution u should posains position keeping be lost causing reversion to posins the fa18 aircraft navigation system requires 22 seconds to recover gpsaided solution after returning to posains due to kalman filteringthis is the minimum delay before the jdam weapon can be expected to receive txa with gpsaided position and velocity information note also that this does not include the filtering delay in the weapon itself therefore it isrecommended that jdam not be released until at least 30 seco nds after posains is indicated if radical defensive aircraft maneuvering to include inverted flight combined with large vertical velocities is required in the target areawithin minutes of the expected launch point such that pos ains cannot be recovered for at least 30 seconds prior to the launch point then it is recommended that jdam not be released unless the potential for wide miss can betolerated this consideration includes either preemptive or reactive antimissile defenses maneuvers andor highdive rollinssecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 454224 gps tactical considerations u tactically the following decision matrix is germane if the aircraft maintains gps tracking and it is expected that the weapon will acquire gps then whenever possible jdam should be released with atof of 30 seconds or more to exploit gps aiding if the aircraft maintains gps tracking but it is expected that the weaponwill not acquire gps then whenever possible jdam should be released onaxis with tof to less than 30 seconds topreserve insonly accuracy before it drifts dive delivery is method for reducing tof but gps antenna masking isgermane section 4224 if the aircraft does not maintain gps tracking do not drop jdam miss distance increasesquickly over time when aircraft gps is unavailable this is grounds for jdam mission abort there is satisfactory workaround u releases designed to maximize jdam accuracy thro ugh maximum tof ie long range and high speed reduce the probability that the launch aircraft will receive indicatio ns of gps denial due to target area jammers or terrain masking which may degrade weapon accuracy releases planned for minimum gps aiding nearer 30 seconds tofincrease the probability that gps denial may be recognized due to closer proximity to the target area but converselyreduce the amount of time available to recognize the conditions and modify the release profile in order to make thenecessary tof adjustment 423 envelope management 4231 ingress42311 ingress steering u the aircraft provides variety of sta tic preplanned and dynamic envelope cues in three dimensions on the aircraft hud and hsi formats to assist the aircrew in arriving at an effective releasecondition these include cues to allow the aircrew to achieve the preplanned launch and terminal impact conditionsas well as cues to provide the necessary flexibility to reach valid unplanned realtime release condition u every jdam preplanned launch point and target aimpoint is displayed independently of aircraft waypoints steering to the preplanned launch point is accomplished by selecting the desired pp mission and deselecting hsi waypoint steering launch point steering then is selected automatically if waypoint steering directly to the target isdesired with scs 15c and subsequent the fa18 aircraft automatically stores the coordinates of the selected jdamweapon in waypoint files 5154 section 3441 in order of the priority release station u the aircraft provides adequate cues for entry and exit of valid launch conditions hud ag and hsi format cues of time with respect to maximum range in range in zone leaving in zone and leaving minimum rangecombined with visually distinguishable hsi envelope presentations are useful and beneficial to the aircrew ingauging potential weapon effectiveness based on position within the various weapon envelopes 42312 ingress maneuvering u with the exception of the friction brake weapon limits for carriage on the inboard wing stations as discussed in section 2232 fa18 aircraft maneuvering otherwise is not constrained byjdam weapon carriage the full aoa gload airspeed and altitude maneuvering limits of the aircraft are availablehowever consideration must be made for gps antenna masking in terms of aircraft attitude section 4224 4232 izlar optimization u the dynamic cues displayed in the aircraft are optimized for attack of horizontal targets using terminal impact angles near 65 degrees but ar valid for vertical targets as well if contradiction exists between the dynamic aircraft izlar and the static ppizlar it is recommended that the dynamic izlar beused unless the ppizlar is planned to account for the co rrect target area conditions such as winds then the izlar provides more accurate presentation of the valid launch region u the displayed lar may be constrained to fairly small size if launch is planned highoff axis if large terminal impact angle is commanded if large weapon turn to achieve terminal heading is required or if an attack of multiple widely separated targets is selected this lar constriction is countered by maximizing weapon energy atrelease by increasing rel ease altitude and airspeedsecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 46u combinations of airspeed and altitude may result in loss of lar cues otherwise present for the same aircraft and target orientation particularly at low altitudes in pa rticular during low altitude loft ingress profiles valid irlar izlar or minimum range circle may be available for display however during the loft pullup thesecues may appear often quickly therefore using pp missions to the maximum extent possible will maximize thecues available in the cockpit to prosecute jdam targets 4233 jdam lar cues mechanization u fa18 jdam lar cues as di splayed on the hsi format section 24111 are intuitive and provide satisfactory aircrew situational awareness with respect to the employment of ajdam weapon the following example is provided to illustrate the mechanization of lar cues during typicalingress to jdam target 42321 general rules of lar display u once jdam weapon variant is selected by boxing the associated legend on the stores format jdam cues are available on the hsi regardless of aircraft master mode or weapon selected this facilitates orientation of the aircraft with respect to the jdam target and pp launch point if in ppmode while other ingress tasks such as airtoair search are performed however jdam lar cues are notdisplayed until the aircraft is within 160 miles of selected jdam target inside of this range the aircraft willdisplay all jdamrelated lar cues except for the dynamic izlar which is calculated and displayed only when theaircraft heading meets certain criteria if the hsi dc ltr option on the stores format section 24822 when in pp mode selected static pp cues are removed from the hsi format display u if terminal impact heading is defined then the i zlar is displayed whenever the target is within 15 degrees of the aircraft heading if terminal impact heading is defined then the izlar is displayed whenever the target iswithin 10 degrees of the aircraft heading and the terminal impact heading is within 15 degrees of the line of sightfrom the aircraft to the target figure 248 42332 beyond maximum range u as the aircraft approaches the target the dynamic lar cues of irlar izlar predictive maximum range and minimum range change significantly as function of aircraft airspeedaltitude and heading while the remaining cues remain static if the aircraft is turned directly toward the target theizlar appears as described above the irlar expands to meet the predictive maximum range cue and theminimum range circle expands if the aircraft is turned away from the target the irlar contracts away from thepredictive maximum range cue the minimum range circle contracts and the izlar disappears as describedabove u as the irlar boundary is approached the hsi and hud format time to maximum range tmr timer cues approach zero 000 42333 in range u once inside the irlar the timers are replaced with the in rng cue the dynamic cues continue to change as function of aircraft flight conditions except for the predictive maximum range and defaultto target line cues which are removed all pp cues are disp layed if the aircraft is steered toward the preplanned launch point along the bearing to launch point line and aircraft conditions are set to match the tampsplannedvalues the dynamic lar approaches the shape size and or ientation of the static ppizlar with variations caused only by differences in the preplanned winds and the actual winds 42334 in zone u once inside of the dynamic izlar the in rng cue is replaced with the in zone cue on the hsi and hud formats and the hsi format is automatically decluttered such that the only remaining cues arethe ppizlar and preplanned launch point cues if in pp mode the dynamic izlar and the jdam targetsymbol with the terminal heading cue if defined if the aircraft is turned sufficiently the izlar disappears u when the aircraft reaches point where the mission co mputer calculates that it will exit the izlar in 5 seconds the in zone cue flashes to alert the aircrew to this condition if the aircraft exits the izlar the in zone cueis replaced with the in rng cue and the lar cues return to those described in section 423133 42335 inside minimum range u if the aircraft enters the minimum range circle all cues except for the jdam target cue with the terminal heading cue if defined the default to target line cue and the predictivemaximum range cue are removed the range status cue is removed from the hud and the stores formatssecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 474234 wind effects 42341 wind compensation u in the fa18 the izlar is calculated referencing aircraft ground speed this biases the valid launch zone away from the preplanned lar which could place the preplanned launch point inside theppizlar outside of the dynamic realtime izlar if there is contradiction between ppizlar and izlar it is recommended that the dynamic izlar be used for release 42342 winds option u the winds option on the stores format is available but not functional when jdam is selected this option is mechanized for use in conventional highaltitude ballistic bombing when boxed the displayed wind data is added into the mathematical computations that determine ballistic impact point for conventionalweapons jdam is not aimed and does not fall ballistically so this option is not applicable to jdam note u jdam lar calculations use only aircraft ground speed and any stored aircraft wind data ie winds option on the stores format is ignored 4235 loft lar uncertainties u the dynamic izlar contains uncertainties that make it inadvisable for lowaltitude lofts using the autoloft release mode it is recommended that the manual release mode be used for lowaltitude lofts 424 proposed tactical timeline u the tactical timeline for jdam is straightforward in the most optimistic case jdam weapons can be powered up initialized and conditioned before aircraft takeoff with otheraction on the part of the aircrew besides navigating to the preplanned launch point selecting ag and the desiredrelease mode selecting the master arm to arm and pickling at the launch point however there are severaldecisions that must be made that have direct effect on jdam success 4241 t minus 5 u within t5 minutes of release do not cycle jdam power there is 2½ minute gps warmup timer plus time to establish and complete transfer alignment nominally four to five minutes totalthere is real action required at this checkpoint but performing the above action inside of this point may result inan otherwise avoidable mission abort 4242 t minus 2 u at t2 minutes from the planned release point perform final check of the navigation status of each weapon selected for release this may be accomplished via the aln qual cue on the storesformat or the jdam format using the step option the hud txa degd cue provides feedback if one ormore jdam selected for release does not have an ins quality of good if the transfer alignment has degradeddue for example to long straight runin there is time to maneuver to improve the transfer alignment prior torelease u if quantity release is selected then all weapons must be checked individually nonfailed weapons displaying unst should be deselected and time and stores and conditions permitting backup weapons assigned to primarytarget nonfailed weapons displaying marg should be deselected if the computed tof is less than 30 secondsor the release point may be changed to facilitate longer tof 4243 t minus 1 u at t1 minute from the planned release point determine the final launch point in order to tailor the weapon tof to the known or suspected gps envi ronment if gps jamming is expected establish tof of less than 30 seconds prior to release section 4415 if the aircraft gps is jammed abort the release u furthermore do not execute inverted vertical maneuvering within one minute of release as this may prevent valid posains status at release without posains status jdam effectiveness is degraded significantly 43 release and postrelease 431 launch point and launch parameters u for pp missions it is recommended that actual release point and release parameters match the preplanned parameters as closely as possible whenever feasible in order to ensure both weapon performance and mission effectiveness in accordance with mission planning for toomissions or pp missions that require deviation from the planned launch profile higher and faster releases always arerecommended section 31321secret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 48warning u deviation from tampsplanned and slicauthorized launch parameters andor postrelease maneuvering may result in departure from the nimum safe escape envelope for the selected fuzing options u the jdam weapon design release envelope fully cont ains the fa18 aircraft basic envelope authorized release envelopes are contained in the fa18 tactical manual or atacs or the appropriate flight clearance u two other important limitations on release conditions must be considered the minimum recommended airspeed at release for weapons configured with the fzu48 is 250 kcas in order to facilitate proper fzuoperation in providing suitable electrical power to the weapon fuze the minimum release speed for jdam is specified as 165 kcas in order to provide minimum aerodynamic control by the guidance section 432 release profiles u jdam may be employed effectively in straight and level flight which is the recommended delivery profile whenever gps is available in order to maximize altitude and standoff to prolong thetof other delivery profiles are supported and may provide tactically important benefits but do not improve and insome cases may degrade jdam weapon effectiveness 4321 dives u dive release profiles do not improve jdam terminal characteristics in terms of impact velocity or penetration depth or overall effectiveness furthermor due to its guided vice ballistic trajectory dive releases in most cases shrink the jdam envelope therefore dive deliveries are not recommended except in certain cases of tactical necessity of course defensive maneuvering to noselow attitude for release may be required also ifgps is available for the launch aircraft but is expected to be denied to jdam then tof is recommended to be less than 30 seconds in order to minimize the ins drift over time in this case it is recommended that tof beminimized by releasing as close to the target as possibl within the displayed izlar in shallow dive section 4415 regardless of profile it is recommended that dynamic inverted maneuvers be avoided as the release pointis neared sections 311 and 422 4322 lofts u loft delivery profiles do not improve jdam performance characteristics in terms of range or tof due to the shaped trajectory commanded by the weapon autopilot to the contrary in many cases lofting actually reduces the range capability afforded by straight and level release under the same flight conditions therefore loft deliveries are notrecommended except in cases of tactical necessity in these cases due to lar uncertainties in the dynamic izlar at low release altitudes it is recommended that lowaltitude loft deliveries be planned and executed using the manual release modevice the autoloft release mode regardless of profile it is recommended that dynamic inverted maneuvers be avoided asthe release point is neared sections 311 and 422 433 quantity release u if quantity release is selected then the sms automatically releases all selected jdam in the quantity that are inventoried as safe to release eg not wfail hung etc the smsautomatically steps over nonreleasable weapons in order to complete the quantity release sequence since the smsemploys asymmetry protection one or more failed w eapons may create an undesirable or uncontrollable weight asymmetry u the minimum release interval for jdam quantities is fixed at 300 milliseconds within the fa18cd sms and cannot be overridden by the aircrew release interval may be longer than this but cannot be shorter with an initialinterval of 800900 milliseconds for the first jdam store the minimum required time to release the maximumquantity of four jdam is 17 seconds 434 safe separation u the jdam weapon has separation characteristics similar to that of the lowdrag weapon using the same warhead as the weapon autopilot is not enabled until fixed period after weapon ejectionto ensure safe separation the aircraft should not be maneuvered for one second after last bomb releasesecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 49435 safe escape u since the jdam weapon follows guided vice ballistic fall trajectory after autopilot activation the appropriate safe escape maneuver must be fo llowed to prevent aircraft damage in the event of early warhead detonation note that the jdam can selfloft back to or above release altitude to achieve the desiredterminal impact parameters particularly if the launch airspeed is greater than 460 kcas specific safe escapemaneuvers are dictated by the slic planning tool the general rules of jdam safe escape are g183 u execute single turn away avoid multiple turns including sturns after release avoid delayed turns backacross the launch axis g183 u maintain or increase aircraft velocity g183 u climb if feasible warning u deviation from tampsplanned and slicauthorized launch parameters andor postrelease maneuvering may result in departure from the nimum safe escape envelope for the selected fuzing options 44 specific tactics 441 aircraft tactics 4411 standoff release u standoff release in order to maximize launch range is accomplished with very high and fast level releases directly on axis to the target the total potential altitude and kinetic airspeed energy of theweapon at release is the main contributor to maximum ra nge and is optimized by direct onaxis release during developmental flight test of the gbu32 release from 35000 feet and 12 imn resulted in maximum rangerelease of 14 miles and tof of 136 seconds 4412 high threat targets s high threat targets are prosecuted id eally using high and fast onaxis release this maximizes threat standoff and allows for increased tof to exploit gpsaided guidance if the high altitudeblock is denied the weapons high offboresight capability and autonomous guidance may be exploited usingtangential offaxis attacks along the primary threat ring however high offboresight attacks require substantialweapon energy at release to overcome the envelope reduction common to offaxis jdam attacks furthermore thelow altitude block may not be available for this tactic as valid lar may exist requiring instead mediumaltitude attack it may be possible to exploit highspeed highthreat ingress to achieve valid and useable offboresight lar with which to prosecute jdam targets at low or medium altitudes s although low altitude onaxis tactics involving loft deliv eries may provide improved aircraft survivability in very high threat environments the reduction in minimum lar range from low altitude loft deliveries actually can placethe launch aircraft in closer proximity to and aligned more on axis with defended target the onaxis nature of loftreleases may further reduce the threat standoff range in the moments after weapon release note u the autoloft release mode is not recommended for lowaltitude loft deliveries due to laruncertainties in the dynamic izlar it is recommend ed that the manual release mode be used for low altitude lofts u in all cases the best insurance for arriving at valid jdam lar against highthreat target is wellplanned tamps missionsecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 4104413 coordinated tactics u since jdam is autonomously guided and independently targetable against up to six stored pp targets there is little benefit in employing multiple aircraft for attacks that can be supported by singleaircraft other than that in terms of survivability offered by standard multiplane integrity andor the potential backupcapability for aircraft or highlevel weapon system malfunctions therefore coordinated tactics are not addressed asrelevant specifically in terms of jdam employment however in attacks involving multiple targets or multipleweapons against single target the redundancy afforded by multiple aircraft increases overall strike flexibility andreduces assumed mission risk see also section 452 4414 penetration missions u penetration missions are optimized by executing according to plans established using mission planning software when penetration eg gbu31v4b mission is flown in real time it isrecommended that the terminal impact velocity and term inal impact angle values be specified in accordance with existing rules of thumb for penetration weapons in the appropriate reference documents there is specific rule ofthumb associated with the jdam guidance kit itself that optimizes penetrator warheads although the jdaminterface in the fa18cd aircraft provides specific cont rols for assigning commanded impact angle and minimum impact velocity penetration effectiveness is function of the warhead according to the established directives u if realtime penetration mission is expected use of the fmu152 jpf is recommended as it provides maximum flexibility in assigning functional delay appropriate to the desired level of penetration and damage 4415 tailoring tof u tailoring jdam tof in real time prior to release is an important ability in preserving weapon mission effectiveness if potential weapon gps denial can be confirmed during the strike ingress the abilityto modify the launch point and conditions in order to reduce weapon tof if the tactical environment exists providethe aircrew with means to preserve the best possibl insonly specification accuracy 13 meters this is accomplished by reducing the weapon tof to less than 30 s econds as method to constrain the ins drift over time although the weapon possesses specification accuracy of 30 meters for insonly deliveries of 30 seconds tof or more this lesser accuracy reduces overall jdam mission effectiveness and should be avoided if conditions permit u jdam tof is function primarily of standoff distance release energy airspeed and altitude and terminal parameters for constant release altitude and airspeed laying the release point nearer to minimum range in order to reduce standoff range generally reduces tof but not necessarily significantly or sufficiently to achieve 30seconds tof if significant release energy is present for constant release airspeed reducing airspeed also reduces tof for constant altitude reducing airspeed does not significantly reduce tof the combination of reductionof release altitude and standoff range is the best way to reduce jdam tof therefore an erect pushover in orderto maintain crucial gps tracking to establish shallow dive delivery for release below 25000 feet roepermitting near the displayed dynamic minimum range is the best tactical profile to reduce tof u regardless of the profile required to reduce jdam tof it is strongly recommended that mission which provides less than 30 seconds tof be planned in advance using tamps and stored as an alternate pp mission forselection in the cockpit this prov ides the best probability of mission success should an alternate mission be required and also provides the strike planner with basis for coordinating an alternate strike support timeline realtime tailoring of jdam tof cannot be guaranteed to be effective particularly under combat conditions and shouldbe avoided whenever possible 4416 weapon and master mode selection u there is restriction on the selection of aircraft master mode andor nonjdam weapons prior to selection of jdam for release once jdam variant is selected by boxing an appropriate select option on the stores format section 2461 power is applied to all inventoried jdamvariants after proper conditioning all jdam variants then are passed and receive transfer alignment data continually regardless of aircraft master mode or subsequent selection of different aa or ag weapon in orderto release jdam all that is required of the aircrew is to select the ag master mode ensure that the desired jdamvariant is selected boxed and satisfy the ag ready requirements ie weapon available man release modeselected or in zone and autoloft release mode selected etc this feature of the fa18 aircraft provides the aircrew with unparalleled flexibility in weapon system management options during ingress and egress on jdamstrike missionsecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 411442 battle usage 4421 optimized jdam phasein s jdam is particularly effective against fixed area targets where when fixed strike loadouts are assumed its point targeting capability becomes tangible force multiplier as compared toconventional ballistic weapons jdam has potential use against many highvalue targets early in the battletimeline particularly command and control structures is olated fixed iads elements communications and industrial complexes pol fixtures and transportation choke points ch as bridges however due to its minimal standoff capability compared to other tactical weapons such as jsow and propelled weapons jdam is not the mostdesirable weapon of choice against defended targets while the enemy iads is still effective therefore it isexpected that jdam utilization will increase after target area survivability is improved by initial attacks using truestandoff weapons nevertheless jdam usage is perfectly compatible with and can materially enhance theeffectiveness of standard integrated strikes employing ontimeline sead in the target area in that the strike aircraftare exposed to the same threat level but enjoy the increased single and multipleweapon p d of jdam 4422 battle area interdiction s although jdam specification accuracy makes usage for battle area interdiction feasible the lack of moving target capability inherent in bomboncoordinates weapon reduces thepotential jdam target set fixed or immobile mechanized artillery and troop placements are excellent candidatesfor jdam attacks however due to the fixed turnaround time in mensurating and programming weapon targetingdata the potential for mobile target relocation reduces overall effectiveness the fa18cd aircraft currently hasno sufficiently precise selftargeting too capability and use of jdam using radar or flir handoff may reducejdam cep sufficiently enough to render it more effect effective than an unguided gp bomb s furthermore fixed targets located inside of compact highwall berms present challenge for jdam particularly if the dsu33 proximity sensor is not used jdams 13meter specification cep presents the potential for nearmisses inflicting little or damage the factors of target relocation and protected fixtures during operation southern watch combined to drive jdam effectiveness below 50 even though several fixed open targets such as surfacetoair acquisition radars we re included along with bermed artillery s unfortunately due to the nonballistic trajectory of jdam and the nature of gps guidance errors doubling jdam targeting is not always tactically effective experience has shown that multiple jdam weapons releasedagainst single dmpi have tended to cluster about miss point relative to the target based more on gps navigationerror dispersion relative to pdod or ztod of the drop that the truly ballistic dispersion of the guidance errorassociated with the jdam autopilot that is two bombs released near the same time may tend to miss by the samemagnitude and direction based on gps error therefore especially against bermed targets or targets located amid other types of aboveground physical obstructions altering planned weaponeering to include two warheads when onewarhead meets the p d requirement does not necessarily increase the pr obability of kill doubletargeting however does improve p d in terms of singleweapon fuzing failures 443 airwing integrat ion and deconfliction 4431 jdam in the electronic jamming environment s the latest information on ea6b and gps weapons deconflcition is available on the nsawc siprnet homepage the decision to employ jdam in an ea6b band 4 or 6or threat jamming environment can be reduced to the follo wing options 1 if possible control the gps jamming by destroying the threat gps jammers or limiting ea6b jamming if there is threat to the strike aircraft 2 if ea6bjamming is required because of the threat or the threat gp s jammers can not be destroyed then employ jdam in the weapon gps denied mode imuonly and reduce the tof to 28 seconds or less if 28 second of less tof can not beaccomplished then use multiple jdam or ch oose another weapon to accomplish tasking s jdam can not be employed when the launch aircraft is being denied gps the launch aircraft must have access to gps information to provide jdam with valid transfer alignment prior to release all valid jdam tactics assume that thelaunch aircraft maintains posains at the launch point and that gpsaided cep is only available with twodigit herrand verr values if jdam tof exceeds 28 seconds up to 90 seconds by specification and the weapon is denied gpsthen the weapon cep will degrade from gpsaided 13 meters to an imuonly 30 meters 30 meter imuonly cepshould accomplish most tasking see nsawc siprnet standardization webpage for examples ofweaponeeringsecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 41244311 jdam guidance priority s if decision is made to prioritize full gps guidance for jdam weapons then ew must be tailored to prevent l1 and l2 band bands 4 and 6 respectively in ea6b prowler aircraftjamming along the jdam launchpointtotarget axis to allow for mission success u for onjammeraxis attacks it is recommended that jdam launch points be selected that are at least 20 miles from l1 jamming and at least 10 miles from l2 jamming with the jamming aircraft offset away from the jdam target area notehowever that with the rear mounting of its gps antenna jdam is more vulnerable to standoff jamming from behind thanother gpsaided weapons as weapon masking occurs and that increased standoff only improves the probability thatweapon gps acquisition will occur s for offjammeraxis attacks it is recommended that jdam launch points be selected that are outside of the jammer beam width cone oriented towards the enemy radar which for an ea6b prowler is 28 degrees for band 4 l1 jammingand 20 degrees for band 6 l2 jamming an offaxis release is strongly recommended if the minimum separation criteriafor onjammeraxis attacks cannot be met s if the orientation of the jammer and strike aircraft is such that effective gps jamming will be present anywhere from the launch point to the target then it is recommended that l1 and l2 band jamming be inhibited from at leastone minute prior to the jdam launch point to ensure the posains requirement can be met at the launch point toat least 15 seconds after predicted impact to support the gpsaided cep effectiveness 44312 ew jamming priority s with an ea6b prowler jamming in band 4 andor band 6 inside of effective range section 44311 the jdam gps receiver is expected to be denied valid gps da ta if the threat environment requires band 4 andor 6 jamming and jdam employment is desired jdam imuonly tactics are available with tof tailored to30 seconds or less to preserve 13meter cep effectivene ss it is recommended that should gps band jamming be expected in the target area that backup missions be planned to allow for disciplined employment to achieve tof of less than 30 seconds s finally the strike planner is always afforded the opportunity to deconflict strike ew simply by selecting weapons other than jdam that are not vulnerable to the planned ew environment 4432 tot control u fa18cd integration of jdam includes excellent cockpit cues of tot for jdam mission including consideration for jdam tof these timing cues presented on both the hud and storesformats provide the aircrew with sufficiently adequate and visible information with which to place jdam on the selected target according to very precise strike timeline furthermore cockpit timing cues are dynamic and not tied to preplanned mission data such that strike aircraft may switch to an alternate or emergency release profile and stillreasonably meet defined strike timeline 45 basic inflight troubleshooting 451 weapon power cycles 4511 effects u jdam power is cycled in variety of troubleshooting scenarios the jdam weapon has static memory other than that required to store the weapon ofs other data can be stored with power off gpsephemeris data gps crypto keys targeting data and the w eapon transfer alignment are not maintained when power is deselected when weapon power is cycled the ephemeris is re loaded and the transfer alignment is reinitiated if the weapon expects an ephemeris update but doesnt get on it will post the gps data advisory until successful ephemeris download is completed this is true also if communication error prevents the weapon from receiving valid ephemeris update from the magr 4512 methods u weapon power may be cycled by deselecting and reselecting ie unboxing and boxing the appropriate jdam weapon variant legend on the stores format performing an ibit on the weapon or weaponsvia the jdam option on the bitstoresstation format or cycling the aircraft mission computerssecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 413452 transfer alignment problems 4521 bad alignment data u if inaccurate transfer alignment data has been passed to jdam such as selecting the weapon before achieving posains aircraft position keeping the quickest way to remove it is to reinitializethe weapon by cycling weapon power which will reseed the navigation solution this in turn invokes the 2½minute gps warmup timer to avoid this it is recomme nded that whenever possible jdam not be powered up until an ok fine alignment is achieved and the magr is receiving quality position information however this may not always be practical especially during embarked operations when gps acquisition may be delayed due tointerference but completing weapon bit before launch is criti cal therefore if the initial transfer alignment data is suspect cycling weapon power with known good alignment data will correct any potential accuracy problem at the cost of few minutes of weapon unavailability 4522 poor alignment quality u weapon alignment quality is continually reported from all jdam weapons to the aircraft various cues and advisories are provided to alert the aircrew to degraded navigation status for jdam weapon the transfer alignment process requires time to achieve satisfactory good alignment qualityfurthermore the transfer alignment process is reinitialized any time the weapon power is cycled u before troubleshooting poor alignment quality the timi ng cue should be referenced transfer alignment does not begin until the gps is warmed up and initialization is complete however it is possible that weapon alignmentquality never improves from the initial 10 unst or hangs up at some intermediate value before achieving agood status there are three possibilities all of which require specific handling u if the alignment quality appears to stall at marg or unst with relatively high transfer alignment quality numeric ie 4 or greater then cycling weapon power will reinitialize the transfer alignment and will clear out potentially bad data in the weapon ins in the vast majority of cases the period of loss of weapon availabilityduring reinitialization balances equitably with the loss of weapon utilization due to degraded navigation quality u if the alignment quality appears to stall at marg or unst with relatively low transfer alignment numeric then most likely the aircraft is passing satisfactory transfer alignment data but some external environmental factorsuch as vibration heading misalignmen t accelerometer inaccuracies etc is ffecting the ability of the weapon ins to adequately resolve state vector in this case ther is little that the aircrew can do to rectify the situation cycling weapon power may have effect at all u if the alignment quality degrades from good to marg or unst then most likely the aircraft maneuvering is insufficient to provide transfer alignmen t data of sufficient quality to support the weapon ins alignment in this case performing transfer alignm ent maneuver section 4221 should cause the alignment quality to return to good status note u the plain language alignment quality cue may

selected for release has an alignment quality less than 01 or 02 good note that this is normal on deck before an adequate transferalignment maneuver has been performed this advisory is directly related to poor alignment quality see section 4612 453 gps problems 4531 satellite acquisition u satellite acquisition may be indicated by gps time hold status for jdam weapons on the stores format

entry is straightforward 4532 keys invalid entry advisory u the keys invalid entry advisory is an indication that the magr contains invalid keys there is remedy in the cockpit the magr must be rekeyed with validkeys externally using kyk13 magr is essential for jdam mission and backup aircraft should be used ifavailable or the jdam mission should be aborted 4533 gps data advisory u the gps data advisory is an indication that valid gps data has not been provided to the weapon after startup it is t uncommon to receive this advisory as the magr and the jdam weapons complete their startup tests and initialization routines this may require 35 minutes if the magrnever acquires satellites then this condition should be remedied first see section 4621 if the magr acquiressatellites but the advisory remains then problem probably exists in the weapon and weapon power should becycled via the weapon variant on the stores format if after several weapon resets the advisory remains theweapon may be released in insonly mode with tof ss than 30 seconds provided that the magr provides gpsaided navigation solution to the aircraft with 2digit herr and verr values 4534 gps keys advisory u the gps keys advisory is an indication that valid gps crypto keys for jdam weapons cannot be located on the mu or cannot be verified by the jdam weapons if valid gpscrypto keys are not present on the mu then the only prac tical solution is to use backup mu to provide gps crypto keys to the jdam weapons if backup mu is not ava ilable but printable gps crypto keys are available in the correct format then this information may be entered manually by the aircraft using the gps entry format notethat this latter manual method is timeconsuming and vulnerable to entry errors that cannot be identified or verifiedeasily and may result in gps crypto key invalidation u if valid gps crypto keys can be confirmed on the mu but are not being verified by the weapon then the problem may rest with the timedate indexing of the existing keys and the current ztod and date should bereentered ztod and date are entered by selecting the timeufc option on the hsi format zulu date is entered byselecting setdate and

weapon status message u wfail status indicates two likely possibilities if the wfail is accompanied by subsystem failure message on the jdam dsply format then the failure status has been declaredby the weapon bit logic if the wfail is not accompanied by subsystem failure message on the jdam dsplyformat then the failure has been declared by th aircraft this usually indicates communication timingsynchronization problem between the aircraft and the weapon where the aircraft does not receive amandatory response from the weapon in the allotted time and assumes that the weapon has failed u if weapon is declared wfail the first step is to retest the weapon via an ibit this is accomplished by selecting the jdam option on the bitstoresstation format if the wfail clears it is recommended that themission be continued if the wfail remains ibit should be attempted second time after cycling the weaponpower via the weapon variant on the stores format and cycling the mission computers if wfail remainsafter the second wfail it is recommended that the wea pon be considered unreleasable and whenever possible the mission should be aborted unless backup weapon or event aircraft is available 4542 wdegd weapon status message u wdegd status indicates that weapon has an internal subsystem failure which degrades its normal functionality but does not preclude launch because viable workarounds exist the actual problem can be identified on the jdam dsply format this status may be caused by gpsfail tik fail or jpf fail subsystem messagesecret chapter 4 tactical employment secret 415u tik fail indicates telemetry package failure and should not preclude operational launch workaround is required jpf fail indicates an fmu152 communicatio n failure the fuze defaults to the faceplate settings gps fail indicates weapon gps receiver failure the weapon still functions adequately in the insonly modehowever in order to retain the gpsequivalent specifi cation accuracy weapon tof must be reduced to 30 seconds or less in order to avoid inaccuracy due to ins drift without gps updates 4543 hold weapon status message u hold status indicates valid zulu time andor date is available to the weapon the correct ztod and date can be entered via the timeufc option on the hsi formatthe correct date is critical to satellite acquisition while the magr can overcome errors in ztod if provided fresh almanac data date error can be terminal date is entered on the ufc timeufc format by selecting set date and entering the date in mmyydd format with leading zeroes for the month for example march 292002 is entered as 32902 and not 032902 4544 efail weapon status message u the fa18 has strict timing requirements for most aircraft functions when an erase command is sent the reply of completion must occur within specified period however jdam weapons do not complete the commanded crypto key autoerase function in the 6 seconds currently prescribed in scs 15c and prior upon landing the weapon always degrades to efail follo wing autoerase and sets the c05 weapon classified msp code to avoid this expected autoerase problem whenever possible jdam weapons should be erased before landing using the erase jdam option on the stores or jdam dsply form ats after erasure jdam weapons may continue to be powered and in fact this is recommended for tas fault is olation purposes particularly during arrested landings u if jdam is not erased airborne and sets efail once on deck the erase jdam option is longer functional two methods still are available to successfully erase jdam ground crew may erase jdam with cmbre after shutdown if this is not feasible or desirable such as during carrier operations an sms reinventory may be forced by cycling the sms circuit breakers or both generators to reset the weapon stat us then the erase jdam option erases the weapon correctly u the autoerase timing anomaly is corrected in scs 15c and subsequent 455 bulk data problems 4551 corrupted or missing jdam data u in any case of identified jdam bulk data transfer errors the first step is to attempt reload of the jdam data this is accomplished most simply via the jdam reload option on the mumumore format reload also may be accomplished by removing and reseating the mu cycling themission computers or deselecting and reselecting the jdam variant option on the stores format u if the errors appear to be resident in the bulk data file itself then the aircrew have various levels of recourse for workaround targeting and fuzing information may be inserted manually provided that this information is providedon flight cards however if an error exists in the gps crypto keys gps keys then the aircrew have littlerecourse since hard copies of crypto keys are t carried in the aircraft as matter of course 4552 error jdam advisory u this contingency is addressed in the same manner as corrupted or missing jdam data 4553 mu load caution u if the mission computers show communication with the mu an mu load caution is displayed communication can be restored with functional mu by removing and reseating the mucycling the mission computers or replacing the mu with spare

jdam is bomboncoordinates boc weapon accurate guidance is accomplished through selfcontained gpsaided ins that guides the weapon from the release point to precise gpsreferenced targetcoordinates regardless of weather camouflage or obscurants this capability provides simultaneously more lethal andsurvivable alternative to many other precision weapons and all generalpurpose bombs jdam and other boc weaponsresolve the tactical shortcomings of many other precision weapons such as laser guided bombs lgbs which require both clear lineofsight to the target and continuous signation boc weapons also provide greater accuracy than conventional weapons limiting collateral damage and providing superior probability of destruction the end result isenhanced aircrew survivability and increased mission effectiveness a12 capability u jdam is capable of release in sequential quantities against one or more targets the jdam guidance set controls the terminal trajectories of the wea pon to achieve widely varied impact angles against both horizontally and vertically oriented targets at an angle of ttack of less than 5 degrees jdam is capable of being released from wide range of airspeed altitude and attitude combinations further adding to its versatility the jdam guidance lawcommands the optimum trajectory from the release point to obtain the planned impact conditions at the target a2 boc weapon coordinate systems a21 geodetic systems u employing boc weapons requires common reference from which to extract precise target coordinates this is accomplished through geodetic datum system geodetic system is mathematical model of the earth used to calculate coordinates on any map or chart it is composed of smooth geometric ellipsoidreference model constructed about reference point origin and contains welldefined series of points control network used for the placement of coordinate system geodetic system is further broken down into both ahorizontal datum and vertical datum a211 horizontal datums u the term horizontal datum is another name for coordinate system the most commonly used coordinate system is the latitude longitude and elevation system in which the prime meridian and theequator are the reference planes used to define latitude and longitude u an earthcentered earthfixed ecef coordinate system is used to define threedimensional positions with respect to the origin of reference ellipsoid which typically is the earths center of mass from the origin the zaxis pointstoward the north pole the xaxis is defined by the inters ection of the planes of the prime meridian and the equator the yaxis completes the system measured in the plane of the equator 90 g176 east of the xaxis of the several ecef coordinate systems only the wgs84 system figure a1 has been established as the standard for gps and thus bocweapons it is critical that coordinates used by boc weapons be defined using the wgs84 system a211 vertical datums u the term vertical datum is also referred to as zero surface in any geodetic system elevation is measured in reference to that systems zero surface just as there are many different horizontal datums so there are many different vertical datums accurate elevation measurements depend upon defining anaccurate zero surface from which to base them u traditionally mean sea level msl is used as the zero surface for measuring topographic elevation however by definition msl varies with tidal shifts it is nevertheless close approximation of another more accurate surface called the geoid the geoid derives its accuracy by modeling changes in the earths gravitational pull due to land mass forexample mountain represents increased mass and thus incr eased gravity resulting in rise in the contours of the geoid model because of its accuracy the geoid is the true zero surface for measuring elevations and msl elevationsare actually measured as height above the geoidsecret annex jdam theory of operation u secret a2u in addition to msl another common elevation is height above ellipsoid h ae hae uses as its zero surface the smooth geometric model of the earth associated with pa rticular geodetic system the wgs84 ellipsoid is the zero surface used by the gps system thus gps systems are based on hae elevation figure a1 earthcentered earthfixed reference system wgs84 u u although most terrestrial elevations are stated in msl each gps receiver contains geoid model for converting msl to hae automatically this model is used to define geoid height which is the separation between the geoid andthe ellipsoid figure a2 when geoid height is applied to an msl elevation it converts that elevation to hae for useby the receiver since little precision is lost in this co nversion when targeteering for boc weapons it is acceptable to define target elevation in either msl or hae figure a2 vertical datums usecret annex jdam theory of operation u secret a3a22 wgs84 requirement u wgs84 and its constituent horizontal and vertical datums has been designated by the department of defense as the mandatory datum for use in the armed forces of the united stateshowever the cost of immediate conversion of all mapping systems and sources is prohibitive because gps requires the accuracy of wgs84 any targeting process must include conversion if different datum such as nad83 orwgs72 is used to determine the coordinates and elevation of dmpi failure to use the proper datum can introduceerrors in the hundreds of meters in summary when fining the dmpi for boc wea pon the latitude and longitude must be defined using the wgs84 coordinate system with elevation given in either msl or hae wgs84 datum tokyo datum figure a3 comparison of two datums u a3 global positioning system gps a31 the gps system u gps is precise worldwide radionavigation system formed from constellation of satellites and network of ground contro l facilities the space system consists of 24 navstar satellite vehicles 21 in use vehicles and 3 active spares that orbit the earth every 12 ho urs in six distinct orbital planes orbital altitude is such that the satellites repeat the same ground track over any poi nt on earth approximately every 24 hours actually 4 minutes earlier each day this distribution provides users with betw een five and eight satellites visible from any point on earth u control of the gps system is provided by master control facility and worldwide monitoring network the monitor stations use passive receivers to track satellites in view collecting range data from each satellite that data is passed on to the master control facility to determine orb its and to update the navigation message of each satellite periodically the master control facility transmits the update d information to each satellite for retransmission in the navmessages a32 gps navigation theory u the basis of gps navigation theory is the ageold concept of triangulation position fixes figure a4 in order to perform triangulatio n gps receivers measure distance from the satellites using the travel time of radio signals the gps concept is based on accurate and continuous knowledge of the spatial position of each satellite in the system with respect to time and di stance from transmitting satellite to user each satellite periodically transmits signal at specified time part of that transmission is ranging code which enables receiver tomeasure transit time of the signal and determine pseudorange to the satellite navigation message in the signalenables the receiver to calculate the position of the satellite at the time of transmission the receiver then uses the calculated ranges and satellite positions to solve for its position in three dimensionssecret annex jdam theory of operation u secret a4figure a4 gps triangulation position fixing u a33 gps signal processing u gps satellites transmit messages on tw carrier frequencies which are code modulated to provide ranging data and control access to the system course acquisition ca code modulates one carrier and is the basis for the standard positioning syst em sps used for civil navigation precise p code modulates both frequencies and is the basis for precise positioning system pps available only to authorized users u the nav message is superimposed on both the ca code and pcode it contains gps system time of transmission ephemeris and clock data for particular sa tellite being tracked and almanac data for all the satellites in the constellation orbital data for the satellites including altitude position and speed is constantly monitored by thecontrol segment updated data is then periodically relayed back to the satellites for transmission in their navigationmessages a34 gps security u access to pps navigation is controlled by two features using cryptographic techniques selective availability sa feature purposely reduces gp s accuracy to unauthorized us ers by introducing controlled errors into the satellite signals the effects of sa provide 100 meter horizontal accuracy for civil users of gps theaccuracy degradations can be increased if necessary ie tim of crisis or war to deny accuracy to potential enemy an antispoofing as feature is invoked at random times to negate potential imitation of the pps signals thetechnique alters the pcode into code known as the ycode the ca code remains unaffected encryption keys andtechniques are provided to pps users wh ich allow them to remove the effects of sa and as pps capable receivers that do not have the proper encryption keys installed are subj ect to the accuracy degradations of sa and are not able to track the ycode a341 pps predictable accuracy u predictable accuracy for pps is 178 meters in horizontal accuracy 277 meters in vertical accuracy and 100 nanoseconds in time accuracy a342 sps predictable accuracy u predictable accuracy for pps is 100 meters in horizontal accuracy and 156 meters in vertical accuracysecret annex jdam theory of operation u secret a5note u selective availability has been discontinued duri ng peacetime therefore actual sps accuracy may exceed that listed for noncrypto users of gps a34 gps errors u two major factors contribute to gps positioning errors called the user equivalent range error uere and dilution of precision dop uere is measure of the error in the range measurement to each satellite as seen by receiver dop ma gnifies those errors because of the geom etric relationship of the satellites as seen by gps receiver these factors contribute to overa ll gpsguided weapon targeting uncertainty figure a5 figure a5 targeting uncertainty u a341 uere u uere is introduced by satellite clock and ephemeris deviations delays of the signals caused by atmospheric specifically ionospheric conditions and local obstructions or magnetic anomalies and inherent noise andresolution characteristics of the gps receiver a342 dop u fundamentally dop is the quality of positioning data derived from gps satellites and is related directly to the geometric positioning of the satellite constellatio n this positioning is changing constantly because the 25 navstar gps satellites are not geostationary but instead orbit at an altitude of 11000 miles which generates relative motionof the satellites in the sky from fixed reference on the earth therefore dop is function of the orientation of the satel lite constellation with respect to earth location and the time of day as the satellite sky is changing constantly a3421 dop factors u figure a6 illustrates how the geometric relationships of satellites contribute to dop if two lines of position are necessary to tablish receiver position the least amo unt of error is present when the lines cross at right angles the greatest amo unt of error is present when the linesofsight between the receiver and satellites approach parallel or when the satellites approach the same plane ideally to minimize dop the four sate llites that gps receiver tracks are distributed evenly with three n ear the horizon every 120 degrees and the fourth directly overhead this configuration practically never occurs and is uncontrollable anyway when two or more satellitesused in the gps fix are clumped together in the same part of the sky angularly close dop can be very largesecret annex jdam theory of operation u secret a6u occasionally satellite positioning and availa bility conspire to cause large jump or spike in dop for example over period of 40 days in the southeast united states there were seven significant pdop spikes the largest being 184 whichlasted about six minutes in march 2000 three satellites failed causing spikes as high as 173 in the united states figure a6 gps dilution of precision dop u a3422 dop categories u there are several categories of dop these include horizontal dop hdop positional dop pdop and geometric dop gdop for jdam the dop of interest is pdop because jdam has pitotstatic system and gps altitude error is relevant for reference pdop value typically is 25 or higher in fact the jdamspecification accuracy assumes pdop value of 44 meters fa18 magr herr and verr values are related to dopbut more precisely represent the estimated gps accuracy due to errors combined with sa tellite availability and accessibility a35 gps jamming u several types of jamming can be used to degrade the accuracy of gps receiver including the following g183 spoofing g183 cw jamming spot jamming g183 wide band jamming g183 pulse jamming u typical gps receiver encryption that allow access to p code also inhibit spoofing noise jamming is overcome through various sophisticated techniques which allow ccessful signal lockon provided sufficient signaltonoise thresholds are metsecret annex b procedures and

general description c11 overview c111 introduction u the fmu152 joint programmable fuze jpf is an electromechanical bomb fuze designed for installation in the tail fuze well of generalpurpose warheads and is compatible with all mk80 series blastfragmentationwarheads the jpf is equivalent in size and shape to the fmu139 electromechanical bomb fuze the jpf also is designed and manufactured to be sturdy enough to provide hardtarge t penetration capability down to 20 feet and may be used with the blu109 penetrator warhead the fmu152 specification stipulates shelf life of 20 years and service life of 10years once the box is opened c112 design u the jpf is divided internally into two functional sections called the nonsurvivable and survivable sections the nonsurvivable section primarily controls fuze arming and is powered by capacitor that is charged during bomb release the survivable section primarily controls the terminal functions of impact sensing delay and detonationthis section is powered by an internal 24hour battery that is fired during bomb release and in corporates an internal digital signal processor to control terminal fuze operation c113 theory of operation u the fmu152 is capable of internal digital programming via serial data interface for applications that include digital communication with the host aircraft conventional fuze faceplate figure c1 provides manual fuze settings selection for backup default of serial interface operation or for backwardscompatible noninterfaced operation figure c1 fmu152 fuze faceplate usecret annex c fmu152 jpf system description u secret c2c12 functional description c121 fuze initiation u the fmu152 is initiated by voltage either from the aircraft fuze function control set ffcs via the mk122 arming switch or directly from the fzu55b mechanical initiator note u the fmu152 is supported on the fa18 aircraft only using the mk122 electrical safety switch u once the aircraft serial interface is severed during jettison fuze operation is completely internal unless an external arming wire is used in this case the fuze requires that the aircraft extract the arming wire from the fuze gag rod during th bomb release sequence in order for the fuze to provide tonation pulse when commanded by the onboard processor c121 fuze arming u fuze arming is accomplished via the conventional method of physically rotating an explosive train within the fuze into alignment which allows the fuze to propagate loworder firing pulse into the warhead chamberfor detonation if an external arming wire is used to pin the fuze gag rod then the wire must be extracted completely during the release sequence to allow the explosive train to rotate without this rotation to arm the fuze an activated fuze may attempt to cause detonation but cannot since the nonaligned explosive train will not propagate into the warhead note u an arming wire is not required for the fmu152 when used on the fa18 aircraft with mk122electrical safety switch u fmu152 arm time tolerance is 10 eg for 10 second arm time the fuze may arm between 99 and 101 seconds after release which is similar to other generalpurpose bomb fuzes caution u during mission planning regar dless of the fuze type attack pr ofiles and arm times should be chosen such that an adequate margin exists between calculated weapon time of fall and fuze arm time in orderto avoid unnecessary risk of duds c122 fuze functioning u an internal microswitch senses deceleration above nominal threshold and then signals the fuze processor that impact has occurred the fmu152 design specification threshold is 4080g that is the fuze alwaysfunctions above 80g and never functions below 40g once the impact signal is received by the processor the specified functioning delay is applied and the firing pulse is initiated downstream channel allows for the insertion of syntheticimpact signal by the dsu33 proximity sensor in order to provide preimpact functioning c2 applications c21 interfaced application c211 available fuze settings u fmu152 arm and functioning delay times when used with jdam are segregated into two groups cockpitselectable settings and fuze faceplate settings cockpitselectable settings include all available fu ze settings and are controlled and selected using aircraft controls and displays via the serial interface between aircraft weapo n and fuze useful subset of the settings are available via fuze faceplate settings for use in operational backup planningavailable fmu152 fuze settings are listed in figure c2 caution u arm times less than 10

which are independent of and override the fuze faceplate settings typically fmu152arm and functioning delay settings are set acco rding to the values selected during mission planning and transferred from the memory device but may be modified manually by the aircrew us ing existing cockpit controls and displays in the absence of programmed settings ie the serial interface is lost or is not present then the jpf defaults to the fuze faceplate sett ings note u if jpf fuze code is present the ffcs always applies 195v for arming the jpf provided that the fuzeenable signal is received from the cockpit ie efuz on selected on the stores format note u for jdam configured with the fmu152 and dsu33 there is provision for disabling the proximity burst function of the dsu33 as there is with the

variants which are operationally interchangeable d1131 dsu33ab variant u the dsu33ab is the original variant ma nufactured to usaf specification it has nominal battery life of 90 seconds and nominal shelf life of 180 days the sensor has an battery status indicator thatappears yellow before battery initiation and black after battery initiation the dsu33ab has design deficiency whenemployed with the mk122 switch for quantity releases from the fa18 aircraft this flaw is sneak circuit that saturatesthe aww4 whenever 195 volts is applied the aww4 cannot reset from the drain quickly eno ugh in the 300ms jdam release interval and every bomb after the first bomb in the quantity may dud due to lack of charging power caution u use of the dsu33ab usaf vari ant in quantity releases off of the fa18 aircraft may result in multiple dudssecret annex d d su33 system description u secret d2d1132 dsu33bb variant u the dsu33bb is newer variant manufactured to more stringent usn specification it has nominal battery life of 200 seconds and nominal shelf life of 5 years the sensor has battery sta indicator that appears white or light gray before battery initiation and dark gray or black after battery initiation thedsu33bb corrects the sneak circuit design deficiency of the dsu33ab which allows employment with the mk122 switch for quantity releases from the fa18 aircraft d114 theory of operation u the sensor provides firing pulse signal prior to ground impact the design height of burst is 5 to 35 feet the sensor operates autonomously and automatically after battery initiation requiring control ormanagement by the aircrew in specific applications dsu 33 functioning can be controlled selectively from the cockpit d12 functional description d121 sensor initiation u the dsu33 is connected to the aircraft vi power cable to route voltage to the sensor during weapon release the dsu33 uses the same power that is applied to the weapon fuze in order to initiate its thermal battery the sensor operates automatically upon receipt of the thermal battery initiation signal arming lanyard is required there are switches or settings on the dsu33 its elf provided that the sensor functions correctly bomb detonation will occur at the specification height above the ground automatically provided that the fuze has armed properly d122 sensor function u after the dsu33 receives thermal battery initiation signal as the bomb is released from the aircraft the sensor radiates rf energy to sense proximity once the sensor determines that the weapon has reached the design height of 5 to 35 feet height over all surfaces it pr ovides proximity signal fuzing pulse to the fuze through the power cable the actual fuzing height depends on the angle of pproach and surface reflectivity steeper angles equate to higher burst altitude more reflective surfaces also result in hi gher burst altitudes eg water is more reflective than san d and causes higher burst altitude u if functioning delay is selected in conjunction with the dsu33 the dsu proximity signal initiates the fuze functional delay timer before bomb impact occurs d2 applications d21 selective control d211 electrical safearm control u when the dsu33 is used in conjunction with electrical safearm control ie mk122 switch proximity vt fuzing may be activated selectively via aircrew cockpit options d212 mechanical safearm control u when the dsu33 is used in conjunction with mechanical safearm control ie fzu48 proximity vt fuzing cannot be controlled selectiv ely via aircrew cockpit options and always is active after weapon release d22 interface d221 jdam serial interface u when the dsu33 is used in conjunction with jdam weapon dsu33 activation after weapon release is controlled by digital commands via the 1760 serial interface d222 backwards compatible interface u when the dsu33 is used in conjunction with conventional nonjdam weapons dsu33 activation after weapon release is controlled by selective voltage application only if electrical safearm control is used
