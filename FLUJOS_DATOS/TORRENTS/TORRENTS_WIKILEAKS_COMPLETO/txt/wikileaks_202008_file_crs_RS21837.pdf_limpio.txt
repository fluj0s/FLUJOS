report focuses on t hose mma provisions that added voluntary prescription drug benefit under new medicare part d and the effect of this new benefit both on individuals who are dually eligible for medicaid and medicare and on state medicaid programs implications for medicaremedicaid dual eligibles the term dual eligibles refers to individuals who qualify for services under both medicare and medicaid most of these individuals are cons idered full benefit duals1 in general medicare is the primary payer fo r those services covere d by both medicare and medicaid eg hospital services medicaid us ually covers those costs in excess of whathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21837crs2 2 the medicaid state plan is the document that states submit to the federal government for approval which describes the eligibility groups covered and the services provided 3 section 1115 of the social security act allows the federal government to waive sections of medicaid law as long as the demonstration project is

coverage as of march 2005 all states and the district of columbia covere d prescription drugs for at least some medicaid be neficiaries starting in 2006 dual eligible individuals were longer eligible for the states prescrip tion drug benefit provi ded under the medicaid state plan2 or comprehensive section 1115 waiver3 to receive coverage of prescription drugs dual eligibles were required to enroll in the medicare part d benefit the benefit is offered through prescription drug plans pdps that have received approval from the secretary of health and human services hhs mma also affects dual eligibles whose eligibility pathway for medicaid is medically needy these individuals qualify for medicaid because they incur medical expenses that spenddown or deplete their income to statespecified standard some currently medically needy dual eligibles may longer qualify for medicaid if their prescription drugs are covered by medicare and are longer outofpocket expenses4 changes to the scope of prescription dr ug coverage for dual eligibles medicaid generally covers broad range of prescription drugs states may create lists of preferred drugs or require prior approval for nonpr eferred drugs but statutory requirements insure that medicaid c overs comprehensive list of drugs5 most states limit coverage of prescription drugs through for example the number of refills or the number of prescriptions in given time period generally drugs covere d under the part d benefit include those drugs that states are required to cover under medicaid except for sm oking cessation drugs the part d drug benefit will not include those drugs that are optional for states to cover under medicaid eg overthecounter drugs within the list of covered part d drugs pdps are permitted to establish formulary as long as it includes drugs though not necessarily all drugs within each therapeutic category and class as requested in mma the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21837crs3 6 to appeal coverage of drug

contribute most of their income continuedstates pharmacopeia usp has released draft list of therapeutic categories and classes one for 2006 formularies and revised version for 2007 formularies pdps can use the classification system developed by usp or can develop an alternative classification system to develop its formulary in either case cms stated that it reviews the formularies by looking at best practices in existing drug benefits and ensuring that drugs covered in the formulary are adequate and do not discriminate against specific disability or condition states covering other drugs in class or category included under mma may not use federal medicaid dollars to do so this di ffers from other benef its covered by both medicaid and medicare in which medicaid suppl ements medicare coverage states may continue to use medicaid f unding to cover those drugs not covered by mma for dual eligibles the scope of benefits has likely changed unlike medicaid mma does not limit the number of prescriptions one can receive or require prior authorization for particular drugs howeve r individuals must determin whether the drugs they take are on the pdp formulary and if needed re quest coverage of different drug mma gives individuals or their authorized representatives rights to access particular drug not covered by the formulary throug h an exceptions or appeals process6 requests for exceptions to the formulary or appeals of pdp decision must be made by the pdp within 72 hours or 24 hours for expedited requests if necessary other levels of appeal are also available changes to premiums and co stsharing for prescription drugs most dual eligibles do not ve premium to enroll in medicaid but they may have nominal copayments for the services they us to enroll in the medicare drug benefit most persons have to pay the pdp pre mium for coverage and costsharing amounts when they use benefits mma however established special rules for dual eligible individuals all dual eligibles qualify for lowincome subsidies for premiums and co payments full benefit dual eligibles are entitled to subsidy equal to the weighted average premium of all plans in the region or if greater the lowest premium for plan in the region in 2006 the monthly premiu m subsidy varied from 2325 in california to 3639 in mississippi7 if dual eligible chooses drug plan with higher premium than the amount of the subsidy he or sh is required to pay the difference costsharing requirements differ for dua l eligibles depending upon whether or not the individual resides in an institution indi viduals who reside in an institution have additional costsharing obligations under mma eg deductible copayment for drugs8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21837crs4 8 continued to the cost of their care referred to as pos teligibility treatment of income mma does not change this requirement 9 section 1927k7ai of the social security act 10 the goldman sachs group inc health care services united states medicare drug benefit oct 10 2005for dual eligibles who do not reside in an institution the amount that they pay for prescription drugs has likely changed state medicaid programs are permitted to impose nominal costsharing on noninstitutionalized dicaid beneficiaries generally the cost sharing imposed for prescription drugs s ranged from 50 per prescription to 300 under mma pdps may charge noninstituti onalized dual eligibles copayments for prescription drugs dual eligibles whose income as calculated by the supplemental security income program is less than 100 of the federa l poverty level can be charged up to 1 for generic drug or preferred drug that is considered multiple source9 drug and 3 for any other drug this copayment amount is adjusted annually based on the consumer price index cpi for other dua l eligibles their copayments are 2 for generic drug or preferred drug that is c onsidered multiple source drug and 5 for any other drug this copayment amount is increased annually based on the percentage increase in per capita expenditures for the medicare part d benefit copayments apply after beneficiary has total drug costs of 5100 in 2006 this amount is also increased in subsequent years by the incr ease in medicare per capita drug spending it appears that some nonin stitutionalized dual eligibles will be paying more per prescription under the medicare pa rt d benefit than they had been paying under medicaid the size of that increase is unknown nd will vary by person depending upon income level the prescription drugs used and increases in the cpi and part d expenditures enrollment of dual eligibles in the medicare part d benefit under medicaid dual eligibles received pres cription drug benefits as part of package of medicaid services with the same prescription drug c overage rules applying to all medicaid beneficiaries under the medicare drug benef it drug plans offer different formularies and have different premiums or copayments and may have multiple options within drug plan dual eligible beneficiar ies are having to decide which pdp plan they want to enroll in for 2006 the average number of pdp options within region is 42 ranging from 27 in alaska to 52 in pennsylvania and west virginia10 in october 2005 cms randomly assigned dual eligible individuals to lowcost pdp and notified them of this assignment to decrease the likelihood th at dual eligibles dr ug coverage will lapse when switching from medicaid to medicare as backup plan cms contracted with wellpoint national pdp to provide access for dual eligibles who arrive at pharmacy and are not enrolled in pdp as of janua ry 2006 there have been significant challenges in operationalizing the transition of dual eligibles from medicaid to medicare as result several states are paying for prescription drugs for dual eligibles with the expectation that they will be reimbursed several senators have expressed interest in sponsoring legislation to reimburse these states for their costs hhs has also taken steps to address the confusion and operational challenges by for example adding resources tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21837crs5 11 k freking senators seek to reimburse st

transitional supply of prescription drugs11 changes for dual eligibl residing in institutions to access prescription drugs dual elig ibles residing in institutions are also required to enroll in medicare part d and select pdp under medicaid institutions eg nursing facilities were required to provide pharmacy services for medicaid residents including dual eligibles generally facilities contracted with single longterm care ltc pharmacy that supplies prescription drugs fo r those residents since residents of institutions access prescription drugs somewhat differently than those in the community mma requires pdps to provide conveni ent access for prescription drugs for institutional residents12 federal regulations implementing mma require pdps to contract with any ltc pharmacy that meets certain standards and th at is willing to par ticipate in the pdps network cms have re quired pdps to demonstrate that there is sufficient network of participating ltc pharmacies to meet mmas convenient access requirements institutions may select and contract with the ltc pharmacyies that best meets their needs and residents will receive informa tion about those pdps that provide access to ltc pharmacy benefits in their specific institution implications for state medicaid programs ability to negotiate drug prices medicaid law requires drug manuf acturers that wish to have their drugs available for medicaid enrollees to enter into rebate agreements with the secretary of hhs on behalf of the states under these agreements manufacturers must provide state medicaid programs with rebates on drugs paid for medicaid beneficiaries in exchange states are required to cover all drugs ffered by those manufacturers few states have also negotiated supplemental rebates in addition to the federa l agreements in fy2004 federal and state drug rebate agreements redu ced medicaid drug expenditures by 2413 mmas effect on overall drug prices is unknown previously medicaid was spending significant share of its prescription drug expenditures for dual eligibles with the decrease in medicaid drug expenditures will state and federal medicaid officials ability to negotiate rebates with pharmaceutical companies also diminish in addition to enhance its negotiating ability will states increasingly join other states in pooled purchasing arrangementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21837crs6 administration of lowincome subsidy under mma state medicaid agencies and the social security administration ssa are determining eligibility for the lowincome subsidy of the drug benefit for all medicare beneficiaries not just dual eligibles ssa has established an application and eligibility process that most states are also using states were also required by mma to develop their own application while screening individuals for the lowincome subsidy states must also screen individuals for assistance with medicare part and part b costsharing as result more people may become eligible for this medicare costsharing assistance because they want to take advantage of the drug benefit assistance states may also screen the individual for medicaid eligibility these efforts may increase medicaid expenditures by increasing the number of enrollees receiving medicare costsharing assistance and receiving full medicaid benefits coordination of servi ces for dual eligibles states have also requested gaining access to the part d drug u tilization data by dual eligibles for the purpose of ma naging and coordinating care for example state may be implementing care management program for individuals with chronic illness in which information about prescription drug utiliza tion may be an important component for managing that care given the requirement s of mma it is unclear whether cms has the authority to give state medicaid agencies utilization data or can require the pdps to share the data with states medicaid financ ing the clawback formula states are also responsible for partially funding the new pa rt d bene fit under provision called the clawback the funding level for each state is function of the number of persons eligible for both medicaid and the medicare drug benefit the dual eligibles state prescripti on drug expenditures for dual ligibles in fy2003 the state share of medicaid funding inflation for pres cription drugs and statutorily determined annual factor over time th annual factor is reduced from 90 for 2006 and gradually declines to 75 for years after 2014 in its final regulation cms provided detailed information on the data sources to be used to calculate state clawback payments states continue to have concerns about the clawback formula g fy2003 data does not reflect more recent state efforts to reduce spending finally it is unclear how or if states will modify their state medicaid programs in response to mma eg to lower the clawb ackpayment by reducing eligibility for dual eligibles or to cover drugs not included in the part d benefit this will be addressed in future updates as inform ation becomes available
