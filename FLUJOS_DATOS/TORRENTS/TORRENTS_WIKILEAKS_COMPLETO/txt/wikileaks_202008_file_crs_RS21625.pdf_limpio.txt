trade policy by wayne m morrison and marc labonte and will be updated as events warrant from 1994 until 2005 china maintained polic of pegging its currency to the us dollar at an exchange rate of roughly 828 yuan to the dollar1 the chinese central bank maintained this peg by buying or selling as many dollardenominated assets in exchange for newly printed yuan as needed to eliminate excess demand supply for the yuan as result the exchange rate between the yuan and the dollar basically stayed the same despite changing economic factors which could have otherwise caused the yuan to either appreciate or depreciate relative to the dollar under floating exchange rate system the relative demand for the two countri goods and assets would determine the exchange rate of the yuan to the dollar many economists contend that for the first several years of the peg the fixed value was likely close to the market value but in the past few years economic cond itions have changed such that the yuan would likely have appreciated if it had been floating the sharp increase in chinas foreign exchangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21625crs2 reserves which grew from 403 billion in 2003 to 19 trillion as of september 2008 and chinas large trade surplus with the world 262 billion in 2007 are often viewed by critics of chinas currency polic as proof that the yuan is significantly undervalued china reforms the peg the chinese government modified its currency policy on july 21 2005 it announced that the yuans exchange rate would become adjustable based on market supply and mand with reference to exchange rate movements of currencies in basket it wa s later announced that the com position of the basket includes the dollar the yen the euro and few other currencies and that the exchange rate of the us dollar against the yuan was adjusted from 828 to 811 an appreciation of 21 unlike true floating exchange rate the yu an would be allowed to fluctuate by 03 later changed to 05 on daily basis against the basket since july 2005 china has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily but very slowly it has continued to accumulate foreign reserves at rapid pace which suggests that if the yuan were allowed to freely float it would appreciate much more rapidly the current situation might be best described as managed float market forces are determining the general direction of the yuans movement but the government is retarding its rate of appreciation through market interventi on from july 21 2005 to november 20 2008 the dollaryuan exchange rate went from 811 to 683 an appreciation of nearly 19 the impact of the yuans appreciation is unclear from januaryseptember 2008 us imports from china rose by 66 over the same peri od in 2007 while us exports to china rose by 175 the price index for us imports from china from september 2007 to september 2008 rose by 48 compa red to 145 for all imports us concerns over chinas currency policy many us policymakers and business and labor represen tatives have charged that chinas currency is significantly undervalued visàvis the us dollar even after the recent revaluation making chinese exports to the united states cheaper and us exports to china more expensive than they would be if exchange rates were determined by market forces they furthe r argue that the undervalued cu rrency has contributed to the burgeoning us trade deficit with china which was 256 billion in 2007 and has hurt us production and employment in several us manufacturing sectors that are forced to compete domestically and internationally against artificially lowcost goods from china furthermore some analysts conte nd that chinas currency policy induces other east asian countries to intervene in currency markets in order to keep their currencies weak against the dollar in order to compet with chinese goods critics contend that while it may have been appropriate for china during the early stages of its economic development to maintain pegge d currency it should let the yu an freely float today given the size of the chinese economy and the imp act its policies have on the world economy chinas concerns over modifying its currency policy chinese officials argue that its currency policy is not meant to favor exports over imports but instead to foster economic stability through currency stability as many other countries do they have expressed concern that floating its currency could spark an economic crisis in china and would especially be damaging to its export industries at time when painful economic reforms such as closing down inefficient stateownedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21625crs3 2 us production has moved away from manufacturin g and toward the service sector over the past several years us employment in manufacturing as share of total nonagricultural employment fell from 318 in 1960 to 224 in 1980 to 102 in 2007 this trend is much larger than the chinese currency issue and is caused by numerous other factors 3 putting exchange rate issues aside most economis ts maintain that trade is winwin situation continuedenterprises are being implemented they further contend that the chinese banking system is too underdeveloped and burdened with heavy debt to be able to deal effectively with possible speculative pressures that coul d occur with fully convertible currency concerns have also been raised over the effects an appreciating yuan would have on farmers due to lowerpriced imports chinese officials view economic stability as critical to sustaining political stability they fear an appreciated currency could reduce employment and lower incomes in various s ectors and thus could cause worker unrest however chinese officials have indicated that their longt erm goal is to adopt more flexible exchange rate system and to seek more balanced economic growth through increased domestic consumption and the devel opment of rural areas but they claim they want to proceed at gradual pace to ensure economic stability these concerns have been further strengthened by the effects of the current global financial crisis implications of chinas currency policy for its economy if the yuan is undervalued visàvis the dollar estimates rage from 15 to 40 or higher then chinese exports to the united states are likely cheaper than they would be if the currency were freely traded providing boost to chinas export industries and to some degree an indirect subsidy eliminating exchange rate risk through managed peg also increases the attractiveness of china as destination for foreign investment in export oriented production f acilities however an underval ued currency makes imports more expensive hurting chinese consumers and chinese firms that import parts machinery and raw materials such policy in effect benefits chinese exporting firms many of which are owned by foreign multinational corporations at the expense of nonexporting chinese firms especially t hose that rely on imported goods this may impede the most efficient allocation of resources in the chin economy another major problem is that the chinese government must expand the m oney supply in order to keep purchasing dollars which has promoted the banks to dopt easy credit policies in addition hot money has poured into china from investor s speculating that china will continue to appreciate the yuan at some point these factors could help fuel inflation overinvestment in various sectors and expansion of nonperfo rming loans by the banks each of which could threaten future economic growth implications of chinas currency policy for the us economy effect on exporters nd importcompetitors when exchange rate policy causes the yuan to be less expensive than it w ould be if it were dete rmined by supply and demand it causes chinese exports to be relatively inexpensive and us exports to china to be relatively expensive as result u s exports and the production of us goods and services that compete with ch inese imports fall in the short run many of the affected firms are in the manufacturing sector2 this causes the trade deficit to rise and reduces aggregate demand in the s hort run all else equal3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21625crs4 3 continued for the economy as whole but produces losers within the economy economists generally argue that free trade should be pursued because the gains from trade are large enough that the losers from trade can be compensated by the wi nners and the winners will still be better off effect on us consumers and certain producers societys economic wellbeing is usually measured not by how much it can produce but how much it can consume an undervalued yuan that lowers the price of imports from china allows the united states to increase its consumption through an improvement in the termsoftrade since changes in aggregate spending are only temporary from longterm perspective the lasting effect of an undervalued yuan is to increase the purchasing power of us consumers imports from china are not limite d to consumption goods us producers also import capital equipment and inputs to final products from china an undervalued yuan lowers the price of these u s products increasing their output effect on us borrowers an undervalued yuan also has an effect on us borrowers when the us runs current account deficit with china an equivalent amount of capital flows from china to the ited states as can be seen in the us balance of payments accounts this occurs because the chinese central bank or private chinese citizens are investing in us assets which allows more us capital investment in plant and equipment to take place than would otherwise occur capital investment increases because the greater demand for us assets puts downward pressure on us interest rates and firms are now willing to make investments that were previously unprofitable this increases aggregate spending in the short run all else equal and also increases the size of the economy in the long run by increasing the capital stock private firms are not the only beneficiaries of the lower interest rates caused by the capital inflow trade deficit from china interestsensitive household spending on goods such as consumer durables and housing is so higher than it would be if capital from china did not flow into the united states in addition large proportion of the us assets bought by the chinese particular ly by the central bank are us treasury securities which fund us federal budg et deficits according to the us treasury department china holds 585 billion in us treasury securities as of september 2008 making china the largest foreign holder of such securities if the us trade deficit with china were eliminated chinese capital would l onger flow into this country on net and the government would have to find other buyer s of us treasuries this could increase the governments interest payments net effect on the us economy in the medium run an undervalued yuan neither increases nor decreases aggregate mand in the united states rather it leads to compositional shift in us producti on away from us exporters and import competing firms toward the firms that benefit from chinese capital flows thus it is expected to have medium or long r effect on aggregate us employment or unemployment as evidence one can consider that the us had historically large and growing trade deficit throughout the 1990s at time when unemployment reached three decade low however the gains and losses in employment and production caused by the trade deficit will not be dispersed evenly acr oss regions and sectors of the economy on balance some areas will gain while others will lose and by shifting the composition ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21625crs5 4 most economists believe that the united states runs trade deficit because it fails to save enough to meet its investment needs and must obtain savings from other countries with high savings rates china has one of the worlds largest savings rate us output to higher capital base the size of the economy would be larger in the long run as result of the capital inflowtrade deficit although the compositional shift in output has negative effect on aggregate us output and employment in the long run ther may be adverse shortrun consequences if output in the trade sector falls more qui ckly than the output of us recipients of chinese capital rises aggregate spending nd employment could mporarily fall this is more likely to be concern if the economy is already sluggish than if it is at full employment otherwise it is likely that government macroeconomic policy adjustment and market forces can quickly compensate for any decline of output in the trade sector by expanding other elements of aggregate demand the deficit with china has not prevented the us economy from registering high rates of growth since 2003 the uschina trade deficit in the context of the overall us trade deficit while china is large trading partner it accounted for only 165 of us merchandise imports in 2007 and 29 of the sum of all us bilateral trade deficits over span of several years country with fl oating exchange rate can consistently run an overall trade deficit for only one reason domestic imbalance between saving and investment over the past two decades us saving as share of gross domestic product gdp has been in gradual decline on the one hand the us has high rates of productivity growth and strong economic fundamentals that are conducive to high rates of capital investment on the other hand it has chronically low household saving rate and recently negative government saving rate as result of the budget deficit as long as americans save little foreigners will use their saving to finance profitable investment opportunities in the united states the trade deficit is the result4 the returns to foreign owned capital will flow to foreigners instead of americans but the returns to us labor utilizing foreignowned capital will flow to us labor more than half of chinas exports to the world are produced by foreigninvested firms in china many of whic h have shifted production to china in order to gain access to lowcost labor the returns to capita l of us owned firms in china flow to americans such firms import raw mate rials and components much of which come from east asia for assembly in china as result china tends to run trade deficits with east asian countries such as taiwan south korea and ja pan and trade surpluses with countries with high consumer demand such as the united states if chinas trade with the united states is excluded chinas tota l trade surplus was 12 billion 2007 these factors imply that much of the increase in us imports and hence the rising trade deficit with china is largely the result of ch ina becoming production platform for many foreign companies rather than unfair chinese trade policies congressional legislation many members contend that the pace of ch inas currency reforms and level of the yuans appreciation against the dollar have been too slow and some have introduced legislation to put further pressure on the ch inese to speed reforms or to enable ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21625crs6 producers to use us trade law to addre ss the impact of chinas undervalued currency hr 321 english would increase tariffs on imported chinese goods if the treasury department determined that china manipulated its currency and would require the united states to file wto case against china over its currency policy and to work within the wto to modify and clarify rules regardin g currency manipulation hr 1002 spratt would impose 275 in additional tariffs on chinese goods unless the president certifies that china is longer manipulating its currency s 364 rockefeller would apply us countervailing laws dealing with government subsidies to products imported from nonmarket economies such as china and would make currency manipulati on actionable under this measure hr 782 tim ryan and s 796 bunning would make exchange rate misalignment ac tionable under us countervailing duty laws require the treasur department to deter mine whether currency is misaligned in its miannual reports to cong ress on exchange rates prohibit the department of defense from purchasing certain products imported from china if it is dete rmined that chinas currency misalignment has disrupted us fense industries and would include currency misalignment as factor in determining safeguard measures on imports of chinese products th at cause market disruption hr 2942 tim ryan would apply count ervailing laws to nonmarket economies make an undervalued cu rrency factor in determining antidumping duties require tr easury to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and to list those meeting the criteria for priority action if consultations fail to re solve the currency issues the ustr would be required to ta ke action in the wto s 1607 baucus would require the tr easury department to identify currencies that are fundamentally misaligned and to designate such currencies for priority action under certain circumstances such action would include factoring currency undervaluation in us antidumping cases banning federal procurement of products or services from the designated country and filing case against in the wto s 1677 dodd would require the treasury depa rtment to identify countries that manipulate their currencies regardless of their intent and to submit an action plan for ending the manipula tion and gives treasury the authority to file case in the wto s 2813 bunning would also require the treasury department to identify currency manipulators and to submit an action plan to end the manipulation some us policymakers have expressed hope that china will increase its us debt holdings in order to help the federal govern ment pay for its financ ial rescue plan and future stimulus packages while others have expressed concerns that doing so would lessen pressure on the chinese government to appreciate the yuan
