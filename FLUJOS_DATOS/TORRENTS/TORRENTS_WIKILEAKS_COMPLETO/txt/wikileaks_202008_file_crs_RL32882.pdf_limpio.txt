everyone but taiw an under the rubric of the sixparty talks the united states china japan russia and south korea are cooperating to resolve the north korean nuclear crisis taiwanese businesses have invested an estimated 70 to 100 billion in factories in coastal china china relies on foreign invested enterprises for about half its im ports and exports for taiwan japan and south korea china has displaced the united states as their major trading partner china interacts with taiwan japan nd south korea on four levels human relations economic and financ ial interaction diplomatic and political intercourse and military relations the mperature of relations at each level ranges from cold to hot depending on the type of interaction and country or state being considered at the human level the temperatures are mixed at the economic level hot at the diplomatic level cold for taiwan to warm for south korea and at the military level temperatures of interaction are cold the implications of chinas globalization and rise as major economic power can be seen in its impact both on beijing and on policy deliberations in taipei tokyo and seoul the chinese communist leadership not only is having to cede space in its decision making process to indus trial interests but the leaders themselves are coming into power with experience in the transformation of society that comes from development and moderniz ation after opening to the outside world china now depends on international investment and trade for the economic growth needed to maintain the partys legitimacy for chinas trading partners dependency on the chinese market means that beijing is looming larger in all aspects of policy making while this is not likely to challenge us security ties with japan south korea and taiwan it raises several policy issues one is how to deal with modernizing and more powerful chinese military financed by the growing chinese economy another is how to explicitly incorporate into us policy the greater weight that beijing is being given in policy deliberations in t okyo and seoul further policy issue is whether to take explicit measures to offset the rising economic clout of china and attempts by beijing to create east asian institutions with china at the center and the united states pushed to the periphery positive result of the mutual trade and financial dependenc that has developed in northeast as ia is that all parties now have much to lose by an international military crisis that would interrupt economic and financial flows in the regi on all four governments

forces of globalization the internationalization of markets politics and legal systems in an emerging new order in northeast asia china is rapidly becoming the economic heavyweight in asia and this is having major effect on the prcs relationships with japan taiwan and south korea the fo cus of this report is on the use of soft power as contrasted with hard military power in inducing china taiwan

they are altering the basic costbenefit calculations related to the security of these nations and how taiwan japan and south korea are responding to the rise of ch ina focus of this report is whether globalization is working to induce northeast asia nations to behave in ways that promote peace and stability in th region and to ease tensions an argument could be made for example that for beijing the potential costs in decreased trade lower investment inflows and lost jobs that would occur should it invade taiwan are rising with each new taiwanese factory opened in this case the economic forces can be seen as stabiliz ing the milit ary establishment in both taiwan and japan however are viewing the growing strength of the chinese economy and the concomitant military buildup that it has abled with some alarm in that sense globalization and the armaments it has financed has been destabilizing both taiwan and japan have had to adjust their military capabilities to cope with growing potential chinese threat in larger sense the lure of the chinese market for japanese taiwanese and south korean exporters tends to provide stabilizing force as all would lose by large disruption in trade flows for congress one question is how to pr omote and protect us interests while northeast asia undergoes ra pid economic change and the imperatives of the containment of communism fade the po licy choices for northeast asia include whether to continue current polic ies of promoting market economies enabling globalization and encouraging democracy while projecting sufficient military power to keep the peace in the region seek to contain china along the same lines of the containment of the former soviet union actively counterbalance the rising economic influence of china and the trading networks it is buildin g by pursuing free trade agreements and closer investment relations with japan south korea and taiwan and by strengthening free trade process under the asia pacific economic cooperation apec forum bring chinas external trade more into balance ensure that china adheres to its world trade organization commitments reduce the foreign exchange resources availabl to chinas central governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32882crs3 and slow the bandwagon effect by which japanese south korean and taiwanese businesses are establishing factories in china with the intention of selling part of the output in the us market facilitate the globalization of china in order to strengthen forces of change create centers of power outside of beijing and increase representation in beijing by business and international interests and take into greater account the impact that the rise of china is having on the policies of japan s outh korea and taiwan chinas evolving strategy even before the 911 terrorist att acks on the united states the peoples republic of china was shiftin g its strategy with respect to its neighboring countries and washington away from confrontation and strategic competition toward ec onomic cooperation and reduction of strategic ggressiveness follo wing several crisis points in chinas interna tional relations including the 1989 tiananmen square repression the 1995 seizure by china of misc hief reef in the spratly islands the 199596 live fire missile exercises in the taiwan strait the 199798 allegations of chinese espionage the 1999 nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade and the 2001 us ep3chinese fighter aircraft collision incident chinese relations with its northeas t asian neighbors and with the united states have now become fairly calm and constructive why china has turned its focus toward its own peaceful development rather than blatantly asserting what it considers to be its territorial rights and periodically poking fingers in the eyes of its neig hbors is complex question that will be addressed partly below it seems clear however that beijing has recognized that its attempts to assert sovereignty over disputed islands or the test firing of missiles near taiwan have proven to be counterproduc tive recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan moreover have demonstrated anew that the united states is the premier global power and that the us military hol ds large technological lead in the conduct of war beijing sees huge cost to an open conflict with the united states in the post 911 environment moreover beijing has been able to position itself in way that puts it on the side of washington in the global antiterrorism campaign despite beijings concerns over the growing american military presence near the western border of china in central asia beijings leaders also recognize that the legitimacy of their monopoly on government rests primarily on their ability to deliver rising standard of living to their peopl this not only requires continued economic growth but stability in the region and undi sturbed flows of capital and goods between china and the rest of the world

states to south korea japan and taiwan replicate the import trends china is rising while the united states is static as source of supply for these markets these shifts in trade flows away from the united states indicate that dependency relationships also are turning toward chin not only are japan taiwan and south korea becoming more dependent on china but china also is becoming more dependent on these economies for imports nd exports many of the imports into china moreover are intermed iate products and capital goods that are vital to chinas industrial sector and economic growth and enable china to export to the us and other markets exports to china more over are important sources of aggregate demand for countries such as japan nati on that has been in and out of recession since 1992 another indicator of the shifting positi ons of the united states and china can be seen in foreign direct investment fdi or longterm investment in controlling shares of companies this is investme nt in companies that provide goods and services in which the foreign investor cont rols 10 or more of the shares looking first at the aggregate flows from all sources figure 3 indicates that while the united states is still the preferred destination for foreign direct investment the trend is turning toward china in 2003 china received 54 billion in fdi while the united states received 30 billion

fdi inflows into china play geopolitical role in that they raise the cost of instability both within the prc and between the prc and its neighbors particularly taiwan more important than the total inflows from the world however are the flows to china from its neighborin g economies of the 535 billion realized foreign direct investment in 2003 51 billion came from japan 45 billion from south korea and 34 billion from taiwan chinas largest investor however was hong kong with 177 billion some of this was actually chinese money which round tripped in order to take advantage of incentives that favor foreign investments the us total of 42 billi on was slightly less than south koreas 45 billion but more than taiwans 34 billion the general trend of foreign direct investment within northeast asia has been for it to increase or remain at fairly substantial level the united states is maintaining its rate of direct investment in china but that level is just on par with that of south korea for japan china accounted for 31 billion or 86 of its total 361 billion in direct foreign investment in 2003 japan still invests more than three times as much in the us market 106 billion

capital markets and more stability in the asian financial markets12 these financial arrangements are evidence of nascent cooperation and ins titution building among east asian nations with both japan and china playing major roles within china moreover economic success is affecting decision making and policies in the ranks of the chinese communist party ccp the ccp is including more of chinas business and other interests both in its membership and policies an estimated 30 of chinas entrepreneurs s everal million are now members of the ccp13 these entrepreneurs are not poor peas ants many are the business elite in addition numerous party memb ers have themselves beco involved in businesses or have strong business interests china may still be oneparty state but that one party is gradually recognizing that it must reflect the interests of the people including those with business and economic interests if it intends to remain in power14 further effect of the rapid developm ent of chinas economy is its growing appetite for raw materials and energy and other accouterments of modern life in the market for petroleum for example ch inas demand already has reached 67 million barrels per day and in 2020 is expected to climb to 120 million barrels per day or about 11 percent of world consumption15 similar increases are occurring in chinese demand for steel gold natural gas

against taiwan independence with credible threats of military action against what beijing considers to be renegade province should taiwan attempt to make its facto quasiindependent stat us into one more jure china has backed up its rhetoric by deploying an estimated 600 missiles that can be aimed at taiwan along the south china coast and augmenting its ability to launch naval attacks on the other hand the prc has encouraged taiwan businesses to invest in the prc in the hope that the increasing economic and financial interdependence would ameliorate the political forces for independence in white paper beijing said that with respect to taiwan doors have been flung open to facilitate the flow of g oods and people businessmen from taiwan are welcome to invest or trade on the mainland they are accorded preferential treatment and legal safeguards17 by creating dependency by taiwan s businesses on chinese workers subsidiaries sources of supply and markets china has sought to win the

from receiving diplomatic recognition from the major countries of the world the prc has been particularly aggre ssive and uncompromising even going so far as blocking taiwan from receiving unoffici observer status in the world health organization and preventing the president of taiwan fro m attending the annual meetings of the leaders of the 21 member states at the asia pacific economic

taiwans ministry of national defe nse in its biennial defense report places the possibility of direct attack by the prc across the sea as low but warns of the prc military buildup and the likeli hood that an imbalance in the prcs favor may induce beijing to attempt to resolve the taiwan issue through military means33 the critical deterrence factor against military action has always been the weight of war damage and possible intervention by the united states these factors still are preeminent but the diplomatic politi cal economic and human costs of open hostilities have reached level far beyond that of years past when china was more isolated and less interconnected with the rest of the world some in beijing have indicated that they would fight to retain taiwan regardless of cost in december 2003 leading chin military strategist warned that decision to attack taiwan would not be ffected by concerns about chinas economic development and that beijing was not concerned that foreign investment might drop or that an attack would set back its development by several years34 chinas 2004 report on national defense states that ta iwans independence movement is the greatest threat to

reality the effect still is small right now it is more hope than reality36 the fact that china has not resorted to force to achieve one of its major national goals however indicates that beijing

technical report tr 133 july 2004 p 145international business community also wants stability in the region for business reasons message they have conveyed to both beijing and taipei third reason is that taiwan also needs stability to conduct its own internal political and economic reforms37 hence neither side is opting for overt hostilities the taiwan side points out however that whether the growing economic interdependence across the strait combined with other deterrent forces leads to stability or instability depends on whether beijings decision makers are rational or irrational if they are rational as viewed by taiwan costbenefit analysis would likely overrule an unprovoked military action agai nst taiwan if they are irrational as viewed by taiwan however anything can happen history has shown that in campaigns such as the 196676 cultural re volution rationality as might be viewed by others does not always prevail in beijing38 one author who has examined the inte gration of the information technology industry between taiwan and the prc concludes that in addition to the fatalities and casualties resulting from open hostilities cro ssstrait war would devastate taiwans economy and severely harm chinas industrial pr ogress he points out that such war also would cripple the dig ital economies of ever developed economy in the world his argument is that all international commerce depends on siliconbased computer and communications systems wh ile industries depend on new information technology products for future productivity ga ins crossstrait war would suddenly cut into much of the worlds supply of siliconbased products essential for global commerce and investments in new technology the author surmises that any use of force to reunify china would cause such jolt to the world economy that the united states would be forced to intervene preemptively to prevent it39 another study points out that chinas desire to attract investment and technology from taiwan is likely to decreas the likelihood of conflict in the taiwan strait by making the costs of any potentially provocative move prohibitively high for both sides in short economic integr ation has made war so costly that neither side would risk contemplating any action that might ignite serious conflict40 in separate study taiwanese profe ssor points out that while crossstrait integration has generated spillover effects in terms of broadening exchanges to areas untouched in the past economic integration has not resolv ed the sovereignty issue it also in his view has precluded the chen administration

political goals41 former national security advisor henry kissinger sees type of historical evolution taking place as more and more of the taiwanese economy is connected with the prc and more and more exchanges take place over period of ten years or perhaps more he says the conditions of life on the two sides of the taiwan strait will become more comparable and the dialogue on the political level therefore easier he does not feel the problem will be resolved by economic exchanges since peace across the strait depends on political solution and an understanding of what is required for peace in asia42 many military authorities continue to emphasize the risk that crossstrait crisis could trigger global conflagr ation what can be concluded is that the stakes of overt hostilities are now higher

approach diplomatic political and security relations with other states57 for both japan and china one key questi on is to what extent the extensive economic interactions and diplomatic sensibilities will prevent political tension from escalating into outright hostility or even military conflict some experts point to tentative evidence that japanchina security relations are stabilized by growing economic ties one study of the sino japanese relations hip concludes that cooperation in the economic r ealm has not developed into cooperation in the security realm but the author also notes that confrontation in the security realm also has not brought friction in economic relations japans china po licy is striking balance between military security and commercial policy58 another study concludes that economic interaction has on the whole proven effective in promoting stable political relations the economic nexus has not only provided the foundation for the political relationship but it has served to maintain that relati onship during times of trouble in times of crisis such as the 1989 tian anmen square crackdow n japans political retaliation was scant so as not to disturb the economic synergy and political stability the author also concludes that as the two economies become more profoundly intertwined with each other they are likely to reach out to each other in areas such as regional security affairs in order to maintain the peace59 one example of such cooperation could be china s cooperation with japan nd the united states south korea and russia in the six party talks on north korea in short economic interaction appears to have induced the two sides to keep the political rhetoric to manageable vel and adroitly tiptoe around potential military clashes both sides however continue to build their military capabilities the question then becomes whether economic nd cultural ties will c ontinue to induce military restraint as china grows into major regional power

both washington and seoul policymakers insist that the alliance is strong and president roh has kept hi s promise on sending troops to perform humanitarian work in iraq disagreements over the global

division of the peninsula further china has not yet accepted seouls 1999 proposal to hold joint maritime search and rescue exercises63 although talks have continued one indicator of the warming relations between seoul and beijing is the roh administrations new geopolitical strategy w ith the support of china of seeking to play the role of balancing force in nort heast asia president roh reportedly would like south korea to play the role of stab ilizer for peace and prosperity and to place exchanges between south korea and china on the same level as those with japan while korean

than to pursue pragmatic diplomatic policy rooted in economic benefits although clearly china shows intention of compromising or negotiating over matters related to its sovereignty in this respect china regards peace and stability on the korean peninsul as indispensable to its continued economic advancement it seeks to pres erve the pyongyang regime while taking measures to resolve the north korean nuclear problem also the talk of reunification between south and north korea places pressure on beijing to keep on the good side of south korea to avoid the prospect of nuclea rarmed unified korea as an unfriendly neighbor the prc also would like to wean south korea away from its close military alliance with the united states in order to weaken what it views as an important link in the us encirclement of china beijing therefore has placed great importance on its economic and trade relations with south korea while maintaining its support of pyongyang and expanding diplomatic and political contacts with seoul65 policy discussion from the above discussion it is appare nt that the rise of the prc as an economic powerhouse has brought significant changes in chinas relationships with taiwan japan and south korea the intere sts of all four of these governments are being influenced by the rapid development of trade investment and financial flows these relationships are selfmotivating selfperpetuating and selfsustaining they arise primarily out of the self interests of businesses and operate largely independently of governme nt intervention except for government regulation ownership of enterprises and financing many of these economic flows are generated by the forces of globalization th at are affecting all parts of the world within the four strata of interaction military dipl omatic economic and human economic relations between china and the other states are the warmest human interaction is both warm and cool diplomatic relations ra nge from warm to cold and military relations generally are cold or absolutely frigid the chinese economy is growing so fast and becoming so large that other asian countries are jumping on the bandwagon to ensure that their industries both capture some of the chinese market and use the lowcost chinese manufacturing platform to keep their exports competitive in thir d country markets governments in the region are increasing their economic engagement with china while hedging their bets by strengthening their own military forces to offset the arms buildup in china they are keeping military clashes that do occur often related to claims to disputed islands from escalating into political crises china is increasingly engaging in strategic cooperation particularly in the global wa r on terrorism and in using its influence with north korea in hosting the sixparty talks potential flashpoints however still exist particularly across the taiwan strait and with north korea and menacing frown could appear

might cause instability in the region the economic costs of instability are rising each is being induced to seek stability alt hough the prc is adamant in preventing taiwans independence chinas growing economy provides the resources for be ijing to modernize its military and it is expected before too long to be able to tip the balance of power across the taiwan strait in its favor once that occurs china may be w illing to sacrifice external peaceful relations to accomplish other national goals such as forced reunification with taiwan while the economic political and military relations in

crossstrait stability for the united states question is how to promote and protect us interests wh ile northeast asia unde rgoes rapid economic change during the cold war the countries of northeast asia and the united states tended to make policy deci sions relative to security politics and economics under bipolar strategic lens that placed security first in international relations in most cases the overriding question for the west was whether the policy being considered added to or detracted from the containmen t of the soviet union and curtailed the spread of both russian and chinesestyl communism this colored for example efforts to reconstruct postworld war ii japan to intervene in the korean conflict to provide support to the re public of china on taiwan to escalate the vietnam war to sometimes wink at trade barriers in japan and south korea in exchange for their support of the us military and to promote closer trade ties with japan and south korea rather than have them rely on china their traditional trading partner during that time the best predictor of whether nation had amicable relations with the united states was the degree to which it opposed communism now that the last remnants of the cold war are disappearin g in asia national policy among countries in northeast asia seems to be evolving more to reflect the practical interests of individual states rather than

is couched in terms of military strategy it also can extend to economic and political issues certainly chinas economic rise has pr ovided the resources for it to build modernizing and more powerful

view assert that the united states needs to send strong signal to countries in the region that washington is not distracted by the middle east and that it has enduring interests in asia71 there are many ways that signals can be sent one is through realist channels such as military strength and actual trade and investment flows another is through idealist channels such as diplomatic and political

current attention on the upward valua tion of the chinese yuan is separate topic that is receiving considerable attention already77 at time that the us dollar is depreciating in response to the us current account deficit of around 6 of gdp the peg of the yuan to the dollar shifts the burden of adjustment to europe japan south korea and other countries what is particularly ironi c is that the bilateral us trade deficit with china at 162 billion is not subject to the market forces normally exerted by exchange rate adjustment so since the japanese yen and south korea won already are floating the chinese peg to declining dollar gives chinese exports relative price advantage not only in the american market but in japan and south korea as well between january 2002 nd january 2005 the dollar depreciated 22 against the japanese yen and 20 against the south korean won since the chinese yuan has been tied to the dollar it too s depreciated by like amounts against the yen and won this gives

to exercise much direct leverage over the united states and nations supportive of us effo rts but china appears to be taking advantage of its rising economic clout and growing trend to ward regionalism to attempt to develop some mechanism to check what it considers to be us hegemony82 this could be some sort of asian community or more formal organization one observer concludes that

northeast asia that diminishes the ability of the democratic states in the region to counter beijings influence the problem rests on the basic trust of japan in south korea in particular there exists

with beijing the united states could work more with japan and other countries in the region to resolve historical issues and dampen popular for ces of nationalism in order to keep those nations from drifting toward an explosive enmity that could be avoided and could threaten us interests from one perspective as long as the nationalistic and emotional outbreaks are kept under control however the united states actually could benefit in this view the more the as ian nations squabble among themselves the more they tend to view the united states as distant third party whose history of relatively nonimperialistic policies can be welcome international economic relations are like streets they go both ways while beijing has been trying to coopt its neighbor s particularly taiw an by enticing them

is difficult for economic engines to churn out wealth and even rumor of war triggers penalties from international financial markets it should not be surprising ther efore for south korea and japan to

rattling that disrupt growing economic relations are not likely to be welcomed in the region in summary protecting us interests in security prosperity and value preservation can be consistent with the
