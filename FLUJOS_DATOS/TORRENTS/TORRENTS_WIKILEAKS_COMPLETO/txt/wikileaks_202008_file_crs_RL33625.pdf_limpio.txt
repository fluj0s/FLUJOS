laws and recent developments introduction state laws that require pa rental involvement in pregnant minors abortion decision have gained greater visibility in light of r ecent attempts by congress to criminalize the interstate transport of minor to obtain an abortion1 at least forty three states have enacted statutes that require minor to seek either parental notification or parental cons ent before obtaining an bortion this report discusses the validity of state parental invol vement laws in the context of planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england and other us supreme court cases that address minors right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy in casey the court upheld the right of wo man to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy but permitted certain restrictions on minors ability to obtain an abortion such as state pare ntal consent requirements2 in ayotte the court reiterated that state may require parental invol vement in pregnant minors abortion decision3 in addition to examining the relevant abortion decisions this report reviews common state parental invol vement law provisions such as judicial bypass procedures and exceptions for medical em ergencies the report also highlights recent federal parental involve ment legislation nd provides survey of current state parental involvement laws planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v casey and ayotte v planned parenthood of northern new england in roe v wade the us supreme court held that woman has constitutional right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy4 the court in later cases has affirmed the basic right to an abortion but also permitted restri ctions on womanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33625crs2 5 the other provisions required spousal consent 24hour waiting peri od the pregnant womans informed consent before she could obtain an abortion and certain reporting for facilities that provide abortions the plurality upheld the informed consent waiting period and reporting requirement provisions finding that they did not impose undue burdens it struck down the spousal consent provision how ever holding that it gave husbands too much control over their wives and could contribut to spousal abuse thus imposing an undue burden on womans abortion decision 6 the plurality opinion defined undue burden as substantial obstacle in the path of woman seeking an abortion of nonviable fetus casey 505 us at 877 casey was not the first judicial instance in which the s upreme court held that state cannot place parental involvement restriction on minors right to obtain an abortion so that her parent or parents have absolute veto power over the decision in planned parenthood of central missouri v danforth 428 us 52 1976 the court held that state may not require the consent of parent or guardian of pregnant minor seeking an abortion if such consent will unduly burden the minors right to seek an abortion 7 casey 505 us at 899 8 ayotte 126 s ct at 965 access to an abortion casey established that st ate may require parental involvement in pregnant minors abor tion decision if the involvement does not unduly burden the minors righ t to choose wh ether to obtain an abortion in that 1992 case the court considered constitutiona l challenge to five provisions of the pennsylvania abortion control act of 1982 one provision required pregnant minor seeking an abortion to obtain consent from one parent or guardian before the procedure5 the court upheld the parental cons ent provision and also affirmed that state law that banned abortion completely would be unconstitutional in its holding the court shifted away from the trimesterbased strict scrutiny standard of judicial review it used in roe and articulated new undue bur den analysis courts will now invalidate stateimposed abortion restriction if it imposes an undue burden on womans right to obtain an abortion6 applying the new standard the casey court held that the parental consen t provision did not unduly burden pregnant minors right to obtain an abortion because it included exceptions in the event of medical emergency and when the minor demonstrates to court that parental consent is not in her best interests7 in january 2006 the court reiterated the va lidity of state laws that place certain restrictions on pregnant minors right to obtain an abortion in ayotte the court considered constitutional challenge to state statute requiring parental notification before minor may obtain an abortion the plaintiffs argued that the new hampshire parental notification prior to abortion act violates the right of woman to obtain an abortion because it does not contain an exception to allow pregnant minor to obtain an abortion without pare ntal notification when the procedure is necessary to preserve the minors health in writing for an unanimous court justice oconnor stated explicitly that the holding did not revisit court precedent regarding abortion8 rather the court addressed the re latively narrow issue of remedies it held that only certain applications of the act would violate womans constitutional right to an abortion and remanded the cas with orders for the lower courts to consider whether the act could be interprete d in manner consistent with the judicialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33625crs3 9 ayotte 126 s ct at 96667 10 428 us 52 1976 minnesota mississippi and north dakota ve laws that require the parental consent of both parents before preg nant minor may obtain an abortion the court has held that state law that contains twoparent consent provision is unconstitutional unless it contains an alternative for parental consent such as judicial bypass procedure 11 443 us 622 642 1979precedent that state may not restrict access to an bortion when the health of the woman seeking the abortion is at issue despite its narrow holding the court in ayotte expressly affirmed two legal propositions relating to pregnant minors acce ss to abortions states have the right to require parental involvement in mino rs abortion decision and state may not restrict access to an abortion that is necessary to protect the life or health of woman seeking an abortion9 parental notification and parental consent fourteen state parental i nvolvement statutes require the consent of one parent before pregnant minor may obtain an bortion while twelve st ate statutes require only that the minor notify one or both parent s that she intends to obtain an abortion as discussed the court has held that st ate law that requires parental involvement in minors abortion decision is uncons titutional if it unduly burdens the minors right to terminate her pregnancy several court cases preceding casey and ayotte expressly established that state parental involvement statute that permits parent to unilaterally prohibit minor from obtaining an abortion would be unconstitutional in planned parenthood of central missouri v danforth the court held that state parental involvement statute must provide an alte rnate procedure for minor to obtain authorization for an abortion10 in belotti v baird the court reiterated the danforth holding and stated that such an alternative must provide pregnant minor the opportunity to demonstrate that she is mature enoug h and well enough informed to make an abortion decision without parental involveme nt or that the abortion is in her best interests11 judicial bypass procedure thirtyfour state laws that require parental involvement in pregnant minors aborti on decision provide fo r judicial bypass procedure as the alternate means for nor to obtain permission for an abortion judicial bypass procedure allows minor who seeks an abortion to obtain permission from court to waive the releva nt parental involveme nt requirement in cases preceding casey the court held that adequate judicial bypass procedures are constitutional alternatives to state pa rental involvement statutes both danforth and belotti for example involved judicial bypa ss procedures that the court upheld as valid safeguards of pregnant nors right to obtain an abortion while the court has inva lidated state parental consent laws that do not include judicial bypass procedures it has not determined whethe r state law that requireshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33625crs4 12 497 us 502 1990

health et the court held that the ohio parental notification statute at issue was constitutional suggesting that the statutes judicial bypass procedure adequately protected pregnant minors right to obtain an abortion12 the court expressly declined however to decide whether state parental notification law that did not include judicial bypass procedure would per violate the constitution in lambert v wicklund the court similarly declined to reach the question of whether state pa rental notification law must contain judicial bypass procedure13 rather the court held narrowly that the montana parental notification law at issue which contained judici bypass procedure did not place an undue burden on pregnant minors right to obtain an abortion14 although the court has refused to addr ess directly whether state parental notification law must contain judicial bypass procedure court precedent appears to suggest that parental notification law would be unconstitutional if it did not provide pregnant minor w ith some alternative to pa rental notification in hl v matheson the court upheld as constitutional state statute that requires an unemancipated minor who lives with her pa rents to notify them if possible before she obtains an abortion but includes excep tions for minor who demonstrates that notification is not in her best interests15 moreover in belotti the court indicated that parental notification law would be unconstitutional if it did not provide an alternative to notification for mature nor or when notification would not be in minors best interests the court has declined to establish sp ecific parameters for the adequacy of judicial bypass procedures in the context of state parental i nvolvement laws in writing for the majority in akron justice kennedy rejected the dissenting opinions call to articulate specific procedural thresholds for the constitutionality of judicial bypass alternative such as whether it mu st be anonymous or only confidential or how quickly state must provide pregna nt minor with the opportunity for court proceeding he stated only that the ohio judicial bypass procedure contained reasonable steps to protect the identity of pregnant minors seeking judicial bypass and that the procedure included adequate provisions to expedite pregnant minors request for proceeding16 the court majority also held that state may validly require pregnant minor to establish by clear and convincing evidence during judicial bypass hearing that she is matu re enough to make an abortion decision without parental involvement17 medical emergency exception state parental i nvolvement statutes in louisiana maryland massachusetts nd ohio contain express exception tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33625crs5 18 ayotte 126 s ct at 967 in doe v bolton 410 us 179 1973 the court held that to determine whether an abortion is necessary to protect womans health doctor may exercise his or her judgment based on vari ous factors such as womans physical emotional psychological and familial wellbeing as well as her age 19 ayotte 126 s ct at 967protect the life or health of the pregnant minor in ayotte the court expressly reiterated its prior holdings in roe and casey that state may not restrict access to an abortion that is necessary to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman18 the court also stated the factual proposition that in small number of cases pregnant minor requires an immediate abortion to prevent serious health consequences19 therefore state statute that restricts pregnant minors access to an abortion likely must include an excepti on for medical emergencies involving the minors health or life federal legislation in the 109th congress during the 109th congress legislation that w ould have prohibited the
