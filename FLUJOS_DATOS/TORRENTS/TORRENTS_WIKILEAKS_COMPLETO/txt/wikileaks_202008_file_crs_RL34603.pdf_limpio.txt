had been part of the treasury department for over 100 years during an april 2008 hearing on the fy2009 budget request for the us secret service members of congress raised questions related to the missions and organizational location of the service are the two missions of the service compatible and how should they be prioritized is the department of homeland security the most appropriate organizational and administrative location for the secret service these and other policy questions have been raised and addressed at different times by congress and various administ rations during the

missionsinvestigation and protectionhave evolved over 143 years its original and oldest mission which began in 1865 is its investigation mission statutorily the protection mission did not begin until 1906 in fy2009 however the protection mission received 60 of the agencys funding and employed approximately 73 of its fulltime equivalents fte in fy2009 the protection mission was appropriated approximately 842 million and the investigation mission was appropriated 324 million 87 additionally according to usss fy2009 congressional justification the fy2008 protection missions fte is 4850 compared to the investigation missions fte of 1850 as described earlier in this report ussss protection mission employs the majority of the services agents and receives larger share of the agencys resources additionally the majority of congressional action concerning usss has been related to its protection mission this difference may be the result of the costs associated with an increase in protecting individuals events and facilities the relevant statutes identify what federal officials are authorized through statute usss protection the role and responsibilities of the secret service uniform division and the services role in security for nsses while congress has maintained ussss role in investigating financial crimes congressional action primarily has addressed and continues to address the services protection mission an example of this is congress enactment of pl 110326 the former vice president protection act of 2008 which requires the service to protect former vice presidents their spouses and minor children for period up to six months after leaving office another example of congressional interest in the services protec tion mission occurred in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act when congress specifically stated that the usss could not use any funds to protect any federal department head except the dhs secretary unless the service is reimbursed 88 one could argue potential terrorist attacks have resulted in an increase in the need for the services protection activities the services protection mission has increased and become more urgent due to the increase in terrorist threats and the expanded arsenal of weapons that terrorists could use in an assassination attempt or attacks on facilities 89 the usss transfer from the treasury department to dhs indicates this change the establishment of single mission or distinct primary and secondary mission for the usss is one option for congress in light of this increased terrorist threat one argument for this is that the majority of the services resources are used for its protection mission and that congress has raised the issue of the services competing missions of protection and investigation it can be argued however that the service trains its agents in both investigations and protection with loss of protectee in the last 45 years some have argued however that there

missions it might be determined that it is ineffective for the usss to conduct its protection mission and investigate financial crimes specifically in 2008 usss is engaged in an increased protection workload which includes protection of major presidential candidates ensuring security for the 2008 presidential nominating conventions preparing for the transfer of presidential administrations and the january 2009 inauguration congress addressed this issue at hearing in april 2008 on candidate protection 91 members expressed concern with the services ability to meet the demands of its dual mission92 usss director mark sullivan stated at the hearing that the service has initiated candidate protection approximately 18 months before the general election the earliest it has ever begun protection93 director sullivan also stated that the service has employed approximately 1000 transportation security administration screeners also within dhs to augment the services uniform divisions

to threats and hazards to the nation we will ensure safe and secure borders welcome lawful immigrants and visitors and promote the free flow of commerce100 more specifically certain authorities and responsibilities of the homeland security act address usss activities some involve dhss mission to prevent terrorist attacks within the us 101 and reduce the nations vulnerability from terrorist attacks102 the focus on terrorism prevention within homeland security context is further reinforced with the october 7 2007 version of the homeland security councils national strategy for homeland security the strategys four goals are prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks protect the american people our critical infrastructure and key resources respond to and recover from incidents that do occur and continue to strengthen the foundation to ensure our long term success103 arguably the authority for the usss to protect specified categories of individuals listed in 18 usc 3056a provided earlier in this report and the services investigation into financial crimes related to terrorism or terrorist organiza tions meet dhss mission and the strategys goals of preventing and disrupting terrorist attacks some past assassination attempts on presidents presidentelects and candidates have been terrorist attacks such as the 1901 assassination of president mckinley by an anarchist and the attempted 1951 assassination attempt on president harry s truman by two puerto rican nationalists 104 however to date attempted or successful assassination has been attributed to an individual professing to be terrorist or being member of terrorist organization it is not unreasonable however to associate general terrorist threats with potential dangers to top government officials in its

attackers plan their attacks and are motivated by wide range of issues105 the ntac study also suggests that mental illness is not critical to determining legitimate threats the ability to develop and execute plan is more significant factor106 terrorists are motivated by many issues and ideologies and have proven to be adept at developing and executing plans also in the national strategy for homeland security banking and finance is listed as critical infrastructure and key resource107 ussss original mandate to investigate crimes against united states financial system meets the strategys goal to protect our critical infrastructure and key resources dhss national protection and prog rams directorate contains an office for infrastructure protection oip oip is responsible for the coordinated national effort to reduce risk to our critical infrastructures and key resources cikr posed by acts of terrorism in doing so the department increases the nations level of preparedness and the ability to respond and quickly recover in the event of an attack natural disaster or other emergency 108 it could be assumed that dhss responsibility for ensuring the protection of critical infrastructure which includes banking and finance supports usss transfer to dhs therefore it could be argued that the usss is able to effectively execute its missions as distinct entity within dhs it can also be argued that because of the department of the treasurys mission to ensure the nations financial systems usss could execute its investigation of financial crimes mission as one of the departments entitiesas it was prior to its transfer to dhs in march 2003 this option might ensure that the lead agency for financial crime investigations was part of the federal governments financial department this option would require an evaluation of the services history of its protection mission when it was part of the treasury department and if the service would still be effective in this mission if was reassigned to the treasury department again this was an activity usss executed as part of the treasury department prior to march 2003 however the services protection mission has taken on increased significance since september 11 2001 this may arguably be reason to maintain ussss protection mission within dhs presently the services practice of training its agents in investigations and protection could impede on this division of usss between the departments of treasury and homeland security another example of an agency that could possibly assume the services investigation mission is the fbi which has the mission of protecting and defending the united states against terrorist and foreign intelligence threats and enforcing the criminal laws of the united states 109 however this might be problematic since investigations of financial crimes was the original mission of the usss additionally the service has developed proficiency in investigating financial crimes that the fbi may not be able to replicate unless usss personnel and resources were transferred 105 us department of homeland security us secret service united states secret service national threat

the question of what is the primary usss mission in order to determine where the service can efficiently execute its mission and be appropriately supported this evaluation could result in the status quo usss as dhs agency separation of usss missions financial investigations in the treasury department and protection in dhs or the service being transferred back to the department of the treasury another possibility may be establishing the usss as an independent agency that investigates financial crimes and conducts its protection mission this would require service coordination with the treasury department during financial crime investigations and coordination with other governmental entitiessuch as dhs and the depart ment of justicewhen usss is executing its protection mission one additional course of action could be having the service transferred to federal department other than treasury or dhs such as the department of justice regardless of how the service is organized it may be necessary to examine how usss is funded and if the present procedure of funding adequately meets the services needs and organization g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 from 1865 to the present usss has been investigating financial crimes its only activity for the first three decades and protecting senior executive branch officials most notably the president recently the service has increased its efforts in cybersecurity and its protection activities due to certain events such as the terrorist attacks of september 2001 and the war in iraq the missions of the service have evolved and conformed to presidential departmental and congressional requirements due to evolving technology and tactics used in crimesincluding financial cyber terrorism and attempted assassinationsusss has had to evolve as the cost of this law enforcement increases and the number of protectees increases at least during presidential campaign election years the service is having to determine how to continue to balance and fulfill its two missions
