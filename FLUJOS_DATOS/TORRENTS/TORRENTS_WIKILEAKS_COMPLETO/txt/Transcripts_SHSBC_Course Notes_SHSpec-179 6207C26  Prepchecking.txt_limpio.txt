6207c26 shspec179 prepchecking some of the data in this lecture is found also in hcob 30ju162 smooth hgc 25 hour intensive see also page 254 above for history of prepchecking ive just found way to use middle rudiments and make them double in brass and get the job done much better in prepchecking suppress suggest careful of invalidate and fail to reveal are powerful prepcheck buttons they should be used in the above order used in this order you have the midruds as complete prepcheck the middle rudiments were carefully sorted out of great number of buttons that could be used you could add another fifteen or twenty buttons the chart of attitudes see handbook for preclears has lot of them ruds are buttons that consist of just those things that can keep one of the other buttons from reading and which if present can keep goal or item from reading they are pretty powerful suppress if you got suppress off the case nearly everything would blow if suppress is alive you dont get read on the remainder of the buttons so run suppress before adding another series of anything suggest this button could be and sometimes has to be translated as isness that is evaluation per the auditors code 1 it says that something is it is powerful button because you say something is it will now read even though it wasnt reading before you say something reads which doesnt and the pc can jam on it and it will now read it will at least read on disagreement suggest neednt be used in midruds since auditors dont do it much save it for prepchecks invalidate if goal or item is invalidated it will read even when it is not the goal or item get the inval off and it will longer read suppress on top of inval keeps the inval from showing up that is why suppress goes first as button fail to reveal this button is off the line it gives you the dirty needle minute rockslam careful of this is another suppress with an added characteristic after the person has been having something little offbeat done for little while he can hang up in the thing if he becomes too careful of something or other he can also make an item read by reverse suppression by carefully not suppressing it ie by making sure it reads the order of the buttons would be suppress suggest careful of invalidate fail to reveal this is an optimum arrangement that puts the most important button last as far as session foulups are concerned this also gives you two cracks at suppression if these buttons are so strong they must have some value they make great prepcheck zero questions as lrh found more or less by accident while cleaning up pc who had been feeling poorly the procedure for the problems intensive is as follows see also p 134 above and hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion as well as the current hcob of 30jul62 1 sort out the chief selfdetermined change the pc has made using assessment by elimination or greatest read for purposes of assessment each change should be expressed in few words plus date 2 get the confusion that preceded the change and date it keep the pc to the just prior confusion this should be anywhere from five minutes to two weeks earlier dont let the pc go way back on the track 3 go month earlier in case he didnt remember the overt that started the confusion 4 prepcheck since the above date when you use the above procedure pcs are very willing to tell you things they have suppressed somatics come off also dont also check midruds on the period you are prepchecking you might think that you wouldnt reach basic on any chain by using the above method of prepchecking but since you are taking up the buttons in this sequence and they seem like such innocent buttons they clear away lot of track without your having to worry about fundamentals and basic omitting the withhold system left us with way to get to basic it appears that with this system you dont have to bother you could start in all over again if the pc had given it shallow pass on the first time through and pick up deeper fundamentals however the hazard in doing so is that you might be cleaning clean also be very sure not to leave question unflat that is very important since in so doing you could give him missed withholds and he could blow or create big storm and feel terrible for fiftyhour intensive you could also do prepcheck in this lifetime this system gets the pcs withholds easily and voluntarily just be sure to follow the rules and dont be an idiot make sure the pc understands the question to audit small child you might have to reword it to get it to communicate on any pc you want to be sure to communicate know what you are trying to communicate if you find the pc unable to answer or with very few answers dont blame it on the pcs caginess or unwillingness you have to more the communication so it does bite if you do that the prepcheck will unstack the bank in its natural sequence which is always desirable in sec checking and prepchecking it is very repetitive action there is another way to use repetitive prepchecking 1 sort out by assessment the persons selfdetermined decisions get the most charged oldtime problems intensive style make sure it is selfdetermined 2 date the problem 3 date the confusion prior to the decision found in 1 the pc will slide away from the prior confusion if you dont keep him looking for it dont let him find one five years before it is justprior confusion 4 date the beginning of the prior confusion and go month earlier 5 prepcheck it since date found in 4 pc tends to see himself as pawn on the board of life the liability of taking an otherdetermined chain is that you will get into chain of engrams this system doesnt handle engrams so watch it it is ok however to get sometimes coming off on dating the prior confusion if you let the date he few years earlier you will miss it the prior confusion is the period when he was creating the problem for which the decision is solution the sequence for this this mechanism is 1 the pc commits overts all over the place and has withholds missed on him like mad 2 this causes problem for him 3 he makes decision to solve the problem this is the selfdetermined change for more details sec pp 128130 above all this is part of an effort to make prepchecking beefier and more effective and farreaching you might feel shy of doing prepcheck if you werent pretty sure of getting good result somatics and conditions like postpartum depression will blow without your having to run engrams and getting the pc stuck in the incident the success you will have will depend on the excellence of your meter reading how thoroughly the pc is in session and how well you clean up each question prepchecking is relatively permissive system that gradiently lets the pc get himself into confrontable soup it doesnt overwhump the pc but it must be metered right
