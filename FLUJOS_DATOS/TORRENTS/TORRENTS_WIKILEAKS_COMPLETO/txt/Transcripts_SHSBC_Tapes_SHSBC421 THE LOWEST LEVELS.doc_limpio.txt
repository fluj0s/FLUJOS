the lowest levels lecture given on 13 april 1965 thank you okay how are you today audience fine well i have to check up on this sort of thing youre doing all right some of you are doing splendidly some of you are doing splendidly but some of you doing terribly i got brandnew idea audience oh yes yeah i got brandnew idea i got brandnew idea why dont you audit your pc isnt that terrible its insulting isnt it how about that though how about that it would be dead simple all right well now youd probably like to hear about lot of things but there are in actual fact some data that you need very desperately and that is that research is not wrapped up contrary to what ive been saying new datum has just emerged and research is very far from wrapped up research is going south here was weird unexplored area of homo sapiens and i more than get it shoved ininto place very nicely than some more data shows up from the bottom in other words apparently unable to go upapparently unable to go on up without uncovering fundamentals concerning the bottom thats quite understandable in other words the more progress you make into the upper reaches why the more fundamental the understanding is of what made man tick in the first place and as result although im pushing on up the line with considerable interest and velocity and as matter of fact havejust the day before yesterday i think i plotted nearly hundred gpms in the lineup and so forth for your eventual useall very correct this time thats been very very tough one by the way to plot my god the number of variables there could be in the reactive mindalmost infinite and actually we have the fundamental now of exactly what the pattern is and so forth and i have found out that people are having trouble even so theyre coming in on top of the bank you see through tremendous numbers of locks and lots of track and all that sort of thing and they have lot of trouble trying to sort out which is what and mistake in the thing is practically fatal and i therefore have been pushing on through youve got r6ewits holding you very nicelyand r6ew s these are very very nice processes and youd have to run them anyway and meantime why im putting the new capper on r6 of the gpm plot so that when you get there why youll have complete accurate plot that simply the hardest thing was to untangle the top and the bottom of the reactive mindthat was almost impossible to untangle because the top read as the bottom and the bottom read as the top and it was terrible mix up and finally got that straightened up and joined up anyway youre walking along into gpm plot r6 for instance has developed now into series of starrated processes the first of the starrated processes is how do you operate an meter solohow do you clean up some ptps and things like that on yourself well now it frankly isnt really possible in the lower ranges to engage in that kind of an activity fellow is too overwhelmed by his bank and needs an auditor sitting there and the auditor can see and the pc cant but when you get up into the vi range why it should be very easy to handle the thing from viewpoint of solo actually auditing is too slow at vi thats the main thing we learn about it its too slow it would take too long itd be too enturbulative process for the auditor and just knock the auditor around but its basically that it is too slow thats the main thing now about as near as i could figure out its about three months of solid runjust running the gpms themselves out if you were solo auditing at very highhour volume very high that is to say you were auditing three four hours day something like that but that would be the end of the reactive bank and you wouldnt have any more reactive mind than rabbit theres people who suddenly say what would i do if i got rid of my reactive mind very funny you know its like somebody walking up to you you see all smeared up with tar and say but what would i do if i got rid of this tar you know because there is nothing in the bank that isnt calculated to do one in there is nothing assistive about any part of it you know now were going to help you out were going to break your leg you know i mean its just reactive bank almost psychiatric when we look this overwe look this over we find out that it has as its end product of course clear as weve understood it in the earliest days on up the line that is clear that is reactive bankexclamation point dont you see none now i can assure you theres nothing beyondnothing beyond it worth running out that youd bother with theres great deal of unfamiliarity however and you run into problems of various kinds and not least amongst those problems ishow do you pick up delicate objects and so forth or how do you handle delicate objects and so on andlike body and you can knock body around awful fast awful hard without knowing what you are doing you yourself are now measuring and estimating your actions you see and they have to learn how to postulate with great rapidity in order to be at all accurate this is strange field for instance if youre used to having meat contact with somethingyour hand dont you see well thats easyyouve learned to touch something with your hand do you see and you find thats very unsatisfactory you find that is kind of silly its perfectly all right to touch something but what you do is postulate it on and off and its sort ofhow fast can you postulate its quite quite remarkable how fast do you say touch not touch you know because if you dont postulate it you get into some very remarkable messes you all of sudden find yourself half wrapped around telegraph pole when you first start out this sort of thing you have to understand im talking about the behavior of new clear and you find yourself wrapped around telegraph pole so fast that itd make your thetan swim see you feel very bold and brash and you feel quite good and everything looks very nice and the dewdrops on the roses are very bright indeed so youre going to pick rose you know well thats not sooner said than done proposition it is not that type of proposition at all first you break down the rosebush its been so long since youve had any direct control dont you see all your control has been on via and your control im not now talking about necessarily being outside you see your handling of the body goes out and you have to settle that down again well you might say its condition of too aware you have to adjust yourself to reading peoples minds worries you you know youre talking to somebody you know hes lying like hell and you finally tell him so you know its not yes its not just first dynamic adjustment you seethere are several others well for instance you pick up sofa pillow you pick up sofa pillow with beam lets say you pick up sofa pillow with beam you see well you reach out your hand to pick up the sofa pillow but you pick up the sofa pillow two inches ahead of your hand see now this is very difficult because when you touch the sofa pillow with beam youve touched the sofa pillowwith the same type of operation but your hand is cushioned so it doesnt stick to the sofa pillow but your beam will your beam is too much of the woof and warp of this universe dont you see and you find yourself all of sudden in frantic statetrying to get rid of the damn sofa pillow rahhh and you say how did i ever get into this you know devil with the sofa pillow thawwwttt and you say oh yes of course let go of the sofa pillow and thats the end of that done by postulate youre trying to crosscoordinate between postulating and handling now youve got both systemsand you can use both systems and frankly youre like ayoure like little kid that is trying to handle body for while of course you have the beautiful head start that youve got nothing in your road to keep you from learning so you learn rather fast but youre not quite sure where all these things fit you know what can you do youre not at all sure of that sort of thing things that were very bad to you before suddenly become quite pleasant things that were very pleasant appear to be rather odd to you your tastes change in other words i suppose right now if you went something on the order of few miles up or were in an aircraft 32000 feetlets not be extremeyou would find it very uncomfortable if that wasnt pressurized and heated well its frankly very uncomfortable if its pressurized and heated there is nothing quite so pleasant as nice icy cold cloud its faintly warm to the touch you see one is so moved up on temperatures that one is actually running all the time as thetan at 986 or whatever it is or 984 and there he is running away at this temperature well as soon as you start clearing up youll find that temperature is just fine if youre using body thats dandy if you are using body you get it in its proper perspective its really quite hot proper temperature is minus 273 degrees fahrenheit way down south around absolute zero the rest of it is temperature and that means that the air around you is vibrating slightly with temperature everything is in this tiny tiny but observable motiontemperature this is heat and frankly its bothersomebecause you can perceive it therefore you have to familiarize yourself with it and very shortly afterwards you come back and you can stand 986 and the difference is you could now stand 210 you see you could stand any of these temperatures but it requires refamiliarization and life is full of startling little surprises like this you see like stoves are coolred hot stove it can be cool it can be hot youre not quite sure what you can do in other words you never realized your potentials were as great as they are but you in your fondest imaginings thought they were much greater than they were you get the weird frame of mind in which you are you see furthermore your framework changes quite markedly on what life is all about and who you must fight and what you must contest and i think if you were to take somebody who was clear and try to convince him that he ought to declare war personally you see on the abaflubians or somebody like that dont you see it would just puzzle him end why he would start wondering about your sanity because it doesnt look sensible to him but at the same time he can give you solution to straighten it out you see the difference he can now give you solution that straightens out the thing you are trying to fight so then thered be reason to do something wild and incredible to it dont you see that would appear to be an overestimation of effort see something is running badly something is running badly well dont break it up or kick it you see because all you have to do is adjust this little whizargoo you know and the thing promptly starts running smoothly you can do an analysis of situations that before were just blank puzzles or total antagonisms now these various conditions are not as exclamatory when you first start turning clear theyre not as exclamatory and as huge as you would believe because theres quite few levels above this when you are on your road to ot its road of familiarity its road of getting acquainted with yourself you seethe way you were once and the way you are nowand fitting yourself into some sort of framework with relationship to existence trying to reconcile what has been going on in your life with what you are now and not really being able to think very straight about how confused you were its negative gain process and sometimes you dont realize how confused you were because of course that is erased so therefore its sometimes hard to understand why somebody else is confused i can see you now talking to somebody and this guy is saying but weve got to get the republicans back in power see and this guy keeps saying this and saying this trying to wrap your wits around it why does he want to get the republicans back in power theyre nutty too you find yourself working on how we would devise political system then that would solve the problems this individual apparently sees dont you see you try to find out what he is upset about and you eventually will come back to the fact that hes upset because hes not clear clear is not necessarily very tolerant state but its not very antagonistic state either but its certainly not negative state one is far more positive about things than he ever was before his reactions are far more vivid i mean im giving you terrible generality here you see im just trying to give you some sort of an idea but all im really trying to tell you is youre moving on upward and as you get processed and processed and move up the line you frankly have been moving into that state for some time as you get higher up the line you move into the state much faster you dont quite realize when you arrive at it its not fast borderline dont you see its not sharp thing but you sure know when the banks goneand that will be gone when youve run the last gpmthe last item in the last gpm therell be bank so dont make any mistake about the state is suddenly achieved by an amulet of raw asafedity asafetida which you put in your left hip pocket or something like this or the type of tobacco you chew dont you see that had nothing to do with it its totally mechanical proposition what you have to realize is thetan can become aberrated without being implanted or without having gpms and we have in scientology been long studying these mechanisms what really keeps him down and made him unable however were these gpms which are messedup gpmsgive him the wrong purposes and smash him so that he really cant have any purpose of his own all of his purposes are suppressed his own purposes are suppressed well when you start getting out into the open your own purposes start to show up and you begin to see what you would like to do not what your bank has been telling you you would like to do and you get completely clear perspective now in scientology we have run on this latter line we have actually been working with what thetan wants and we only fail when we dont continue to work with the thetan and that is to say when were dealing with people and so forth when we dont talk to them as another thetan and being you see when we start treating them totally as just reactive animal or something why then we start running into bit of trouble on the line because we arent recognizing that that person can get better and that person is just simply caved in by some stuff he doesnt want either all thetans want out and even the thetan who is fighting down here in an insane asylum and trying to slaughter every attendant that walks in the door and so forthhe still wants out hes just lost sight of what he is trying to get out of man is basically good and thats one of the reasons he has consented to have bank because then it prevents everybody else from being bad i think that is the most remarkable piece of philosophy ive ever heard of it is so farfetched that nobody would ever look for that as the philosophical fundamental back of the aberration of man you see because we figure man is bad and then we have to do something to make him good why then weve got him so reversed that we will never understand him in other words there is line of aberrationjust not to talk at random with youthere is line of aberration which thetan can get into and its mostly based on his own unfamiliarities or his decisions that he knows something when he doesnt know ithis decisions which are based on data these are the various liabilities and we have all of those in scientology and scientology is oddly enough built straight around the thetan and what might happen to thetan this is very curious dont you see because what was really wrong with the thetan was reactive bank and chain of gpms which gave him reverse purposes this really wasnt what was wrong with himthe fact is it was more fundamental than that he wasin an effort to keep other people good dont you see why he decided that himself and everybody else had better all agree to have bank that checked anyone from being bad and then he got this bank and its this bank which lies thereand by the way pictures and all the other things in dianetics and so forth just stack up on that bankand there that thing lies across the railroad track and he cant get anyplace with this much baggage and apparently immediately after he decided to have and make and carry on with such bank those various decisions put him into conditionthis is whats fantasticput him into condition where he couldnt conceive of how he had been so it was just cutoff see he cut off all familiarity with himself as he was the moment that he did this trick in other words it was something on the order of throwing guy in coal pit and then you try to explain to this fellow theres such thing as light well just few minutes before you threw him in the coal pit he knew there was such thing as light but after you threw him in the coal pit something convinced him there was such thing as light and you just start arguing with this chap almost in vain that there is such thing as light now its barrier of that type that made thetan unsalvageable if you did not know the whole trick you had to know all about this before you could salvage the individual you had to know why he was stacked up and so forth otherwise youd get downright impatient with him youre disseminating to this pcthis was raw meat seeand you are disseminating to the raw meat and you are telling the raw meat well you see youre reallyyoure really being who doesnt particularly need body and who is perfectly capable of operating you see and you dont have to have all those funny pictures you are carrying around and you oh he says ima animal called jones you see and you say but listen youre just you you see and youve gotyou got bunch of crosspurposes that keep you from functioning the way you ought to function not im just healthy and normal my psychologist told so you begin to wonder if you havent got cut line here or something of the sort you see you begin to be baffled its just like you would be explaining to this fellow in the coal pit well theres such thing as light you know and he said oh theres such thing as light there isnt any i know look you can prove it yourself look around do you see any light you say but man youre in coal pit guy says this is the place to be perfectly normal habitat well you frankly dont know whether to give up oror bat him one oryou see and numerous reactions are going to show up because your reality is being violated so as you come up the line your reality gets very easily violated and the higher you get the more your reality is susceptible to violation but fortunately the more capable you are of standing up to invalidation so that it doesnt mean anything to you for instance somebody gave today some data that was considered very important but it wasnt important at all and the only thing i was puzzled about was how come the data was considered important see but it was not important do you follow that but within that framework and so forth the datum could have seemed important you know like there is light thats an important datum you just say to this fellow well now look we can run out of your gpms we can get you trained up and we can take you up the track and we can get you trained up and we can get you knocked out here so your visio comes back and then we get out of this damn coal pit and ill show you some nice scenery dont you see well when he says ah youreyoure fooling youre just trying to trick im going to have the fdafbi arrest you because youre telling lies and so forth you can form very very interesting opinion of how evil man is and how nutty he is and you could even form the opinion that there were two types of thetansvery easy to do you know you could get lot of solutions to try to explain this but in actuality to handle it you would have to have the right one now where the individual is concerned then he improves on gradient as he goes on up the line and its vital that he does improve on gradient because his case gain must not outrun his capability of handling the new reality and frankly were so good well we invented comm system the other daycommmember system and the routing in that bulletin the routings are too good we finally found out what was wrong with themthey were too good well how could they be too good well because they instantly tried to go into the internal communication system when they just had to do with the external communications system of the organization and it was causing great deal of trouble because these routings had to be fended out of the organization do you understand because they were external routings they were routings to another org and staff members were so entranced with these routings that they promptly started routing internally and the bug on the line was communicator was saying but there is nobut there is duplicate post in the organization to use the routing on i looked it over for while and i suddenly realized there was duplicate posttheres your opposite number in any other department in the organization he of course could be handled by the same routing in other words you dont have to have the d of p melbourne to the d of p perth dont you see as the only routing there are other directors in the organization itself you see who could have the routing used on them in other words we had developed system which wasor i developed it take authorship on the thing i shouldnt keep saying weit confuses people sometimes its highly authorial we most of the time you know the old editors in the old south always used we dont you see and itsits the polite thing for an author to do so youll excuse anyway what happens in one of these instances is you develop system that is just for this and then if the system is too good it then embraces what it should embrace in other words it tries to expand its own perimeter and become what it should become we now have such an organization plot you only saw fragment of it the other day that is to say you saw the thing i just brought it out in very rough form its incomplete more or less what you saw dont you see but there were lots of things on it which hadnt been drawn in which you will see very shortly but if you start to go along the road to truth you reach makebreak point you reach the point beyond which you cant stop the truth see where we design these four little routings for the commmember systemwell of course theyre just dolls for the commmember system you see you just throw it in the communicators basket and bang itll wind up in the hands of your opposite number in some other organization theres nothing to that but the system is too good the organization already needs some type of nice routing system in which you put down on the top of your despatch and thats it it follows routing dont you see the communicator knows what it is you know what it is it winds up in the right basketbang you see its good fast routing what particularly intrigued people is the fact that they didnt have to do anything with some of their despatches that they got which were sent to them for information onlythat type of routing so you just toss despatch off toward joe dont you see well he doesnt have to do thing with it he just has to look at it oh well what do you know you know and it goes on to files do you see what i mean in other words hes not troubled by this thing on his communication line he can get rid of it somebody has said to say hello to him well his whole line is blocked up maybe with people who have said to say hello to him now if he has to turn around and answer each one of these things as despatch he goes practically mad dont you see so hes very cheerful that all these people said to say hello to him but hes now got the hellos what the hell does he do with the despatch well the commmember system solves this the proper routing just lets you dispose of the despatch with action on your part at all which is of course you shouldnt take any action on such thing it requires acknowledgment there is nothing there at all obviously needed and yet it was relegated to the commmember system only and when it was applied to the commmember system only staff membersseeing that that was vital and that it would speed up their lines and make things much easiertried to put it into the internal communication system of the organization thereby driving the communicator halfway around the bend because all she could do was reject these despatches when they werent comm member despatches see im just going over this point again to show you here in other words it was good system which was incompletely applied and good system which is incompletely applied will immediately try to apply itself and thats what weve done with scientology and i have seen this in the broader perimeter if im not active right now and im not reorganizing organizations right now well be in trouble well be in plenty of trouble we will simply cave in because if i did not totally devise the thingthe road to truth is one that you cant travel halfway if i didnt totally devise it and get it explicitparticularly at this pointit is being applied to the degree now where its release of such applications bring about bang appliance dont you see and weve hit the makebreak point here we are 15 years after the release of dianetics and were on the makebreak point here now what do you mean makebreak point well just short of the makebreak point youve got to force your way forward to make it go see its still hard work and just beyond the makebreak point it goes like mad its like thefriction if you push some object over the floor youll find the first little push on the thing the first push on the thing has to be pretty heavy to make it push dont you see but then you apply less and less energy to this thing the faster it moves you see it moves faster and youre actually pushing less did you ever have this happen with chair or box in other wordvery hard to start it moving right at the first thing but the second it started moving it sometimes surprised you by going too easy if anything see well were in that state right now im having to pilot this thing very close and tight because were at this makebreak point now if we released public book at this time it would simply cave us in we went too far with our membership pricing system because it was designed for public book and then i havent released the public book i havent released the public book because the organization has got to sit there to take care of the traffic how is it going to get people how is it going to get expansion how can it expand i already saw something like this happen in 1950 im not afraid of it but i also saw that it justit wasnt grooved and because it wasnt grooved it practically blew up in your face it just made so much of confusion it overworked everybody so hard that almost near chaos resulted now thats an interesting observation because we can press the boom buttons anytime we want all id have to do is write new public book and advertise it around someplace knowing what we know about interest and lines and so forth and this thing would all work like bang well actually we put in the membership discount system here just little bit prematurely because it was matched up to catch public book and then i had technicali actually had technical breakthrough and thats funny thing to have happen to your line to make sudden advance that was an unexpected advance which antiquated and outdated your planning but thats just exactly what occurred all of sudden undercut the case youve been running at 0 very successfullyhas couple of levels below him the cases that wouldnt run successfully in level 0 and those cases take you right straight out into raw meat they also take you right down to the bottom of the spinbin they take you anyplace there would be cases you see and im so close to the edge on well ive got one level below communications and ive got it mapped and taped its complete itd actually would empty out every insane asylum in the world but it isnt psycho process but i dont know whether you ought to be using it or not i dont know that yet the thing is fantastic as process level see but i now know there are twotheres level below it i know that theres at least one level below it that makes two levels below 0 i know theres another level there well auditing case on this below 0 process is walk in the park but weve done something very peculiar i dont know yetand this is what is stacking upi dont know yet that it wouldnt take levela class vi to run it its complete walk in the park you understand i mean you could see this thing oh you audit thiswhoa nothing to it sit there and yawn see the pcs needle just flies like madlike mad i dont think you could run it in coaudit the stuff that flies off the case flies off so fast and furious that youd have to be level vi to understand what was happening and i think out of pure terror or something of the sort if you put this particular proc i dont know these things you see if you put this process into coaudit or pe or something like this dont you seethe human being in front of you runs like startled gazelle hes not affected by this hes just getting better better better better better better better see and he gets up to point where hes at communication but hes getting better there is long way north to get to communications it was quite jump and when he does that jump i should think itd require very skilled auditor i think we found process whereby only an upper level auditor could run it on lower level person because it frankly applies to almost any case that youre having trouble with that wont get ta action its the nocasegain i was busy solving this case with justice and ethics and then all of sudden solved the case technically been studying the case quite while its quite surprising its the nocasegain what happens with this well of course then it didnt just take in cases you were having trouble with on enturbulation basis it took in cases that you just were having trouble with do you follow and it just went that far south now ive now got lowlevel process apparently which i dont know that i could trust it to the hands of guy who just walked in off the street and you put the two guys together and have one run it on the other one i think the one running it on the other one would just get his head blown off the case is getting fasta fast gain dont you see now i dont even know this pointi dont even know this yet i dont know that case wouldnt have to be audited quite ways to be run on this lowlevel process you say oh what the hell are you talking about its almost gag because frankly it would run on almost anybody if it were well run but it would have to be well run and itd have to be finished and its got some technical points in it which are quite startling the end of the process does not come at the end of 25 hours it comes when an exact state is reached by the case and you give about three more commands beyond that exact state and that is the end of the process and it wouldnt run any morei dont care what you did with itand thats liable to happen in two hours or 25 hours or 35 hours its going to be finite period these are the new conditions processes they havent been released there are three of those processes of which only one has been run that is to say only one has been released its release is very narrow but below conditions there isyou see there is communication then theres conditions below that and below that is existence now we tap sideways on existence when we use mimicry it shows somebody something exists there is california school teacher out there is mimicking childrens stuttering or something like that and the stuttering disappears either because its suppressed or because it blew or something im not quite sure why but the main thing here here is level heres this level called existence and that levelwere already reaching into the very tough casebut this level of existence undoubtedly reaches way out into the publicits your very resistive case these things have got to be adapted to dissemination and the existence of these levels make it very very hard i assure you to write the public book it should be quite obvious to you why itd be very hard to write public book youre sitting there looking at couple of brandnew tigers with which you dont have much experience yet and you know darned well that this public book is going to go like bomb its got to include those tigers and you dont know enough about those tigers yet to do anything with them see so of course youre not about to write public book you follow so that made our pricing policy and membership policy premature then that backs it up on the orgs dont you see now im probably going to give them some shocks in the next few days here on altering their course of existence it wont be an alter itll be cutback and well get them to get their organizational plan in and get things organized better and get their old signup line in so they dont have to learn new signup line too and let them carry forward little smoothly in other words i cut it just little bit too quick you understand just little bit too soon now we know with this experience on the thing and technical breakthrough technical breakthrough at raw meat level technical breakthrough at the insane asylum level technical breakthrough south and when two levels have shown up gratuitouslyi think thats all of them i wouldnt have said that about communications by the way i already knew there was the nocasegain case i already knew that there were some cases below this point dont you see but as far as i can plot it out there isnt anything else that will show up on plot that gives levels for those for lower actions except what weve already got person would have to recognize something about existence and weve seen this mysteriously occur when weve asked somebody to find something really real in roomand thats oneshot process the moment they have found something really real in the room they sometimes experience the most remarkable recovery you possibly know the old process look around here and find something thats really real to you ive seen some very remarkable things happen at that level well that is the level of existence thats where that process fitted in other words this process was wildcat it was wild one it was up in the upper technology and it shouldnt have beenit was way down here at the bottom technology basic auditing command might be are you you see something like that its probably familiarity without contact or communicationand without an awareness of what familiarity is arriving you get the shutoff because as youve gone south youve dropped orientation youve dropped perception youve dropped communication youve now dropped conditions and youre in existence now that existence must be without any of the other things now how do you audit it now that i can ask the question i can tell you because im experienced in handling if i can ask the question why habitually ill find out the answer will turn up ahead of out here in another 25 feet dont you see sometimes only two inches but sometimes its 25 feet i can ask the question see you know what is this level see what is this level called existence how would you audit something without understanding lets go up one seeunderstanding orientation perception communication or the recognition of condition now dropping all those things out of the auditing lineup what do we have left well i cant answer that at this particular instant but we will have the answer to that now the other thing that has happened on the way south is weve got an organizational plan thats just like this little comm member routing plan this organizational plan is the alldevouring monster you cant keep an organization out of it it hasnt been posted on the board at saint hill there have been few things released we have talked about it but nobody can keep this thing from going in you will find executives around here are using it this minute and they sometimes dont pull back and say hey there isnt you know distribution division yet or there isnt somethingorother yet or appointment has been made from that post and it suddenly feels sort of uhhrrrrr frustration you know ehhrrr ehhrrr they feel blocked well well do it some corny old way you knowwooufffapfffzz weve got an expansional organizational plan that is sitting up partially done on the drawing board which you saw in the last lecture people simply aware of this thing and its unlike any org board anybody ever saw before its whopping big magnet its justits just zup here we go it actually is trying to take the existing departments at saint hill at this moment and put them on it and i dont think it could be prevented i think if i never posted the org board executives one after the other would snarlingly say well its not been posted yet but you really are the qualifications division you better make up your mind who is the director of review you see because it works and one of the reasons it works is its the first parallelline org board that ever existed i think in this universe its parallelline org board not verticalline org board its in parallel and the very funny part of it is that it operates to the left and right and it doesnt operate up and down even though there are officers up it operates left and right it has very many peculiar characteristics one of them is is each repeating department as you go across the board from the left to the right will have nothing to do with the functions which follow it but includes all of the functions which precede it now thats the silliest thing you ever saw in your life try to squeeze into departmentcomfortablysome action which follows it on the org board to the right yeah youre having trouble every time youre having trouble somethings going to go wrong in other words you try to get into the orientation department something about understanding you see has it understanding well that has its own departmental functions but there we have understanding and the next one to it to the right would be purposes now lets put under understanding purposes in other words were going to have purposes before we had understanding in other words hehhhhhhh and so it works out organizationally if you try to put something about promotion under understandings why people will just sit around and understand that there should be some promotion and that would be the end of that do you follow therefore ive had to be very careful not to drop any of these functions and its been working with the org board which suddenly displayed that lower levels existed the thing is not an org board at all its philosophic machine to which an organization is easily adapted but then anything is easily adapted to this philosophic machine and here we are at this late state suddenly whipping out philosophic machine see and the machine is too good the development of the machine is derailing some of our intentions in other words actually what has happened is its pushed us forward on the track perhaps two or three years of development it gives us answers to questions that we have routinely had trouble with in the past such as personnel ill give you an idea what this machine does from the standpoint of personnel i just talk about it jokingly as the machine you see without any executive doing anything about it at all personnel come in and get hired and get put on the post you say but thatsthatsthatsthats very dangerous situation you just going to have anybody go to work thats right they can walk in the front door and sign their namethey go to work even if they make an x how are you going to do that well thats pretty easy you keep an ad out all the time that you hire people and we dont care what conditions we hire them under sometimes in some areas it will be for money sometimes on an applicant basis without pay for couple of weeks we keep this ad out any person that applies is simply put on purchase order which is sent to authorities for an okay on financial planning but its just okayed it really has nothing to do with financial planning but thats where its sent and it skids back down the line to the communicator and the communicator calls the person up and the person comes in and theyre given the po and theyre routed through an emeter check point and given slip to sign which is the fact that they agree to their terms of employment which is about all and then theyre routed to the department head that has the allocation it sounds very dizzy doesnt it and at the end of two weeks they are sent to qualifications in review because when they walked in they were also given staff hat and when their department head receives despatch that they are to go to review the department head simply gives them little chit on the same chit and he just says whether he wants them or he doesnt want them thats all and they disappear out of his view they go over to review review examines themvery rapidlymaybe now gives them their oca and apa and maybe does somethingorother with them but theyre equipped to handle people masse dont you see they can give tests of various kinds well this person passed his tests maybe they even gave him little check on his staff member hat you see they made an examination of this person weve now got two weeks of experience with this person in the meantime whether that person has followed orders or done their job or not is the subject of different report system in the organizationagain which has nothing to do with any executive in the organization so review has all this data on this person now its been accumulated and review can now okay this person or give this person the deep six but we dont just give the person the deep six because the truth of the matter is he never leaves the organization he remains an applicant you understand weve wiped out thing called dismissal apparently the only way to get dismissed from scientology organization is to become ot now lets see the immediate effect that this sort of thing happenslets follow this through blitz receiveshes reading the paper and he sees that them scientologists or them sintologists is advisin ferfer people to come and work at em and so he comeshe phones up you still got job open im aim good laborer do you still got job open and the communicator is not looking for any post at all see theyre just looking for any application and she says oh yes whats your name blitz all right initials thank you very much what is your address you got phone can you be reached by phone thank you very much we will let you know in day or so and he says what interview well well take care of all that in day or so thank you and day or so he receives phone call and he said yes you can come to work again decisionno judgment on it at all just you can come to work and the guy comes to work and hes taken along the line and hes given the po and just routedlike despatch and hes given po hes given the po and he goes through and they put him on an emeter whats that thing well nothing and they just take him off the emeter there werent any questions they just read the tone armthe only thing that could reject him and then the boy who did that says well sign here and what is it well lets say hes taken on as temporary its your wage for the first week and this is what wage youre on youre going to be on temporary status and your position has to be reviewed in couple of weeks okay thats fine he says couple of weeks later hes busy out digging the garden somebody comes up to him and says youre supposed to report to qualifications and so forth to see whether or not you become upgraded and kept on and so forth well thats about time so he walks over there and they ask him bunch of questions and then they tell him that he has got to improve his employability before he can be taken on and hes shunted through into review and review tells him exactly how to improve his employability straightens him up like startled gazelle and shoots him out into the public but he has not been dismissed from the organization he is simply waiting to do that they also call the labor exchange to see if they cant get him onto other employment right away in other words they take care of this personnel see arc breaks because this boy was dismissed you seebecause he hasnt been he was told he needs some more preparation before he can have this job and of course hes never had anybody take any real interest in him before whether he ever had job or not well he considers this pretty interesting and he doesnt get job for few days and he comes back and he says hes not able to get job or this area doesnt have national assistance or something of the sort dont you see well review has displaced persons section in it they can hand out meal tickets they can hand out all the things that youd hand out to somebody in distress they can give you money enough for cable for postage stamps they take care of people dont you seeon the little ofthe people that get into sudden binds and emergencies and that sort of thing they issue this kind of stuff they take care of this person now you can coax that person up the line they can send that person to pe course they can make sure that he gets into coaudit they can do this they can do that they can give him something to study they have got him in their files you need sudden crush along the lines of laborers well this persons advance and so forth has been reported you look him up in the files you find out youve got two or three of these boys you simply call them back on from an applicant status move them back onto this time provisional status and they will be with youthey can be with you year at which time they are made permanent now thats an interesting lineup to have happen on employment and you say what the hell are you talking about manyoure going to have an organization with thousands of members thats right because the only way the machine wont workif somebody wont hire people for it thats an incredible fact if you fill none of the posts it wont work about the only way you could keep it from working and it would just go on and work now its promotional lines are very clean and clear the funny part of it is that its employment is one of the heaviest promotional lines that london had years ago london had beautiful promotional lines and theyd try to put on typists and wind up with the person moving into the hca london in vain for years tried to have nonscientology staff and it never made it that is because they were teaching all the basic and elementary things that would take person up from raw meat into becoming scientologist and they seldom missed and it frankly is quite procurement line if you looked on it just from that point of view you would find out it would turn into procurement line now an industry starts getting to look at this machine dont think they arent going to send somebody over well that costs some money the same thingthe exact same thing happensbut you dont call the guy an applicantyou call him an intern it costs somebody money for him to do this you understand audience mmhm i know it sounds dazing when you first look at it because it seems to be shuffle of this and that and you say thats an awful lot of bureaucracy and so forth it isnt bureaucracy because the lines are all designed to flow the lines are designed to flow if theres anything comes near the machine it flows it doesnt stop it flows and it has just one job as an organizational setup and thats so to change people for the better and thats all its doing so of course anything that comes near it gets changed for the better whether it agrees or not the alldevouring monster whats interesting about this type of thing though is i early detected this tendency on the part of this new organizational structure and i had to shift the emphasis of the forward line of approach i had to change it slightly because i saw that it was going to get advanced faster than i had intended it to advance originally i was working too good see so id have to refine the line in few places where we had already begun off in another track thinking there was another prediction line we got to get the machine in before we can release the field staff member program have you heard of the field staff member program youve heard of that havent you audience mmmm you havent gee where have you been youve been on course thats what well all the auditors that were ever trained are now going to be staff members there are more private auditors that finishes it now this hasnt official release because it gets released in the auditor we were just waiting for the day when we were technically flying high see until we did this they have just been on wait so in very short order as soon as that auditor is released in couple of weeks and so forth youll be provisional field staff member and your pay on the thing is simply the 10 percent of the fee of the person you send in because ive spotted the one thing that you can do absolutely fatal that will finish you as an auditor it is the same thing which i tried to do and almost finished i was smart enough to get an organization to back up i found out that an individual auditor or two or three auditors sitting around in the field will go for short length of time with wild burst of enthusiasm and then fall on their heads because they havent got any business pinning themselves down by processing anybody theyve got business at all you can give somebody an assist you can cheer them up you can handle the family you can do this and that and so forth but as far as going into thing called private practice it must be wrong because the medical profession uses it and is failing it must be wrong see all right so therefore if youre part of an organization you would only have to be part of the organization to the degree the organization is wide open for paying you on this basis you just pick up pcs and send them into the organization the organization instantly turns around and sends you 10 percent of the pc thats all whatever fee they collect they give you 10 percent of the feebang immediately well that means you could whip up quite pe couldnt you you could tag people left right and center without the liability of having to process them now it takes quite team to process pcsto handle and administer things and handle the rough spots it takes quite team to pull psycho off of your neck that some family has wrapped around it it takes quite team and that team is possible in an organization but is not possible in individual practice i learned that the hard way and ive gone over this with very fine look the field in general and that is said advisedly was reviewed once and found out that they mostly wanted to be members of the organization they wanted to be part of scientology and the arc break in the london academy at the rising prices reported to after research to be that all they were getting trained for anyhow was so that they could become members of the organization so they didnt feel they ought to be charged such high prices for it and that was the source of the arc break the rest of the communication might interest you is their instructors are all class vi saint hill and they adore them and they just keep on taking course after course after course anyway so what happens to somebody well he can scrounge up pcs or he can give pes or he can give talks or he and two or three other auditors can go around and talk to people about this well now this was hard to do few years ago or even year ago supposing you had technology that anybody you tagged immediately became scientologist you had to apply certain dissemination technology and the person you talked to if he could talk at all immediately wanted some more scientology supposing that didnt take you very long well thats quite interesting because that technology exists as of this minute see its been in existence for two or three weeks i havent got time to write down everything that has got to be written down to square this up so some of these things dont get released at the instant theyre dreamed up but there is system by which this can be done its rather easy drill itd take you few hours to learn this drill and down to fine feathered frenzy the person who flashes in your face the person who says what is scientology what is this stuff blahhehheh i understand youre scientologist boy hes just bait hes just bait hes just bait he has announced himself aboard with this technology man hes resisting and protesting thats all you need in other words we had to figure out this item called salesmanship now when we go down low on processing levels were going to tag people with that wild abandon we have that much command or control of to whom we speak we certainly had better have the technology very desperately and definitely in line to handle case once it appears and wed better not miss on this one so as soon as i got this other dissemination data i started going south and making sure we had that all neated up and found there were two more levels which we could handle them with well it wouldnt matter who walked into the organization it just wouldnt matter who walked into the organization if its going to be up to the field staff member or you to send in anybody that you tag then the organization had better be capable of handling in the first three minutes of play anything that is sent otherwise there would be jam there dont you see field staff member will be in continuous troublecontinuous continuous troublebecause he is sending in psychos or somebody in the organization is saying so anyhow youve got to wipe out that as an argument dont you see that has got to be gone not by simply postulate gone it has got to be gone technically so this person slides into the organization caroming against both doors dead drunk been an alcoholic for years skid row special and so forth well the guy whos right there in the hgc doing the technical work whos in thewhat would be the department of estimationguy just looks at this boy and says well thats it and theres an auditor in room soand so and well theres the cashier and so forth in room soandso youll find the auditor pilots him down the line routes him in weve got to have nonalcoholic on our hands in few hours you understand whether he was drunk being processed or not see this is what it really demands in extremis now that would be the total demand now how well that can be met and so forth is horse of another color theyd probably develop technology by which he is made to sober up they dont let him communicate to anybody for day or two till he kind of steams out because ifs easier to do and he wakes up and says where am i you are in an auditing room here is the first auditing command all right to handle things of that particular character requires that you have considerable command of mest and space and buildings and youve got to be able to acquire these things fairly rapidly you have to have good command in your community so the organization has got to get up fairly rapidly and there will undoubtedly be point of struggle of the organization trying to get up to speed and trying to get squared around so that it can get into this kind of condition now the field staff member is provisional grade all you have to do is write to your nearest organization and say i accept the appointment of field staff member because you are being appointedits just up to you to accept it technical detail and you get an immediate appointment as field staff member provisional and thats field staff member provisional and there you are with staff member rating with the privileges of provisionalwhich are considerable by the way theyre up above intern applicant and so forth and now youthe method by which you operate and you go about it from there if you know any pcs around that are giving you hard time well send them into the organization see and if you know any students why send them into the organization if you are running center why just give pes like crazy and send them into the organization stand by because you are going to be tapped on the shoulder to be new organization for that organization very soon do you follow that in other words center is nucleus organization and if it even moves vaguely in the direction of an org board or anything and so forth itll wrap up into becoming an organization so fast you wont know what happened to it dont you see little organization should basically devote its time totally to pe promotion taking care of contact work of this particular kind youll find it quite remunerativeprobably far more remunerative than doing it themselves dont you see just do promotional line promotional line now in the first place as time goes on this will get much easier because there will be public book dissemination drills will be more broadly known and the public book coming out all of its addresses will be available because you are staff member in other words youre not being asked to talk to or write or meet or something people who are unknown the point is that youve got tailormade audience and it is shoved straight towards you well you are given about 150 cards and all these people bought book and theyre probably sitting around wondering what to do next and so on well all you have to do is tap them and you say this is what you do next and the route is all figured out and you get paid for doing it quite adequately now your field staff member of course is bona fide staff member at the end of about 10 months or something like that why he ought to apply to the organization to have the provisional status removed and he becomes general staff member of the organization the chances of anybody remaining outside the machine very long if they are trained technician are quite remote the way this would go you would have tremendous demands well youd be getting nagged all the time about why dont you come in and take over as director of field activities or something or why dont you come on tech staff and why dont you do this because these organizations are going to get desperate theyre going to get desperate for personnel and we havent got enough personnel thats why weve got to open up our personnel lineswidely and youll find out tremendous quantity of raw meat will be working in our organizations where its just been little scientology club in some places i see somebody knows of some the main point is is the appointment is made nobody is shoving it down your throats you have to accept the appointment and write in and say you do and it doesnt change your other activities even vaguely there is this kind of clause connected with it which is quite interesting is you would be field staff members of saint hill that would be your point of operation as staff member see youd be saint hill staff member and while saint hill staff member you could also be on another organizational staff you see you could be something like you could be d of p of let us say washington and field staff member saint hill well the trick of the field staff member is to select people for clearing and thats what he is doing hes trying to select people out of the society and send them in to straighten up there are many things that he can offer in this particular wise if as field staff member of washington you selected somebody to go to saint hill the percentage would be paid to washington as an organization so everybody could share in your selection but if you were operating independently and so forth and not as member of another organization as field staff member of saint hill you would simply get 10 percent of whatever fee was paid in here as result of your selecting people to here the game is simply very easy game its just matter of selecting people to be cleared thats all and you give them selection slip the administration of it is very easy you give them selection slip actually the administration can be this rawboned you give them selection slip that has your name and address on it and tell them to be sure to present that to the registrar or cashier at saint hill thats all and this will let them in now you of course can put piece of carbon paper under that and probably should and keep copy for yourself and undoubtedly should put another piece of carbon paper under it and send copy to central files saint hill that makes it neat but nevertheless youll still find yourself with nothing to write on but napkin and thats perfectly good selection paper in other words its not fragile proceeding now that means that you would be free to select anybody for training or processing now itd only be possible for you to select people for saint hill who of coursefor training who were already trained auditors but you could select pcsany type of pcfor saint hill we normally would get the roughest onesif i know anything about it the organization gets the rough ones and the biggest organization or the best organization gets the roughest ones see and the hgc here would be wide open for the selection of pcs the new gradation program calls for the road to clear simply get processed up to grade iv and then shift overwhatever the grade numbers areand then shift over to training and as release to be trained up through training and then go on out through the top on solo this is very simple thing to explain its very simple thing to map you just tell some individual well you get audited up through your grades and then you get trained through these levels which are the same as the grades but now you know how to do it and then you get up to the top end of this and you reach the state of clear through that particular road how long does this take actually it takes two years and two months of steady application well how many years does that mean well it all depends on you but it would probably take five or ten years or something like that with the present technology in other words this can probably be shortened too and will undoubtedly be shortened here and there because as processes are grooved in more solidly it may not take that long to get grade certificate you see it might not take three or four intensives to get grade certificate we might be able to wrap one up sooner also it might very well be that if person were release and in pretty shininggood shape before they started to be trained at all they would go through the training very much more rapidly and theyd only have to have the experience of processing somebody naturally thats where your review body of applicants comes in youve got to have review body of applicants for students to practice on so this thing all crossworks in various ways and that road to clear is one that the people have wanted to follow and it is the one that you want to follow well its onlymy job is to make it as easy as possible as fast as possible and to find out what are the snags on the road and get those snags removed and move them on up the line one of the snags on the road of course is economics youll find that some people dont have any money and so on well there is an oddity an oddity little review which is going on is particularly with some of the new processes as they are applied are actually returning more earning power to the individual processed than the individual spent for the processing in other words he made more money than he spent on the processing in other words it was profitable to be processed at fairly high rate you see thats quite interesting you say well how would anybody do that well i dont know how does anybody live at all in the wog world but they do experience various increases they go up in jobs ratings responsibility areas and so on fairly fast it has been road that has not been particularly open because we didnt have the grades in exact lineup and it was hard to get an individual up to an exact state well each one of these grades now has state to get the individual up to and youve been having some fun with these things lately but actually at the present moment you have only one grade which is totally written up and in shape now dont become alarmed because person can only be examined on the processes which he has been trained in and also checksheet cant be changed in progress that is to say when youre on checksheet it cant be changed till you are off of it the next student coming right in behind youthese are the new regulations ive been working pretty hard on this trying to smooth the road for youthe student coming in right behind you might be handed an entirely different checksheet for the same grade but that wouldnt influence your checksheet one iota nor would there be anything added to your checksheet while you were going through the grade even though new bulletins existed on the subject for your own benefit you probably would care to read those new bulletins or something of that sort but it nevertheless wouldnt impede your attaining your level and it also wouldnt impede for moment your being able to claim the level as yours you see because there is another policy on the thing is you cant be retrained for level which you have already attained those policies already exist very often people do not inform you of what the policies are you basically sometimes see breakdown where you think there is breakdown because just nobody has told you what the policy is on this particular thing you see it has not been custom to broadly issue central organization policies to people or training policies to people this has not been custom for one of the reasons why is it was too expensive to do all that mimeographing and another thing organizations were in formative state and there was particular way to formalize this and finalize the issue of it within year or so youre going to see what you call hat books the divisional hat books which contain every policy there is in the shop and those are fixed with loose leaf binder type of arrangement so that little clipbook can be issued to you and you can snap it into that particular divisional hat book and you will know what all the policies are in that theres great deal more to the administrative technology of scientology than the usual auditor has ever really known for instance this business about that youre being trained on course right now which is covered by policy there are very many policies and two or three of those policies were recently violated and you saw blowing the roof off around here probably was great mystery to you about why i was getting so excited about something or other well you see snarl on the board dont you see but its just that policy or something has slipped dont you see or new policy is desperately needed for this particular line to straighten out the thing and to let it go but there are various policies one of those things is that student cannot be retrained for the level he has already studied on you cant retrain student for something he has already got dont you see now the only reason under gods green earth that you are in training at this particular moment at these lower levels is they didnt exist when you were trained and there was gradation where you were now exactly how you fit somebody in who shows up here as perfectly valid class iii grade iii personwell that becomes little rough piece of policy because supposing that some part of this wasnt done well dont you see something like this didnt happen well well this is review situation and its merely review situation for the protection of the individual but somewhere up the line here in very short space of time youre going to see the courses dropping out of the bottom at saint hill in other words these courses at the bottom are going to start turning up missing and the only reason that the saint hill course is at the state it is in right now is because the broad training of the scientologist has not been standardized in the field so therefore we have to train him all over again and we make better auditors for doing so but it is very funny thing the saint hill course began originally only for one reason and that was to improve training in the field and we have pretty well made that grade and people who are coming in here trained are trained pretty darned well im very proud of the way they are done in other words saint hillers have gone out taken over training facilities which is exactly the way i planned it some years ago and all i was interested in doing was showing them how to train and showing them basic fundamentals of auditing they went out they took over academies and so forth academies improved and improved then the people who started coming into saint hill could audit better then we could upgrade the auditing here dont you see but then you going out youre going to improve those academies even more and the next thing you know because youve been through these various courses at these various levels you sure know how level course is supposed to be trained and along about that space of time why it is not any longer going to be necessary dont you see to teach that level thats what we are fighting for soon as we can get that straightened out were all set people will come to saint hill for vi and thatll be that and then about 1948 well get rid of vi see well get rid of that at saint hill too because that will be well taught out in the field by that time see toward the end of 1948 i imagine you will see most continental organizations teaching vi now where do we go from there female voice 1968 we havent run out of anything dont worry but ill tell you very frankly very frankly there are something likethere are at least 12 levels above vi and saint hill will be teaching those do you follow this is how were picking up man by his bootstraps this is the plan on which youre operating if very often you dont understand particularly how this goes together particularly if youre not on central org intimate line whereby its being engaged in we sometimes make slip and miss and we try to straighten it out as fast as we can and so on were dealing with living beings we are not making coke or iron or toys you see and dealing with living beings requires an entirely different operating structure and man has never tried to deal with them before so he is complete infant so weve got to feel our way all the way along the way and we are doing things of course man has never done before and were just making it just fine and one of the reasons we are making it just fine is because you are doing well and you are carrying on and you are doing fine so thank you very much
