classified by ambassador k eikenberry reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary president karzai reiterated to admiral mullen and ambassador eikenberry on december 14 his commitment to afghan national security forces ansf development interior ministry moi reform and to obtaining sufficient security force recruits and training although karzais reported cabinet picks appear generally positive he is still considering ismail khan for energy and water he told us that few months delay in the 2010 parliamentary elections is necessary and that he is considering holding loya jirga afterwards end summary karzai focused on ansf 2 s in meeting with chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral mullen ambassador eikenberry defense minister wardak presidential chief of staff daudzai national security advisor rassoul deputy national security advisor shaydah presidential press spokesperson houmanzada and afghan national army chief of staff bismillah khan on december 14 president karzai appeared relaxed although admittedly tired and in need of vacation karzai said he planned to take three or four days vacation in europe between conferences in london munich and davos he appeared more helpful and committed to ansf development than ever expressing interest in obtaining sufficient recruits to reflect geographic and ethnic balances and commitment to establishing training timeline 3 s defense minister wardak said army recruitment was improving last months return of 873 formerly awol soldiers to their units was promising sign admiral mullen noted that the 2011 drawdown date was not political decision but rather us military recommendation karzai said that if the afghan government was over half way to the 2011 ansf recruitment and training goals it would be success comment although karzai was clearly attempting to manage expectations he also seemed to be personally vested in this endeavor positive and relatively new development end comment karzai said he will have his defense minister and chief of defense on the road frequently to ensure this project moved forward 4 s karzai inquired whether ansf expansion would include only an increase in training or also an increase in more sophisticated military equipment for afghan internal defense admiral mullen said the united states would continue to equip the afghan forces for counterinsurgency operations since the territorial defense was not currently priority especially considering the us strategic defense relationship with afghanistan wardak further noted that more heavy weapons were need for the ana over time to increase their capability to defend themselves and could also be used to fight the taliban admiral mullen responded that afghanistans military requirements will naturally evolve over time but emphasized that heavy weaponry was not needed at present 5 s ambassador eikenberry mentioned how successful the 2003 ministry of defense mod reform was to this institution noting that the 2006 moi reform was neither as comprehensive nor as successful president karzai agreed and noted characteristically that this was due to the failures of unama the united states and the eu when eikenberry noted the serious problems in the senior moi leadership karzai acknowledged this was also an important issue he preferred however to work on moi reform with the united states not the eu or unama nonus nato troops can stay home 6 s karzai asked if the other nato countries were committed to sending 7000 nonus nato troops and if so would those numbers be several contributions of 100200 troops or larger commitments by fewer countries he remarked that if the commitments are small contingents from many nations it would be more of headache he quipped that if these countries only announced their plan to deploy additional troops without actually sending them it would be easier admiral mullen noted the political significance of these troop commitments despite the challenges they might entail admiral mullen asked karzai for his assessment of nato isaf efforts to limit civilian casualties karzai responded that general mcchrystal was doing an excellent job kabul 00004027 002 of 003 with his instructions to limit civilian casualties because of the emphasis he placed on restricting the use of aerial bombardments however he said more needed to be done with the special operations troops noting recent reports from laghman province of civilian casualties during two separate operations skepticism on pakistan 7 s karzai expressed concern over pakistan noting that the taliban may decide to lay low there until 2011 admiral mullen replied that if the taliban decided to give that security space to the afghans it would be to our advantage as it would allow time for the ansf and security to be built up sufficiently to defend themselves karzai appeared to accept this answer ambassador eikenberry emphasized that the united states shared afghan concerns over pakistan providing sanctuary to the afghan taliban but noted pakistani foreign minister qureshi had stated publicly at the recent iiss manama dialogue in bahrain that there was an afghanpakistani taliban nexus possible signal of an evolution in their thinking he also stated however that pakistan was focused at present on its greater threat the pakistan taliban minister wardak said he had received contrary reports that the pakistani army was helping the afghan taliban obtain sanctuary in cities deeper into pakistan cabinet selections 8 s president karzai told eikenberry after admiral mullens departure with fm spanta and nsc rassoul in attendance that he still had date for his cabinet announcement but that he had asked the parliament to remain in session for the time being he plans on giving parliament about 75 percent of the cabinet list and expects parliamentary support for almost all of his nominations he said the national security ministers would stay on reftel as well as the finance commerce communications agriculture and health ministers 9 s karzai said the current higher education minister dafur would be replaced by the current governor of kabul zabihollah mojadedi or an unnamed senior university official education minister wardak would move to the palaces office of administrative affairs oaa while mrrd zia would be given an ambassadorship and his deputy wais ahmad barmak would replace him he said he would appoint technically qualified individual as the minister of mines and that nangarhar governor gul agha sherzai would be given position involving the construction of roads in urban areas note it was unclear whether this would be urban planning or new position end note karzai said the ministry of public works would go to qualified engineer with masters degree from prestigious us university while transportation would go to junbesh partys batash rumored to be dostum ally 10 s karzai invited the groups views on placing commerce minister shahrani in the ministry of mines spantas endorsement was lukewarm ambassador eikenberry noted shahranis extravagant home suggesting that the afghans knew best who is corrupt concern karzai shared karzai claimed he would split the ministry of information and culture into just the ministry of culture and downgrade information responsibilities to an agency he said he wanted spanta to stay on but spanta said he was not interested in cabinetlevel position karzai said jalali was possible choice for nsa but claimed that he insisted on keeping his 13000month national defense university salary eikenberry responded that if this were the case it hardly seemed like sign of patriotism karzai said atmar was politically hanging on by thread because he was highly disliked for his former communist and excessively propashtun reputation 11 s karzai said ismail khan was still his choice for minister of energy claiming that secretary clinton agreed to compromise after karzai promised to keep atmar and appoint competent deputy ministers under khan ambassador eikenberry countered that secretary clinton did not endorse khan underscoring that the united states has indicated that energy and water is key us development priority and that our policy was not to invest in ministries not competently led eikenberry added that during his congressional testimony all members of the us congress expressed great concern over the longterm costs of afghanistan especially during the current financial crisis kabul 00004027 003 of 003 if incompetent and corrupt ministers were appointed it would provide good reason for them to limit funding the ambassador urged karzai to consider the tradeoffs and make decision on what would most benefit the afghan people and their economic future he should worry less about pleasing political factions or foreigners and more on the objective longterm interests of his citizens karzai said he would further consider this choice 2010 elections 12 s karzai mentioned that the 2010 district council elections could be postponed past 2010 but the parliamentary elections should only be delayed three to four months in response to the ambassadors concerns about addressing the unsustainable electoral calendar that would eventually bankrupt the afghan government karzai replied that he would like to hold loya jirga sometime in the fall of 2010 to resolve these constitutional issues he referred to conspiracy theories he had heard about the international communitys intentions in delaying the elections that eikenberry flatly rejected the ambassador said the afghans would have to make the decision whether to delay the elections or not 13 admiral mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff did not clear this cable eikenberry
