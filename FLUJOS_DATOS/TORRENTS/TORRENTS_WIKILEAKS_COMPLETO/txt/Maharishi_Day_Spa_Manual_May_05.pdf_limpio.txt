cancellation policy authorization form equipment and supplies prices and suppliers distributors maharishi vedic health spas maharishi day spas introduction day spa concept in order to immediately offer to the public our wellness and rejuvenation programs which will eventually be offered in our peace palaces we will be opening day spas in hotels malls shopping centers office space or in rented house that is zoned for commercial use 2 our day spas will not function as medical facilities doctor or vaidya will not be involved with our day spas guests will select their own treatments from menu of spa treatments that are beneficial for all body types invasive treatments such as nasya and basti will not be offered in the context of our day spas all those with more serious health concerns should be referred to our two maharishi vedic health centers at the raj and lancaster ma legal entity the global country of world peace will be the entity renting the day spa facility mved maharishi vedic education development corp will be the entity taking in revenue and hiring employees leasing space for the day spa before signing any rental agreement or contract please read the section on local zoning and codes hotel space there are two options for our day spa space in hotel setting one is to lease the already existing spa facility within hotel the other is to simply rent hotel rooms and convert them to treatment rooms we want to negotiate as low price as possible for our hotel space the following points will be useful in our negotiations 1 since spas are now popular amenities in hotels those hotels that do not have spa might be happy to have us come in and create one for them the fact that the hotel could have spa amenity without having to invest their own money may inspire them to give us the space for free or at greatly discounted price 2 because we have famous destination spas lancaster maharishi vedic health center and the raj maharishi vedic health center hotel guests will recognize our name as high quality spa this will reflect well on the hotel be sure to have the hotel management go to our websites wwwlancasterhealthcom and wwwtherajcom 3 we can provide additional services for their hotel guests such as lectures on executive health to their corporate conference clients 4 we can also help promote business in the hotel restaurant by encouraging our spa guests to enjoy spa lunch before or after their treatments when you are negotiating the lease contract be sure to emphasize all these points three to five hotel rooms would provide basic minimal day spa those three to five rooms would include 23 treatment rooms 1 office storage room and 1 reception waiting area where books knowledge and mapi herbs can be displayed the last two rooms could be combined for larger day spa 3 operation we would just add more treatments rooms we can start out with few rooms and then take more hotel rooms as business increases the size of the treatment rooms should be minimum of 9 feet by 12 feet we prefer smaller hotel rooms rather than large spacious hotel rooms it would also be ideal if the treatment rooms were all next to each other in quiet area and if the windows in each room could be opened onceaday cleaning service should be included in the lease price of the rooms other possible rental facilities for day spa include 1 mall space shopping centers lifestyle centers since malls can be very expensive we could take very small space with excellent exposure and use that space as our reception area the space in which we actually give treatment could be located elsewhere in less visible less expensive area of the mallsometimes there is space where the public rarely goes 2 rented house or apartment is also possibility with house or an apartment we have private bathrooms and showers but zoning would need to be commercial zoning 3 office space could also work ideally we would want our own bathrooms and shower facilities in whatever space we have there are ways in which we could provide some of our day spa treatments without shower facilities if we had other options please note that for day spa we do not need kitchen nor do we need washerdryer we do need access to utility sink in which equipment and pots can be washed local zoning and codes and rules and regulations regarding massage and facials before signing any rental agreement or contract please verify that the property has proper zoning to allow day spa activities zoning rules can vary greatly within city so be sure to get this information for each property under consideration be sure to check with the code enforcement officer at your local police station they will inform you of all codes which you must meet and all licenses which you must obtain in order to open day spa these could include zoning fire codes health codes massage establishment license business license we will need to register our corporation with the secretary of state and thereby receive an employer id also known as an ein the required employment of licensed massage therapists for all body work and licensed aesthetician for facials 4 workmans compensation insurance most likely this will be taken care of by mved general and professional liability insurance mved will provide general liability insurance once you inform the raja domain administrative office charlie in lexington we will ask the lmts to have their own professional liability insurance staff day spa can be started with minimum of 1 full time general manager 4 fulltime technicians 2 men and 2 ladies for the 8 am to 3 pm shift 4 full time technicians 2 men and 2 ladies for the 3 pm to 8 pm shift more technicians will be needed if you are open 7 days week see section on hiring and training technicians cleaning service if not provided by hotel outside laundry service the outside laundry service is necessary because of the fire hazar d involved in washing drying and storing oily linen this minimal staff requirement would be adequate in start up situation the day spa staff could in time expand as needed hiring and training technicians because many states require those giving massage to be licensed massage therapists we may need to hire nonmeditators as our technicians it should be easy to find licensed massage therapists by posting notice at local massage schools the following are some basic points to consider when hiring technicians hiring licensed massage therapists should meet the following qualifications previous experience giving ayurveda treatments unless maharishi ayurveda previous experience with reiki is ideal but if they are willing to stop practicing it we could consider them good hygiene nice appearance friendly simple willing to sign noncompete nondisclosure agreement while we cannot make learning tm job requirement it would be good if they learned tm we require that all lmts that we hire have their own professional liability insurance important policy to disclose to all applicants 5 we want to inform all applicants that our policy is that men provide massage for men guests and ladies provide massage for our lady guests this is important for the applicants to know because it will impact the amount of work man technician will have versus lady since more ladies frequent spas than men it could be that our lady lmts will be given more work and therefore will receive more gratuity than the male lmts it is important to tell them now so that this does not become an issue later wages we want to hire our technicians full time for 30 hours week 15 hr or less do not feel that you need to offer the going rate most lmts are so enthusiastic about being involved with such profound knowledge that they are willing to take less than what other beautysalon spas are offering them remember that beautysalon spas make up the majority of job opportunities available to lmts the lmts are thrilled to be involved with us and appreciate our need to reduce our expenses in our start up phase training when you are ready to begin training your lmts please request training materials and schedule from the healthspaofficeaolcom creating day spa environment flooring in the case that we are renting hotel rooms for our day spa one flooring option would be to have the carpet in the room removed and stored in that way we can put down an in expensive vinyl flooring or carpeting that could be removed when we move our spa into our peace palace at that point the hotel could reinstall the original carpet we could also cover the existing carpet with plastic and then cover that with an inexpensive indooroutdoor carpet from menards or home depot this has been tried before and works very well and is very simple and inexpensive you can also use inexpensive area rugs on top of vinyl or on top of carpet the area rugs can be removed and shampooed frequently and replaced easily while carpet does seem less practical and more difficult to keep clean it provides warmer cozier feeling than vinyl flooring be sure to put plastic under the area rug if the area rug sits on top of carpeting in order to keep the underlying carpet from getting oily we just noticed in the sky mall catalogue 18007596255 or wwwskymallcom there is nice product that can be rolled onto your garage to save it from oil it 6 was quite inexpensive and could be used for our purposes the name of the item is car pad and comes in several sizes from 74 x 14 item 255811a 119 to 9 x 22 item 2255816a 199 with other choices in between these sizes this pad could be used over existing carpeting or any other type of floor lighting sconces with low wattage light bulbs or floor lamps with low wattage light bulbs create quiet settled feeling ambiance war m

instructions for abyhanga table assembly instructions for wege pk table and system burner cleaning it is essential to the proper functioning and safety of your burners that they be cleaned after each treatment oil left on and around the heating element creates serious fire hazar d cleaning procedure after each pizi or shiro thoroughly wipe the oil off of the burner element it is best to do this before you begin cleaning the table because it allows time to heat the element to burn off any oil residue left after thoroughly wiping the element with towel turn burner on high and open window if necessary to allow smoke to leave the room close the treatment room door if there are smoke alarms outside of the treatment room after the oil is burned off turn the burner off never leave the

smaller pump for shirodhara has not yet been located 3 techs may prefer to give the shiro treatment manually 4 as soon as supplier is found for the appropriate pump you will be informed if you locate the appropriate pump please inform finlay at the raj 515 4729580 ext 469 13 pizichili setup 1 place pizi oil in 2 gallon stainless pan fill within 2 of top 2 place vegetable steamer with the legs removed in the bottom of above pan it is critical that the steamer be used at all times to avoid destroying your pizi pump preheat oil to approximately 1100 f place the pan on the burner 3 clamp the hose assembly and pump together by placing the pump on the floor with the male adapter toward you take the hose assembly and connect it to the pump the adjusting valve on the gas fitting should be facing toward you 4 grasp the assembly just above the gas valve and place the pump in the oil be sure that oil level is low enough to prevent oil from overflowing when pump is submersed in the oil 5 slide the pan and burner under the stainless steel funnel and hook hoses on appropriate locations on table 6 place one large strainer 1 small strainer directly under stainless steel funnel this will collect hair and keep it from getting into the pump blades 7 it is best to preheat the oil but if you are unable to do so you can heat the oil while you are doing your abhyanga 8 it is advisable to have approximately 1 quart of pizi oil in shiro pan in the treatment room in case your oil gets too low in your pizi pan if it is necessary to add oil add small amount at time so that the pizi oil temperature does not drop significantly 9 it will also be necessary to adjust the oil flow through the tubes with the valve on the gas fitting if the flow is too great this oil will not heat up adequately if it is too slow there will not be enough oil on your guest 10 it is imperative that you never have the pizi oil burner on when you are out of the room swedana setup 1 center top hole holes are not always lined up properly therefore poke holes in straps as needed 2 would be better to have temperature gauge temperature gauge is not included in package even though it is referred to in instructions 3 cloth should not come down on the neck 14 4 space blanket makes it too hot so be very careful using it maybe only in cold room or for safetys sake avoid using it 5 home deepfat fryers have had handles cut off resulting in sharp ragged edges which need to be filed down so they wont tear the tube that slips over the unit 6 fan should point upward all the way 7 cover shins and feet with light cloth instructions for abhyanga table assembly assemble the 4 side panels 1 two sides have metal brackets on them 2 do not tighten up screws until the legs are attached 3 use the square drive bit provided to tighten install the 4 legs 1 the legs are in two sets left and right legs for each side of table 2 the small hole at the bottom of each leg should face out to the sides of the table these holes are for the leg lifter brackets 3 tighten the side panel screws and then the 8 leg nuts install the leg lifter on one end of the table 1 the end opposite of the large hole in the tabletop 2 use lag bolt with washer for each leg install table top 1 screw rails on the underside of the table to the panel sides 2 the foot of the table is at the leg lifter end install shirodhara pole install stainless steel funnel 1 funnel is shipped separately 2 slide in rails and then slightly rotate funnel 3 you may want to caulk around the outside top of the funnel to make it permanent and to prevent any leaking keep crate and all packing materials in storage do not throw crates away 15 additional instructions for wege system pk table pizichili 1 clothes covering the table which catch all the oil need to be 2 longer therefore all slack should be pulled to the bottom where drain is and velcro should be moved an inch out of position toward the back bottom where drain is 2 use clamps to adjust area where oil is collected so it drains properly and not over the edge onto the floor 3 follow directions start pizi oil at 68o 72o not less and not more heating system 1 must be used properly 2 straighten out tubing pull gently on each connection to make sure the tubes are on tight especially on the white domes flow regulators 3 if tubing comes off of pump then you must cut off an inch of tubing and then reattach the tubing 4 main problem cut steel tips steel tubing off at the very start of the system then clamp filter material over the tubing 5 to avoid suction lock cut two triangles into end of tube where you took away steel tubes 6 keep tubes straight and unkinked 7 shirodhara tubes one with two white domes flow regulators plus temperature gauge follow directions on how to set up temperature gauge watch to make sure it holds otherwise it will spill oil linenlaundry you will need to have the following items for each patient for every treatment given order your linen accordingly inventory list for linens 1 wash cloth 4 hand towels used during treatment 4 mediumsized towels used during treatment 16 2 bath towels for use after shower 1 bath mat 2 sheets 3 if you put one over the abhyanga table 1 pillow case the cost of laundering is approximately 300400 per patient per treatment clinic does not need to purchase linens laundry service should supply launder replace pickup and deliver all linens for this price important do not do clinic laundry in your facility it is potential fire hazar d as sesame oil fumes are extremely volatile 17 drain care due to the oil and hair buildup in the drains resulting from our spa treatments the following procedures are recommended for drain care in your clinic facility 1 place stainless steel screen over all shower drains to keep hair from going down the drain 2 three times week use liquid plumber professional strength enzyme buildup remover last thing of the day pour it in the drains and leave it in overnight another excellent product is called microdyne by misco international this product will not corrode or damage pipes and yet is highly effective in keeping drains clear 3 purchase drain snake approx 1200 to clean out drain traps once month 18 appendix 19 maharishi vedic health spa dear course participant we are pleased that you are enrolling in the training program of the maharishi vedic
