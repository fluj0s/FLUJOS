erin d williams domestic social policy division july 10 2008 abstract the new majority leadership of the 110th congress indicated that it would address the topic of stem cell research early in the Ô¨Årst session hr 3 degette was introduced on january 5 2007 with 211 cosponsors and passed the house on january 11 2007 the bill would allow federal support of research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from human embryo and thus negate the august 2001 bush stem cell policy limitation the senate passed s 5 reid on april 11 the house passed s 5 on june 7 and president bush vetoed the bill on june 20 2007 s 5 is the same as hr 3 except it has an additional section supporting research on alternative human pluripotent stem

into virtually any cell in the body and may have the potential to treat injuries as well as illnesses such as diabetes and parkinsons disease currently most human embryonic stem cell lines used in research are derived from embryos produced via in vitro fertilization ivf because the process of removing these cells destroys the embryo some individuals believe the derivation of stem cells from human embryos is ethically unacceptable in november 2007 research groups in japan and the united states announced the development of embryonic stem celllike cells called induced pluripotent stem ips cells via the introduction of four genes into human skin cells those concerned about the ethical implications of deriving stem cells from human embryos argue that researchers should use ips cells or adult stem cells from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood however national institutes of health nih director elias zerhouni and many other scientists believe research should focus on all types of stem cells in august 2001 president bush announced that for the first time federal funds would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells bu t funding would be limited to existing stem cell lines nih has established registry of 78 human embryonic stem cell lines that are eligible for use in federally funded research but only 21 cell lines are currently available scientists are concerned about the quality and longevity of these 21 stem cell lines nih director zerhouni stated before senate and house subcommittees in march 2007 and in may 2008 that research advancement requires access to new human embryonic stem cell lines the senate passed s 5 reid on april 11 2007 s 5 would allow federal support of research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from human embryo and would negate the august 2001 bush stem cell policy limitation s 5 also would provide support for research on alternative human pluripotent stem cells such as ips cells the house passed s 5 on june 7 2007 and president bush vetoed the bill on june 20 2007 the 109 th congress passed legislation similar to s 5 hr 810 castle but president bush vetoed it the first veto of his presidency house attempt to override the veto failed on the related issue of human cloning the house failed to pass hr 2560 degette on june 7 2007 the bill would impose penalties on anyone who cloned human embryo and implanted it in uterus s 812 hatch would ban human reproductive cloning but allow for the therapeutic uses of the technique in contrast hr 2564 weldon and s 1036 brownback would ban not only reproductive applications but also research on therapeutic uses which has implications for stem cell research advocates of the legislative ban say that allowing any form of human cloning research to proceed raises serious ethical issues and will inevitably lead to the birth of baby who is human clone critics argue that the asure would curtail medical research

president bush announced that for the first time federal funds would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells however funding would be limited to stem cell lines that had been created prior to the date of the policy announcement research involving human embryonic stem cells raises number of ethical issues because the stem cells are located inside the embryo and the process of removing the cells destroys the embryo1 many religious and socially conservative individuals believe the destruction of embryos for the purpose of harvesting embryonic stem cells is morally and ethically unacceptable they argue that researchers should use other alternatives such as ips cells or adult stem cells both discussed below instead of embryonic stem cells relatively small amount of federal funding has been used to support human embryonic stem cell research the national institutes of health nih identified 78 human embryonic stem cell lines that would be eligible for use in federally funded research but most were found to be either unavailable or unsuitable for research twentyone cell lines are currently available under the bush policy scientists are concerned about the quality and longevity of these 21 stem cell lines many believe research advancement requires the use of new human embryonic stem cell lines the director of nih elias zerhouni stated in hearing on march 19 2007 before the senate labor health and human services hhs educ ation and related agencies appropriations subcommittee that its not possible for to see how we can continue the momentum of science and research with the stem cell lines we have at nih that can be funded2 when asked if other avenues of research should be pursued instead dr zerhouni stated that the presentations about adult stem cells holding as much or more potential than embryonic stem cells in my view do not hold scientific water i think they are overstated3 he noted that competitors in europe china and india are investing heavily in human embryonic stem cell research i think it is important for us not to fight with one hand tied behind our back here i think its time to move forward on this area its time for policy makers to find common ground to make sure that nih does not lose its historical leadership to sideline nih on such an issue of importance in my view is shortsighted4 on may 8 2008 dr zerhouni made similar statements about the need for additional embryonic stem cell lines and the value of pursuing all avenues of stem cells research at hearing before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on health5 several states such as california connecticut illinois maryland and new jersey have responded by moving forward with their own initia tives to encourage or provide funding for stem cell research and many others are considering similar action proponents of these state stem cell research initiatives want to remain competitive as well as prevent the relocation of scientists and biotechnology firms to other states or overseas however without the central direction and 1 for further information see crs report rl33554 stem cell research ethical issues by erin d williams and

being are committed to fulfilling single function within the body in contrast stem cells are unique and important set of cells that are not specialized stem cells retain the ability to become some or all of the more than 200 different cell types in the body and thereby play critical role in repairing organs and body tissues throughout life although the term stem cells is often used in reference to these repair cells within an adult organism more fundamental variety of stem cells is found in the earlystage embryo embryonic stem cells may have greater ability to become different types of body cells than adult stem cells

embryonic stem cells were first isolated from mouse embryos in 1981 and from primate embryos in 1995 animal embryos were the only source for research on embryonic stem cells until november 1998 when two groups of us scientists announced the successful isolation of human embryonic stem cells one group at the university of wisconsin derived stem cells from five dayold embryos produced via in vitro fertilization ivf 8 the work is controversial because the stem cells are located within the embryo and the process of removing them destroys the embryo many individuals who are opposed to abortion are also opposed to research involving embryos the second group at johns hopkins university derived stem cells with very similar properties 6 during the first session of the 109th congress the house passed identical legislation hr 810 castle in may 2005 in july 2006 the senate passed hr 810 and president bush immediately vetoed it the first veto of his presidency an attempt in the house to override the veto was unsuccessful 7 pluripotent cell has the ability to differentiate into all of the various cell types that make up the body but not the extraembryonic tissues such as the components of the pl acenta 8 the ivf embryos were originally created for the treatment of infertility excess embryos are often frozen for future use couple may elect to discard their excess embryos donate the embryos for research or allow another couple to adopt an embryo the society for assisted reproductive technology and rand conducted survey of more than 430 infertility clinics to determine the number of frozen embryos in the united states 340 clinics responded to the survey nearly 400000 embryos have been frozen and stored since the late 1970s the vast majority of embryos are being held to help couples have children at later date patients have designated 28 or about 11000 embryos for research scientists estimate these 11000 could form up to 275 st em cell lines perhaps much less

elective abortion9 both groups reported the human embryos or fetuses were donated for research following process of informing one or more parents and obtaining their consent the cells removed from embryos or fetuses were manipulated in the laboratory to create embryonic stem cell lines that may continue to divide for many months to years the vast majority of research on human embryonic stem cells both in the united states and overseas utilizes cell lines derived via the university of wisconsin method

university in japan and the second at the university of wisconsin madison announced the development of embryonic stem celllike cells called induced pluripotent stem ips cells through the introduction of four genes into human skin cells 10 until this breakthrough the characteristics displayed by the ips cells were thought to occur only in cells found within the embryo the research teams accomplished the reprogramming of the adult skin cells by using retrovirus to transport the four genes into the skin cells the teams each used different set of four genes the kyoto group has subsequently achieved reprogramming using three genes11 the work on human ips cells is based on earlier studies by the kyoto group in mouse embryos that identified the genes active in early embryos and then used combinations of these genes to try and reprogram adult mouse cells the successful mouse reprogramming study using four mouse genes was announced in june 2006 the analogous four human genes were used by the kyoto group on the human skin cells although development of ips cells may one day lessen the need to study stem cells derived from the human embryo scientists insist that work on human embryonic stem cells must continue for several reasons 12 for example it is unclear whether ips cells share all the characteristics of embryonic stem cells and therefore multiple comparisons between the two types of cells will be necessary in addition because scientists have used potentially cancercausing retroviruses to transfer the reprogramming genes these ips cells would not desirable for therapeutic uses in patients therefore alternative mechanisms to accomplish reprogramming would need to be developed scientists are in the process of investigating the use of other safer viruses to transfer the genes some groups are exploring chemical methods of achieving the same results by switching on genes in the adult cell rather than tran sferring in additional gene copies with virus

an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus from mature body cell such as skin cell obtained from patient in 1996 scientists in scotland used the scnt procedure to produce dolly the sheep the first mammalian clone14 when scnt is used to create another individual such as dolly the process is called reproductive cloning in contrast scientists interested in using scnt to create cloned stem cells would allow the cell created via scnt to develop for few days and then the stem cells would be removed for research stem cells created via scnt would be genetically identical to the patient and thus would avoid any tissue rejection problems that could occur if the cells were transplanted into the patient creating stem cells using scnt for research purposes is sometimes referred to as therapeutic cloning although various scientific groups have reported success in using scnt to create cloned embryos which are then used to produce stem cell lines or live births of variety of different mammals sheep rabbits cows attempts at creating primate embryos via scnt had been unsuccessful however in june 2007 researchers at the oregon national primate research center at oregon health and science university announced the successful derivation of stem cells from rhesus monkey embryo created via scnt 15 results of the oregon group were confirmed in november 200716 the unsubstantiated announcement by clonaid in december 2002 of the birth of cloned child have contributed to the controversy over research on human embryos17 more recently charges of ethical and scientific misconduct have clouded the reputation of scientists involved in deriving stem cells from human embryos created via scnt in february 2004 scientists at the seoul national university snu in south korea announced the first isolation of stem cells from cloned human embryo and in may 2005 announced advances in the efficiency of creating cloned human embryos and in isolating human stem cells concerns about the snu work arose in november 2005 when us coauthor of the 2005 paper accused hwang woo suk the lead snu researcher of ethical misconduct 18 in december 2005 korean coauthor of the may 2005 paper stated that the research was fabricated and the paper should be retracted hwang agreed to the retraction on january 10 2006 snu stated that results of the 2004 paper were also deliberate fabrication 19

stem cells obtained from adult organisms are also the focus of research in april 2007 researchers in brazil published preliminary report on attempts to treat 15 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients with highdose immunosuppressi ve chemotherapy followed by transplantation of the patients own stem cells21 although this experiment was first proposed by us scientists the risks associated with the procedure were judged to be to high 5 mortality for treatable disease that affects children 22 type 1 diabetes is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which the patients immune system attacks the insulinproducing cells in the pancreas scientists are not certain about the exact mechanism of how the treatment works one hypothesis is that the chemotherapy suppresses the patients immune system and stops the destruction of the remaining insulinproducing cells in the patients body which is why early diagnosis is crucial in this approach the patients stem cells are then transfused back into the body hopefully becoming part of an immune system that will not continue to attack the patients insulinproducing cells january 2007 report found that cells similar to embryonic stem cells can be found in amniotic fluid however the lead author of the report as well as others in the field caution that these cells are not replacement for embryonic stem cells 23 there have been number of other publications on the abilities and characteristics of adult stem cells from variety of different sources such as bone marrow and the umbilical cord following birth bone marrow

list by pointing to tangible benefits to some patients29 both sides again accused the other of misleading laypeople and deceiving patients opponents of stem cell research advocate that adult instead of embryonic stem cell research should be pursued because they believe the derivation of stem cells from either ivf embryos or aborted fetuses is ethically unacceptable others believe that adult stem cells should not be the sole target of research because of important scientific and technical limitations adult stem cells may not be as long lived or capable of as many cell divisions as embryonic stem cells also adult stem cells may not be as versatile in developing into various types of tissue as embryonic stem cells and the location and rarity of the cells in the body might rule out safe and easy access for these reasons many scientists argue that both adult and embryonic stem cells should be the subject of research allowing for comparison of their various capabilities reports issued by the nih and the institute of medicine iom state that both embryonic and adult stem cell research should be pursued 30 in fy2004 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 provided 10 million to establish national cord blood stem cell bank within the health resources and services administration hrsa hrsa was directed to use 1 million to contract with the iom to conduct study that would

provides the logistical process for establishing national cord blood banking system establishes uniform standards for cord blood collection and storage and provides recommendations on ethical and legal issues associated with cord blood collection storage and use on december 20 2005 the president signed the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 pl 109129 the act provides for the

the opportunity to study the growth and differentiation of individual cells into tissues understanding these processes could provide insights into the causes of birth defects genetic abnormalities and other disease states if normal development were better understood it might be possible to prevent or correct some of these conditions stem cells could be used to produce large amounts of one cell type to test new drugs for effectiveness and chemicals for toxicity stem cells might be transplanted into the body to treat disease diabetes parkinsons disease or injury eg spinal cord the damaging side effects of medical treatments might be repaired with stem cell treatment for example cancer chemotherapy destroys immune cells in patients decreasing their ability to fight off broad range of diseases correcting this adverse effect would be major advance before stem cells can be applied to human medical problems substantial advances in basic cell biology and clinical technique are required in addition very challenging regulatory decisions will be required on any individually created tissuebased therapies resulting from stem cell research such decisions would likely be made by the center for biologics evaluation and research cber of the food nd drug administration fda the potential benefits mentioned above would be likely only after many more years of research technical hurdles include developing the ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into desired cell type like heart or nerve cell and to ensure that uncontrolled development such as cancer does not occur some experiments may involve the creation of chim era an organism that contains two or more genetically distinct cell types from the same species or different species 31 if stem cells are to be used for transplantation the problem of immune rejection must also be overcome some scientists think that the creation of many more embryonic stem cell lines will eventually account for all the various immunological types needed for use in tissue transplantation therapy others envision the eventual development of universal donor type of stem cell tissue analogous to universal blood donor however if the method used to create ips cells or if the scnt technique was employed using cell nucleus from the patient the stem cells created via these methods would be genetically identical to the patient would presumably be recognized by the patients immune system and thus might avoid any tissue rejection problems that could occur in other stem cell therapeutic approaches because of this scientists believe that these techniques may provide the best hope of eventually treating patients using stem cells for tissue transplantation

following the november 1998 announcement on the derivation of human embryonic stem cells nih requested legal opinion from hhs on whether federal funds could be used to support research on human stem cells derived from embryos the january 15 1999 response from hhs general counsel harriet rabb found that the dickey amendment would not apply to research using human stem cells because such cells are not human embryo within the statutory definition the finding was based in part on the determination by hhs that the statutory ban on human embryo research defines an embryo as an organism that when implanted in the uterus is capable of becoming human being human stem cells hhs said are not and cannot develop into an organism they lack the capacity to become organisms even if they are transferred to uterus as result hhs maintained that nih coul d support research that uses stem cells derived through private funds but could not support research that itself with federal funds derives stem cells

studies utilizing stem cells derived from human embryos may be conducted using nih funds only if the cells were derived without federal funds from human embryos that were created for the purposes of fertility treatment and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment under the guidelines nih would not fund research directly involving the derivation of human stem cells from embryos this was prohibited by the dickey amendment other areas of research ineligible for nih funding under the guidelines include 1 research in which human stem cells are utilized to create or contribute to human embryo 2 research in which human stem cells are combined with an animal embryo 3 research in which human stem cells are used for reproductive cloning of human 4 research in which human stem cells are derived using somatic cell nuclear transfer ie the transfer of human somatic cell nucleus into human or animal egg 5 research utilizing human stem cells that were derived using somatic cell nuclear transfer and 6 research utilizing stem cells that were derived from human embryos created for research purposes rather than for infertility treatment nih began accepting grant applications for research projects utilizing human stem cells immediately following publication of the guidelines the deadline for submitting grant application was march 15 2001 all such

embryos is regulated by the dickey amendment as described above stem cells and stem cell lines are also not considered human subjects nor are they governed by the dickey amendment because of the current lack of federal regulation of stem cell research the national academies has developed voluntary guidelines for deriving handling and using human embryonic stem cells two hhs agencies fda and nih regulate some aspects of stem cell research even if research on stem cell lines is not classified as human subjects research fda the agency that ensures the safety and efficacy of food drugs medical devices and cosmetics regulates stem cell research aimed at the development of any product subject to its approval nih the medical and behavioral research agency within hhs regulates stem cell research that it funds in compliance with president bushs 2001 policy nih has created human embryonic stem cell registry that lists the human embryonic stem cell lines that meet the eligibility criteria as outlined in the bush administration stem cell policy g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g140g138g141g142g150g146g142g156g561g9g158g146g141g142g149g146g151g142g156g561 in july 2004 the national academies established the committee on guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research to develop voluntary guidelines for deriving handling and using human embryonic stem cells due to the current lack of federal regulation of such research the stated position of the national academies is that there should be global ban on human reproductive cloning and therefore the guidelines will focus only on therapeutic and research uses of human embryonic stem cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer the committee released its guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research on april 26 2005 the document provides guidance on informed consent of donors and states that there should be financial incentives in the solicitation or donation of embryos sperm eggs or somatic cells for research purposes the guidelines recommend that each institution conducting human embryonic stem cell research establish an oversight committee including experts in the relevant areas of science ethics and law as well as members of the public to review all proposed experiments the guidelines recommend that national panel be established to oversee the issue in general on continuing basis the human embryonic stem cell research advisory committee met for the first time in july 2006 and held number of meetings to gather information about the need to revise the guidelines in february 2007 revised version of the guidelines was published with minor changes affecting sections 1 introduction and section 2 establishment of an institutional embryonic stem cell research oversight committee 40

contacts of the patient and eventually to the general population public health officials and regulatory agencies such as the fda are specifically concerned about retroviruses which may remain hidden in the dna only to cause disease many years later as well as any unrecognized agents which may be present in the mouse cells the fda defines xenotransplantation as any procedure that involves the transplantation implantation or infusion into human recipient of either live cells tissues or organs from nonhuman source or b human body fluids cells tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells tissues or organs41 under fda guidelines transplantation therapy involving bush approved stem cell lines which all have been exposed to mouse feeder cells would constitute xenotransplantation xenotransplantation products are subject to regulation by the fda under section 351 of the public health service act 42 usc 262 and the federal food drug and cosmetic act 21 us c 321 et seq fda has developed guidance documents and the us public health service has developed guidelines on infectious disease issues associated with xenotransplantation 42 during senate hearing on stem cell research held by the health education labor and pensions committee on september 5 2001 the hhs secretary stated that the fda was overseeing 17 investigational protocols involving xenotransplantation in other areas of clinical research that involve patients therefore he said the xenotransplantationrelated public health concerns over the human embryonic stem cell lines may not nece ssarily preclude the development of treatments for patients while the problems presented by xenotransplantation for clinical research are neither unique to stem cell research nor insurmountable many scientists believe it will be preferable to use sterile cell lines when attempting to treat patients via stem cell transplantation and scientists have been successful in developing human embry onic stem cells that can be maintained without the use of mouse feeder cells 43

and others remain concerned that federally supported research on human embryonic stem cells is limited to the number of cell lines that meet the criteria of the august 9 2001 bush policy as stated above currently 21 cell lines are available for research with federal dollars because the preaugust 9 cell lines were developed in the early days of human stem cell research using older 1990s techniques the cell lines not only have the problems of xenotransplantion described in the previous section on fda regulation but they are harder to work with not well characterized and genetically unstable compared to newer stem cell lines in reaction to the limitations imposed by the bush policy several us research groups have decided to develop additional human embryonic stem cell lines using private funding some research groups are using state funds as well in order to perform this work the research groups considered it necessary to build new laboratory so that the groups federally funded research would be conducted separately from research on the new stem cell lines

created in at least 20 countries the authors of the survey state that only limited data on characterization of these cell lines are publicly available currently it is not clear whether all lines are indeed pluripotent human embryonic stem cell lines database searches performed by the survey authors found that derivation and at least partial characterization of only 432 of these cell lines have

being successful we have already seen researchers move to countries like the united kingdom which have more supportive policies in addition leadership in this area of research has shifted to the united kingdom which sees this scientific area as the cornerstone of its biotech industry under the direction of the white house nih direct or elias zerhouni sent letter in response to the house members which restates the bush administration position against using federal funds for research involving the destruction of human embryos51 the letter from nih director zerhouni did contain the following sentence which some observers believed in 2004 indicated potential future policy shift and although it is fair to say that from purely scientific perspective more cell lines may well speed some areas of human embryonic stem cell research the presidents position is still predicated on his belief that taxpayer funds should not sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life 52 at the time white house spokesperson claire buchan stated that the sentence did not indicate the presidents position had changed supporters of stem cell research point out that it concedes that science could benefit from additional stem cell lines and that the presidents position now rests solely on ethical arguments letter signed by 58 senators urging president bush to expand the current federal policy concerning embryonic stem cell research was sent on june 4 2004 53 the letter states that despite the fact that us scientists were the first to derive human embryonic stem cells leadership in this area of research is shifting to other countries such as the united kingdom singapore south korea and australia on july 14 2004 hhs secretary

cells can be used to treat variety of diseases national embryonic stem cell bank is to collect in one location many of the stem cell lines that are eligible for federal research funding in the letter to speaker hastert secretary thompson stated that before anyone can successfully argue the stem cell policy should be broadened we must first exhaust the potential of the stem cell lines made available with the policy 55 in reaction to the announcement the president of the coalition for the advancement of medical research stated that creating bank to house stem cell lines created before
