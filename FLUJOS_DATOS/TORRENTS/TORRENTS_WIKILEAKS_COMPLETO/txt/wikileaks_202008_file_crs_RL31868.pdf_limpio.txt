not ag ain be considered unless they shall again be made to the senate by the presidentappointment of justices to the supreme court8 the process officially begins when the president selects someone to fill judicial vacancy submitting nomination in writing to the senate usually on the same day it is received by the senate the nomination is referred to the committee on the judiciary the senate committee having jurisdiction over district and circuit as well as most other federal court nominations the judiciary committee then holds hearing on the nomination the committee subsequently meets to vote on whether to report the nomination to the full senate committee vote to report even vote to report with an unfavorable recommendation sends the nomin ation forward to be consid ered by the senate as whole while vote against reporting histo rically very rare occurrence prevents the nomination from going forward and in effect defeats the nomination in committee the final step in the appoin tment process occurs when the senate votes to confirm or disapprove the nomination vote to confirm requires simple majority of senators present and voting if the senate votes in the negative on whether to confirm the nomination is feated and resolu tion of disapproval is forwarded to the president as with nominations in general judicial nominations sometimes fail to advance through each procedural step in the ppointment process after referral to committee nomination might not receive hearing or after receiving hearing might not receive committee vote on whet her it should be reported even if favorably reported by committee the nomin ation might not receive vote by the senate on whether to confirm mination for instance will not under senate rules receive vote on whether to confir m if some senators oppose taking such vote and supermajority of threefifths of the full membership of the senate fails to vote in favor of motion to close debate on the nomination9 if it fails to receive senate vote the nomination ultimately w ill be either withdrawn by the president or returned to the president by the secret ary of the senate upon senate adjournment or recess of more than 30

of these tables are listed in chronological order according to the date on which each nomination was received by the senate the tables show how far along each nomination progressed in the appointment

judiciary committee held hearing on the nomination the judiciary committee voted to report or take other action on thenomination the senate voted for confirmati on or some other action occurred in the final action column date by itself indicates that the senate confirmed the nominee by voice vote or by unanimous c onsent confirmation date with vote tally underneath indicates that senate c

nomination was withdrawn by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31868crs7 16 president may withdraw nomination fo r any number of reasons the mar 19 2001 withdrawal by president bush of nine nominations submitted earlier by president william j clinton mentioned in table note to appendix 2 was in keeping with the usual practice of incoming presidents to withdraw pending nominations submitted by their predecessors presidents also sometimes withdraw their ow n nominations president might do so for example if the senate committee to which the nomination has been referred either has voted against reporting the nomination to the senate or has made clear its intention not to act on the nomination if the nomination even if reported is likely to face substantial opposition on the senate floor or if the nominee has reque sted that the nomination be withdrawn by the end of the 109th congress president bush had withdr awn three of his circuit nominations and three of his district c ourt nominations see in appendix 3 the jan 7 2003 circuit court nomination of miguel estrada whic h at the nominees request was withdrawn by the president on sept 4 2003 following seven unsuccessful votes in the senate by estrada supporters to close debate on the nomination in appendix 4 the feb 14 2005 circuit court nomination of henry w saa d which was withdrawn on mar 27 2006 and the sept 29 2005

mean number is the sum of the number of elapsed days for all of the nominations in question divided by the number of those nomina tions the median number is either 1 the elapsed number of days for the nomination in the middle of the distribution of all the nominations in question with an equal number of the nominations having longer elapsed times than that nomination and an equal number of nominations having shorter elapsed times or 2 the mean of the elapsed number of days for the two nominations in the middle of the distribution if ther is one middle nomination 18 william h greene

nominations such as motions to close deba also have been entered in the final action column the tables also show for each nominati on the length of time that passed before committee hearing committee vote or fina l action took place for each nomination separate columns present the number of days which elapsed between the senates receipt of the nomination and the date s on which it received hearing committee vote or senate vote also at the bottom of each of these three columns the tables show the average number of days which elapsed between the presidents submission of judicial nominations to the senate and the dates on which the nominations received hearings committee votes or senate votes each elapsed time average is shown in two forms as the mean number and as the median number of elapsed days17 although the arithmetic mean is the true average number it has the disadvantage of being skewed by extremely high or w values in distribution of numbers loosely speaking one statistician has note d the median corresponds more closely than the mean to the middle of distributi on of group of numbers it is unaffected by extreme values18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31868crs8 19

court nominations of reggie b walton and terry l wooten on sept 4 2001 in anticip ation of these nominations the judiciary committee held hearing for walton on aug 22 2001 and hearing for wooten on aug 27 2001 20 as noted earlier senate rule xxxi paragraph 6 provides that nominations pending in the senate at the time that the senate adjourns or takes recess of more than 30 days shall be returned to the president usually but not always the senate before starting recess of more than 30 days waives this rule by unanimous consent allowing pending nominations to remain in status quo and continue to be pending in the senate after it reconvenes sometimes however when rule xxxi paragraph 6 is not waived nominations pursuant to the rule are returned to the president and can only be considered again if they are resubmitted by the president 21 footnotes to each of these resubmitted nom inations are provided indicating that the nominees had been nominated earlier to the same judgeships 22 in the 108th congress as appendix 3 reveals three persons were nominated more than once to circuit judgeships claude allen of virginia was nominated to the fourth circuit on apr 28 2003 and jan 20 2004 charles w pi ckering sr of missi ssippi was nominated to the fifth circuit on jan 7 2003 and feb 6 2004 william h pryor jr of alabama was nominated to the eleventh circuit on apr 9 2003 and mar 12 2004 for both pickering and pryor the second nomination in the 108th congress was to life term to the position to which they had been recessappointed earlier in that same congressthe time averages presented in appendices 24 and appendices 68 are calculated from timeelapsed data for speci fic nominations as opposed to overall time an individual might have been in nominee st atus thus in the case of an individual nominated twice to the same judgeship timee lapsed data are count ed separately for each nomination rather than for instan ce measuring the time between nominees first nomination and any action hearing committee vote or senate vote on the nominees second nomination nomination not receiving committee hearing committee vote or senate vote is excluded from the calculation of average time between the nomination date and this par ticular procedural step also three nominations in which nominees received hearings were nevertheless excluded from the calculations of average time between mination and hearing because the hearings in all three instances preceded the nomination dates19 as noted above some indivi duals were nominated more than once to judgeship within the same congress appendix 2 includes 20 circuit court nominations submitted by president bush during the 107th congress between may 9 and august 2 2001 which the senate returned to the president on august 3 2001 at the start of the senates august 2001 recess pursuant to senate rule xxxi20 appendix 6 includes 20 district court nominations submitted by president bush during the107th congress between june 18 and august 2 2001 which the senate returned at the start of its august 2001 recess when the senate reconvened on september 4 2001 president bush renominated all 40 of the individuals involved21 similarly footnotes to the initial 20 circuit and 20 district court nominations that were returned to the president indicate that the nominees in question were later renominated in the 108th and 109th congresses several additional nominees were renominated at least once in the same congress in the 108th congress three individua ls were nominated twice22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31868crs9 23 see in

confirmation rate fo r his circuit court nominees 714 was also notably less than for his district court nominees 872 however such differences in confirmation rates for circu it and district nominees were either slight or nonexistent for the three presidents prior to clinton107 also the senate has tende d to take much longer to act on president bushs circuit court nominees than on his district court nominees as table 1 below shows the mean number of days elapsing from first nomination to confirmation for circuit nominees 366 days was more than twice as much as the corresponding time

january 1977 carter reagan george h w bush and clinton consistent pattern namely that the lowest av erage number of days from nomination to confirmation was recorded in the first cong ress during the presidency and the highest corresponding average was recorded in th last congress during the presidency among the first four presidents the most dramatic proportional increase within this pattern was the almost fourfold increase in average number of days from nomination to confirmation during the reagan presidency with 34day average in the 97th congress the first congress during that pr esidency to 119day average in the 100th congress the last congress durin g that presidency during the years of the first four presidencies the highest average number of days from nomination to confirmation 227 days was recorded in the 106th congress the last congress during the clinton presidency an average more than twi ce as long as the 103day average in the 103rd congress the first congress during that presidency figure 1 reveals that thus far the presidency of the current white house occupant george w bush has seen revers of the pattern just described for president bushs circuit court nominations the lowest average number of days elapsing from nomination to confirmation 125 days was recorded not in the first congress during his presidency the 107th but in the 109th congress thus far in the bush presidency the highest average num ber of days elapsing from nomination to confirmation 210 days was recorded in the first congress during his presidency the 107th congress figure 1 also shows that during every congress from the 102nd to the 109th the average nominationtoconfirmation time interval for circuit court nominations has been more than 100 days well above th is 100plus average was the 210day average for george w bushs circuit court nominations during the 107th congress the first congress during his presidency this average however can be seen as roughly at the same level as the corresponding time averag for william j clintons circuit court nominations during the 105th and 106th congresses 212 days and 227 days respectively the average elapsed time of 125 days between nomination and confirmation for george w bushs circuit nominations in the 109th congress can be seen as being in the same approximate range as the corresponding averages for president ronald reagans circuit nominations in the 100th congress 119 days george h w bushs circuit nominations in the 102nd congress 108 days and president clintons circuit nominations in the 103rd and 104th congresses 103 and 124 days respectively district court nominations average number of days from nomination to confirmation figure 2 below like the preceding figure 1 for circuit nominations shows the average number of days that elapse d for district court nominations from nomination date to c onfirmation during each congress from the 95th congress to the 109th congress each bar in figure 2 indicates the average number of elapsed days from nomination date to confirmation for specified congress and under each bar is the name of the president whose presidency coincided in time with that congress note the

nominations 79 daysnominations that ultimately were not confirmed but were withdrawn by the president or returned to the president at some point in the congress figure 2 shows among other things that from the 95th congress during the first two years of the carter presidency through the 105th congress during the fifth and sixth years of the clinton presidency the average number of elapsed days from nomination to confirmation for district court nominations per congress increased significantly from 40day average in the 95th congress to 165day average in the 105th this overall pattern of increase however was marked by drops in the nominationtoconfirmation time average durin g the first two years of presidency ie with the average dropping from signifi cantly higher average recorded in the last two years of the previous presidency only to be followed by increases in the average during the subsequent congress or c ongresses of the successor presidency the average nominationtoconfirmation time intervals for george w bushs district court nominations during the three congresses coinciding with his presidency have all been below the peak average of 165 days recorded for president clintons district nominees in the 105th congress relatively close to that peak however was the 156day average interval recorded fo r president bushs confirmed district nominees in the 108th congress and the 143day average interval recorded for confirmed district court nominees in the 109th congress comparison of time averages in figure 2 with those in figure 1 also reveals that in nine of the 15 congresses in the 1977 2006 time frame the average time intervals between nomination and confir mation were less for district than for circuit court nominations116 for instance the nominationtoconfirmation average interval for william j clintons district nominations in the 106th congress was 133 days compared with 227 days for his circuit minations in the same congress likewise figure 2 us district court nominations average number of days from nomination to confirmation 95th congress to 109th congress january 20 1977 december 9 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31868crs34 the average interval for george w bushs district nominations in the 107th congress was 127 days compared with 210 days for his circuit nominations in the same congress this however was not the pattern for the two most recent congresses in the 108th congress the average elapsed time between nomination and confirmation for george w bushs district nominations 156 days was higher than for his circuit nominations 140 days as it was again in the 109th congress for district court nominations 143 days for circuit nominations 110 days it should be emphasized as caveat that figures 1 and 2 in accounting only for nominations confirmed within congress have certain limitations the figures focus on the elapsed times of nominations rather than on nominees and the time which elapsed from their first nomination to confirmation of their most recent nomination focusing only on nominations rather than persons nominat ed underestimates how long individuals awaited confir mation this is particularly true for courts of appeals nominees whose nominations have been returned at greater rate than district court nominees under president george w bush further failing to account for nominees who never were confirmed may also understate the av erage time in pendency for judicial nominations to provide clearer comparative snapshot by presidency of the average time pending for all nominees figures 3 and 4 follow over the five most recent presidencies the two figures provide fo r circuit and district court nominees respectively the average elapsed time from their first nomination to final

steadily the average elapsed time between first nomination and confirma tion was 69 days for carter ci rcuit nominees and 68 days for reagan nominees subsequently howev er with each succeeding

president george h w bushs confirmed nominees to the district courts on average waited 107 days to be confirmed 529 longer than reagan and carter district nominees president clintons confirmed district nominees on average waited 133 days to be confirmed 243 longer than george hw bushs nominees and george w bushs district court nominees waited 171 days 286 longer than clinton nominees viewed from the perspective of the entire 19772006 period in question george w bushs district court nominees have taken on average almost two and half times as long as the district nominees of presidents carter and reagan to be confirmed 171 days for bush versus 70 days for carter and reagan nominees the magnitude of this increase however was not as great as th abovediscussed 500 increase in average time taken for george w bushs circuit court nominees to be confirmed 366 days over the average confirmation time taken by president reagans circuit nominees 68 days in other words over the course of the last four presidencies reagan through george w bush there has been steady rise in the average times taken to confirmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31868crs37 district as well as circuit court nominees however circuit nominees have experienced higher rate of increase in their average confirmation time than have district nominees ultimately resulting in an averag confirmation time during the presidency of george w bush 366 days more than twice as long as the average confirmation time for district court nominees 171 days for district court nominees not confirmed figure 4 shows there has not been steady increase by presidency in the average elapsed time between first nomination and final disposition of last nomination rather the average elapsed time stayed at about the same level over the course of the carter reag an and george h w bush presidencies increased dramatically by mo re than 100 with the clinton presidency and then for the first six years of the pr esidency of george w
