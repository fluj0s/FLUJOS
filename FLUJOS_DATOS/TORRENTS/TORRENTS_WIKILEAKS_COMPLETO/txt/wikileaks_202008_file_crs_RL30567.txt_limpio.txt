the congress and legislative process government and finance division party leaders in the united states congress 17892009 summary this report briefly describes current responsibilities and selection mechanisms for 15 house and senate party leadership posts and provides tables with historical data including service dates party affiliation and other information for each tables have been updated as of the reports issuance date to reflect leadership changes the report will be updated as changes in house and senate party leadership positions occur although party divisions appeared almost from the first congress the formally structured party leadership organizations now taken for granted are relatively modern development constitutionallyspecified leaders namely the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate can be identified since the first congress other leadership posts however were not formally recognized until about the middle of the 19th century and some are 20th century creations in the earliest congresses those house members who took some role in leading their party were often designated by the president as his spokesperson in the chamber by the early 1800s an informal system developed when the speaker began naming his lieutenant to chair one of the most influential house committees eventually other members wielded significant influence via other committee posts eg the post1880 committee on rules by the end of the 19th century the formal position of floor leaders had been established in the house the senate was slower than the house to develop formal party leadership positions and there are similar problems in identifying individual early leaders for instance records of party conferences in the 19th century senate are not available memoirs and other secondary sources reveal the identities of party conference or caucus chairs for some but not all congresses after about 1850 but these posts carried very little authority it was not uncommon for senators to publicly declare that within the senate parties there was single leader rather through the turn of the 20th century individuals who led the senate achieved their position through recognized personal attributes including persuasion and oratorical skills rather than election or appointment to formal leadership posts the formal positions for senate party floor leaders eventually arose from the position of conference chair owing to the aforementioned problems in identifying informal party leaders in earlier congresses the tables in this report identify each leadership position beginning with the year in which each is generally regarded to have been formally established the report excludes some leadership posts in order to render the amount of data

reflects the leadership elections and appointments for the first session of the 111th congress made in party organizational meetings held in november 2008 at the end of the 110th congress2 included for each post are leaders names party and state affiliations and dates and congresses of service for most congresses the report indicates years of service only except in the tables for the house speaker and the senate president pro tempore both of which include specific dates of service when member died while holding leadership office however the date of death is included as the endof service date except in table 13 in cases where leadership change occurs during the course of congress exact dates of service are indicated where possible with respect to length of service the report includes all instances in which member held particular leadership post regardless of whether the member held the post for the entire congress or only portion of it official congressional documents house journal and senate journal congressional record and predecessor publications can be used to document the tenure of the constitutionallyspecified leaders ie speaker and president pro tempore the actions of the party organizations in choosing other leaders such as floor leaders or caucus or conference chairs frequently went unacknowledged in these sources however in the frequent absence of party caucus records in the latter half of the 19th century scholars have had to rely on secondary sources such as memoirs and correspondence for evidence of party leadership positionholding the concluding portion of this report source notes and bibliography provides more information about sources and the reliability of leadership lists identifying house leaders the changing nature of congressional leadership provides additional challenges to identifying leaders not constitutionally specified eg floor leader3 even for party elected posts determining who held other positions can be problematic in earlier congresses for example identifying each partys conference or caucus chair often requires reliance on incomplete historical records of conference meetings or inferences made from informal practices eg noting which member nominated his partys candidate for speaker motion that often fell to the conference chair in the house for example it was the common practice of president thomas jefferson and his immediate successors to designate member as their principal legislative spokesman often these spokesmen held other formal leadership position in the house and presidents frequently designated new spokesmen or even specialized spokesmen for individual measures as their terms progressed as these 2 this report was originally written and updated by paul s rundquist and richard c sachs former specialists in american national government at crs and faye m bullock former technical information specialist at crs the listed author has updated and expanded this report and is available to respond to inquiries on the subject 3 see the source notes and bibliography section at the end of this report for description and citation of the multiple sources used in identifying leaders in the house of representatives crs3 and other leaders were not chosen by congressional party group or by party leader such as the speaker these presidential designees have not been included here as party leaders most historians who study the 19th century house acknowledge that an informal positional leadership system emerged possibly as early as the war hawk congress 18111813 under speaker henry clay under this system the speaker who at the time designated the chairmen of the standing committees would name his principal lieutenant to be chairman of the ways and means committee after the appropriations committee was split from the ways and means committee in 1865 the speakers principal floor lieutenant received either of these chairs sometimes the speaker chose rival for the speakership to chair one of these committees in an effort to resolve intraparty disputes it is somewhat inaccurate however to consider these early leaders to be majority leaders in the modern sense and they have not been included here the position of chair of the appropriations or ways and means committee inevitably made the incumbent powerful congressional figure because of the important legislation reported from these committees these chairs were not however chosen in vote by the full party organization as the majority or minority house leaders are now furthermore other leading congressional figures such as the republican leader thomas brackett reed achieved their positions of influence within the house by service on other committees such as in reeds case the post1880 rules committee identifying senate leaders the senate developed an identifiable party leadership later than the house the few existing records of party conferences in the 19th century senate are held in private collections memoirs and other secondary sources reveal the identities of party conference or caucus chairs for some but not all congresses after about 1850 these posts however carried very little authority it was not uncommon for senators to declare publicly that within the senate parties there was single leader4 instead through the turn of the 20th century individuals who led the senate achieved their position through recognized personal attributes including persuasion and oratory skills rather than the current practice of election to most official leadership posts the development of senate party floor leaders was one of slow evolution like the house but they arose for the most part from the post of conference chair not until 1945 did senate republicans specify that the conference chair and floor leader posts must be held by separate senators among senate democrats the floor leader is also chair of the conference in many secondary sources senators are identified as floor leaders before existing party conference records so identify them in this report footnotes to the tables attempt to clarify when leader was identified through official sources such as caucus minutes or through secondary sources 4 woodrow wilson congressional government boston houghtonmifflin 1885 p 223 crs4 party affiliation designations another problem in identifying party leaders in early congresses is the matter of party affiliation secondary sources reporting on party leaders often relied upon the information compiled in early editions of the biographical directory of the united states congress as the editors of the 1989 edition of the biographical directory noted the most serious source of error and confusion in previous editions of the biographical directory was the designations of party affiliation many of the party labels added to the editions of 1913 and 1928 were anachronistic claiming for the two modern parties senators and representatives elected to congress before the modern democratic or republican parties existed other entries ignored the frequent shifts in party affiliation during the nineteenth century or omitted reference to shortlived and regional political parties and thus failed to reflect the vigor and diversity of nineteenthcentury politics5 the 1989 and 1997 editions of the biographical directory resolved these differences and their designations of party affiliations are principal sources for this report the 1997 edition of the biographical directory in particular included more complete notations where members changed their party affiliations while serving in congress6 the main source for early party affiliations of senator leaders principally presidents pro tempore is volume four of senator robert c byrds the senate

leadership posts in order to render manageable the amount of data provided specifically the senate and house party conference secretaries and the chairs of party committees eg steering committees policy committees committees on committees and campaign committees are not presented here junior party whips are also not identified at least since the 1930s 5 us congress senate biographical

representatives the position of speaker is constitutionally specified in article 1 section 2 the speaker is the only party leader who is chosen by rollcall vote of the full house of representatives which occurs after each party has nominated candidate for the position when new congress convenes house rules give the speaker various formal duties these include for example administering the oath of office to new members signing housepassed bills and resolutions presiding over the house and making rulings on the presence of quorum points of order etc referring measures to committees and naming the partys slate of members for certain committee positions each party conference cedes additional powers and responsibilities to speaker from its own party including influence over the makeup of

positions descriptions and historical tables president pro tempore of the senate pursuant to article 1 section 3 of the us constitution the president pro tempore of the senate is the chambers presiding officer in the absence of the president of the senate the vice president of the united states the president pro tempore is elected by the full senate as the formal institutional leader and in current practice is the longest serving member of the majority party8 until 1890 the senate elected president pro tempore whenever the vice president was not in attendance whether for day or permanently as in the case of the vice presidents death or resignation when the vice president returned the president pro tempore lost his place when the vice president was again absent the senate again elected president pro tempore in many cases the same senator who had been chosen before by the standing order agreed to on march 12 1890 the senate declared that the president pro tempore shall hold the office during the pleasure of the senate and until another is elected and shall execute the duties thereof during all future absences of the vice president until the senate does otherwise order9 the senates president pro tempore is pursuant to statute currently third in the line of presidential succession behind the vice president and the speaker of the house in the succession act of 1792 the position was initially designated to serve in line after the vice president10 an 1886 act altered the succession line by replacing congressional leaders with cabinet secretaries but the president pro tempore post was reinstated in the line in the current position in 194711 as presiding officer the president pro tempore has the power to decide points of order and enforce decorum on the floor the president pro tempore has other formal powers eg appointing conferees appointing certain senate officers and serving on or appointing others to working groups commissions and advisory boards however because the direction of senate business has fallen in modern times to the majority leader almost all of these powers are actually exercised by the majority leader in practice as explained in the notes to table 9 and table 10 below the senate has also had past occasion to select deputy president pro tempore and permanent acting president pro tempore for more information on the president pro tempore and the 8 electing the longestserving majority party senator has generally been the practice since 1890 with some exceptions the only exception since 1945 has been the election

political parties during their congressional careers this table lists the party with which each individual was affiliated at the time of his service as president pro tempore in cases in which the historical sources indicate party switch in the midst of calendar year without specific date it is presumed that the party switch coincided with the beginning of new congress although the biographical directory of the american congress 17741996 identifies these presidents pro tempore as republicans the party designation democratic republicans is more widely used and familiar to readers this designation rdr should not be taken to refer to the contemporary republican party which did not emerge until the 1850s b senator john gaillard was elected after the death of vice president elbridge gerry on november 23 1814 and continued to serve throughout the 14th congress as there was vice president c there was actual election senator ambrose h sevier was permitted to occupy the chair for the

beginning of new congress while these positions developed later than and arose from the post of conference chair they now represent the top post in each party the majority leader is the lead spokesperson for the party in the chamber and is also responsible for scheduling the legislative activity of the senate by precedent established in 1937 the majority leader is afforded priority recognition on the floor the minority leader leads and speaks for the minority party and is consulted by the majority leader in scheduling senate floor activity he also has preferential floor recognition after the majority leader the rules of each party conference assign additional responsibilities to each floor leader as well in current practice the floor leader for senate democrats also

riddick includes in table iii seniority of majority and minority leaders of the senate p11 conference chairs senator shelby m cullom as majority leader from 19111913 and senator jacob h gallinger as

he was simply reelected to the conference chair post in 1919 and the party had not yet employed the designation floor leader scholarly opinion is that his role in the 66th to 68th congresses for all intents and purposes was that of the floor leader however byrds volume provisionally lists him as the first majority leader table 46 p 506 riddick includes him in table iii p11 also see widenor henry

leader was also majority leader for at least half of the congress for example while the republicans began the 107th congress with controlling majority party control switched to the democrats in june of the first session the 107th congress is therefore treated as being under democratic party control in these tables where applicable byrds identification of the first democratic conference chair begins with senator gorman in the 58th congress other sources however rely on unofficial records to give gorman that title in the 53rd congress with senators morgan and jones identified as such in later congresses after period in which reliable sources do not exist see for example riddick majority and minority leaders of the senate table i p 7 b riddick identifies senator gorman as the first democratic conference chair in 1893 though byrd does not designate him as such until the 58th congress this is also the case with the designations of senators morgan in 1901 and jones in 1902 c reliable records from the caucus exist for this period d senator gormans designation as conference chair in the 58th congress is the first that can be confirmed from official caucus minutes died june 4 1906 crs30 f secondary sources generally identify senator kern as the first democratic floor leader in the modern sense of the term see for example oleszek john worth kern p 10 others have made case for designating senator blackburn as the first since he was referred to as the democrats chosen official leader in congratulatory resolution see riddick p 3 still others consider senator martin an early floor leader see oleszek john worth kern note 13 senator underwood is the first person to be officially called floor leader in minutes of the party conference so some sources eg byrd treat him as the first democratic floor leader g elected june 9 1906 h died november 12 1919 an initial caucus vote to replace senator martin resulted in tie between senator gilbert m hitchcock and senator underwood hitchcock briefly was acting leader until underwood was elected in april of 1920 see riddick p 9 note 2 i elected april 27 1920 j died july 14 1937 k elected july 22 1937 l in the 107th congress senator daschle became majority leader on june 6 2001 following change in party control of the senate from republican to democratic conference chair each party has conference organization consisting of all the elected senators from that party it is the main body through which the party contingent at large decides and communicates its legislative priorities while each partys conference chair posts were the first formal party leadership positions in the senate eventually floor leader positions were established as uppermost in each partys leadership hierarchy since 1945 republicans have elected their conference chair separately from other leadership posts but the elected democratic floor leader also serves as chair of the democratic conference see table 12 for the list of

codified their conference procedures in 1944 making it clear that the whip post was elected by the conference today each party conference elects party whip who is also known in the senate as the assistant majority leader or assistant minority leader depending on the party typically deputy whips are also appointed to assist the whip operation the whips communicate leadership priorities to the party rankandfile and vice versa provide leaders an assessment of member support for or opposition to pending legislative matters and mobilize support for leadershipsupported measures under

congressional sources and authoritative documents such as the privately printed biographical directory of the american congress 1774 to 1996 and similar online adaptation the biographical directory of

leadership lists have been compiled from these sources where these have been published they have been used as source in this report this report also relies on secondary sources developed by scholars the congressional research service made attempt to gain access to caucus or conference minutes in collecting data for this report inevitably conflicting interpretations occur in these data even among sources generally accepted as reliable for example there are disparities on the dates of elections and tenure of senate presidents pro tempore between byrds history the 1911 senate document and gamm
