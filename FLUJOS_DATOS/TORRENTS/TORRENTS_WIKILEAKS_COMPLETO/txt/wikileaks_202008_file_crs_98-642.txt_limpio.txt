states of the former soviet union progress and implications for us interests summary since the end of the cold war and the advent of independence for the former soviet republics these new independent states nis have made varying progress in implementing democratic reforms some nis such as russia appear to be making some progress few such as kyrgyzstan appear to be faltering and several such as turkmenistan appear to be making scant progress successive us administrations have fostered democracybuilding in the nis as primary foreign policy objective broadly us policymakers have stressed that the containment policy of the cold war has been replaced with the policy of engagement and enlargement to increase the worlds free market democracies democratic nis are regarded as more likely to conduct peaceful foreign policies and to uphold civil and human rights also us trade and business would likely be attracted to democratic nis where the rule of law is respected the administration generally adheres to the idea that democracybuilding and the creation of market economies can proceed simultaneously in the nis as the best means to ensure stable reforms several us agencies carry out democracybuilding programs with the us agency for international development playing prominent role in practice us democracybuilding aid reflects various interests and aid goals and particular needs in an nis cumulative data for fy1992fy1997 appear to some degree to show that democracybuilding aid has been targeted to nis that are faltering or making scant progress in order to bolster civil society democracy building aid to belarus kazakstan and uzbekistan has been aimed at bolstering the growth of ngos in countries where the political systems are largely undemocratic the administration has placed some priority on democracybuilding in russia and ukraine because of their large populations and territory and the strategic threat of an unstable nucleararmed russia their geopolitical and cultural connections to europe and the view that democratization in these nis provides examples to other nis cumulative aid figures for armenia georgia and tajikistan reflect recent shift to some democracybuilding aid and efforts to relieve humanitarian suffering related to conflict most in congress have supported aid for democracybuilding in the nis though there have been varying concerns about the duration conditionality and scope of such aid some have urged earmarking or otherwise highlighting democracy building aid for armenia georgia ukraine and other nis while others have criticized the effectiveness or pertinence of existing democracybuilding and other nis aid foreign operations appropriations for fy1998 pl105118 reduced the administrations request for aid to the nis to 770 million from 900 million but otherwise generally reflected shift in program priorities to grassroots democracy building efforts congressional debate on the fy1999 nis aid request appears supportive of the administrations plans for democracybuilding programs in the nis but less receptive to other nis programs and requested funding levels contents introduction 1 what is

democracybuilding in the new independent states of the former soviet union progress and implications for us interests introduction many analysts argue that process of political liberalization undertaken by former soviet president mikhail gorbachev in the late 1980s contributed to the collapse and breakup of the soviet union at the end of 1991 the new independent states nis1 that emerged from the breakup professed intentions to democratize and to uphold human rights these assurances were given to the united states when diplomatic relations were established and several nis leaders on us visits have repeated these assurances2 according to some analysts the interest in democratization in the nis is part of the expanding worldwide appeal of democratic governance3 but democracy is only one of several possible outcomes of transition from communist rule in the nis many observers optimistically argue that all the nis have at least formally disavowed communism they contend that majority of the nis have made at least faltering progress in democratization despite the harsh obstacles and legacies the nis have faced other observers are less sanguine concluding that only few of the nis appear to be making much progress in becoming democracies they also argue that none of the nis has made enough progress that democratization might be termed consolidated or unlikely to face reversal this paper examines democratization in the nis grouping them broadly into three categories based on their progress in reaching various benchmarks the paper will examine us administration policy on democracybuilding in the nis and congressional and other concerns and issues in practice us democracybuilding efforts in each nis reflect various interests and aid goals as well as the particular needs of an nis and its receptivity to aid 1 the baltic states regained their independence in september 1991 they are usually considered in us aid and policy discussions as part of central europe rather than as members of the nis and are not included in this study 2 jim nichol diplomacy in the former soviet republics westport ct praeger 1995 pp 6164 several analysts have stressed that the collapse of communism removed it as an alternative model for developing states to follow see francis fukuyama the end of history and the last man new york the free press 1992 3 the fall of communism in central europe and the soviet union was preceded by the collapse of authoritarian regimes in southern europe latin america and elsewhere see samuel huntington the third wave democratization in the late twentieth century cambridge ma harvard university press 1991 crs2 the united states long has been committed to expanding the number of democracies in the world broadly us policymakers have stressed that the containment policy of the cold war has been replaced with the policy of engagement and enlargement to increase the worlds free market democracies the administration has argued that good relations with russia and ukraine are primary objective of us foreign policy and that fostering democratization in these and other nis is one of the central objectives of us aid democratic nis are viewed as us security interest since democracies are considered unlikely to start wars4 in this view democratic russia and other nis could be integrated into the western community of democratic states and they would uphold international civil and human rights standards also us trade and business would be attracted to democratic nis where the rule of law is respected according to the administration congress has generally supported administration efforts to foster democracy in the nis with differences in emphasis and timing congress was at the forefront in the early 1990s in calling for coordinated us aid response to the breakup of the soviet union and more recently in directing the administration to devote more resources to bolstering independence and democracybuilding in the nonrussian nis for fy1998 congress also generally endorsed the administrations partnership for freedom initiative and partly funded it which calls for shifting and increasing aid resources devoted to civil society programs at the same time many in congress have voiced concerns about the longterm commitment of russia and other nis to democratization the effectiveness of us aid programs in fostering nis democratization and the aptness of administration support for nis engaging in nondemocratic actions see below issues for congress what is democracybuilding democracybuilding is usually defined as those activities that aim at establishing and strengthening democratic processes and institutions efforts to promote democracy according to the state department include civic education conflict prevention and resolution ethnic racial and religious diversity programs human rights education and training legislative political party public administration and trade union development rule of law initiatives support for elections and electoral reform and support for civilian control over the military5 more generally many observers have focused on several benchmarks of progress in democracybuilding c the establishment of civil peace or at least the geographical containment of conflict is one of the precursors of successful democratization contending 4 some observers have warned that while mature democracies have not been warlike democratizing states may pursue aggressive foreign policies see michael doyle the ways of war and peace new york norton 1997 and jack snyder and edward mansfield foreign affairs vol 74 mayjune 1995 pp 7997 5 us general accounting office promoting democracy gaonsiad9483 january 1994 pp 1 10 and us general accounting office promoting democracy progress report gaonsiad9640 february 1996 p 10 crs3 ethnic clan or regional groups can stymie the development of broadly democratic state6 c approval or amendment of constitution providing for representative institutions the separation of powers and broad protection of human and civil rights rights include freedom of speech and media and protections allowing the growth of myriad and influential interest groups7 c occurrence of substantive and open debate and the passage of important laws by the legislature c adoption of multiparty electoral system and repeated occurrence of free and fair elections that result in peaceful transfer of power8 c minimal public support for parties or groups opposed to democracy9 these benchmarks do not necessarily all need to be present for democratization to occur but substantial progress on the benchmarks will usually lead to consolidated democracy where reforms are less likely to be reversed some analysts take the view that democracybuilding marks its first success when the first competitive and free and fair election occurs and seems more assured when the second and third such elections take place many suggest that such elections and other benchmarks can be seen as part of continuum of gradual consolidation the appendix discusses progress on benchmarks for each of the nis democracybuilding in the nis progress and problems democratization faces more difficulties in the nis than in longexisting countries in latin america and southern europe that have recently democratized according to many observers the nis face problems of national identity including defining citizenship that are wrapped in issues of contested borders separatism and ethnic tensions in this view legacy of communist habits of thinking and acting makes democratization more difficult although such habits may be less entrenched where nis have had previous experience with some degree of democratization 6 juan j linz and alfred stepan problems of democratic transition and consolidation baltimore johns hopkins 1996 pp 366400 rogers brubaker argues that titular ethnic elites in the nis tend to promote their language culture demographic strength economic welfare and political hegemony rather than democratic inclusiveness see theory and society february 1994 pp 4778 7 other important issues bearing on the effective separation of powers include the supremacy of the rule of law and its exercise through free judiciary and control of military and security forces by civilian leaders 8 lawrence leduc richard g niemi and pippa norris eds comparing democracies thousand oaks ca sage 1996 they argue that elections are central if not the central institution of democratic governance p 4 9 richard rose journal of democracy vol 8 3 1997 pp 92108 crs4 armenia azerbaijan and georgia can point to brief periods of independence and nontotalitarian existence after world war i as historical models on the other hand it can be argued that the bad memories many citizens have of communism may spur them to support democratization rather than permit backsliding10 national identity issues the cases of georgia azerbaijan and tajikistan illustrate the difficulties of statebuilding in multiethnic states in these states democratization policy that emphasized the inclusion of minorities in the political and economic life of the state was not followed inclusive policies focusing on ethnic or regional representation in the legislature federalism multiple official languages teaching in multiple languages economic equality and legal protections for minority rights can sometimes allow democratization to occur in multiethnic states where leaders do not follow these policies minorities might be faced with choosing between assimilation or secessionism or face repression and ethnic cleansing setbacks to democratization in armenia azerbaijan and georgia with the latter resuming progress after 1995 and the uncertainties faced in tajikistan are signs that internal civil peace appears to be basic condition for substantial and consolidated democratization georgias and moldovas progress will remain conditional until internal dissension and the political status of ethnic minorities are resolved according to many experts armenias relationship to nagorno karabakh nk breakaway part of azerbaijan inhabited mostly by ethnic armenians also remains ambiguous are nk armenians citizens of armenia and has given rise to conflict and dissension some observers argue that the underfunded and inadequately manned and provisioned armed forces in the nis threaten civilian leaders and democratization while others argue that greater danger to democratization is posed by paramilitary groups in the case of russia some observers conclude that the militarys involvement in political disputes in 1991 and 1993 increases the possibility of its future involvement including possible coup11 more commonly however military groups have posed regional or regime threats in georgia moldova russia and tajikistan in georgia paramilitary coup forces were partly supported by badly split georgian national guard in overthrowing president zviad gamsakhurdia paramilitary forces led separatism in abkhazia and south ossetia assisted by russian irregulars and military forces paramilitary groups successfully prosecuted the chechen separatist conflict in russia in azerbaijan paramilitary forces supplied with arms by the russian military pressured the resignation of president abulfaz elchibey

led separatism in the transdniestr region military and paramilitary forces have clashed during tajikistans sevenyear civil war12 leadership the pace of democratization in the nis is also influenced by the disposition of ruling elites toward reform as well as variations in mass political culture several nis leaders have discouraged democratic participation ranging from peaceful demonstrations to elections sometimes leading to civil conflict in the late 1980s soviet russia had developed many new interest groups that urged gorbachev to implement more reforms central asia in contrast had lower levels of urbanization and education and local and clanbased loyalties were often more significant than wider political engagement and civic responsibility strong presidential systems in the nis have hampered the emergence of political parties and effective legislatures13 the presidents either feel themselves to be above politics or head or back dominant communisttype parties several nis presidents altered their constitutions to enhance their powers relative to their legislatures other analysts argue that presidential systems can be conducive to democratization if power is shared more equitably among the branches of governance marking at least concern with appearing democratic nis leaders have not usually canceled elections except in three central asia states where referendums on extending presidencies were held to circumvent competitive elections some nis leaders have delayed or forced early elections such as legislative elections in kazakstan kyrgyzstan and russia in the latter the legislature was forcibly dissolved efforts to manipulate or unfairly influence electoral results are more common as in the armenian presidential elections of 1996 the 1993 azerbaijani presidential race and the tajik legislative races of 1995 where international monitors did not judge the elections as free and fair peaceful leadership transition is stringent test of democratization peaceful leadership transitions have occurred in ukraine and moldova undemocratic and violent changes of executive power have occurred in georgia and azerbaijan in belarus kazakstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan presidents have clung to power by holding referendums to extend their rule without benefit of contested elections crime and corruption while some observers argue that some crime and even corruption may be useful in some cases in facilitating economic decisionmaking the distribution of resources and even the development of free markets others caution that rampant crime and corruption are bound to erode and retard economic and democratic reforms14 12 charles fairbanks jr journal of democracy october 1995 pp 1834 13 juan linz global resurgence pp 124142 14 for details see us library of congress congressional research service crime in continued crs6 according to recent world bank report public officials in russia ukraine azerbaijan kazakstan and uzbekistan were viewed as most corrupt in these nis and corruption and crime in the nis region were viewed as higher than in any other area of the world15 where nis officials are corrupt and crime is rampant the issue of aid diversion also becomes critical congressional concerns about corruption and crime in the nis and effects on aid contributed to provision in pl105118 foreign operations appropriations for fy1998 that some us assistance to ukraine would be withheld until problems affecting us private investment were resolved and to conference report request confrept 105401 for an administration assessment of the effects of crime and corruption in the nis16 grouping nis by progress in democratization there have been various efforts to group nis by their progress in democratization prominent among these have been those carried out by the human rights organization freedom house in cooperation with usaid they have undertaken to assess the progress of excommunist countries in ridding themselves of the shackles of repressive political system and centralized economy their 1997 nations in transit project discerned three groups or subgroups among the nis more and less advanced transitional states and autocracies freedom house categorized all the transitional states as unstable democracies capable of progressing stagnating or retrogressing and stated that these countries may be most influenced by western democracybuilding aid17 based on the benchmarks of progress reflected in table 1 and other criteria evaluated by freedom house and the state department this report will discuss three groups of nis those that are democratizing faltering and backsliding or failing to democratize four nis russia ukraine moldova and georgia appear to have made some democratization progress three nis armenia kyrgyzstan and azerbaijan appear to have faltered while the remaining nis belarus kazakstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan have made scant progress or have substantially reverted to autocracy the groupings are suggestive rather than definitive and democratizing nis may well straddle groups or move from one group to another the question of the future of democratization largely defines the middle group of faltering states kyrgyzstan may strengthen its commitment to 14 continued russia by jim nichol crs report 94718f crime in russia situation update by jim nichol crs report 95486f and

by freedom house and other experts crs7 democratization while armenias march 1998 presidential election presented mixed picture of some improvement in voting procedures along with many voting irregularities azerbaijans future democratization appears more problematic and recent events surrounding the upcoming october 1998 presidential race raise critical concerns of further backsliding

economic reforms in the nis the bush administration submitted the freedom support act to congress in early 1992 and an amended version was signed into law in october 1992 pl102511 it states that the collapse of the soviet union presents historic opportunity to the west to encourage the new states to enter the community of democratic nations and that the united states should play special role in fostering the development of institutions of democratic governance including electoral and legislative systems other us aid goals in the nis include meeting urgent humanitarian needs fostering free markets systems encouraging trade and investment promoting food production and distribution enhancing health and human services promoting educational reform fostering upgraded safety at civilian nuclear reactors enhancing environmental protection improving transportation and telecommunications combating illegal drugs and protecting and caring for refugees and displaced persons the clinton administration has stressed that support for democratic reforms in russia and other nis are important objectives of us foreign policy19 more generally the administrations strategic plan and its national security strategy and the fy1999 budget request for international affairs declare that the core objectives of us foreign policy are enhancing us security promoting us prosperity and fostering democracy worldwide and form an integrated strategy of engagement the strategic plan argues that more and more states are seeking to democratize and that us and other international influence can be crucial to democracybuilding the administration has placed some priority on democracybuilding support for russia and ukraine because of their large populations and territory their geopolitical and cultural connections to europe and the view that democratization in these nis provides an example for similar democratization among other nis the administration has hailed free and fair legislative presidential and regional elections held in russia since 199520 it also has welcomed democratization progress in georgia kyrgyzstan and moldova though in recent years criticizing some setbacks in kyrgyzstan21 19 us government printing office budget of the united states government fy1999 p 155 the secretary of state congressional presentation for foreign operations fy1999 p 607 us department of

organization for security and cooperation in europe the united states has urged genuine if measured progress in democratization in central asia see political reform and human rights in uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and kazakstan march 1998 p 5 crs9 critiques of us democracybuilding efforts the administration generally adheres to the idea that democracybuilding and the creation of market economies can proceed simultaneously as the best means to ensure stable reforms secretary albright argued in early 1998 that i do think that there are set of needs in developing states that need to be fulfilled practically simultaneously in the best of all worlds political development and economic development go together she was in part responding to criticism that us support for economic development should precede support for free elections and other democratization efforts because the latter could be destabilizing22 other critics have argued that the administration should focus aid on nis that have made the most progress in democratization rather than spreading it thinly among most nis they lament that the progressive nis are not receiving enough us aid to surmount their tendencies to stagnate and decay rather than fully democratize they criticize what they view as shallow us efforts to merely foster more free elections worldwide they point out that in countries such as kazakstan and belarus where relatively free and fair elections have been held democratization since has faltered consolidation efforts should include more focused and longer termed efforts to foster individual rights and freedoms the rule of law the separation of church and state and checks and balances on executive power they argue23 among critics faulting us democracybuilding programs professor michael mcfaul has called for the administration to devote more aid to buttress russias substantial progress in democratization rather than pessimistically to emphasize nato enlargement as hedge against democratic collapse in russia others criticize us shift toward closer ties with strategically significant uzbekistan rather than with the more democraticallyinclined kyrgyzstan warning that such an emphasis does not encourage democratization in the region they have endorsed along with some opposition leaders in the nis administration plans to focus more us aid on grassroots democracybuilding rather than continue aid programs viewed as directly or indirectly supporting regimes that resist democratization opposition figure akezhan kazhegeldin former prime minister of kazakstan has urged that america should demand that central asia go forward with democratization and liberalization if you do not you will lose there will be expectations in society and all the western companies will lose as they did in iran opposition figure 22 secretary of state madeleine k albright remarks and qa session at center for national policy january 13 1998 the national endowment for democracy likewise responded that us policy should support broad democratization see marc f plattner and carl gershman wall street journal january 26 1998 these officials were in part reacting to articles by robert d kaplan the atlantic monthly december 1997 pp 5580 and fareed zakaria foreign affairs novemberdecember 1997 pp 2243 ross burkhart and michael lewisbeck conclude in crossnational analysis that while economic development fosters democratization the latter can be pursued for its own sake without sacrificing economic development this view might be seen as supporting administration policy see american political science review december 1994 pp 903910 23 alexander motyl in nations in transit 1997 pp 1722 zakaria pp 2243 crs10 rasul guliyev former legislative speaker in azerbaijan too warned in february 1998 that the lack of democratization in azerbaijan meant that unexpected government changes in the future there could lead to the confiscation of us investments24 secretary albright appeared to address such criticism in her congressional testimony on february 10 1998 when she argued that us democracybuilding efforts were tailored to needs and receptivity in each nis and had proved helpful to democratic groups in the nis she stated that in recent months some have criticized america for in their words trying to impose democracy overseas they suggest that it is hopeless and sometimes damaging to encourage elections in countries that are not yet developed they appear to assume that our efforts are limited to the promotion of elections americas aim is to assist democratic forces where and when we can we employ wide variety of means from vigorous diplomacy to training judges to providing technical advice25 nato and russias democratization prominent among recent criticism of the administrations democracybuilding policy has been the argument that us security interests in natos enlargement could be harmed by countervailing rise to power of nondemocratic ultra nationalists and militarists in russia26 the administration has countered that nato enlargement will bolster democracy in europe including democratization in russia ukraine and other nis however the administration also has attempted to take these concerns into account by backing natorussia cooperation efforts in signing the natorussia founding act on may 27 1997 president clinton stated that because russia has opened itself to freedom we see future of partnership too long delayed that must longer be denied he stressed that nato would be dedicated to advance the security of every democracy in europe natos old members new members and nonmembers alike27 in speech few days later he argued that nato enlargement natos partnership for peace pfp and special accords with russia and ukraine will erase the artificial line in europe that stalin drew we must not fail historys challenge at this moment to build europe peaceful democratic and undivided allied with us to face the new security threats of the new century28 24 michael mcfaul foreign affairs januaryfebruary 1995 pp 8799 and washington post may 19 1998 p a21 and robert dahl democracy and its critics new haven yale university

commencement white house continued crs11 the impact of nato enlargement on russian democratization was major concern among many in the senate during debate on the resolution of ratification on the accession of poland hungary and the czech republic to nato many opponents of enlargement highlighted the dangers it posed to russias democracy and peaceful foreign policy and the possible negative impact on us national security many proponents countered that enlargement would have effect on russias democratization or would even support it others argued that steppedup us and nato ties and aid could preclude possible harm to russias reforms the resolution of ratification to treaty doc 10536 reflects consensus that it is in the interest of the united states for nato to pursue good relations with democratizing russia senator paul wellstone in opposing enlargement contended that the forces supporting democracy in russia would suffer and argued that democratic russia is unlikely to ever threaten its neighbors he warned that many western experts and russian democrats think that enlargement is likely to sow the seeds for the re emergence of antidemocratic and chauvinistic trends in russia senators daniel patrick moynihan and dirk kempthorne likewise urged support for strengthening democracy and free enterprise in russia rather than creating security problems for the west senator patrick leahy similarly warned that the enlargement of nato matter how benign can only strengthen the hand of left and rightwing extremists in russia senator bob smith concurred that we ought to be doing everything in our power to bolster democratization in russia as the best way to preserve the independence of central europe29 in contrast senator alfonse damato voiced views common to many of those endorsing enlargement that russian democracy will be better served by having healthy stable and prosperous democracies on its western border and that failure to expand nato and the european union would be victory for the anti democratic forces in russia senator joseph biden concurred that if you want to give antidemocratic forces in russia boost then vote against enlargement at the same time he called for bolstering the us hand of friendship and help to russia senator william roth argued that natos relations with russia serve to draw it out of isolation and hence bolster its reforms senator lugar argued that despite years of debate over nato enlargement democratization in russia has continued to make progress russia has cooperated with the west on some foreign policies and not on others and this will not change with nato enlargement he concluded30 28 continued may 31 1997 others have disagreed with these arguments on the debate see us library of congress congressional research

to reflect more longterm view of us relations it ostensibly focuses on nis that have come the farthest in their transitions and are ready for trade investment rapid growth and multitude of economic political and cultural ties to the west although the administration also has highlighted pff programs for central asian regimes that have made little progress in democratization39 the democratic component of pff calls for enhanced cooperative aid to encourage the development of civil society through grassroots partnerships between us and nis organizations and exchange programs at the same time some technical aid in the guise of support for us experts who advise recipient governments on policy reforms will continue40 in its congressional presentation for fy1998 usaid proposed aid for

cooperative usnis activities to promote lasting ties and civil societies in the nis41 actual fy1998 freedom support act funding for democracybuilding fell short of the administrations request for most nis because of congressional earmarks and reductions in funding and changing program needs and country receptivity usaid indicated in congressional testimony that if its request was not fully funded it would give priority to economic restructuring and democratic initiatives42 the latter appeared to suffer substantial reductions however estimated funding by usaid in most nis for democratic pluralism initiatives for fy1998 amounted to about one half of what usaid originally requested in georgia and armenia however congressional earmarks apparently protected democracybuilding programs in the case of russia estimated democracybuilding funding in fy1998 is substantially less than what usaid requested being reduced from 698 million to 128 million 39 usaid congressional presentation annex

broadly defined is about 11 of all obligated funds 19921997 11 billion out of 102 billion44 the cumulative rankings do not clearly parallel the three groups of nis ranked by progress in democratization table 3 in practice democracybuilding aid appears to some degree to have been targeted to nis that are faltering or backsliding in order to bolster civil societies in these states although the cumulative data also reflect other us interests aid goals needs and receptivity of an nis or congressional earmarks the fy1998 estimates and fy1999 planning data table 3 also reflect varying objectives and do not precisely parallel the rankings in some nis the administration and congress have placed greater emphasis on targeting aid for civil society initiatives where the governments have made little progress in democratization or are backsliding belarus kazakstan tajikistan and uzbekistan while in others aid has supported further progress in democratization the cases of russia and ukraine democracybuilding aid to belarus kazakstan and uzbekistan has been aimed at bolstering the growth of ngos where the political systems are largely undemocratic in the case of armenia georgia and tajikistan cumulative aid figures reflect focus until recently on relieving humanitarian suffering caused by conflict in the case of democracybuilding support for backsliding nis the administration has argued that support for grass roots and other local civil and human rights efforts can contribute to popular pressure that may eventually result in changes of leadership or other toplevel support for wider democratization such programs have been endorsed by some human and civil rights advocates of these nis though some have doubted their usefulness where regimes stifle meaningful dissent or warn that close attention must to paid to keep such programs from bolstering authoritarian regimes in his congressional testimony in marchapril 1998 richard morningstar thenspecial advisor to the president and the secretary of state on assistance to the nis argued that pff efforts are particularly salient to democracybuilding in south caucasian and central asian states where we have footdragging on democratic reform by authoritarian leaders in these states the united states has tried to pry open the door of progress focusing in particular on 43 amended

personnel45 issues for congress most in congress have supported aid for democracybuilding and economic reforms in russia and other nis over the six years of freedom support aid some congressional observers have urged greater emphasis on democracybuilding in russia while others have criticized the effectiveness or pertinence of existing democratization and other us aid to russia and other nis46 the increased funding for the nis region contained in the fy1998 pff initiative was partly supported by congress congress reduced the administrations fy1998 request for aid to the nis from 900 million to 770 million but increased the level of aid over the 625 million allocated the previous year the house appropriations committee reported that it welcomed the pff shift in program priorities to private sector investment and grassroots democracybuilding efforts further support for nis democracybuilding was provided when congress approved provision in foreign operations appropriations for fy1998 pl105118 that permitted governmenttogovernment democracybuilding aid to azerbaijan at congressional hearings in the first half of 1998 on the fy1999 nis aid request many in congress appeared supportive of the administrations plans for pff programs in the nonrussian nis but less receptive to other nis programs and requested funding levels s2334 foreign operations appropriations for fy1999 was reported favorably by the senate committee on appropriations on july 21 1998 it provides for 740 million for nis assistance below the administrations request of 925 million and earmarks aid to armenia georgia and ukraine the committee reported that its earmarks and other nis support strengthen free market democracies there and enhance us interests through increased stability security and prosperity srept105255 should the united states foster democracybuilding in the nis while consensus supports democracybuilding in the nis some voices believe that current us aid policy may not be the most effective means to reach this goal some believe that the united states should not seek to impose the us system of governance on nis but rather allow them to develop their own democratic systems some call for less reliance on us taxpayerprovided assistance and more recognition and support for the substantial private efforts of us citizens companies and media to spread democracy others call for other democratic countries and 45 ambassador richard l morningstar statement before the house international relations committee on assistance to the nis march 26 1998 statement of ambassador

to shoulder more of the nis aid burden some warn that us aid to foster democracybuilding in the nis might cause backlash by nondemocratic and ultranationalist groups in these states and harm the efforts of indigenous democrats others argue that democracybuilding efforts might contribute to civil disorder if nis governments are not able to cope with increased citizen participation and demands possibly harming us trade and private investment interests the general consensus in congress supporting nis democracy building aid may come into question if nis democratization efforts encounter mounting setbacks and reversals what kinds of democracybuilding programs should be promoted there are narrow and broad criteria of what constitutes democracybuilding programs democracybuilding can be narrowly defined as encompassing support for writing constitutions setting up free and fair electoral systems and executive legislative and judicial branch institutionbuilding support for upholding the broad range of human rights is also sometimes included as are many or most economic reforms many would include such programs as crime fighting and fostering civilian control over the military as democracybuilding many have also advocated that democracybuilding aid be targeted to localities and private groups as well as to central governments and that central governments receive less aid when they are resistant to reforms the state department as noted has taken an expansive view that peopletopeople exchanges that bring nis citizens and officials to the united states and some incountry training such as that conducted by peace corps volunteers expose nis participants to principles of the rule of law and to modes of behavior in civil society47 virtually all observers agree that the kinds of programs and their scope should be tailored to each nis rather than implemented across the board usaid in part has based its democracybuilding programs on reviews it has carried out in each nis in its fy1997 review for kazakstan for instance usaid assessed kazakstan as moving forward in creating effective responsible and accountable local government so recommended beginning program of training and assistance in local democracy building in fy1998 in the case of georgia the review for fy1997 concluded that there had been good progress in usaid programs to foster citizen participation and legal reform but less progress in creating effective responsible and accountable local government it recommended pause on largescale local government aid or even curtailing the program if the central government did not pursue decentralization48 47 on us democracybuilding aid for russian legislative judicial party electoral and ngo development see us library of congress congressional

government democratization pending local government elections p 102 crs20 the question of what kinds of democracybuilding programs to support also depends on the amount of nis aid appropriated and earmarked as well as on changes in the receptivity of each nis to assistance while administration planning through fy1997 called for nis aid to be wound down shortly after the year 2000 there were discussions about what programs important to the united states should be retained in the coming years crimefighting training some peopletopeople exchanges and civil society programs were among democracybuilding programs many proposed should continue and these programs have been highlighted as part of pff what should be the criteria for democracybuilding assistance another issue is prioritizing which nis to assist in bolstering their democratization what are the criteria for determining which nis are to receive the most aid which nis are progressive enough that they require reduced or democracybuilding aid and which nis are so nondemocratic that they should not receive any us aid us assistance to the nis including democracybuilding aid has been conditioned on wide variety of factors including the freedom support act and other legislation as well as administration policies the administration has mentioned criteria including whether an nis is strategically important to the united states or is regional power the prospects for the creation of democracy and free markets how open an nis is to us aid efforts and whether democratization may have demonstration effect on other nis in the region49 other conditions bearing on whether an nis receives us assistance perhaps including democracybuilding aid include whether an nis adheres to arms control agreements does not wage war against its neighbors does not support terrorism does not transfer materials or technology that can be used to construct mass destruction weapons and upholds human rights specific legislative conditions on aid to russia that potentially affect us democracybuilding efforts have included whether it upholds religious freedom and abjures assisting iran in building nuclear reactors and ballistic missiles rarely does an nis have clearcut record in democratization that makes policy choices simple the administration contends that us ties with uzbekistan azerbaijan and turkmenistan are important for economic reasons and because of uzbekistans regional power status despite their poor receptiveness to democracy building in these cases aid levels are not perfectly related to the ranking of nis in terms of democratization progress but even in the case of russia and ukraine besides their democratization progress policymakers have emphasized the geopolitical importance of these populous and territoriallylarge nis as well as strategic concerns with reducing nuclear weapons in russia even in backsliding nis in practice the administration has pursued some engagement to advance human rights and democracybuilding at the grass roots level see table 3 the range and scope of conditions on democracybuilding aid to the nis have been perennial issue of concern to congressional authorizers and appropriators in february 1998 representative lee hamilton reflected arguments of many in congress and the administration that rather than giving up on supporting democracy where nis governments have faltered at reforms the united states should maintain 49 us congress committee on foreign affairs administration of justice programs hearing testimony of john shattuck september 14 1993 p 29 crs21 support for successful programs to aid democratic reformers50 on the other hand representatives gilman gerald solomon and james traficant have questioned the usefulness of giving aid to yeltsin until he attacks highlevel corruption and implements meaningful economic and foreign policy reforms answering those who might caution against cutting off aid to democratizing russia senator gordon smith stated that country that suppresses religious freedom can be democratic in may 1998 after receiving assurances in russia that religious rights would be upheld he emphasized the us interest in russia that chooses the path of democratic government the rule of law and friendly relations with its neighbors51 congressional concern over particular us and international security interests at times has been considered to clearly outweigh broader security interests ensured through democracybuilding support annual foreign operations appropriations since fy1996 have called for partial aid cutoff to russia possibly including some democracybuilding aid if russia assists irans nuclear and missile programs presidential waiver has been provided if russia makes progress in curtailing such programs and on national security grounds52 similarly natos enlargement was widely supported in congress as core us security interest though in this case concern over possible clash of us interests caused many in congress to also urge steppedup support for democracybuilding in russia senator robert torricelli highlighted this view when he argued that if russia is democratic and capitalistic and free then eastern europe is secure and that by enhancing russian democracy the united states enhanced its own security senator patty murray similarly stressed that russia matters to our own future peace and security and called on the administration and congress to rebuild ties with those in russia who are advocating and following the course of democracy senator strom thurmond while arguing that enlargement would provide hedge against future resurgent russia also urged continued support for russias transition to peaceful free market democracy as americas primary national security goal in europe53 congressional debate and funding priorities have placed greater emphasis in recent years on us aid to the nonrussian nis earmarking or strongly supporting appropriations for assistance for ukraine georgia armenia and kyrgyzstan these earmarks usually have been accorded to nis demonstrating at least some progress in democratization though other considerations such as

central asian nis representative gilman in introducing the bill in the house stated that the first priority of us involvement in these nis should be to see democratic government take root in these states stability in the region and in the broader eurasian region may well depend on the successful consolidation of democratic governance in these states55 among nonrussian nis that have been of special concern to congress armenia has received support from an armenian caucus of members of congress and other members who have advocated increased aid and diplomatic support senator jesse helms stated on june 8 1998 that increased aid to bolster democratization in georgia would be priority senator sam brownback on february 10 1998 warned that if democracy is allowed to fail in georgia it is unlikely to succeed anywhere in the region and urged the administration to articulate to those who might try to destabilize the south caucasus states that we will do everything we can to facilitate

it is difficult to assess what effect us government programs have on democratization since indigenous efforts us private investment and other nations foreign aid also may have substantial effect program successes may also be difficult to assess especially in the short term complicating the debate over future aid the administration has admitted that expectations in the early 1990s that democratization in the nis would progress rapidly were exaggerated and has proposed increased assistance over an openended timespan some observers have argued that us aid to russia and other nis may have at most an effect at the margins but might be usefully considered where extra support might bolster democratization efforts by reformers or localities59 others counter that us aid for democracybuilding in the nis has been largely ineffective because of corruption crime and mismanagement in these states and argue either that aid should be cut off or that these problems must receive priority aid see above crime and corruption usaids reviews in the nis attempt to measure the democracybuilding success of us programs in some cases surveys and other data were used to assess progress toward objectives but in other cases qualitative anecdotal narrative approach was used which included state departments human rights assessments and other materials usaid has generally argued that its reviews show that its democracybuilding programs have facilitated and strengthened nis democratization in its review for armenia usaid judged armenia as not meeting expectations in developing political parties and reforming electoral and legislative systems and stated that some aid efforts had been recast or suspended nonetheless it concluded that us aid had improved some aspects of the electoral process it blamed the seriously flawed and questionable 1996 presidential election and turmoil afterward on the still low level of political culture in georgia usaid evaluated progress in citizen participation and legal reform as broadly meeting usaid expectations although there appeared to be less progress in developing decentralized local governments by usaid measures kazakstan has been meeting or exceeding expectations on some measures of democratization the numbers of local ngos formed and improvements in local public administration there have exceeded expectations60 severe

stressed that us democracy building efforts in russia were being refocused to longerterm efforts instead of support for central institutions and political parties where progress has proved difficult

in russias breakaway chechnya republic resulting in tens of thousands of civilian and other casualties and displaced persons and refugees and massive economic damages highly unpopular among most russians the conflict was wound down in august 1996 with ceasefire arranged during the russian presidential campaign although russia has pledged to abide by existing borders with other nis some ultranationalists and communists in russia have called for incorporating transborder areas such as those in crimea eastern ukraine and northern kazakhstan where many ethnic russians reside or even urged reconstituting the soviet union there are serious questions about the results of the december 1993 constitutional referendum that have never been addressed by the yeltsin administration but most political parties endorsed yeltsins proposal in 1994 to work within the constitutional framework in the 1996 presidential race communist party of the russian federation cprf head gennadiy zyuganov stated that he would fundamentally amend or replace the constitution the cprf and the liberal democratic party ldpr vladimir zhirinovskiys party won large numbers of seats in the state duma in 1993 and 1995 but these and other ultranationalist or antigovernment deputies have not been able to revamp the constitution since agreement is required in the federation council and in the regions the electoral system for the state duma was stable for two elections but the federation council has shifted in its representation and it remains to be seen whether it will be durable there also may be changes in the state duma electoral system since yeltsin and others have called for doing away with proportional representation by party lists or lowering the 5 threshold the cprf has regional units and the ldpr has some local though declining presence the our home party has relied on support provided by regional leaders and the yabloko party has endeavored to create grassroots organization but other democratic parties tend not to have local presence there has not been transfer of presidential power yet as test of democratization but the acceptance by the cprf of the results of the 1996 presidential race set fragile precedent67 the legislature is constitutionally constrained in initiating legislation involving appropriations but has asserted itself in altering appropriations measures and passing some important laws yeltsin has vetoed many bills approved by the legislature and the government has often been lax in implementing laws 67 heinz timmerman argues that there has been surprising degree of political stability in russia since 1993 because the cprf has in practice worked within the political system rather than acting disruptively acquiescence by several cprf deputies

the legislature not to try to amend the constitution but to learn to respect it let us learn to live by it and only after that will we think of amendments he also warned that regionalrepublic efforts to circumvent laws will not stand i have enough will to ensure that the constitution operates fully and over the whole territory of the country his 1998 address reiterated this commitment to reforms

policymakers to view kyrgyzstan model of democratization among the nis however kyrgyz president askar akayev orchestrated the early disbandment of legislature he found troublesome in 1994 and took over legislative power pending new elections he decreed an october 1994 referendum to approve amendments to the constitution including provisions creating bicameral legislature and weakening it relative to the presidency he argued that legislative and other provisions of the may 1993 constitution were too idealistic since the kyrgyz people are not prepared for democracy and that transitional period was needed the amendment process like the dissolution of the legislature contravened the constitution according to the state department the referendum questions were approved by over 96 of voters with questionable 96 turnout again according to the state department after the october referendum detailed constitutional provisions were published for popular debate in early 1995 to be given final form and approval by the newly elected legislature83 the early 1995 legislative races were considered by many international observers as generally reflecting the will of the people although campaigning and voting were marred by some irregularities and confusion few candidates were elected in the first round of voting and repeat rounds stretched into mid1995 in september 1995 akayevs supporters submitted petition signed by 12 million 52 of the voting age population urging the legislature to approve referendum extending akayevs term to the year 2001 after contentious debate the legislature rejected holding referendum and akayev instead announced that an early presidential election would be held in december 1995 thirteen candidates were registered but ten were disqualified akayev handily won reelection to five year term in elections deemed generally free and fair by international observers though questions were raised about the disqualifications and other irregularities akayev spearheaded another constitutional referendum in early 1996 although the turnout appeared low to media observers kyrgyz authorities announced 97 turnout and 95 approval margin according to the state department the referendum violated the law on referendums and was marked by rampant fraudulent voting it gave akayev greater powers to veto legislation dissolve the legislature 83 there are

remains under the influence of the executive branch most local officials are appointed by the president political parties are weak although nearly twodozen are registered some are inactive less than half the members of the legislature claim party affiliation and voting rarely takes place along strict party lines president akayevs supporters have petitioned the constitutional court to decide whether akayev could run for second term as allowed by the 1993 constitution disregarding his election in 1991 under previous constitution the constitutional court agreed in july 1998 that akayev could run again leading some observers to criticize the decision as violating the spirit if not the letter of the rule of law other indicators of lagging democratization in mid1998 include passage of law requiring permit to hold demonstrations apparently violating constitutional safeguard of the right to assembly and the consideration of draft electoral law calling for most legislators to be

recent years authoritarian tendencies have caused mixed picture to emerge armenia was among the first soviet republics to begin building democracy and it endeavored to secede from the soviet union in peaceful and lawful fashion its legislature was freely elected in 1990 and its president was democratically elected in 1991 however other events less favorable to democratization included the

arf and media and other manipulation of the electoral campaign by president terpetrosyan86 the armenian government manipulated the results of the 1996 presidential election thereby restricting the ability of citizens to change their government peacefully and contributing to lack of public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process according to the state department osce observers of the 1996 presidential election also concluded that there were serious violations of the election law that raise questions about the integrity of the election process and the official vote count although they noted that it is uncertain whether the irregularities would have affected the basic outcome of the race87 other observers have argued that although the election was flawed the conduct of the campaign was an improvement over the 1995 legislative elections although the constitution provides for independent judicial and legislative branches in practice they are not insulated from political pressures from the executive branch88 the constitution allows the president wide scope to dissolve the legislature and the power to appoint the cabinet chief prosecutor and members of the constitutional court there is an absence of viable legal and regulatory framework for institutions such as the judiciary and procuracy and the relative weakness of civil society impedes democratization according to many observers in february 1998 armenian president terpetrosyan announced his resignation stating that the power bodies the security ministries had demanded that he step down and that he had acceded in order to prevent destabilization in the country prime minister kocharyan who had been critical of terpetrosyans nk policy assumed the duties of acting president after

government peacefully after gaining independence in 1991 belarus continued to be ruled by hardline communists in the government and legislature who forged ties with kindred russian hardliners by 1994 they had forced out the moderate legislative speaker stanislau shushkevich just before elections were held for the newly created presidency the presidential race of mid1994 pitted the hardline prime minister vyacheslau kebich against obscure legislator alyaksandr lukashenka lukashenka ran on an anticorruption platform and won the second round of the presidential race with 80 of the vote international observers judged the race as free and fair98 in contrast the mid1995 legislative races were afflicted by irregularities including media blackout on campaign information harsh restrictions on campaign expenditures onerous electoral procedures that in effect favored rural communist party candidates and government propaganda aimed at discouraging turnout and reducing the appeal of nationalist parties99 even after second round of voting many seats in the legislature remained unfilled and lukashenka used this opportunity to rule by decree many communists and other members of the outgoing legislature opposed lukashenkas effort to eliminate the legislature and pressed for further electoral rounds relenting lukashenka permitted two rounds of voting in late 1995

november 1996 was neither free nor fair according to most international observers the belarusian constitutional court objected that the draft constitution would give the executive branch unacceptable control over the legislative and judicial branches and ruled that the referendum could only be advisory the belarusian central electoral commission head refused demand that he proclaim that the referendum had passed even before the ballots were counted and was fired and the prime minister also resigned following the vote lukashenka implemented the constitution despite the constitutional
