general standards the bulletin was written in prescriptive manner but also appeared to give agencies discretion in its implementation in january 2007 the nas committee reporte d that the proposed bulletin was fundamentally flawed and should be w ithdrawn by omb instead the committee said that omb should issue bulletin that outlines goals and general principles of risk assessments that federal agencies could use to develop their own guidance on september 19 2007 omb withdrew the proposed bulletin and instead issued memorandum reiterating and re inforcing principles for risk assessment that were originally written in 1995 indicating that agencies should comply with the principles reaction to these principles has been ge nerally positive although their impact will likely depend on how

assessment on january 9 2006 the office of management and budgets ombs office of information and regulatory affairs ira released proposed bulletin on risk assessment for comment by the public and for peer review by the national academy of sciences nas1 public comments on the bulletin were requested by june 15 2006 the bulletin proposed to blish general risk assessment and reporting standards and to establish special standard s for influential risk assessments the bulletin applied to all agencies covered by the paperwork reduc tion act ie cabinet departments independent agen cies and independent regulato ry agencies the legal authorities cited for the bulletin include the information quality act iqa2 the regulatory righttoknow act3 which directs omb to issue guidelines to agencies to standardize measures of costs and benefits of federal rules and executive order 128664 which says oira is the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues and requires agencies to base their decisions on the best reasonably obtainable scientific economic or other information omb said the risk assessment bulletin builds on its iqa guidelines5 and its peer review bulletin6 and is intended to be companion document to its guidance on regulatory impact analyses omb circular a47 although characterized as guidan ce in the documents summary the preamble mentioned the requirements of the bulletin and listed the standards with whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33500crs2 8 national research council of the national academy of sciences risk assessment in the federal government managing the process washington dc national academy press 1983each agency shall comply however omb also said that the bulletin applied to all agency risk assessments to the extent appropriate agency heads were authorized to waive or defer some or all of the requirements in the bulletin where warranted by compelling rationale so under the heading of judicial review omb said that the bulletin was intended to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit substantive or procedural enforceable at law or equity against the united states its agencies or other entities its officers or employees or any other person risk assessment was defined in the bulletin as document that assembles and synthesizes scientific information to determine whether potential hazard exists andor the extent of possible risk to human health safety or the environment in regulatory context risk assessment helps agencies identify issues of potential concern eg whether exposure to given risk agent causes effects such as cancer reproductive and genetic bnormalities or ecosystem da mage select regulatory options and estimate forthcoming regulations benefits omb said in the bulletin that it has strong interest in the technical quality of agency risk assessments because these assessments play an impor tant role in the development of public policies at the national international state and local levels omb also said that there is general agreement that the risk assessment process can be improved and said the purpose of the bulletin is to enhance the technical quality and objectivity of risk assessments prepared by federal agencies by establishing uniform minimum standards background on risk assessment risk assessments particularly quantitative assessments date to the first half of the 20th century but their use was accelerated by the enactment of numerous health safety and environmental st atutes in the early 1970s in 1983 nas identified four steps in the risk assessment process 1 hazard identification determining whether substance or situation coul d cause adverse effects 2 doseresponse assessment determining the relationship between the magnitude of the exposure to hazard and the probability and severity of adverse effects 3 exposure assessment identifying the extent to which exposure actually occurs and 4 risk characterization combining the above information into conclusion about the nature and magnitude of the risk8 nas pointed out that this fourste p assessment process is separate and distinct from the decision on where to set regulatory standard which is termed risk management in 1990 congress mandated that commission be formed to make full investigation of the policy implications and appropriate uses of risk assessment and risk management in regula tory programs under various federal laws to prevent cancer and other chronic human health ffects in its 1997 final report the presidentialcongressional commission on ri sk assessment and risk management said that the assessments should be guid ed by an understanding of the issues ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33500crs3 9 presidentialcongressional commission on risk

and the environment9 the commission also noted however that riskrelated controversy of ten arises from what we dont know and from what risk assessments cant tell us data assumptions and context key elements in any risk assessment are the data used in determining the level of risk associated with any given substance or situation in many cases though the data needed to assess risk are lacking for example in 1998 the environmental protection agency epa reported that of 3000 highproductionvolume chemicals those im ported or produced at volumes of 1 million pounds per year full set of toxic ity data was available for only about 200 7 of the chemicals and there was public ly available data for about 43 of the chemicals10 similar data gaps exist regarding the extent to which people are exposed to chemicals for example in 2000 th general accounting office gao now the government accountability office reviewed federal and state efforts to collect human exposure data on more than 1400 naturally occurring and manmade chemicals considered by the department of health and human services hhs epa and other entities to pose threat to human health gao reported that hhs and epa surveys measured exposure of the ge neral population for only 6 of those chemicals11 because of the lack of data agencies must make assumptions as part of the risk assessment process some critics of agencies practices believe those assumptions are unjustifiably precautionary ie designed to ensure that risks are not underestimated in the face of new scien tific data and met hods thereby producing estimates that overstate actual risks nd that those effects are compounded when multiple precautionary assumptions are used12 others though believe that agencies are often not precautionary enough partic ularly when estimating the effects of exposures to multiple chemicals or to account for risks to pa rticularly vulnerable groups eg children the elderly or the infirm13 the legal context in which risk asse ssments are conducted plays an important role in determining what type of assessment is performed and why certain approaches are used for example different agencies and often different offices within singlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33500crs4 14 omb said this standard would not apply to screeninglevel risk assessments in which conservative worst case assumptions and scenarios are used to determine whether any hazard exists in these assessments agencies will proceed to more comprehensive estimate of risk only if evidence of harm is revealedagency have different riskrelated stat utory mandates some statutes require regulatory decisions to be ba sed solely or primarily on ri sk for example section 109 of the clean air act requires epa to set national ambient air quality standards that allow for an ample margin of safety to protect public health other statutes require technologybased st andards eg best availa ble technology and still others require balancing the benefits of risk reduction against the costs incurred in setting risk management goals some st atutes also place the primary responsibility for conducting risk assessments and compiling risk data for particular chemical or source of exposure with industry states or localities not federal agencies for example industry petitioners have the pr imary responsibility to provide the data needed to support registration and toleran ces from epa for their pesticides still other statutes specifically define what will be hazard tell the agency to take certain methodological steps or speci fy an exposure scenario ho wever in many cases the statutes simply provide general framework within which agencies make specific assumptions and methodological choices what ombs proposed bulletin would have required ombs proposed risk assessment bulletin would have estab lished general risk assessment and reporting standards as well as special standards for influential risk assessments the bulletin proposed to make oira in consultation with the office of science and technology po licy responsible for overseeing agency implementation of its requirements general standards with regard to the general standards the bulletin established six risk assessment quality standards that the assessments clearly state the informational needs that drive them as well as their objectives that they clearly summarize the scope of the assessment including identification of the agent technolog or activity at issue the hazard of concern the affected entities and the eventconsequence or dose response relationships for the relevant exposure ranges that they provide qualitative nd where possible quantitative characterization of risk including range of plausible estimates for quantitative measures that they ensure objectivity by neither minimizing nor exaggerating the nature and magnitude of risk14 using the best available data being based on the weight of the available scientific evidence and having high degree of transparency regarding the data assumptions and methodshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33500crs5 15 this is essentially the same standard th at the iqa guidelines say omb is to use to determine whether information is influential and ombs peer review bulletin says that agencies are to use to determine whether info rmation is influential scientific information 16 the narrative text goes on to say that pub lic access to original data is necessary to satisfy this standardthat they explain the basis of each critical assumption and those assumptions that affect the assessments key findings including an evaluation quantitative if possible of the effects of plausible alternative assumptions and that they contain an executive summary that discloses the assessments objectives and scope key findings and key scientific limitations and uncertainties when risk assessment is produced in relation to regulatory analysis for rule with annual economic effects positive or negative of 1 billion or more the bulletin proposed seventh requirement that there be formal quantitative analysis of the relevant uncertainties about benefits and costs th bulletin highlighted several important aspects of risk assessments usef ul for regulatory analysis including 1 identification of baseline risk 2 comparison of baseline risk to alternative mitigation measures noting any countervailing risks caused by those alternatives 3 information on the timing of exposure and the onset of adverse effects and the time between control measures and the cessation of those effects and 4 when risk is measured quantitatively the development of range of plausible risk estimates including central estimate eg weighted average based on relative plausibility special standards for influential risk assessments the proposed bulletin defined an influential risk assessment as one that the agency reasonably can determine will have or does have clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions15 omb said that such assessments include those that determine the level of risk regarding health safety or the environment eg risk assessments that support epas national ambient air qua lity standards or economically significant rulemakings eg those with 100 million impact on the economy in addition to th general standards delineated above the proposed bulletin required all infl uential risk assessments to be capable of being substantially reproduced whic h is defined in the narrative portion of the bulletin referencing the iqa guidelines as meaning that independent reanal ysis of the original or supporting data using the same methods w ould generate similar analytical results16 compare the results of the assessment to other results published on the same topic from qualified scientific organizations which is undefined in the bulletin highlight central estimates as well as highend and lowend estimates of risk when such estimates are

received on draft risk assessment report and issue response to comment document summarizing the significant comments receive d and the agencys responses public comments on the proposed bulletin on june 22 2006 omb posted the comments that it had received regarding the proposed bulletin on its website17 those comments varied significantly with some suggesting ways to make the document str onger and more inclusive whereas others suggested that omb abandon the bulletin altogether for example in its comments on the bulletin the us chamber of commerce said it welcomes and applauds this und ertaking by omb to improve the risk assessments performed by fe deral government agencies and especially in requiring reliable characterization of the uncertainties that impact the quality and useful information content of the assessments18 although it offere d several suggestions for improvement the chamber generally concurred with the text of the bulletin and encouraged its implementati on perhaps most notably the chamber viewed the lack of judicial review as significant weakness that begs the question of what happens if agencies simply choose to ignor the directions given in the bulletin other individuals and organizations wh ile also supporting the issuance of the bulletin urged omb to go further fo r example the national association ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33500crs7 19

bulle tin should be very limited eg declared public emergencies and said the rep roducibility standard for influential assessments should be app lied to all assessments19 the national federation of small businesses questioned the exemption for individual permitting decisions eg epa determinations regarding pesticide applications20 two members of congress proposed deleting the phrase to the exte nt appropriate from the bulletins scope because it suggested that compliance with its requirements was at the discretion of the agencies21 on the other hand the center for pr ogressive reform cpr urged omb to withdraw the proposed bulletin nd abandon efforts to revise it22 cpr said any effort to produce governmentwide ones izefitsall risk assessment requirements would only cause confusion and delay in the developm ent of public and worker protections the organization also stioned why omb should be issuing risk assessment guidance at all since it is st affed primarily with economists and budget analysts not scientists in particular cpr said certain terms in the bulletin are confusing eg central or expected risk and also said that the bulletin requires information that may not exist or would be costly to obtain and may lead to the further ossification of the rulemaking process similarly the natural resources defense council nrdc expressed gra ve misgivings regarding the proposed bulletin and urged omb to withdraw it23 in particular nrdc said issuance of the document as bulletin rather than as guidance and its use of directive terms eg shall suggest that the document is ma ndatory and said the exclusion of risk assessments prepared by private industry for licensing and registration requirements protects industry assessments from scrutiny other commenters raised additional issues the american bar association aba said the proposed bulletin is generally consistent with 1999 aba recommendation on risk assessment but noted several areas for possible improvement eg clarifying the amount of flexibility agencies have to deviate from the bulletins requirements24 the aba also suggested that omb clearly describe the problems that warrant the creation of new risk assessment bulletin and also describe why omb and not the regulatory ag encies is best suited to resolve those problems dr gilbert omenn who chaired the presidentialcongressional commission on risk assessment and risk management in the 1990s said the proposed bulletin has worthy intentions but also said it was too broad and recommended number of impr ovements eg deletion of the influential risk assessment category and its additional requirements he also recommended greater transparency in the omb and agency review processes and the correction of certain omissions eg an exclusi on for research agencies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33500crs8 25 the website is at httpwww8nationalaca demiesorgcpprojectviewaspxkey34282 26 pat phibbs definition of risk assessment deemed too broad by several

national academies division of earth and life sciences began its peer review of ombs proposed bulletin according to the committees website25 its mission was to determine whether the application of the proposed guidance will meet ombs stated objective to enhance the technical quality and objectivity of risk assessments prepared by federal agencies in performing its task the committee will comment in general terms on how the guidance will affect the practice of risk assessment in the federal govern ment the committee will identify critical elements that might be missing fro m the guidance the committee will also determine whether omb appropriately incorporated recommendations from previous reports of the nrc national research council and other organizations into the proposed risk assessment guidance in addition the committee will assess whether there are scientific or technical circumstances that might limit applicability of the guidance on may 22 2006 the committee held public meeting on ombs proposed risk assessment bulletin according to press acc ounts the nine federa l agency officials who testified at the meeting voiced variety of opinions about the bulletin26 for example the director of fdas center fo r drug evaluation and research reportedly said that if the bulletin was made final in its thencurrent form doctors and the public might not receive timely warnings about pot ential health risks posed by drugs and medical devices eg warnings related to the use of the antiinflammatory drug vioxx to illustrate the fda director said that of 109 safety alerts that fda issued in 2005 92 of them would have been consid ered risk assessments under the bulletin and therefore would have been delayed by the required analyses he and two other agency officials from the national institute of environmental health sciences and the national institute for occupational safety and healths risk evaluation branch reportedly said that the bulletins definition of risk assessment is so broad that many types of federal analyses could be inappropr iately covered by its requirements on the other hand epas science advisor was quoted as saying that the agency was in pretty good shape in terms of meeting the requirements in the proposed bulletin but nevertheless suggested that th guidance be revised to explain how much flexibility agencies have regarding its requirements eg how agencies can get waivers from the bulletins requirements27 he and an official from the national aeronautics and space administration also said that some aspects of the bulletin would conflict with their own agencyspecific guidance documents on risk assessment and it was not clear how t hose conflicts should be resolved representative from the department of

nas report was not available to the public but prepublication executive summary was available at httpbooksnapedu openbookphprecord_id11811page11 guidelines noting that any increased cost would be justified by improvements in the resulting risk assessments issuance of nas report on january 11 2007 the nas committee issued its final report concluding that omb s proposed risk assessment guidance was fundamentally flawed nd should be withdrawn28 the committee said that it fully supports the goal of increasing the quality and objectivity of risk assessment in the federal government but also said that it agrees unanimously that the omb bulletin would not facilitate reaching this goal among other things the committee said that the proposed bulletin used definition of risk assessmen t that was too br oad and conflicts with longestablished concepts and practices used definition of adverse effect that was too narrow and ignored fundamental health goal of controlling exposures before the impairment of an organism gave little attention to sensitive popul ations such as children and the elderly failed to explain the basis for exempting risk assessments associated with licensing and pproval processes and ignored the continuum of risk asse ssment efforts by arbitrarily using only two broad categories the report also criticized omb for failing to identify the problem its guidance sought to address and said the proposed bulletins most glaring omission was the absence of criteria and information for gauging the benefits to be achieved by implementing the bulletin that is benefitcost analysis in general the nas committee said that risk assessment is not monolithic process thus one size does not fit all nor can one set of technical guidance make sense for the heterogeneous risk assessments undert aken by federal agencies instead of finalizing the proposed bulletin the nas committee recommended that omb issue bulletin that outlines goals and general principles of risk assessments that would enhance the quality efficiency and consistency of such studies federal agencies could then be required to develop their own risk assessment guidance which would be peer reviewed and contain procedures for ensuring compliance the committee said that the agencies or expert panels appointed by the agencies should deve lop these detailed guidance

28 2007 p a42 33 ibidbecause therein lies the depth of expertise to address the issues relevant to their specific types of risk assessments in response to the nas committee report omb reportedly said that it would not issue the proposed bulletin in final form and was considering what further steps to take possible future acti ons reportedly include the velopment of new proposed bulletin similar to how om b responded to adverse co mments on its peer review bulletin the issuance of new fina l bulletin or some other action updated principles for risk assessment on september 19 2007 susan dudley administrator of oira and sharon l hays associate director and deputy director for science in the office of science and technology policy jointly issued memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies entitled updated principles for risk analysis29 the memorandum indicated that the proposed risk assessment bulletin would not be issued in final form instead the memora ndum reinforced general principles for risk analysis that were issued in 199530 reiterating the text of the principles and referencing more recent guidance where ppropriate for example the memorandum noted that the 1996 amendments to the safe drinking water act sdwa had established certain standards for risk asse ssments and risk characterizations pursuant to the act and that agencies had adopted or adapted these standards as part of their information quality act guidelines it also referenced requirements in omb circular a4 regarding accepted practices for regu latory analysis and 2007 omb bulletin on good guidance practices31 reaction to the risk memorandum has been generally positive sally katzen of the george mason university school of law who was oira administrator during the clinton administration and who issued the 1995 principles said the memorandum was responsive to the nas critique32 similarly rena steinzor of the university of maryland school of law and the center for pr ogressive regulation said the memorandum indicated that omb had backed down from its earlier position and was not anything close to what omb had set out to do33 representatives from the national association of manufacturers and the americanchemistry council were gene rally supportive of the memo randum representative from omb watch however expressed concer n that the memorandum is an attempt to bootstrap more recent omb policies onto the 1995 principles jim tozzi ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33500crs11 34 ibidformer oira official who currently heads the center for regulatory effectiveness said it was significant that omb indicated that it would enforce the aspirational goals in the 1995 policy statement34 concluding observations the nas committees conclusion in its january 2007 report that ombs proposed risk assessment bulletin was funda mentally flawed appears to have had major effect on the principles of risk assessment that omb issued in september 2007 as some observers have noted how ever much depends on how aggressively omb chooses to implement those principl general statem ents that agencies should use the best reasonably obtainable scientific inform ation to assess risks and that those analyses should be based on th best available scie ntific methodologies information data and weight of the ava ilable scientific evidence can be broadly interpreted and benign or can be used to stop agency rulemaking the nas committee also pointed out that omb had not clearly established need for governmentwide requirements and had not included any information on the expected costs and benefits of their implementation to establish need the nas committee implicitly suggested the establishmen t of baseline of each agencys risk assessment proficiency including the extent to which generally satisfactory and highquality risk assessments are pr oduced or how some agencies fall short of the specified standards to date omb has not developed such base line or established what problem in agencies risk assessments the new policy statement is intended to correct related legisla tion has been introduced in the 110th congress
