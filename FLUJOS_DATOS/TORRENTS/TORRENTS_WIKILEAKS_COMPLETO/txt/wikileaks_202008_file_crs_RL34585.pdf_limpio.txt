disaster or when disaster is deemed imminent emac establishes procedure for requesting assistance and lists the respons ibilities of requesting st ates and assisting states among other things the emergency management director in requesting state is responsible for confirming that the governor has declared state of emergency creating list of needed resour ces including manpower specialized skills and equipment alerting the emac standing res ponse team that assistance may be needed and if necessary contacting specific state to alert appropriate authorities that specific resource may be needed emac also lists the responsibilities of the emergency management director in an assisting state these include confirming that the state has the resources to match the request for assistance notifying the governor of the sp ecific resources that have been requested and receiving the gove rnors approval to deploy the resources and responding to the requesting state within two hours specifying the extent to which the requestin g assistance can be provided17 some resources are commonly found in states such as mobile command vehicles public assistance teams and mporary shelters

provide reasonabl protection for such state18 legal and financial aspects articles v and vi of emac address professional qualifi cations and immunity from liability person from one state who renders assistance in another state and who holds license certificate or other permit for professional mechanical or other skills is considered under the emac provisions to be licensed certified or permitted to exercise those duties in the requesting state subject to limitations or conditions set by the governor of the reque sting state where officers or employees of one state render aid to another under

for acts or omissions in good faith while rendering aid including providing supplies and related equipment good faith in this context does not include willful misconduct gross negligence or recklessness also under ar ticle iv of emac emergency forces are to enjoy duties privileges and powers other than arrest power comparable to those under the law of the state wher assistance is being given emac also is intended to resolve the issue of reimbursement for loss damage or expenses incurred by state that pr ovides aid in response to request for assistance the compact establishes standard process that guarantees such reimbursement to the states that lend assistance it does not preclude states that render aid from assuming some or all of these attendant costs or from loaning equipment or donating services the st ates can also enter into supplemental agreements on the allocation of costs depending upon whether the president has made disaster declaration states rendering aid may be eligible for reimbursement not only from the state receiving assistance but also from the federal government at the same time states remain primarily responsible for th pay and benefits of their own personnelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34585crs6 19 emac postdeployment survey results available at httptestemacweborg866 hereafter cited as emac survey results 20 further research and survey
