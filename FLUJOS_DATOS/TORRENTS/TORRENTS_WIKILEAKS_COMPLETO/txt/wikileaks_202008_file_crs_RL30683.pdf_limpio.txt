distribution of their product by digital transmissions without hampering the arrival of new technologies and without imposing new and unreasonable burdens on radio and television broadcasters traditional analog transmissions5 the dpra reflected compromises among the priva sector interests most directly affected by it recording companies performers composers and lyricists music publishers and digital cable subscription music services the new performance right essentially impacted only subscription ie feebased or interactive transmissions of sound recordings and musical works other

activities8 the public performance right in digital audio transmission of sound recordings is relatively new the immunity from copyright infringement for service providers established under the digital millennium copyright act is even more recent these provisions play large role in the courts recent consideration of copyright infringement liability allegations against mp3com and napster the mp3 controversy mp3 which is the popular term to describe technology known as moving picture experts group mpeg 1 audio layer 3 has been referred to by at least one court as the revolutiona ry new method of music distribution made possible by digital recording and the internet9 prior to the introduction of digital audio recording individuals wanting to copy sound recording were limited to analog technology successive copying by analog techniques resulted in increased degradation of sound quality hence copyright infringement by unauthorized duplication of cassettes and cds was frustrated by the inability of copier to replicate music with high quality sound the introduction of digital audio recording to consum er electronics during the 1980s facilitated high quality mass copying music pirates are able to use digital technology to make and distribute near perfect but infringing copies of commercially prepared recordings prior to the advent of mp3 technology however the internet was not feasible vehicle for music distribution because the average music computer file was too big the digital information on single compact disc of music required hundreds of computer floppy discs to store and downloading even single song from the internet took hours however various compression algorithms which make an audio file smaller by limiting the audio bandwidth now allow digital audio files to be transferred more quickly and stored more efficiently mp3 is the most popular digital audio compression algorithm in use on the internet and the compression it provides makes an audio file smaller by factor of twelve to one without significantly reducing sound quality mp3s popularity is due in large part to the fact that it is standard nonproprietary compression algorithm freely available for use by anyone unlike various proprietary and copyrightsecure competitor algorithms coupled with the use of cable modems compressionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30683crs4 10id at

proliferate on the internet in variety of formats the issue before the courts is not the legality of the technology but whether and the extent to which it is used to facilitate music piracy performing artists such as dr dre the rock band metallica and music industry associations have publicized the economic harm they perceive from music piracy and its magnitude11 metallica presented the digital

as college and high school students some mp3 music consumers express resentment over the notion of being denied access to or charged for downloadable music from the internet they argue among other things that musicsharing technology is simply too far advanced to contain through copyright infringement litigation and that shutti ng down any given web site will only spawn more music delivery services with more sophisticated technology indeed news accounts point to development of new underground file sharing tools such as gnutella and freenet12 ultimately digital music delivery options represent yet another clash between technology and traditional copyright law principles governing sound recordings some commentators suggest that it is the business model of music distribution not copyright law that must adapt the labels may succeed in squelching napster which has already lost major court battle and gnutella an even more insidious filesharing client but right now in some suburban bedroom or urban dorm room kid is probably hunched over her keyboard working on newer faster slicker piece of filesharing software and theres probably another kid working on better compression format ultimately it will be technology and economics not lawyers or megabands that will call the tune in the music business13 recent decisions by two us district courts however indicate that the unauthorized use of mp3 technology to download music from the internet may constitute copyright infringement and the music industry and the courts will act to stop it the interaction of law

that manufacturers of home videotape recorders demonstrated that substantial numbers of copyright holders who licensed their works for broadcast on free television would not object to having their broadcasts time shifted by private viewers further the owners of copyrights on television programs failed to demonstrate that time shifting would cause any harm to the potential market for or the

basic principles of copyright law the court found infringement and rejected the defendants argument that its use of the plaintiffs recordings came within the fair use exception to the copyright holders exclusive rights 17 usc 106 107 the defendant mp3com operates service called mymp3com which was advertised as permitting subscribers to store customize and listen to the recordings contained on their cds from any place where they have an internet connection15 the defendant purchased thousands of cds in which the plaintiffs held copyrights and without authorization copied the recordings onto its computer server subscribers upon initial proof of ownership of the cd could then access it via the internet from any computer anywhere subscribers would prove ownership of any given cd by either inserting it into the computers cdrom drive or through purchase from one of the defendants online retailers mp3com argued that its service was the functional equivalent of space shifting or storing the subscribers cd and was analogous to the time shifting permitted by the us supreme court in sony corp of america v universal city studios16 but the court disagreed finding presumptive case of copyright infringement because mp3com was in fact utilizing its unauthorized copy of the cd for the subscriber nor did the court find any basis to support the defendants assertion that its use of the plaintiffs recordings constituted fair use finally the court rejected the defendants claim that it was providin g useful service to consumers that would otherwise be provided by pirates the court concluded that the defendants consumer protection argument amounts to nothing more than bald claim that defendant should be able to misappropriate plaintiffs property simply because there is consumer

considering the claims of plaintiff record companies who are suing napster alleging contributory and vicarious federal copyright infringement napster inc is popular service which makes its musicshare software freely available for internet users to download utilizing the software enables users to share mp3 music files with others logged on to the napster system napster allows users to exchange mp3 files stored on their own computer harddrives directly and without payment napster has other functions as well such as permitting users to play downloaded song or participate in chat room and promoting independent artists through its new artists program the distric t court has issued two substantive decisions to date one denying napsters motion for summary judgment on the ground that it was exempt from copyright infringeme nt liability under the dmca20 and another finding that the recording companies have established prima facie case of copyright infringement and are likely to succeed on their claims that the exchange of files by napster users is not fair use and that plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief21 although the court issued preliminary injunction requiring napster to shut down by july 28 2000 or prevent further copyright infringement the ninth circuit court of appeals issued an order on the same day staying the district courts injunction pending appeal22 on february 12 2001 the ninth circuit issued its ruling holding for the plaintiff recording companies23 the court of appeals upheld the district courts conclusions respecting the plaintiffs likelihood of prevailing on the issues namely that napster users engage in direct copyright infringement and that napster itself engages in contributory andor vicarious copyright infringement the court affirmed the issuance of the preliminary injunction but directed the district court to narrow the scope of the injunction to limit the burden on napster to prevent copyright infringement ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30683crs7 2417 usc 512a15 25id at 512kthan placing the entire burden of preventing copyright infringement on napster the recording companies must meet their burden of providing notice of infringing content the court of appeals affirmed the district court in part reversed in part and remanded the case back to district court hence newly crafted injunction by the district court will in all likelihood end the publics music sharing of copyrighted songs through napsters traditional software format napsters motion for summary judgment in the order denying napsters motion for summary judgment the us district court addressed complicated question arising under the digital millennium copyright act acknowledging the issue to be one of first impression the court held that napsters business activities do not clearly fall within the safe harbor provision of the dmca 17 usc 512a so as to insulate it from liability for damages for copyright infringement naps ter argued that its service comes within the recently enacted safe harbor provision of the dmca 17 usc 512 subsection protects various types of service provider passive conduit activity from liability specifically service provider is not liable for copyright infringement by reason of the providers transmitting routing or providing connections for material throug h system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider or by reason of the intermediate and transient storage of that material if 1 the transmission of the material was initiated by or at the direction of person other than the service provider 2 the transmission routing provision of connections or storage is carried out through an automatic technical process without selection of the material by the service provider 3 the service provider does not select the recipients of the material except as an automatic response to the request of another person 4 copy of the material made by the service provider in the course of such intermediate or transient storage is maintained on the system or network in manner ordinarily accessible to anyone other than anticipated recipients and such copy is maintained on the system or network in manner ordinarily accessible to such anticipated recipients for longer period than is reasonably necessary for the transmission routing or provision of connections and 5 the material is transmitted through the system or network without modification of its content24 in its motion for summary judgment napster argued that it satisfies the statutory definition of service provider25 because the mp3 file resides on the host users hard drive and is transmitted through the internet to the recipients browser and hard drive napster argued that it meets the passive conduit criteria of 512a generally and the specific criteria of subsection a15 but the court rejected napsters argument it held that 512a does not protect the transmission of mp3 files because napster neither transmits routes nor provides connections through system or network controlled by it instead it found thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30683crs8 262000 wl 1182467 12 ndcal 2717 usc 107 entitled limitation on exclusive rights fair use provides in relevant part in determining whether the use made of work in any particular case is fair use the factors to be considered shall include 1 the purpose and character of the use inclu ding whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 2 the nature of the copyrighted work 3 the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole and 4 the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted worknapster enables or facilitates the initiation of connections but the connections do not pass through the system within the meaning of 512a the us district courts finding of copyright infringement in lengthy opinion the court explained why it finds that napsters users are engaging in copyright infringement why the fair use defense to infringement is inapplicable and why napster is likely to be found to be contributorily or vicariously liable for copyright infringement the court found prima facie case of direct infringement by napster users because virtually all napster users engage in the unauthorized downloa ding or uploading of copyrighted music as much as eightyseven percent of the files available on napster may be copyrighted and more than seventy percent may be owned or administered by plaintiffs26 it rejected napsters fair use defense on variety of grounds finding that users did not meet any of the statutory parameters establishing fair use27 purpose and character of use while acknowledging that users downloading from napster are not engaging in paradigmatic commercial activity neither are they engaged in personal use in the traditional sense ie copying occurring within the household which does not confer any financial benefits on the user the court concluded that the vast scale of napster use among anonymous individuals does not constitute personal use most important however napster users receive for free something that they would otherwise purchase which may adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work nature of the work the court found that the sound recordings consti tute entertainment not educational material amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole the court found it to be undisputed that the copying of mp3 music files involves copying the entirety of the work which is inconsistent with fair usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30683crs9 282000 wl 1182467 13 quoting from sony supra 29id at 17the effect of the use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work the record companies produced evidence demonstrating that napster use reduces cd sales among college students and raises barriers to the companies entry into the market for digital downloading of music the court also decisively rejected sampling and space shifting of music as potential fair uses of the napster servi ce copyright owners earn royalties from streamed song samples on retail web sites like amazoncom even if music sampling by napster users did lead to enhanced cd sales unauthorized downloading deprives music publishers of royalties for individual songs and would not constitute fair use and while the practice of time shifting of television programming was upheld by the us supreme court in sony corp of american supra the district court had trouble distinguishing consumers use of napster from their usage of vcrs to tape tv while time shifting tv broadcasts merely enables viewer to see work which he has been invited to witness in its entirety free of charge plaintiffs in this action almost always charge for their music even if it is downloaded song bysong28 contributory copyright infringement involves inducing causing or materially contributing to the infringing conduct of another liability for vicarious copyright infringement may arise when party has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and has direct financial interest in the activity sony also holds that copyright holder cannot extend his monopoly to products capable of noninfringing uses but the court was unwilling to accept napsters assertion that its music space shifting its message boards its chat rooms and its program to introduce and promote new music artists are valid and fair uses which render its service capable of substantial noninfringing uses it rejected the assertion that napster provides noninfringing uses sufficient to overcome its role in contributory copyright infringement napster incs facilitation of unauthorized filesharing smacks of the contributory infringement in these cases rather than the legitimate conduct of the vcr manufacturers given defendants control over the service as opposed to mere manufacturing or selling the existence of potentially unobjectionable use like spaceshifting does not defeat plaintiffs claims29 and although napster did not obtain direct financial benefit from the infringing activity the court noted that benefit does not require earned revenue so long as the defendant has economic incentives for tolerating unlawful behavior napsters business plan to monetize its user base in the future supplied sufficient economic incentive to support liability for vicarious infringementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30683crs10 30am records inc v napster inc 2001 wl 115033 9th cir feb 12 2001 31id at 15 32id at 13 33id at 15 citations omittedfinally napster argued that granting an injunction would be an over broad remedy imposing prior restraint on free speech in violation of the first amendment napsters electronic directory which does not contain copyrighted material is entitled to first ame ndment protection because it contends that its infringing and noninfringing services are inseparable napster argued the injunction would have the effect of shutting it down again the court rejected the assertion for two reasons first the court observed that free speech concerns are protected by and coextensive with the fair use doctrine the recording companies were not attempting to enjoin any fair uses of the napster service second if napster services are inseparable as it contends the inseparability is its doing and its legitimate function cannot be used to support infringement the ninth circuit court of appeals decision30 the court of appeals found that the lower court record supported its findings with respect to direct contributory and vicarious copyright infringement it rejected napsters defenses against direct infringement allegations namely fair use sampling and spaceshifting with respect to copyright infringement the court of appeals approved the district courts finding that napster has actual knowledge that specific infringing material is available using its system and that it could block access to the system by suppliers of the infringing material and that if failed to remove the material31 however the court wished to make clearer distinction between the architecture of the napster system and napsters conduct in relation to the operational capacity of the system than the district court did32 specifically applying the sony decision supra the court of appeals opined that the district court did not give enough weight to napsters argument that its software is capable of substantial noninfringing uses as well as infringing ones the district court improperly confined the use analysis to current uses and ignored the systems capabilities as result it gave undue weight to the proportion of current infringing uses as compared to current and future noninfringing use we agree that if computer system operator learns of specific infringing material available on his system and fails to purge such material from the system the operator knows of and contributes to direct infringement conversely absent any specif ic information which identifies infringing activity computer system operator cannot be liable for contributory infringe ment merely because the structure of the system allows for the exchange of copyrighted material to enjoin simply because computer network allows for infringing use would in our opinion violate sony and potentially restrict activity unrelated to infringing use33 the court of appeals found vicarious infringement liability arising from napsters ability to supervise users and prevent infringing music exchanges but thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30683crs11 34id at 22 35the us copyright office filed an amicus curiae brief in the case arguing the 17 usc 1008 does not excuse napster from infring ement liability it is available online at httpwwwlocgovcopyrightdocsnapsteramicuspdf 362000 wl 1160678 sdny aug 17 2000district court failed to recognize the architectural limitations on its ability to control and patrol its users napster does not read the content of the hosts indexed files other than to check that they are in the proper mp3 format as practical matter napster its users and the record companies have equal access to the infringing material in the napster system therefore in its remand directive to the district court the court explained the preliminary injunction which we stayed is overbroad because it places on napster the entire burden of ensuring that copying downloading uploading transmitting or distributing of plaintiffs works occur on the system as we stated we place the burden on plaintiffs to provide notice to napster of copyrighted works and files containing such works available on the napster system before napster has the duty to disable access to the offending content napster however also bears the burden of policing the system within the limits of the system34 the court of appeals considered two additional statutes which napster asserted insulated it from liability for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement the audio home recording act ahra 17 usc 1008 and the dmca 17 usc 512 the ahra immunizes certain manufacturers and users of digital audio recording devices from liability for copyright infringement again affirming the lower court the ninth circuit found the ahra to be irrelevant to napster because it does not cover the downloading of mp3 files to computer hard drives35 but it was not willing to goes as far as the district court in rejecting any possible safe harbor from copyright infringement for internet service providers under the dmca while the district court had rejected the notion of safe harbor under 17 usc 512 the appeals court held that the statute was not inapplicable per the court recognized that napster would be permitted to develop its argument that it qualifies for immu nity as an internet service provider more fully at trial leaving the question open however did not alter the equities

discovered the css encryp tion algorithm and keys based on this information they created decss program capable of decrypting or ripping encrypted dvds mr johansen posted the decss code on his internet web site although mr johansen was subject to charges filed in norway he is not defendant in the studios suit defendants include eric corley described as leader of the computer hacker community37 and his company 2600 enterprises which publishes magazine called 2600 the hacker quarterly defendants posted the decss code on the 2600com web site the studios filed suit under the dmca to enjoin the defendants from posting decss and to prevent them from electronically linking their site to others that post it the defendants responded with self described electronic civil disobedience ie they increased their efforts to link their web site to others to continue to make decss available38 the defendants argued that their postings do not violate the dmca and that its anticircumvention of encryption provisions as applied to computer program s and their code violate the first amendment anticircumvent ion provisions of the dmca the dmca added new chapter 12 to the copyright act entitled

that would run under linux as opposed to windows operating system the court concluded that css is technological means that effectively controls access to the plaintiffs dvd motion pictures that the only function of decss is to circumvent css and that defendants did offer and provide decss by posting it on their web site the defendants subjective intent ie whether they posted the code in order to infringe or encourage others to infringe copyright does not matter under 17 usc 1201 nor did the activity come within any of 1201s statutory exceptions for reverse engineering 39 good faith encryption research40 or security testing41 fair use the court found that the defendants raised significant point in the assertion that access control measures like css may prevent lawful as well as unlawful uses of copyrighted material for example it could thwart the ability of film studies professor to prepa re cdrom containing two different scenes from movies to illustrate lecture on cinematography but the defendants were not being sued for copyright infringement to which fair use is defense they were sued for violating the anticircumvention provision of the dmca which by express congressional intent precludes the fair use defense the fact that congress elected to leave technologi cally unsophisticated persons who wish to make fair use of encrypted copyrighted works without the technical means of doing so is matter for congress unless congress decision contravenes the constitution42 the first amendment with that said the court went on to consider whether the dmcas anticircumvention provisions as applied to prevent the public dissemination of decss violate the first amendment the court acknowledged that defendants accurately assert that computer code to the extent it is used to express ideas may be protected speech but went on to analyze both its function and the level of protection afforded in the case before it as its starting point the court posed the question whether the dmca as applied to restrict dissemination of decss and other computer code used to circumvent access control measures is content based restriction on speech or content neutral regulation the former is subject to strict judicial scrutiny standard to review the legitimacy of governmental regulation while the latter is subject to lesser or intermediate level the court concluded that even though the substance of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30683crs14 43id at 26 44id at 32 footnotes omittedcomputer code may be expressive decss has functional nonspeech aspect it enables recipients to circumvent the css system societys increasing dependence upon technological means of controlling access to digital files and systems and its importance in the digital world led the court to elevate the functional aspect of the decss computer program and to hold that the anticircumvention provision of the dmca is valid content neutral regulation in furtherance of important governmental interests here dissemination itself carries very substantial risk of imminent harm because the mechanism is so unusual by which dissemination of means of circumventing access controls to copyrighted works threatens to produce virtually unstoppable infringement of copyright43 injunctive relief the same urgency which compelled the court to elevate the comp uter programs functionality over its characterization as expressive speech supported the courts issuance of broad injunctive relief against the posting of decss it viewed the interest served by prohibiting the enabling of piracy and thereby protecting the monopoly granted copyright owners as being of constitutional dimension hence it enjoined others from posting decss by linking web sites it acknowledged that the extension of the prohibition to internet hyperlinks could have possible chilling effect or be viewed as too broad and issued the following caveat accordingly there may be injunction against nor liability for linking to site containing circumvention technology the offering of which is unlawful under the dmca absent clear and convincing evidence that those responsible for the link know at the relevant time that the offending material is on the linkedto site b know that it is circumvention technology that may not lawfully be offered and c create or maintain the link for the purpose of disseminating that technology 44 finding monetary damages to be inadequate and proof of actual damages to be difficult if not impossible the court granted permanent injunction against the posting of decss it addressed the defendants argument that an injunction would be futile because decss is already all over the internet to deny relief would be to encourage others to replicate unlawful conduct to create futility defense but the court was more troubled by the magnitude of destruction of intellectual property rights posed by the internet these defendants would harm plaintiffs every day on which they post decss on their heavily trafficked web site and link to other sites that post it because someone who does not have decss thereby might obtain it this decision will serve notice on others that the strong right arm of equity may be brought to bear against them absent change in their conduct and thus contribute to climate of appropriate respect for intellectual property rights in an age in which the
