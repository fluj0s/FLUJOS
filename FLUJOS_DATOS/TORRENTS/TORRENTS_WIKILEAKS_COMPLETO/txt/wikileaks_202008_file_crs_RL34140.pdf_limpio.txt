a76 is policy and process fi rst initiated in 1966 that was designed to determine whether federal employees or priv ate sector contractors are best to perform activities deemed commercial series of articles that first appeared in the washington post chronicled the dilapidated cond itions and the substandard medical treatment afforded to retu rning veterans media reports surrounding the competition have suggested that one possible contributin g factor to the walter reed controversy was the decision to priva tize base support services what caused the problems at walter reed to what extent were the problems related to the a76 competition did it go badly because a76 is an inherently flawed policy or was it convergence of events should congress draw any conclusions from the outcome of the walter reed competition for future competitions on military medical facilities while it may be hard to draw conclusions of cause and eff ect there may be lessons learned applicable to future competitions some have suggested that constrained army resources due to convergence of events may have caused andor contributed to the problems in the competition and led to the attrition of skilled base support services staff other factors that may have affected the process were the entry of the united states into combat operations in iraq and afghanistan 2005 base rea lignment and closure

a76 implications for the future introduction the walter reed army medical center wramc was the subject of controversy that calle d attention to several issues including the policy and process governing the conduct of omb circular a76 competitions the state of the military health care system and planned base realignment and closure brac action1 series of articles that first appeared in the washington post chronicled the dilapidated conditions and s ubstandard outpatient treatment given to some returning veterans the articles were written by two washington po st reporters who conducted fourmonth investigation on the campus reportedly without the knowledge or permission of army officials2 since their investigation wramc was the subject of several investig ations and congressional hearin gs the investigations have focused primarily on the military health care system yet another important element of this situation is the outcome of th us armys decision to conduct public private competition or competition for ba support services under circular a763 some media reports had suggested that one of the factors that may have caused or contributed to the substandard conditions existing at some of the facilities at walter reed was the push to priva tize base support services4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34140crs2 5 for discussion on omb circ ular a76 see crs report rl32017

the bush administration revised the circular as recommendation of the commercial activities panel6 army vice chief of staff general richard cody tes tified that the army accepted full responsibility for the substandard conditions and that being on the brac list did not give wramc priority for repairs or building replacement7 several members of congress introduced legislation to either cancel the wramc a76 competition or prohibit the appropriation of funds for th conduct of future studies at military medical facilities as result of the issues raised at wr amc both private and public sectors have identified flaws in this competition specifically as well as in the policies governing a76 this report will examine the issues surrounding the wramc publicprivate competition conducted under om b circular a76 and discuss some options that congress may want to consider in its oversight role the wramc competition raised questions that are likely to shape competitions for years to come lessons learned may help congress to determine whether a76 costcom parison studies are the most appropriate way to achieve costs savings and efficiencies in the activities of the federal government several legislative provisi ons in hr 4986 the proposed fy2008 ndaa would impact the conduct of future competitions the army has since announced its plan to cancel all its competitions at its medical facilities for 2007 and 2008 prior to this decision future competitions were already planned for various army facilities including fort detrick maryland and the range of activities would have incl

commercial activities revised may 29 2003 httpwwwwhitehousegovombcircularsa076a76_incl_tech_correctionhtmlwhat is omb circular a76 the omb circular a76 first issued in 1966 defines federal policy for determining whether recurring commercia l activities should be performed by the private sector or federal employees in addition to the circular companion piece of legislation called the federal activitie s inventory reform fair act of 19989 requires federal agencies on an annual basis to prepar and submit inventories of their commercial activities performed by federal employees to the office of management and budget omb the circular requires federal executive agencies to prepare annually lists of activities that are considered both commercial and inherently governmental in general commercial activ ities are subject to competition while inherently governmental activities are not the determination of how activities are classified ultimately depends on several factors the circular describes what makes activities inherently governmental an inherently governmental activity is an activity that is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by government personnel these activities require the exercise of substantial discretion in applying government authority andor in making decisions for the government inherently governmental activities normally fall into two categories the exercise of sovereign government authority or the establishment of procedures and processes related to the oversight of monetary tr ansactions or entitlements an inherently governmental activity involves 1 binding the united states to take or not to take some action by contract policy regulation authorization order or otherwise 2 determining protecting and advancing economic political territorial property or other interests by military or diplomatic action civil or criminal judicial proceedings ct management or otherwise 3 significantly affecting the life liberty or property of private persons or 4 exerting ultimate control over the acquis ition use or disposition of united states property real or personal tangible or in tangible including establishing policies or procedures for the collection control or disbursement of appropriated and other federal funds10 the circular was revised in 2003 at the recommendation of commercial activities panel cap cap also recommended abolishing omb circular a76 and replacing it with an integrated competition process based on combining of elements of federal acquisition regu lations far and the a76 circular in general many federal employees and labor organizations believe that the 76 process is unfairly slanted in favor of the private sector while private sector contractors generally believe that government employ ees have an unfair advantage in a76 competitions for example among some a76 observers the attrition of skilled personnel may be view ed differently the national treasury employees union nteu president colleen kelley bl amed the exodus of key personnel athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34140crs4 11 statement from colleen kelley nteu 12 statement of stan soloway professional services council 13 an

national naval medical center and fort belvoir 15 section 1101f 2 refers to such gaps in the workforce as shortcomings in the number of employees possessing certain skills and comp etencies as well as shortcomings in the availability of those skills and competencieswramc to conditions which were notat all surprising result of the federal contracting process that drives experienced federal employees from their jobs and seeks to replace them with unacc ountable private contractors11 however another observer president of the professional servi ces council psc stan soloway stated that walter reeds deterioration reflected on wramcs poor management capability and not the work of the contractor the issues at wramc he said are resources and facility capability longstanding problems that may have caused federal employees to leave in the first place12 he points out that the contractor at wramc cannot be held accountable because it did not begin contract work until february 4 200713 major new developments hr 5658 the housepassed versi on of the fy2009 national defense authorization bill has provision section 2721 that would halt the closure of the walter reed army medical center and disc

until the secretary of defense certifies to th congressional defense committees that each of the conditions imposed has been satisfie d and period of seve n days has expired following the date on which the certification is received by the comm ittees14 another provision in the bill section 325 would temporarily suspend the conduct of future dod publicp rivate competitions regarding the conversion of functions performed by dod civilians to performance by contractors from the date of the enactment of the bill until september 30 2011 s 3001 the senateproposed versio n of the fy2009 national defense authorization bill has provision sec tion 1101 that requires dod to develop strategic human capital plan designed to improve the civilian acquisition workforce as part of this provision dod would be prohibited from conducting any public private competition under a76 or any ot her law or regulation without first addressing the filling of gaps in the current workforce15 pl

differential meaning that activities can be converted to or from pe rformance by inhouse federal employees to the private sector unless there is min imal cost differentia l of 10 million or 10 this means that in order to win the co mpetition the meo is required to show savings of at least 10 million or 10 over the private sector contr actors costs the minimum cost differential is established so that the government will not convert to contractor performance for marginal estimated savings18 competitive sourcing goals u nder the bush administration competitive sourcing through managed

agen cy ima planned to study 1574 positions in fy2006 and 13500 positions by fy200921 policy questions the wramc competition is seen as an important one to examine it is competition where many things reportedly went wrong and it occurred in the midst of larger controversy some have described the events at walter reed as the perfect storm in his testimony befo re the house subcommittee the honorable jack marsh former secretary of the army and cochair of th independent review group described the situation at walter reed others have described what occurred at walter reed as the perfect storm the confluence of three forces that compromi sed the ability of the hospital to deliver to some patients the standard of care c onsistent with the traditions of its past these forces were the unexpected ca sualty load of the iraq war the contracting out requirements imposed by the 76 program which is administered by omb and dragged on fo r over five crucial years and the decision to close walter reed pursuan t to brac action an action that was ratified by the congress22 the difficulties at walter reed were so acknowledged by president george w bush when he stated the problems at walter reed were caused by bureaucratic and administrative failures the system failed you and it fa iled our troops and were going to fix it23 this a76 competition may serve as an object lesson in what can happen when federal agency fails to manage numerous conflicting and competing goals and objectives some have also surmised as to whether the culture of the army caused andor contributed to failure to take appr opriate action others have questioned whether the desire to reach the bush administrations competitive sourcing goals overrode other considerations in light of these observations there are at least three policy questions that congress may want to consider in the exercise of its oversight role over the c onduct of future a76 studies are the decisions made during the course of the wramc competition likely to shape futu re publicprivate competitionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34140crs8 24 at least one other competition has taken long er two studies were conducted at keesler air force

of the senate appropriations committee march 7 2007in maintenance and upkeep activities needed at wramc after the start of combat operations as the reason why the co mpetition took longer than expected attrition of skilled base operating support staff the most immediate impact of an announcement of pending a76 competition is often that skilled personnel are the first to quit while new employees are usually sought to replace those leaving however some potential new employees have been reluctant to accept jobs that are in the midst of transition even employees who may be part of the proposed meo may start to look for other jobs publicprivate competitions that take an inordinate amount of time to complete may also raise the anxiety level among existing employees and create

a76 competitions while he was not invol ved in the walter reed competition his comments reveal that the exodus of staff is not confined to the army he stated we have not had similar incidents of 76 studies on as grand scale as walter reed has but i would tell you in general whenever you promulgate an a76 competition the very best people that we have start looking for other jobs and we end up with dearth of people in the billets that are currently filled and very often i think it comes out that government worker someone on the general schedule or one of our contractors is at least as

identified to the army as process delegate norton just let id trying to get an answer because i know they want to move on would it have been the better side of wisdom not to privatize everything here except the clinical and medical workforce and therefore add to the stability or the instability th at inevitably comes with brac general kiley it did increase the instabilitynorton thank you sir

costs associated with disruption and loss of productivity related to the competition process59 threlkeld has stated that because the congressional waiver of the 30month limit expired at the end of fy2004 in fy2005 nd fy2006 the army was in violation of the antideficiency act that when the a76 competition extended beyond the deadline dod was spending money in excess of the amount of money in the appropriation which is viola tion of the antideficiency act he also noted that at one point during the 16month period between the initial decision in favor of the meo and its subsequent revers in favor of an award to iap the army asked dod if it could cancel the competition and dod instructed the army to finish the competition implications for future competitive sourcing what are some of the broader implications of the wramc competition on the future of competitive sourcing studies unde r omb circular a76 are the decisions made during the course of the wramc competition likely to shape future public private competitions possibly due to the walter reed controversy the army has announced its plan to cancel all future outsourcing contract s at military medical facilities for 2007 and

udies based on walter reed it appears that the walter reed competition was poorly executed such are the observations of former secretary of the army togo west mr west served as the cochairman of the independent review group and former secr etary of the army army lawyer and secretary of the department of veterans affairs in may 2007 he spoke of the groups study of the walter reed controversy jim lehrer what went wr ong over there at walter reed mr secretary how were things allowed to happen that did happen togo west one of the things is that deficiencies in maintenance had been accumulating over time at walter reed now when system medical center is doing as well as that distinguished facility was in peacetime and without the stress of wartime engagement you can miss some of that but once you get the numbers that were forced into walter reed jack marsh mentioned 640 at the height there were some 800 in the medical hold among outpatients then the cracks begin to show the difficulties begin to come clear for example if you go to that number of outpatients in the whole facility and the case worker staff stays at the same or even drops well then cases are going to be unattended to in terms of getting servicemembers to appointments and the like jim lehrer and why was the numbe r of caseworkers not increased togo west walter reed had been placed on the black list it had been through a76 jim lehrer what is thattogo west the a76 procedure is proc edure by which facility evaluates whether it should take governmental assi gnments and convert them into private contractor assignments it almost fre ezes any hiring until that process is completed it was long process once it was done walter reed was down by as much as 37 percent among its most important caseworker nursing and the like functions jim lehrer in other words the number of people available to do the work was going down while the number of patients was increasing both of them dramatically right togo west thats right thats exactly right 61 certain conclusions may be drawn from this competition first six years in the life of an a76 competition is long time and the competition is not conducted in vacuum lot can

priorities neither brac nor the effect of combat operations were anticipated when the decision was made to conduc t the walter reed a76 competition either or both events could have been used as rationales for delaying or even cancelling the a76 competitions second federal agencies may be under increasing pressure to meet the numerical quotas of the bush administr ations presidential management agenda pma according to the army the depa rtment was reportedl required to review approximately 77873 positions for competitiv sourcing by the end of fy200962 how much of the decision not to cancel the competition was driven by the armys desire to meet the pma goals is unknown one of the challenges facing federal agencies is how to conduct competitions when there are constrained resources given the constrained resources presented by combat operations and brac actions the army might have made the decision to cancel the competition but still fallen short of the numerical quotas third it appears that if the a76 policy is going to work effectively it cannot be the used for every federal activity some have suggested that the armys constrained resources was the reason why re pairs were not made to the reportedly substandard facilities at wramc63 perhaps for some activities a76 competitions are not appropriate particularly for activities that affect military health care including base operations s upport maintenance and repair some would argue that trash removal is not an inherently governmental activity but for medical setting regular maintenance and repair of health care facilities may be critical to the morale of the patient case could be made that any activity that touches the military patient should be considered inherently government including for example trash removal on military health care facility64 when the mission like patient care is critical the risks of mission failure are high in this view base opera tions support activities should be exempt from competition options for congress while congress is not compelled to pursue any action at all there may be legislative initiatives that congress may want to pursue in the area of a76

congress could prohibit the inclusion of health care and retirement costs in the cost comparison process reportedly the army failed to comply with the requirement in the defense appropriations bill to exclude health care costs from the a76 cost comparison process if dod cont ributed more per employee for health care insurance than the contractor contributed per employee for health care insurance the exclusion of retiremen t costs might preclude the rewarding of contractors for providing benefits that ar less than those provided by the federal government67 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34140crs25 68 the competition in contracting act of 1984 public law 98369establish team of acquisi tion professionals to rotate service as agency tender officials it would appear that based on the walter reed competition one individual has overall authority for the conduct of th competition what happens when competition becomes complex or complicated as in the situation at walter reed while the army represented by many diffe rent officials and the office of the secretary of defense have shared au thorities and responsib ilities for 76 these officials share what may appear to be somewhat conflicting and confusing roles to both advocate for the integrity of the a76 process while at the same time exercising their institutional roles the deputy garrison commander as an example attempted to appeal the outcome of the co mpetition he lacked the legal standing to do so and he also lacked the authority nd financial resources to pursue the matter one option could be for omb to blish team of experienced a76 professionals who could be called upon to serve as atos these professionals could be selected to serve as atos in competitions outside of their assigned federal agency also atos would require sufficient f unds to represent the federal employees throughout the entire course of the a76 competition and may so require certain independence require an enforcemen t of the a76 rules congress could ensure that the a76 rules are followed when the rules governing the conduct of a76 studies ar not followed there is authority to ensure that the rules are followed and the process as well as the final decision may lack integrity there appears to be authority to ensure that the rules are followed as result many parties lose confidence in the a76 process some have suggested that omb could have stopped the walte r reed a76 competition when it exceeded the permitted length of time others have pointed out th at dod could have stopped the a76 competition when it exceeded the length of time as prescribed by law in the defense appropriations act also some have pointed out that the army could have excluded health care costs from the contracting out cost comparison process as required by the defense appropriations act an enforcement of the rules of the walter reed a76 competition may have resulted in different outcome grant federal employees the same rights as private sector contractors the right to protest is an essential element of the outcome of the walter reed competition the right to file protest is provided in the competition in contracting act68 it should be noted that at the time of the walter reed competition the competition in contracting act provided priv ate sector contractors the right to file protests with gao while federal employ ees were

providing that federal government officials known as agency tender official s atos may file protests with gao in connection with a76 competitions atos may file protests on their own initiative or at the request of majority of employees involved in the competition 70 under the new circular the ato has the aut hority to file protest on behalf of federal employees the alan d king protest decision changed the law the reason that alan king could not protest to gao was because the new provision had an effective date and it was not that date yet see gao decision b2955296 february 21 2006 71 see proposed section 326 of hr 4986protest rights69 however pl 108375 expande d the definition of who is an interested party and included the agency tender official ato70 federal employees also wanted to protest directly but were prohibited from doing so the ato the federal employee representative tried to file prot est but gao determined that ato existed in the pre2003 circula r and so the ato lacked standing this sequence of events suggests that a76 s not always afforded both equity and fairness the issue of lack of the right of fe deral employees to directly protest the outcome of the competition is central to the outcome of this competition gao heard the protest filed by iap the contractor which iap had the statutory right to file without this protest the meo would pres umably have won the competition on the face of it the inability to directly protest their case put the aff ected federal employees at disadvantage the walter reed competition showed that wramc management wanted to advocate on behalf of its employees but was prohibited from doing so more importantly wramc manageme nt reported that they were unable to advocate on behalf of the federal employees because 1 they did not have the inhouse expertise to handle the appeal process and 2 they did not have the money to pay for outside legal counsel they took the extraordinar step of contacting afge to handle the federal employee appeal congress could grant legislative authority for federal employees themselves to have direct protest rights while the ato s the right to protest on behalf of federal employees it is at the discretion of the at if an ato decides not to protest on behalf of federal employees there is recourse also congress could prohibit federal agencies from conducting compe titions unless they have enough money to fund competitions entirely including repres entation for the federal employees during all phases of the competition up to nd including the postaward process71

military medical center wrnmmc the recommendation was approved by congress in november 2005 and plans call for the full integration to take place by september 2011 this timeline effectively places walter reed army medical center in state of limbo regarding its ability to make capital improvements and recruit and retain qualified staff the complexity surrounding the creation of walter reed national military medical center requires significant attention from the current leadership resulting in time and resources being taken away from the effective management of the hospital there is doubt that the f acilities at walter reed require replacement and the present campus is too small to accommodate the large patient load and influx of family members resulting from operations iraqi
