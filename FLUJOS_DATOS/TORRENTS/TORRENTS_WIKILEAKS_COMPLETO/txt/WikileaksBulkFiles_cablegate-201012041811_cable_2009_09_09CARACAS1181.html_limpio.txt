classified by economic counselor darnall steuart for reasons 14 b nd d 1 c summary post has comfirmed that wholly venezuelan governmentowned company bolipuertos is now charged with the management of venezuelas ports cubas asport has 49 percent share in puertos alba separate company which will reportedly be focused on business development contacts in shipping circles however tell us that the cubans are active in the ports as advisors to bolipuertos and were instrumental in pushing for the take over of port operations bolipuertos has taken over private warehouse operations at three ports named in the original march 25 decree guamache maracaibo puerto cabello as well as fourth guaira the port serving caracas shipping contacts report rumors that the government may nationalize stevedoring and customs agent services insurance premiums have reportedly increased 3540 percent since may end summary bolipuertos puertos alba 2 sbu post has clarified the issue of the management of venezuelas ports two companies of virtually the same name have been decreed by the government of the bolivarian republic of venezuela gbrv the first bolivariana puertos sa bpsa or bolipuertos was founded by decree on june 12 2007 this company was to be mixed venezuelancuban company with cubas grupo empresarial industria portuaria asport having 49 percent share we understand that this first bolipuertos was never actually registered as company the second bolivariana puertos bp or bolipuertos was created by decree 6645 dated march 25 2009 to maintain administer and develop venezuelas ports according to that decree the venezuelan state holds 100 percent of the capital of the second bolipuertos which was assigned to the ministry for public works and housing neither of these companies is puertos alba in which the cubans have significant investment 3 c on july 29 2009 as reported reftel the gbrv published another decree in the national gazette authorizing the creation of puertos alba stateowned company to be charged with modernizing renovating equipping and constructing ports in venezuela and cuba cubas asport has 49 percent share in puertos alba with the 51 percent majority share remaining with bolipuertos close embassy contact tells us that the intent of the gbrv is to follow the cuban model by installing company bolipuertos that will run all aspects of port operations in venezuela while puertos alba will act as its business development arm other contacts assert that bolipuertos retains cuban advisors on staff but they do not believe that the cubans have formal managerial responsibility in the company these advisors however are believed to have urged the gbrv to move ahead with taking control of the ports 4 c the march 25 2009 decree creating or recreating bolipuertos stipulated that it would be responsible for the infrastructure of puerto guamache the isla marguerita cruise ship port maracaibo port puerto cabello venezuelas largest port as well as that of any ports to be developed in the future as reported reftels subsequent decree dated july 30 declared the immediate nationalization of private warehouse operations at the three ports named in the march 25 decree as well as fourth guaira the port serving caracas our contacts in the shipping industry tell us that it appears likely that bolipuertos will also take control of port operations at guanta paluapuerto ordaz guiria and cumana port services still troubled 5 c operations in puerto cabello were interrupted for four days following the take over of warehouse operations at the beginning of august reports of significant problems have continued since the resumption of operations former petroleum chamber president andres duarte protect throughout informed econoffs that his stevedore company has not been allowed to remove equipment from the port for maintenance or weekend storage in what many believe is caracas 00001181 0022 of 002 precursor to the expropriation of stevedoring and other terminal services another contact whose company provided warehouse services at puerto cabello directed econoffs attention to another company venezolana exportaciones importaciones ca vexinca established by decree 38954 dated june 17 2008 according to this contact vexinca which is run by the military as are the ports at this point is actively offering customs services to the clients of private sector customs agents our contact speculates that vexinca may eventually be designated as the sole provider of customs services in venezuela insurance and other risks 6 c duarte informed econoffs that insurance premiums have increased 3540 percent since the may 2009 announcement of the marine committee of the lloyds market association that it had withdrawn maritime warrisk policy coverage for venezuela other local shipping contacts have confirmed bulletin that ran in british shipping magazine in august noting that it may be difficult to make claims against bolipuertos for robbery damage etc according to duarte norweigan and panamanian owned ships that used to bring soda ash to venezuela have already been swapped out for older vessels with much smaller cargo capacity that cannot maintain the previous offloading rate of 50000 tons per day duarte also confirmed that the gbrv will have to pay higher premium on refrigerated shipping containers to european and brazilian firms as maersk will longer send them to venezuela as it has been unable to retrieve them in the past due to the chaos in the ports it has also been reported that shipping line hamburg sud will longer serve venezuela 7 c comment many observers note that decreased traffic arising from the global recession has saved venezuelas ports from complete strangulation the wilderness of stacked containers at the ports has improved however few here believe that the gbrv has the knowhow or the logistical experience to manage the ports even with the assistance of cuban advisors there is speculation that some port operations may ultimately be handed over to friendly governments on concessionary basis duddy
