48 million undocumented mexican migrants residing in the united states in january 2000 accounting for 687 of the total estimated illegal alien population of 70 million mexico takes the view that the migrants are undocumented work ers making the point that since the us market attracts and provides empl oyment for the migrants it bears some responsibility mexico regularly voices c oncern about alleged abuses suffered by mexican workers in the united states and for the loss of life and hardships suffered by mexican migrants as they utilize incr easingly dangerous routes and methods to circumvent tighter border controls mexico benefits from illegal migration in at least two ways 1 it is safety valve that dissipates the political discontent that could arise from higher unemployment

232 series of re strictions on the issuance of consular identification cards by foreign missions in recent years the mexican consulates have been issuing matrícula consular cards for identity purposes and they have been increasingly accepted in the united states in situations where proof of identity is required such as for establishing banking accounts and obt aining credit cards and transferring funds from the united states to mexico critics argue that the cards are used primarily by illegal aliens seeking to obtain benefits not achieved through regular immigration law and procedures and that they might facilita moneylaundering nd terrorist activity the amendment would have required th at foreign missions issue consular identification cards only to bona fide citizens of the count ry as verified by birth certificates voter ids and passports that card recipients be required to notify the mission of any change of address that au tomated records be kept by the missions to prevent duplicate or fradulent issuance that records be subject to audit by the united states and that the united states be notified of each issuance including the name and address in the event that foreign mission has issued consular id cards in violation of these provisions it could be required to suspend the issuance of cards and in the event of noncompliance the st ate department would suspend the issuance of immigrant or nonimmigrant vi sas or both to nationals of that country until it was in compliance with the requirements suppor ters of the amendment argued that the issuance of the cards
