and lifelong learning accounts lilas for fy2008 the senate committee report states that it is deferring consideration of caas without prejudice until consideration by the authorizing committee the house bill also does not fund caas further the house committee report includes language prohibiting dol from further use of dislocated worker national reserve funding for caa pilots these accounts

adults and youth under current law 20 of the amount appropriated for dislocated workers is to be used in national reserve for these types of activities7 also under current law states are required to use 25 of their dislocated worker allocation on rapid response activities such as career counseling and case management delivered by states as soon as possible after the announcement of plant closing

request includes rescission of 335 million in unexpended state balances available from the threeyear spending authority wia allows for youth adult and dislocated worker programs the amounts include obligated but not yet expended funds the request is based on dols concern about the lapsing of funds not spent in the allowable time in response to previous administration requests to rescind unexpended balances the us government accountability office gao was asked by the senate and house authorizing committees to study the issue gao found that dol does not have accurate data on state spending and that very little funds lapse9 an updated approximation of lapsed funds can be determined from dol reports10 of unexpended balances at the end of program year less carryout to the next program year at the end of py2005 june 30 2005 64 million of unexpended funds were not carried over to py2006 this represents 06 of unexpended balances and came from ten states the senate committee
