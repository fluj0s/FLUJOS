instruction in euroamerican agricultural methods vocational skills and habits as well as in literacy mathematics and christianity the aim was to change indians cultural patterns into euroamerican onesin word to assimilate them5 from the revolution until after the civil war the federal government provided for indian education either by directly funding teachers or schools on tribebytribe basis pursuant to treaty provisions or by funding religious and other charitable groups to establish schools where they saw fit the first indian treaty providing for any form of education was in 1794 6 the first treaty providing for academic instruction was in 18037 altogether over 150 treaties with individual tribes provided for instructors teachers or schools8 whether vocational academic or both either permanently or for limited period of time the first us statute authorizing appropriations to promote civilization among indian tribes was the indian trade and intercourse act of 1793 9 but the first authorization and appropriation specifically for academic instruction of indian children was the civilization act of 181910 civilization act funds were expended through contracts with missionary and benevolent societies besides treaty schools and mission schools some additional schools were initiated and funded directly by indian tribes the state of new york also operated schools for its indian tribes the total of such treaty mission tribal and new york schools reached into the hundreds by the civil war11 after the civil war the us government began to create federal indian school system with schools not only funded but also constructed and operated by the bia with central policies and oversight12 the board of indian commissioners in 1869 recommended the establishment of government schools and teachers13 and in 1870 congress passed the first general appropriation for indian schools not provided for under treaties14 the initial appropriation was 100000 but both the amount appropriated and the number of schools operated by the bia rose swiftly 5 prucha francis paul the great father the united states government and the american indians lincoln university of

schools grade levels to secondary education under the impetus of the riam report and new deal leadership the bia also began to shift its students toward its local day schools instead of its boarding schools and to some extent to move its curriculum toward indian instead of solely euroamerican subjects31 in addition in 1931 responsibility for alaska native education was transferred to the bia32 the first major noninterior department federal funding for indian education in the 20th century began in 1953 when the impact aid act of 195033which directed the us commissioner of education34 to pay public school districts to help fund the education of children in federally impacted areaswas amended to cover indian children eligible for bia schools35 further changes to the impact aid law in 1958 and the 1970s increased the funding that went to children on indian lands36 congressional appropriations eventually made impact aid the primary and jom the supplemental source of federal funding to public schools for indian education by fy1981 impact aid funding for indian students amounted to 147 million37 while jom funding the previous year was only 281 million38 in 1966 congress added further noninterior funding for indian education by amending the elementary and secondary education act esea of 196539 the major act authorizing federal education aid to public school districts to add setaside for bia schools to the program of grants to help educate students from lowincome families40 congressional study of indian education in the 1960s41 that was highly critical of federal indian education programs led to further expansion of federal noninterior assistance for indian education embodied in the indian education act iea of 197242 the iea established the office 31 szasz and ryan

expressly to oversee federal indian education program education department ed aid for indian education has become larger in terms of dollars than bia school funding and ed assistance has also become significant source of funding for bia schools see below federal indian education policy also began to move toward greater indian control of federal indian education programs in both bia and publ ic schools in 1966 the bia signed its first contract with an indian group to operate bi afunded school the rough rock demonstration school on the navajo reservation44 in 1975 through enactment of the indian self determination and education assistance act isdeaa45 congress authorized all indian tribes and tribal organizations such as tribal school boards to contract to operate their bia schools three years later in title xi part b of the education amendments of 1978 congress required the bia to facilitate indian control of indian affairs in all matters relating to education46 this act created statutory standards and administrati ve and funding requirements for the bia school system and separated control of bia schools from bia area and agency officers by creating bia office of indian education programs oiep nd assigning it supervision of all bia education personnel47 ten years later the tribally controlled schools act tcsa of 198848 authorized grants to tribes and tribal organizations to operate their bia schools in addition to self determination contracts these laws provide that grants and selfdetermination contracts be for the same amounts of funding as the bia would have expended on operation of the same schools49 indian control in public schools received an initial boost from the 1972 iea the iea required that public school districts applying for its new grants prove adequate participation by indian parents and tribal communities in program development operation and evaluation50 the 1972 iea also amended the impact aid program to mandate indian parents consultation in school programs funded by impact aid51 in 1975 the isdeaa added to the johnsonomalley act requirement that public school districts with jom contracts have either majorityindian school board or an indian parent committee that has approved the jom program 52 the number of schools in the bia school system has shrunk over the years through administrative consolidation and

reported as racially indian are members or descendants of members of politically recognized indian tribes and not all members of such tribes may be reported as racially indian for example eds national center for education statistics nces which collects and analyzes student and school data and produces the national assessment of educational progress naep 65 publishes reports on indian students characteristics academic achievements and naep results nces data however are based on racial or ethnic identification except data on bie students so the data will include students who are reported as racially indian even though they are not members of tribes and do not fall into federal programs eligibility categories ncess racebased indian student population is not the same as fe deral programs indian student population the two populations overlap to very great extent but the degree of overlap has not been determined nces data based on race then cannot be assumed to represent completely accurately the indian student population served by federal indian programs tables 1 and 2 below attempt to illustrate the size of the problem table 1 shows bie iea and nces data for indian students for school years sy 20022003 through sy20042005 the nces counts are far larger than the iea counts for each school year not only by themselves see row 2 but also when bie counts are added in row 3 for better comparability with the iea count row 4 the greater number of nces indian students might be explained if one argued that nces counts include all iea indian students and that the additional
