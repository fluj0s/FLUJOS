28 2005 kevin r kosar analyst in american national government government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32647government advertisement of tourism recent action and longstanding controversies summary the federal governments role in promoting us tourism through advertisements has waxed and waned dur ing the past four decades in 1961 congress established an office within the department of commerce dedicated to promoting tourism to the united states but in 1996 it abolished that office in february 2003 in the wake of decline in us tourism congress established the united states travel and tourism prom otion advisory board usttab and provided 50 million for the secretary of commerce to use in visit america advertising campaign before the campaig n began however congress rescinded all but 6 million of the appropriation in september 2003 legislation was introduced hr 3164 to abolish usttab pl 108447 appropriated 10 million more for the visit america campaign p l 109108 provided another 4 million these contrasting congressional actions monstrate that the federal funding of tourism advertisements like government advertising generally is controversial proponents of federal tourism advertising argue th at it is good economic policy federal tourism advertising they say boos ts the number of foreign visitors to the united states which brings economic bene fits proponents make four arguments in favor of federal touris m advertising first federal t ourism promotion is tool for helping us tourism industry firms increas sales second it is necessary response to foreign nations marketing of their own countries as tourist destinations third tourism advertising is tool for reducing the united states trade deficit with the rest of the world and fourth it is reasona ble response to tourism slump caused by extraordinary events such as the attacks of september 11 2001 critics res pond that there is little evidence th at federal tour ism advertising policy has increased visits to the united states critics also take issue with federal tourism advertising on four gr ounds first there is market failure to justify the intervention of the federal governmen t second federal tour ism advertising is unnecessary because the united states already is top destination for tourists third the us trade deficit is not result of lagging foreign tourism to the united states and fourth the us tourism industry is recovering from its slump on its own and does not need federal adver tising to boost it critics fu rther contend that tourism promotion is not an effective policy because macroec onomic factors are far more powerful variables than advertising in affecting individuals decisions to travel internationally this report concludes by considering the difficulty of assessing the results of government tourism advertising programs empirical evidence on the efficacy of federal tourism adver tising is surprisingly in short supply many variables such as safety affordability and ease of access can affect the decisi on of an individual to travel which makes it very difficult to determine the power of advertisements in those decisions this re port will be upda ted annuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32647contents background 1 recent action 3 f d r l d v r t i s m n t f t u r i s m l n g s t n d i n g c n t r v r s i s 5 r g

were spending in the united states and 11 b illion of that gap was attributed to americans travel and tourism spending abroad6 one consequence of the deficit was the buildup of dollar liabilitie s to foreigners in the 1960s the balance of payments was major political issue because lingeri ng payments deficit raised the possibility of gold drain7 that is foreign central banks that held us dollars could exchange those dollars for gold held by the united states since the amount of us dollars in circulation was linked to the am ount of gold in us reserves rapid outflow of gold could bring about d ecline in the amount of us dollars in circulation decrease spending in the unite d states and set the stage for recession to combat the gold drain problem usts and its successor the us travel and tourism administration ustta aggressively promoted u s tour destinations in foreign countries8 usts opened overseas outreach offices provided translation services bought advertisements in foreig n newspapers and media and generally worked closely with the us tourism i ndustry to draw international visitors9 as policy federal tourism advertisement lost much of its initial raison detre in the early 1970s between 1971 and 1975 the united states moved from fixed exchange rate linked to gold to floating dollar with linkage to gold this meant that foreign central banks could longer draw gold from us reserves in exchange for dollars they held10 thus the gold drain problem had disappeared nevertheless federal advertisement of tourism continued because many in congress viewed the program as

longstanding controversies like other forms of government adve rtising the federal advertisement of tourism has been controversial22 since its inception advocates have contended that tourism advertising is valuable exportpr omotion policy that increases tourism and aids the us economy critics meanwhile have argued that it is an unnecessary government intervention in the economy and is unlikely to increase visits to the united states arguments in favor of the federal advertisement of tourism the need for federal coordination proponents of federal tourism advertising have argued that the united states is not able to attract as many tourists from abroad as it might when airlines hot eliers restauranteurs and transportation providers each attempt to sell their services to the foreign consumer at price sufficient to cover the advertising costs the result is highpriced trips that too few foreigners are able to purchase23 moreover these disparate media messages often fail to convince the wouldbe traveler that th united states is easy to visit as the national chair of the travel industry asso ciation of america tiaa told congress in 1994 people around the world know about the united states but they do not know that it is accessible they do not know that it is easy to get to and that there are packages available they see the united states as this huge bewildering

the federal advertisement of tourism argue that it is not at all clear that the united states is underperforming against other nations in the world tourism market it might be argued that the united states already is getting fair share of the world tourism market among nations the united states ranks first in total tourism receipts 65 billion in 200343 as for proponents concern th at france and spain attract more visitors critics respond that this is not rprising france and spain are much closer to other european countries than the unite d states for persons living in europe or even much of asia traveling to france and spain is easier and less costly than flying across the atlantic or pacific oceans to the united states critics also argue that just because some foreign governments have tourism bureaus that undertake tourism promotional activities that does not mean that the us government should do likewise44 for one critics say there is little to suggest that the federal government could undertake tourism advertising more effectively than the private sector which is already advertising moreover any federal spending on advertising may encourage pr ivate firms to reduce their advertising expenditures effectively shifting the cost of private sector advertising to the public but more fundamentally an economis t would argue that when nation subsidizes exports the benefits

most economists see trade deficits as result of capital not product and service flows the trade deficit is rooted in broader macroeconomic forces related to domestic saving and investment it is not

the united continuedproducing nation thus foreign nations polic ies that subsidize international tourism benefit us consumers while us tourism subsidies benefit foreign tourists45 the trade deficit critics note that tourism is one small factor affecting the 6655 billion trade deficit in 2004 in 2004 travel and tourism made up about 9 93 billion of over 1 trillion in us exports46 thus boosting tourism to the united states critics reason is not the cure for the trade deficit so to take hypothetical example if one were to ima gine an advertising program that doubled tourism receipts in 2004 from 93 billion to 186 billion the trade deficit would still be very large 5725 billion moreover the balance of trade consists of four categories goods services investment income and unilateral tran sfers travel and tourism imports and exports are categorized as services in 2004 the us ran trade surplus of 575 billion in services in the trade of g oods however the us had deficit of 5656 billion47 thus opponents of federa l tourism advertising r eason the trade deficit is not problem of insufficient foreign consum ption of us airline tickets hotel rooms or restaurant seats those who want to improve the balance of trade should not turn to federal tourism advertising48 indeed any policy that did not raise taxes in order to finance an export promotion program such as federal tourism advertising would affect macroeconomic conditions in way that tends to widen the trade deficit49 the need to respond to the tourism industry slump even though the federal tourism surplus has decreas ed between 1996 and 2003 critics of federal tourism advertisement note that the united states nevertheless retained travel surplus with the rest of the world despite the attacks of september 11th sars

compared to 200451 advertising is not powerful variable critics argue that macroeconomic and policy variables are far more powerful than advertising in affecting individuals decisions to travel internationally major policy changes such as deregulation of the airline industry nd macroeconomic forces such as exchange rates have helped coax more visitors to the united states by lowering the prices of air fares substantially52 thus the united states move to floating dollar with linkage to gold caused depreciation of th dollar which made the united states more attractive tourist destination53 moreover as the world tourism industry has grown so have international visits to the united states see table 2 54 v n ustta critics suggest admitted the power of macroeconomic variables

decision to travel is federal tourism advertising effective the debate over federal tourism advertising might be less sharp if two fundamental question could be answered have federa l advertisements increased tourism have they produced more benefits than costs the short answer to these questions unfortunately is that nobody knows for certain surprisingly little is known about the efficacy of tourism advertisements be they private or publicly funded57 neither usts nor ustta included in their annual reports or tes timony before congress studies subs tantiating the effects of their

promotional ac tivities and more generally took issue with federal tourism promotion as public policy specifically omb said usts data involving the number of foreign arrivals generated through direct federal promotional activities is highly questionable and very difficult to validate federal funding of promotional activities in support of tourism is just not costeffective expenditure of the taxpayers money60 the difficulty in discerning advertisements effects are inherent in the nature of the phenomenon being investigated name ly why persons c hoose to travel obviously many considerations can be operative for example tiaa seeks to gauge consumer demand for leisure travel with its traveler sentiment index to this end it surveys individuals interests nd their assessments of their available time finances and their perceptions of the affordability and service quality of travel destinations61 meanwhile studies have identif ied many other variables that can affect the decision of an individual to travel internationally such as exchange rates personal wealth and consumer confidence price of travel and lodging ease of visa acquisition consumer perceptions of trav safety weather desirability dining quality and more62 any effort to discern the power of federal advertisements to affect foreign consumers decisions to travel to the us then faces considerable methodological challenge disentangling the influences that large number of variables may have on cons umers travel decisions
