requested copy of her credit report wh ich reflected the impostors activity trw corrected andrews file when notified of the mistakes however ndrews alleged that the blemishes on her credit report forced he r to abandon her refinancing efforts and settle for an alternative line of credit on less favorable terms12 andrews filed suit against trw on oct ober 21 1996 approximately 17 months after she became aware of the inaccurate information on her credit report and more than two years after trw made the two initial disclosures13andrews alleged that trws failure to verify prior to disclosing information to creditors that she initiated the requests or was otherwise involved in the underlying transactions was in violation of the fair credit reporting acts requirement that cred it reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to avoid improper disclosures14by failing to verify that andrews was the initiator of the requests andrews alleged that trw facilitated the identity theft she sought injunctive relief punitive damages and other compensation trw argued that andrews claims based on t he two earliest disclosures were barred because the fair credit reporting acts tw year statute of limitations had expired15 andrews countered that all of her claims we re timely because the statute of limitations did not toll until the date she learned of the inaccurate disclosures this argument was based upon andrews contention that the fcra incor porated general federal rule which tolls the statute of limitations at the time the plaintiff becomes aware of the injury the district court agreed with trw and held that general federal discovery rule was not incorporated into the fair credit reportin g act thus barring andrews claims based on the two earliest disclosures16the district court also granted trws motion for summary judgement on the two remaining claims finding that trw had maintained adequate procedures to avoi d improper disclosures17 the ninth circuit court of appeals reversed t he district court applying the general f d r lr u l et h taf d r ls t t u eo f limitations begins to run when party knows or has reason to know that she was injured18the ninth circuit rejected the district courts assertion that the text of 15 usc 1681p in cluding the exception to the commencement of the statute of limitations precluded the application of general federal discovery ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21083crs4 19225 f3d at 1067 20idat 1066 21122 s ct at 446 22idat 447 2315 usc 1681p 24122 s ct at 447 25idat 447 citing andrus v glover constr c 446 us 608

court concluded that since the fair credit reporting act contained express legislative directive the general rule applied thus the statute of limitations had not expired on any of andrews claims20 trw appealed to the supreme court which reversed the ninth circuits decision stating that the ninth circuit conspicuous ly overstated the scope and force of the presumption that general discovery rules appl unless congress has expressly legislated otherwise21the court said that while some lower fed eral courts have applied general discovery rule when statute is silent on the issue the supreme court has not adopted that position furthermore the court state d that it had never endorsed the ninth circuits view that congre ss can convey its refusal to adopt discovery rule only by explicit command rather than by implication from the structure or text of the particular statute22 while the ninth circuit correctly noted that the fair credit reporting act contains specific directive against the application of general federal discovery rules the court noted that the statute does set forth specific statute of limitations along with single exception to the general rule23based upon the text and structure of the statute in question the supreme court determined that congress intent t preclude judicial implication of discovery rule was clear24citing an earlier case the court held that where congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to general prohibition additional exceptions are not to be implied in the absence of evidence of contrary legislative intent25applying general principles of s tatutory construction the court reasoned that congress implicitly excluded general discovery rule by explicitly including more limited one26to allow the incorporation of general rule in light of this fact would have the practical effect of re ndering the stated exception to the general rule entirely supe rfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances thus violating cardinal principal of statutory construction that statute ought upon the whole to be so construed that if it can be prevented clause sentence or word shall be superfluous void or insignificant27 as if anticipating the courts decision andrews argued that if the statute of limitations was to commence on t he date on which liability arises the date should be the date on which the inaccuracies come to the attention of the potential plaintiff rather thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21083crs5 28idat 449 29idat 450 30idat 451 31fair and accurate credit transactions fact act of 2003 pub l 108159 32pl 108159 section 156the date on which the credit reporting agency made the inaccurate disclosure28andrews relied on legislative history pointing to congress consideration of alternative language in making her argument the court rejected andrews reliance on legislative history noting that trw was able to present information to the contrary29the court also rejected andrews argument that liability did not arise until actual damages materialized refusing to address the issue because it was not raised earlier the court doubted that the argument would have aided andrews due to the fact that andrews alleged damages began to materialize when the inaccurate disclosures were made causing the statute of limitations to toll at the same time as under the statutory language in question30 by reversing the ninth circuits deci sion the supreme court barred andrews claims based upon the two earliest disclosu res the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion presumably allowing andrews to go forward with the other claims recently enacted legislation hr 2622 was passed by both the house and the senate during the first session of the 108thcongress and was signed by the president on december 4 200331this legislation amends the fair credit reporting acts statute of limitations to allow suit to be brought not later than the earlier of 2 years fter the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the violation that is the basis for such liability or 5 years after the date on which the violation occurred32
