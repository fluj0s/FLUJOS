september 11 summary russian president putin appears to have made strategic decision to shift russian policy toward cooperation with the united states and the west this is major departure from the policy that putin inherited from his predecessors which saw russia as the leader of coalition aimed at opposing us global domination putin seized upon the events of september 11 to promote his new policy by cooperating with the united states agains t qaeda and the taliban regime in afghanistan softening russian oppos ition to nato enlargement including admission of former soviet republics and establishing new c ooperative relationship with nato acquiescing in us decisions regarding withdrawal from the abm treaty strategic nuclear force reductions and missile defense and closing russias large military intelligence base in cuba the principal reason given by putin for the new policy is that russia must integrate with the west in order to rec onstruct its own economy and achieve decent living standard for its people putin also acknowledges russias weakness and inability to act globally in opposition to the ited states he may also have rejected as unwise the previous policy of facto alliance with china against the united states instead seeing china as possible longterm threat to russia putins new policy does not seem to enjoy strong s upport among russian political elites the military and foreign policy establishment and the general public putins overall political power and prestige however may be sufficient to sustain the policy the bush administration responded positiv ely to the new russian policy after september 11 the administration however did not make many concessions on key issues related to arms control missile defense and nato it has been more forthcoming on some economic issues the implications of russias prowestern policy are overwhelmingly positive for the united states in the war on terrorism and in relations with russia and china russias strategic choice of integration with the west reduces the danger seen by some of russochinese coope ration against the united states by depriving china of its erstwhile russian partner it may encourage china to seek improved relations with the united states or risk geostrategic isolation some sore points remain between wash ington and moscow in which congress takes strong interest such as russia s continued and possibly expanded plans to construct nuclear reactors in iran its support of iraq and its heavyhanded policy in chechnya there is also friction on some trade issues critics of bush administration policy argue that it has not been sufficiently responsive to putin and risks losing the new cooperativen ess others reply that russia has choice but to continue its pr owestern course in view of russias weakness and its selfinterest in integrating with the west in this view the endurance of russias prowe stern policy ultimately ma depend on putins success in reviving the economy and imp

september 11 introduction russian president vladimir putin appears to have made strategic decision to reorient russian national security polic from posture of antagonism if not hostility toward the united states and its llies to policy of more cooperation with the united states and the west indications of this shift were discernible even before the terrorist attacks of september 11 but putin seized upon september 11 as an opportunity to transform dram atically the bilateral re lationship along cooperative lines making that date appear to be r eal turning point in usrussian relations among the more notable results of this shift in russian national security policy were russias political and military cooperation with the us campaign against the taliban regime in afghanistan including us military deployments in former soviet states in central asia moscows decision to close its electronic intelligence base in cuba and the softening nearly to the point of abandonment in some cases of russias previously tough positions on nato enlargement the abm treaty missile defense and strategic nuclear force reductions this report will examine the implications of the shift in russian national security policy for nearterm usrussian relations and for broader us security interests it will seek to show the motives behind putins decision to reorient russian policy and assess the prospects for the new policys endurance this report will also examine the bush administrations re sponses to the new russian policy congressional interests and congressional levers to influence us policy toward russia as well as competing opinions on wh at us policy toward russia should be background the primakov vision president putin is the unchallenged and seemingly unchallengeable master of the russian political scene today he has credible political rivals and has enjoyed consistently high standing in russian public opinion polls over 70 approval rating for more than two years yet few foresaw these developments in august 1999 when physically and politically exhausted president yeltsin plucked putin from political obscurity to become russias fifth premier in two years prior to the premiership

chechnya which he rode to popularity and power yeltsin abruptly resigned as president on december 31 1999 six months before the expiration of his term naming putin acting president three months later march 26 2000 putin was elected president in his own right the national security policy that putin inherited from yeltsin and that he continued to pursue for year or more after succeeding yeltsin was shaped by yevgeny primakov who served as foreign nister and then premier in the late 1990s2 primakov was loath to relinquish moscow s role and status as great power he saw the united states as russias natural inevitable foe in view of russias diminished economic political and military means primakov sought to build an undeclared coalition of states with russia at its head to oppose what he saw as us global domination he called this po licy of multipolar ity primakov viewed china india and iran as key partners and sought support among other states that opposed us policy andor resented us power

ould cross red line that would wreck nato russia relations and trigger dangerous ru ssian political and military countermeasures putin signaled major policy shift during trip to finland on september

september 6 2001 may 30 2002so by mid2001 at the latest ie befo re september 11 putin appeared to be moving away from the primakov vision after september 11 it became clear that putin was moving russia in different direction implementing the new policy the first meetings between presidents bush and putin their brief meeting in slovenia in june 2001 and month later at the g8 summit in genoa italy were notable for the emphasis in public at least on personal rapport over political substance much was made of president bushs assertion that he had looked into putins soul and found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy putin responded publicly with praise for the new and untested us president it is not clear whether andor to what extent th softening of russian policy toward the united states may have been influenced by personal rapport between the two leaders some believe that putin career kgb foreign intelligence officer was unlikely to be swayed by such ephemera as pers onal chemistry and d made up his mind in advance to seek friendly relationship with bush and improved relations with the united states even before september 11 there wa s softening of russias previously outspoken opposition to us missile defens plans and to the usbacked accession to nato of the former soviet baltic repub lics of estonia latvia and lithuania putin may have concluded there was an inevitability related to us missile defense and nato enlargement and sought to mode rate the outcomes as much as possible if only marginally rather than continuing to fight and gain nothing in the process this could be seen in moscows abandonm ent of its red line rhetoric regarding baltic accession to nato5 and its movement toward modifying the abm treaty september 11 however seemed to provide turning point or breakthrough in us russian relations immediately after the september 11 att acks it was obvious that if the united states was going to take action against qaeda and its host the taliban regime in afghanistan russian coopera tion would be very valuab perhaps indispensable many observers initially ssumed that moscow would adopt tough position along the following lines now the americans need us very well what is the most that we can extract from them and the minimum cooperation that we must offer in return this assumption was based on the belief that putin the exkgb

voices solidarity with us but looks to xploit terrorist attacks 7not all observers are fully satisfied with moscows account some claim that russian security forces may have been involved using the bombings as pretext to reinvade chechnya and give putin national security em ergency to bolster his authority and prestige 8nuclear conflict scenario set aside vremya novostei moscow september 12 2001would gladly revert to harder line on ce the september 11 attacks had strengthened his hand6 events showed that putin took different view he appears to have decided immediately after the terror attacks to seize upon t hose epochal events as an opportunity to transform usrussian relations although putin may have decided to move russia closer to the united states before september 11 the bush administrati on did not appear eager to reciprocate at that time to the contrary most of the administrations top agenda items regarding russia were negative issues for moscow missile defense the abm treaty nato enlargement russian transfers to iran of nuclear reactors missile technology and conventional arms russian support of ir aq russian abuses in chechnya and suppression of press freedom in russia september 11 gave putin the opportunity to change the subject the new dominant issue would be cooperation against international terrorism since late 1999 putin had been trying to interest washington in the idea of joint action against terrorism as the new core issue for bilateral cooperation neither the clinton nor the bu sh administration was receptive to this in view of putins claim that his military campaign in chechnya was prime example of antiterrorism in action on september 11 only hours after the attack s putin using the hot line was the first world leader to speak to bush in air force one about the tragedy putin reminded bush that russia had suffered seri of dreadful terrorist bombing attacks against apartment buildings in moscow and other cities two years earlier that had killed hundreds of russians putin attri buted those attacks to radical islamic chechen terrorists7 beyond personal and official condolences putin informed his american counterpart that he was or dering the immediate cancellation of military exercises scheduled to begin the next da that included longrange bomber flights in the direction of the united states cana da great britain norway and iceland sailing orders for russian submarine and surface naval units were also cancelled8 he may have wished to avoid false alarms in somber speech to the russian people putin compared the september 11 attacks to nazi atrocities which some observers took as sign of putin preparin g the public for possibly dramatic shift in russian policy ie strategic c ooperation with the united states within days the bush administration began to focus on action against qaeda and the taliban regime the possibility of us military deployments in central asia was prominently mentioned by us officials and in the press the immediate response from russian officials was strongly negative even defense minister sergei ivanov perhaps putins closest political asso ciate said on september 16 that there were prospects for us military forces to operate in any of the cis states putin personally intervened to change that policy he publicly contradicted his defense minister and declared that us military

on september 199 there are divergent accounts of moscows initial role in the us deployments to central asia some say that at first russian officials tried to prevent central asian leaders from offering washington military bases on their territory others say that moscow facilitated or at least did not stand in the way of the us deployments10 perhaps there is some truth in both accounts reflecting early divisions in moscow on this issue ultimately russia could not prevent sovereign states in central asia from hosting us military forces if they saw it as in their interest to do so which was clearly the case in uzbekistan but russian influence in tajikistan is very strong and some say that us deployments ther would not have been possible if moscow had objected strongly11 the fact that us combat forces were deployed in large numbers to military bases in central asian soviet successo r states would have been unimaginable few months earlier rega rdless of his own in itial reaction to this development putin put the best face on it offering political and logistical assistance russian cooperation in the campaign agai nst the taliban was not based solely on desire to draw closer to the united st ates moscow had long viewed the taliban as serious threat to russian security becau of that regimes role in promoting the spread of radical islam in central asia this was an immediate threat to the secular central asian regimes along russias southern frontier which might ultimately destabilize russias own large muslim population12 to counter talibansupported insurgency russia provided covert and open support to the antitaliban northern alliance despite fiveyear russian effort however the taliban had expanded its control to over 90 of afghan territo ry by september 2001 and squeezed the northern alliance into small pocket near the afghanuzbek border thus us operations in afghanistan af ter september 11 served double interest for moscow the opportunity to demonstrat concrete strategic coope ration with washington and the elimination of serious security threat on its vulnerable southern flank russian support for the usled campaig n in afghanistan was

expressions of appreciation for russian assistance the us role was decisive moscow undoubtedly noted that th united states accomplished in 56 weeks what russia had been unable to accomplish in 56 years in theater remote from the united states and in russias backyard moscows nse of satisfaction in its new partnership may have been overshadowed by its awareness of the widening gap between us and russian military capabilities 14 see for example walter pincus us ru ssia likely to agree on arms summit could lead to historic cuts washington post november 11 2001 p a43 15 crs report rl31448

accommodate washington continuedalliance forces during the decisive ope rations in octobernovember 2001 us defense department officials credit these russian efforts with having contributed substantially to the rapid defeat of the taliban in the north13 at the same time that moscow was giving washington unprecedented cooperation in afghanistan it was showing willingness to compromise on missile defense the abm treaty and strategic fo rce reductions in midnovember in the runup to the bushputin summit in wash ington and crawford texas us and russian media carried reports of possible negotiating breakthrough that might result in big package deal on these issues14 these reports proved premature however because the united states did not back ff many of its demands and positions the november summit yielded few major substantive results and three weeks later bush announced that the united states would ilaterally withdraw from the abm treaty putin while regretting the us decision in sisted that it was not tragedy and that it would not destabilize otherwise excellent bilateral relations as with nato enlargement putin appears to have decided that it was futile to continue trying to resist the inevitable and that russian interests were best served by minimizing the damage on missile defense and the abm treaty and by getting the best deal he could on strategic nuclear force reductions on this too putin eventually yielded on virtually all substantive points in th treaty on strategic offensive reductions treaty of moscow signed on may 24 200215 during this evolution on strategic nuclear issues another significant indication of putins shift in national security stra tegy received relativel little public attention on october 1 7 2001 putin nnounced that russia would close its electronic intelligence base at lourdes cuba this listening post established in 1964 was moscows largest and most important intelligence facility outside its borders and was considered thorn in the side by the united states16 to the extent that russia viewed the united states as an adversary the base at lourde s which was manned by 1500 russians and provided 6070 of russias electronic intelligence data on the united states was significant strategic asset the decision to close it was more than symbolic move it was strategic decision17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31543crs7 17continued russia paid cuba 200 million annually for use of the base others find this argument unconvincing noting that the russian economy was stronger in 2001 than at any time since the collapse of the soviet union that there was actually budget surplus in 2001 and that if moscow could afford the payment in earlier years it could better afford it in 2001 b russias payment to cuba was mainly not in hard currency but in more affordable below marketprice oil deliveries and other commodities such as military spare parts and c putin as former career intelligence officer would be expected to value the

colonel general leonid ivashov as head of the treaties and international cooperation department of the ministry of defenseother aspects of russian defense polic under putin support the idea of shift away from confrontation towa rd cooperation with the united states and the west one of the most significant moves was pu tins decision august 2000 that russias strategic nuclear forces would be unilaterally reduced from nearly 6000 deployed warheads to 1500 in this decade18 this acknowledgment of russias inability or unwillingness to maintain quantitative parity with the united states in strategic nuclear forces was significant step in 2001 the ministry of defense announced plans to further reduce russian military manpower from 12 million to 850000 in 2002 the government announced plans to accelerate the transition from mainly conscript to mainly profe ssional army in the longrun smaller professional force may be more capable in many respects than mass conscript army but mass was traditionally the russian armys strong suit and the basis of its presumed offensive capability visavis nato in the early 1990s russian defense spending was cut drastically and procurement of major new weapons systems virtually came to halt19 the governments fiscal situation improved s ubstantially after 1999 and defense spending has increased somewhat but the increment has gone mostly to pay military salaries largescale serial production of majo r weapon systems has not yet resumed20 in the late 1990s into the early stage of putins presidency russian military exercises were given an almost ostentatiously antinato antiamerican edge this tendency has been reduced since september 11 also in the past two years putin has instituted major personnel changes in the military high command

and deputy commander of the northern fleet the navy chief of st aff and the minister of defense among others in televised interview soon after the kursk sank putin said that our armed forces should match our needs on one hand and the possibilities of the state on the other adding that the military mu st be compact modern and well paid we have been talking about military reform for how long at least eight years and perhaps whole ten years but there has been little change in this area23 after the kursk putin began to make changes that was thirteen months before september 11 2001 soon after september 11 somewhat skep tical polish analyst wrote that there were two key questions in judging putins policy the first was whether russia really sought fullfledged cooperation w ith the west the second was the price of such cooperation russian pa rticipation in an antiterrori st offensive he continued together with only moderate demands in return might be substantial indication of russian preparedness to become reliable partner of the west it is exam time and we can only hope that russia will not fail24 putin appears to have passed this test reasons for the new policy if putin really has fundame ntally reoriented russian policy toward cooperation and integration with the west one may well ask why does the former kgb agent have cultural or ideological affinity for the united states and the west ie does he like us does he like western democracy most observers would say instead putins change of course seem s to be based on sober assessment of russias vital interests and its current limitations first and foremost from the day putin became acting president to the present time he has insisted that russias most urgent need and his top priority is the reconstruction and vitaliza tion of the economy in speech on december 13 1999 he warned that russia is in the midst of one of the most difficult periods in its history for the first time in 200 or 300 years it is facing

is clear are our numerous and concrete steps towards integration with europe we will continue to work actively with the european uni on designed to create single economic space25 it is axiomatic that this requires relatively benign international environment for russia russias economic integration with the west cannot be accomplished in an atmosphere of politica lmilitary confrontation or antagonism with the west andor with the united states it follows from this that russian nati onal security policy must support russias preeminent economic objectives putin unde rlined this point in

foreign minist ry the first was convened by mikhail gorbachev in 1986 to lay down his principles of new thinking in foreign policy and of glasnost and perestroi ka putin also intended to lay down new principles he lectured the assembled foreign policy bureaucracy criticizing them on various shortcomings and noted that under his l eadership russia has managed to get out of the long period of confrontation and now sought truly reliable businesslike relations he went on to say that the new basis of russianus relations lies in new reading of the national interests of the two countries lest they miss the point he declared i will reemphasize the confident partnership between russia and the usa is not only in the interests of our people it exerts positive influence on the entire system of

that russia must adjust its foreign and defense policies to its limited capabilities is hi s conclusion that primakovs concept of maintaining russias status as great power and the leader in the struggle against american hegemonism was losing strategy in view of the preponderance of us economic political and military power compared to russia28 putin may also have had doubts about the wisdom of primakovs reliance upon china as key partner and preferably an ally visavis the united states russian chinese relations are friendly and the two states share number of important interests including

be moving in the direction of alliance against the united states as envisioned by primakov31 there is ample reason however for moscow to be wary of such policy while primakov and likeminded russian nationalists saw china as an opportunity to be exploited in the shortterm to counterbalance us pre dominance other russians saw and see china as longterm threat the basic reasons for this are the apparent trajectories of russian decline and chin ascendance and russian concerns about possibly dangerous china as neighbor in the future russia is by far the largest nation in the world in terms of

russias support moscow may have been motivated primarily by financ ial gain on the other hand russias deal with iraq together with the iranian reactor plan and the invitation to kim jongil encompassing all three elements of bushs axis of evil may be signal that moscow is displeased with current us policy arms control and missile defense during the cold war arms control often dominated the ussoviet agenda moscow has sought to maintain that arrangement which inherently treats the two parties as equals nd provides opportunities for moscow to try to restrain washington from further tilting the military balance in americas favor the bush administration takes the position that the cold war is over and that friendly states do not need arms control treaties to protect them from one another some in the administration and congress also maintain that russia is too weak economically politically and militarily to prevent the united states from acting unilaterally in its best interests on vital questions of nuclear forces and missile defense many others critical of the unilateral approach argue that russia remains nuclear superpower and that us security and nonproliferation are best serv ed by maintaining the arms control process with russia there is general agreement that in the strategic offensive reductions treaty moscow acceded to the us position on virtually every substantive issue67 most observers think that the treaty will win approval easily in the senate it is also widely believed that putins political power and prestige ensure parliamentary approval of the treaty in moscow both sides officially agree russia reluctantly that the abm treaty and the unratified 1993 start ii treaty are both dead letters that leaves missile defense as the principal item remaining from the old strategic arms control agenda russia still seeks to slow or shape us missile defense activities as much as possible arguing that missile defense will be destabilizing bilaterally and globally and will accelerate nuclear weapons pr oliferation among nonweapon states68 russian authorities appear to understand how ever that acting alone they lack the leverage to prevent the bush administration from going forward as rapidly as possible with missile defense strategic initiative to which it is deeply committedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31543crs24

seem that russias main hopes for altering or slowing us missile plans defense lie outside the realm of bilateral relations moscow will probably continue trying to rally international opposition to missile defense including opposition from us allies in europe nd asia congress through the budget process and other means has critical role in the future of missile defense in view of the sharp divisions within the congre ss over missile defense in general and the bush administration approach in particul ar this is bound to remain contentious issue nato enlargement and the natorussia council

analysis carried by reuters af ter the may 2002 bushputin and nato russia summits entitled russia ends cold war with nato china shivers calls attention to chinese concerns that russias geostrategic shift could bring usled forces right up to chinas western borders it is probably something that is very worrying said one western diplomat in beijin g because there is risk of isolation of china82 if russia turned toward strategic cooperation with the united states while the antagonism in uschinese relations remained that could leave beijing in the position of being or appearing to be the leading antiamerican power that could be costly and risky position for china at time when it is still struggling to accelerate and complete its economic modernization the antagonism in uschinese relati ons noted above p 11 however has not remained unchanged in the past year there has been warming or at least an easing of tension between the two at the outse t the new bush administration promised tougher approach to china than either the clinton or the earlier bush administration describing china as str ategic competitor of the united states in the aftermath of the collision april 1 2001 of us and chinese military aircraft near hainan island the antagonism on both sides deepened after this rocky start however the events of september 11 appeared to alter the policies in both washington and beijing the bush administration appeared to see the potential for sinous cooperation against global terrori sm as priority and us officials downplayed differences and problems in th relationship as they sought chinese support with asian states and in initia tives for their part after september 11 chinese leaders have taken steps to imp rove sinous relations soften us criticism of their policies and demonstrate that china can be responsible global player83 the apparent softening of chinese policy or rhetoric toward the united states is probably driven by many factors on of these is likely to be domestic political struggle in the run up to the 16th communist party congress fall 2002 at which key leadership changes are expected including the succession to president jiang zemin many analysts have described part of the internal political dynamic as conflict between proponents and opponents of wester nstyle economic reforms relations with the united states gets caught up in this because those who favor more market oriented reform of the economy also nd to favor closer economic and political cooperation with the advanced industrial democracies in cluding the united states many opponents of further market reform also oppose more opening to the west thus disagreement and political conflict over foreign policy among chinese politicalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31543crs30 84the views in this section are based on numerous news reports congressional hearings analytical studies and discussi ons with us european and ru ssian officials and analystselites can become subset of and sometimes even surrogate for struggle over fundamental domestic issues it is also possible that concern grew among chinese leaders in 2001 after the crisis surrounding the april 1 collision of th us ep3 aircraft and the chinese jet fighter and especially after september 11 that relations with the united states were deteriorating to dangerous level with new and unpredictable administration in washington that seemed inherently unfriendly to china beijing may have decided independently to ease some of the tension as precautionary measure regardless of russian policy at some point in 2001 putins policy shift toward the west probably entered into chinese calculations and debates about relati ons with the united states those in the chinese leadership who opposed the rdline confrontational approach to the united states could use the russian shift as an argument against dangerous chinese course that risked conflict with america without the prospect of russian support those in beijing who advocated tougher line toward washington must have been encouraged by primakovs policy of part nership with china against the global hegemon and discomfited by putins aba ndonment of that policy in the internal chinese debate over policy toward the united states putins westward tilt may not have been the most important consideration but it most likely was one of the factors that shaped and is shaping chinese policy thus it seems likely that russias turn toward the west influenced china to move in the same direction although not to the same degree nor for the same reasons competing views of how the united states should respond to russias new nati onal security policy 84 there is an active debate about the appr opriate us response to putins policy of integrating russia with the west american european and russian critics of bush administration policy toward russia make many of the same arguments the essence of their criticism is that the ited states should do more to reciprocate putins cooperativeness nd ensure that russia stays on this course some argue that putins shift toward the west lacks strong domestic political support and therefore is frag ile some compare putin to gorbachev warning that putins prowestern policy could meet similar fate arousing domestic opposition like that which led to the august 1991 coup that almost toppled and fatally undermined gorbachevs leadership ot hers who see putins political position as relatively secure warn that putin himsel f might conclude that his cooperation with the united states is not yielding the sired reciprocity from washington leading him to move away from failed policy another line of criticism is based on longerterm view ie russias current w eakness may be such that it has choice but to accede to heavyhanded us dominance however russia is likely to recover and once again be great power and when it does it will harbor resentment and animosity toward the united states because of arrogant and shortsighted ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31543crs31 policies that ignored russian vital interests and offended russian national dignity all three versions of this criticism cite the same list of us actions that allegedly are offensive to moscow such as withdraw from the abm treaty missile defense nato enlargement and us military deployments in georgia and central asia on the other hand many observers belie ve that the administrations approach to russia is fundamentally sound some supporters of adminis tration policy argue that russia simply does not matter very much any more that with population smaller than brazil gdp smaller than the netherlands and armed forces that have little ability to project power beyond its borders russia should not be treated deferentially as great power by the unite d states some who hold this view are dismissive of russia whether russia succeeds in becoming modern state with functioning market economy is their business not ours others view the relationship in terms of tough love helping russia ad just to its proper status as regional rather than global power still others focused on the cold war rivalry are happy to see russia as weak defeated foe and want to keep it that way some supporters of us policy toward russia contend that putins repeated concessions to us positions and acceptance of faits accomplis acknowledging us force majeure confirm the correctness of that polic that there was and is need to make undue concessions to moscow because russia has choice but to go along with the united states due to russias weakness visavis the united states and because of russias objective need to join the western world on the wests terms some of those who oppose being defere ntial to moscow say that many of putins domestic policies are undemocratic and that the united states should not hesitate to criticize such tendencies and press the kremlin to do better they argue that us silence in the face of russian g overnment abuses such as restrictions on freedom of the press and religion contro l over the formation of political parties persecution and imprisonment on false charges of political dissidents and massive human rights violations in chechnya are betrayal of us values and signal to russian authorities that the united states is not really serious about democracy in russia as long as moscow c ooperates on security issues those who question the wisdom of administration policy warn that at some point if washington is not more forthco ming to moscow russian policy may swing back in the direction that primakov favored and that this would be tremendous lost opportunity for the united states others reply that to the extent that there is danger of putins prowestern policies being reversed it will hinge not on whether the united states and the west reward russia but on whether putins domestic economic policies succeed after all these observers contend putins f undamental rationale is that russia must integrate with the west in order to r econstruct its economy and achieve decent living standard for its people if that goal or appreciable progre ss in that direction is not achieved in reasonable period of time the prowestern policy will be difficult to sustain if this is true then the united states has not only humanitarian interest but also strong self interest in russias economic recovery
