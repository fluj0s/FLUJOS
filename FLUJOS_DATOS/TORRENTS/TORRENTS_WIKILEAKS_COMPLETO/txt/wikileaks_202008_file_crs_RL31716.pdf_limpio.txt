congressional quarterly article it was reported that despite the funds apparent success some legislators families of the victims and even the special master himself say funds like that set up for the victims of september 11 might not be the best approach for responding to future largescale terrorist attacks8 feinberg said im dubious that congre ss will do this againit was successful but it was in response i think to very unique historical event i think the reason is 911 left scar on the american peopleh esitancy to become an automatic insurer for airlines or an other i ndustr yw ill likely have congress thinking twice before endorsing the sept 11 fund as model for th future some people thought that the special master had too much power in di stributing the fund some thought that the fund was unfair because victims life insura nce policies had to be taken out against the total award family received and ther eby rewarded families without insurance for poor family pl anning feinberg thought that if congress does anything next time it will likely be everyone receiving th same amount instead of asking special master to try to determine how much money victim would likely be earning over lifetime9 in final report of the september 11th victim compensation f und of 2001 feinberg addressed several important questions he i ndicated that the fund was sound public policy b ecause it constituted legitimate response by the nation to unique historical event he did not thi nk that the fund was useful precedent for the future because the profound conditions that existed immediately after the attacks will probably not be duplicated he suggested th at in the future better approach might be to provide the same amount for all eligible claimants nd that this approach should probably not be part and parcel of restrictions imposed on the right to litigate in court10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31716crs4 11 pl 107134 codified at 26 usc 1 notetable 1 general award statistics last updated

cross li berty fund for victims of 911 then the expectation of donors is that all of the mone raised in that fund will go to meet that specific need unless it is very clearly stated that some of the money would be put in reserve accounts for similar tragedies32 this idea was reinforced by the testimony of representative of the better business bureau wise giving alliance nationally recognized monitoring organization that sets accountability sta ndards for charities and other soliciting non profits the committee was told that the bbb wi giving lliance had commissioned princeton survey research associates to conduct donor expectations survey in the spring of 2001 this survey was released in september 2001 the findings indicated among other th ings that 86 of americans gave to charities in 2000 that americans have ve ry high expectati ons for ethics and accountability by the charities and that fi rst and foremost the public needs to know how the charity is spending their money specifically 63 of the public expects the money to be used for current needs rather than put in reserve and 73 rate the accuracy of charitys advertising and promotion as very important33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31716crs12 34 paula span profiteers of pain washington post july 16 2003 p c01 35 september 11th charitable relief an oversight at one year rept of ny atty general
