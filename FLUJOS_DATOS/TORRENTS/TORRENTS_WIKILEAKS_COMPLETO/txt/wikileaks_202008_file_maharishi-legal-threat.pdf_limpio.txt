of defamatory article dear examiner editor in chiefi write this letter as general counsel for maharishi university of management and the d avid lynch foundation for consciousness based education and world peace concerning the article i n your online publication httpwwwexaminercomx20682bostonunderground examiner_y2009m10d5transcendentalmeditationinschoolsthedavidlynchprogram i will not comment on the inappropriate statements on the scientific research conduct ed on the tm program contained in mr mesners article dr orme johnsons comments ou have received reply more expertly than i could on that subject and i incorporate them but there are other false defamatory andor misleading statements which need to be identifie d as such and retracted the failure to do so continues to damage the reputation of my client organizat ions which teach and promote these programs and the individuals involved in those activities one court case over thirty years ago found curriculum in the science of creative intell igence which included the tm program to have religious overtones violative of the first amendm ent that malnak case has been mischaracterized and its scope overstated by m r mesner court at any time has ever ruled that teaching the tm program alone is impermissible nor t hat the student is assigned the name of hindu god to chant what is even more relevant is the fact that largely in light of the extensive rese arch that has been done over the last thirty years on the transcendental meditation programs benefits in re moving stress several thousand at risk students in public schools across the united states have decided voluntarily to learn the tm program through sponsorships from the david lynch foundation they have learned the technique in voluntary quiet time programs without any legal i nterference the supreme courts 1985 decision in wallace v jaffree 472 us 38 and its progeny have now made it clear that secular or nonsecular meditation is permissible under the fi rst amendment in such circumstances mr mesner then goes on to paste the horrific label of cult on the tm program gore jerry seinfeld and paul mccartney would find it remarkable to be told they are membe rs of cult but that does not mitigate the serious damages that such thoughtless labeling can have on the organizations which teach these programs to the public and while jerry may laugh at s uch characterization gore may not have as well developed sense of humor john knapp who claims to be licensed counselor is quoted by mr mesner as saying he was lied to and harassed by the tm organization but this is not factually supported however what is fact is that mr knapp has developed niche in the field of counseling for victims of cults which he actively promotes on his websites he has created straw man and now he is selling expensive medicine to him mr knapps professional ethical conflict of interest s eems much more worthy of note than his unsupported claims of lies and harassment further messrs knapp and mesner attempt to attribute the symptoms of mental illne ss to the practice of the tm program without scientific basis this may be of great support to his cult counseling practice but is not supported by the several hundred studies one claims that eve ry person who practices the tm technique will be promptly freed of any mental distress people who practice the tm program may indeed coincidentally suffer from such problems what the research shows conclusively however is that they get noticeabl and materially better through this practice they do not get worse if mr knapp really and honestly feels otherwise why has he not undertaken controlled scientific study which has been published in peer reviewed journal in fact all such studies of the tm program have shown that it only produc beneficial effects mr knapps self serving conflict ridden unscientific ane cdotes are not the evidence recognized as credible by science or his profession and claiming such is unethical nd irresponsible it is also damaging to those who teach and practice those programs and he should be held accountable for such damage in any event it should not be published and promoted by this publication or you are participating in this damaging process mr mesners misrepresentations continue by his claim that kropinski received 138000 jury verdict for claimed injuries from the tm program what he omits to mention is that i t was reversed on appeal kropinski v wpec 853 f2d 948 1988 these falsehoods defamations and omissions compel to ask you to remove this arti cle from your newspaper to put an end to the continuing damage its publication causes to my client thank you very much for your anticipated cooperation william goldstein general counsel maharishi university of
