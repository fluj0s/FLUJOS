ambassador anthony wayne for reasons 14 b and d 1 s as discussed in reftel information strongly suggests afghanistans new ansari hawala network is facilitating bribes and other widescale illicit cash transfers for corrupt afghan officials and is providing illicit financial services for narcotraffickers insurgents and criminals through an array of front companies in afghanistan and the uae 2 s headquartered in kabul the new ansari hawala network has connections to dubai and other global financial markets law enforcement and other components in mission afghanistan and isaf have been investigating new ansari and briefed washington agencies in september 8 svtc as noted in ref moving forward against new ansari requires an interagency approach here in country as well as in washington such efforts will need to include better organizing and resourcing usg efforts to identify and disrupt financial linkages in afghanistan and in key regional financial hubs 3 s embassy would appreciate response to the requests for additional resourcessupport contained in reftel these include the need to fully staff the afghan threat finance cell atfc the total number of positions required is 49 but only 22 of those positions are filled moreover higher percentage of those slots should be filled with more senior and experienced interagency analysts and at least one public corruption prosecutor the atfc also urgently requires access to translators who can accurately and quickly process an increasing amount of wire intercept information including complex technical and financial records in addition the current split in the atfc between bagram airfield and kabul should be minimized to integrate the atfc better into broader intelligence analysis efforts it would be advisable to establish lead base of operations in kabul the atfc would continue to forward deploy liaison staff at each regional command to ensure countrywide coverage 4 c mission appreciates washington agencies consideration and support of these requests we look forward to rapid response eikenberry
