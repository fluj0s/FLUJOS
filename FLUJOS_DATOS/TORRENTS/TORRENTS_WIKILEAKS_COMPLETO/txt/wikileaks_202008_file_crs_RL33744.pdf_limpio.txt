government and finance division july 26 2007 abstract with expanding trade with growing emerging economies that have changing resource endowments the us economys terms of trade may move as this growth causes changes in the worldwide demand for and supply of the goods and services that the united states exports and imports given its current and prospective size chinas impact on these forces could be large chinas main impact on the us terms of trade over the last decade has been through the falling price of us imports from china transmitting favorable impulse to the us terms of trade it also seems likely that the impact of the economic growth of china on the us terms of trade over the near term will continue to be dominated by the favorable eﬀects of falling price for imports from china over the longer term conclusions are more tentative several factors point to favorable outcome for the united states however some deterioration of the us terms of trade may be the unavoidable consequence of successful economic development in large emerging economies such as china as well as india russia and brazil the economic beneﬁt to the world economy from large numbers of people accomplishing the very diﬃcult transformation from poverty to steadily rising standard of living is greathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33744g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

and increase the incentive for economic agents to undertake the forwardlooking activities of investment and innovation policies that give focused public support to knowledge producing activities such as education and scientific research that are very likely undervalued and underproduced by the private market and continued bilateral and multilateral initiatives to lower trade barriers at home and

trade is the central premise that informs the economic case for free and open trade between countries typically the gains from trade are rooted in differences in resource endowments ie the relative abundances of land labor capital and technology leading to each trading economy having relative efficiency advantage in the production and export of particular good or class of goods economists call this trade based on comparative advantage the critical but seemingly counterintuitive insight of this economic theory is that what matters for establishing basis for trade is not absolute cost but relative cost country could have an absolute cost disadvantage in all goods yet still be able to realize gains from trade it follows that country with an absolute cost advantage coul d also gain from trade all that is needed for comparative advantage to exist is difference in relative cost that is difference among countries in the rate at which the output of one good must be curtailed to expand production of another good in other words difference in opportunity costs exists if these rates are different then each country has comparative advantage in the production of good or class of goods creating the potential for gains from trade in this circumstance each country can improve its economic wellbeing by producing what it does best and trading for the rest comparative advantage is particularly important basis for trade between an advanced industrial economy such as that of the united states and an emerging economy such as that of china where very different resource endowments cause significant differences in each economys relative efficiency at producing different goods economic theory predicts that comparative advantage is likely to occur in the production of goods that use each economys relatively abundant resource intensively china has relative abundance of lowskilled labor relative scarcity of human and physical capital and low level of technical knowledge in contrast the united states has relative abundance of human and physical capital high level of technical knowledge and relative scarcity of lowskilled labor in this circumstance the comparative advantage for china will be manifest in the export of goods that are produced using lowskilled labor intensively such as apparel footwear toys and final assembly of electronic machinery and equipment in contrast the comparative advantage of the united states will be in the export of goods that are produced using human and physical capital and technology intensively such as aircraft software pharmaceuticals and hightech components of electrical machinery and equipment unfortunately for each country trade based on comparative advantage will have negative effects on domestic industries and among groups of workers displaced by imports in the long run however the overall effect of trade on each trade partner is an elevation of economic wellbeing over what would be possible without trade this winwin outcome has been confirmed by preponderance of evidence the size and source of the us gains from trade with rapidly growing emerging economy such as chinas are not necessarily going to be static phenomenon however as the relative economic circumstances of trading partners chan ge with economic growth altering the relative abundances of economic resources and the source of each countrys comparative advantage the size of each countrys gains from trade could also change trade can still leave country better off than would be true without trade but the size of the countrys gains from trade could rise or fall depending on the character of the changes in its economic circumstances and those of its trade

high volume of international trade could mean that the impact of such changes in relative economic circumstances on the us economy emerging with the economic growth of china could be substantial

that focuses on the economic impact of trade over time it can be telling of an economys international trade performance from increased trade to also consider whether there has been any longterm trend in the nations share of the gains from trade because the benefit of free trade resides in the product received the import while the cost resides in the product given the export the gains from trade to the nation rise if for any given volume of imports it exchanges smaller volume of exports rather than larger volume nations terms of trade is measure of the average export cost of acquiring desired imports increases and decreases in its terms of trade defined as the ratio of the economys average export price to its average import price indicate whether nations share of the gains from trade is rising or falling although trade is process of mutually beneficial exchange each trading partners share of those benefits can change over time and movement of the terms of trade is an indicator of the direction of that change up or down in the share of the gains from trade more specifically this is question of whether over time the us economys terms of trade has tended to rise or fall as the industrial output and export sales of china and other lowwage economies has grown rising trend would indicate that countrys trade performance has improved relative to other trading countries reaping an increasing share of the gains from trade and real income benefits for the economy similarly decrease in the ratio of export prices to import pricesa deteriorating terms of traderaises the export cost of acquiring imports and reduces the gains from trade falling trend would be indicative of deteriorating trade performance decreasing share of the gains from trade and decrements to real income deteriorating terms of trade does not necessarily mean that trade overall is not beneficial and that the united states would be better off without trade it has merely become less beneficial in circumstances where the volume of trade is rising there may not be an absolute decline in real income rather the rate of income growth will be slower than it otherwise would be the terms of trade will not fully reflect the gains from trade that come from other bases for trade most importantly the realization of economies of scale gains due to scale economies are of greater significance for trade between mature economies that have similar factor proportions ie the united states europe japan and canada 1 scale economies are basis for trade that have steadily risen in importance in trade among the united states and other advanced economies this could lead to partial offset to any loss in th gains from trade associated with any loss in comparative advantage nevertheless movement in the terms of trade would still be indicative of changes in the gains from trade coming from risi ng trade with lowwage economies that would still have very different resource endowments ie relatively large supplies of lowskill labor and 1 if some degree of product differentiation can be achieved there will be opportunities for specialization and trade also this type of trade does not cause the sharp impacts on each countrys distribution of income that typically occurs with trade based on comparative advantage even if all countries are equally adept at producing any given good single country is likely to have the productive capacity to produce the full spectrum of products demanded at the leastcost scale of operation if some degree of product differentiation can be achieved there will be opportunities for specialization and trade also this type of trade does not cause the sharp impacts on each countrys distribution of income that typically occur with trade based on comparative advantage

possible over the long run that the us gains from trade based on comparative advantage coming from trade with china and other emerging economies could also diminish as the latter become more like advanced economies in their resource endowments making them capable of efficiently producing many of the goods and services that the united states now exports to them and other economies at the same time gains from trade with china derived form scale economies may grow in importance as basis for generating us gains from trade

in growing world economy with expanding inte rnational trade particu larly with growing share of that trade with emerging economies with very different resource endowments the us economys terms of trade the ratio of the average price of us exports to the average price of us imports will move in response to trends in the worldwide demand for and supply of the goods that the united states exports and imports in general and other factors constant an increase in the worldwide demand for us exports tends to pull up the average price of those exports and thereby improve the us terms of trade similarly an increase in the worldwide supply of the goods that the united states imports will tend to pull down their average price and improve the us terms of trade in contrast an increase in the worldwide demand for the goods that the united states imports tends to pull up their average price and worsens the us terms of trade worsening of the terms of trade could also be caused by an increase in the worldwide supply of the goods the united states exports because it will tend to increase their average price 2 emerging economies in the stages of economic development such as chinas often show an inclination to produce goods to be exported to countries with advanced economies such as the united states this pattern will not only be reflection of the emerging economies comparative advantage but also reflection of the size and strength of the us economy that makes exporting to it very reliable engine for propelling sustained economic growth in emerging economies which often have small and unstable domestic markets if this exportled growth leads to sizable increase in the worldwide supply of these goods then their price tends to fall and the us terms of trade tends to improve exportled growth has been successful development strategy in other asian countries such as japan in the early postwar era and more recently in south korea singapore and taiwan however as the process of economic development evolves in emerging economies they tend to absorb technology accumulate human and physical capital and as result become competitive with advanced economies in their productive prow ess in some areas of economic activity this can change the source of comparative advantage and make it possible for an emerging economy to produce some goods that could compete with the exports of the advanced economy this competition can occur not only within the emerging economy as it substitutes domestic 2 the impact of relatively shortterm changes in the dollars exchange rate unrelated to longterm changes in international demand and supply on the us terms of trade are being ignored in this analysis international flows of financial capital the buying or selling of us assets will influence the path of the dollar exchange rate these capital flows may be in response to changes in macroeconomic policy or other reasons for shifts in investor preferences between us and foreign assets these impacts tend to have cyclical pattern and do not generally result in an enduring trend up or down

headtohead competition in other economies japan is an example of nation that has evolved into an advanced economy that competes worldwide with us exports however it is not only economic growth in emerging economies that can affect the us terms of tradeso can economic changes induced within the advanced economies themselves advanced economies particularly the united states are most often the wellspring of technological advance and economic innovation steadily generating both stream of new products and more efficient production techniques yet these fruits of technological advance will have an opposite effect on the innovating economys terms of trade on the one hand although production by foreign producers can erode the gains from trade attached to any particular export the ongoing process of innovation can create new source of comparativ advantage and new product to export for highly innovative economy its comparative advantage may in fact lie in the ongoing production of new ideas and products which causes the steady generation of new sources of the gains from trade that will also generate an enduring positive impulse to the economys terms of trade on the other hand if technological change in the united states emerges as an improvement in the efficiency of the productive process for existing products including exported goods it increases the worldwide supply of those goods tends to reduce their price and in turn to decrease the us economys terms of trade for this case in addition to this supplysideinduced decrease of export prices pulling down the terms of trade there can be an associated positive demandside impulse to import prices that adds further to the downward push on the terms of trade this arises because this type of technological change also increases the advanced economys total output and total income higher income causes an increase in the advanced economys demand for imports which tends to pull up import prices and as result contribute to the decrease of the advanced economys terms of trade while any induced reduction in the terms of trade has negative effect on real income in most circumstances the overall effect of advances in productivity on real income is positive it is difficult to predict the ultimate longterm effect of these several positive and negative impulses caused by economic growth at home and abroad on the us economys terms of trade over time it is possible that economic growth in the rest of the world could show bias toward either production of goods the united states expor ts or production of the goods it imports if exportbiased the economic growth abroad will cause more than proportionate increase in the worldwide supply of goods that compete with us exports tending to reduce the price of us exports inducing deterioration of the us terms of trade that deterioration is decrement to the united states economic welfare and an increase to that of its trading partners in contrast if economic growth in the rest of the world is importbiased there will be more than proportionate increase in the worldwide supply of the goods the us imports pushing down import prices and inducing an improvement in the us terms of trade over time that improvement translates into gain in us economic welfare to the detriment of our trading partners

peak in the mid1960s the us economys terms of trade has certainly declined but the period of trendlike decline stops around 1980 the deterioration in this earlier period was at about 10 per year the impact however of this fall of the terms of trade on us economic welfare would be proportional to the share of imports in gdp which in this period was about 100 this would then translate into an annual real income loss of about 01 this annual rate

judged by its cumulative impact over nearly two decades this deterioration most likely reflects the recovery and return to competitive posture of industrial economies devastated by world war ii these were largely economies with resource endowments similar to those of the united states and who with economic recovery could be expected to increasingly compete against us exports in global markets in this period it appears that growth in the rest of the world was from the united states perspective exportbiased and accordingly pushed down the average price of us exports and reduced the us terms of trade since the early1980s the us terms of trade has fluctuated moderately but it has not shown sustained trend up or down it rose in the early 1980s fell in the late 1980s and early 1990s and then moved up again through the late 1990s to the present it is likely that this undulating but trendless path was mostly reflection of the effect of relatively shortterm movements of the dollars exchange rate on export and import prices suggesting that there was enduring net force up or down being generated by the strong and enduring demand and supply conditions in the global economy it is of course in this recent trendless 25year period that trade with emerging economies has grown so whatever impact the growth of emerging economies may have had on the us terms of trade it was not strong enough by itself to induce an upward or downward trend in that measure it would seem then that growth in the rest of the world in this period was on balance without bias towards either the goods the united states exports or imports and there was evident change in the us share of the global mutual gains from trade

consequence of economic growth in the rest of the world in the postwwii era in recent years this has included the expanded participation of lowwage developing economies such as that of china in the internationally fragmented production processes in which good has valueadded generated in several locations during production that now propels large and growing share of international trade has this increased trade with china adversely affected the us economys terms of trade g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g21g152g561g8g138g155g561 first it has certainly been the case that recent economic growth in china has been rich in the production and export of many laborintensive goods to the united states during the decade ending in 2006 us imports from china increased nearly 236 billion or nearly 460 and increased as share of total us imports from 5 to nearly 12 making china the second largest source of imports this growth seems likely to have been largely spurred by the price advantage of these chinese goods relative to both domestic and other foreign sources therefore if anything this inflow of chinese goods s exerted downward push on the price of us imports and an upward pull on the terms of trade there is limited data on the average price of us imports of chinese goods the us bureau of labor statistics bls maintains fairly extensive import price indexes by locality of origin over the last decade the price index for imports from newly industrialized asian economies as group fell about 25 however data on chinese imports alone have only been available since december of 2003 during this 2½year period that import price index has

overall import price index for asian newly industrializing economies fell less than 10 some have suggested that because of problems in measuring price changes in recently outsourced goods the bls import price index for china could be significantly underestimating the true degree price reduction what data exist seem to confirm the strong expectation that the prices of imports from china have been falling and are exerting positive impulse on the us terms of trade second economic growth in china in contrast to the prior experience with japan and other east asian economies at similar stage of development has occurred with relatively open trade leading to strong chinese demand for exports particularly of hightech capital goods from the united states over the last decade us exports to china increased about 30 billion or nearly 350 and their share of total us exports tripled rising from 15 to 46 making china the fourth largest export market for the united states bls does not have chinaspecific export price index but this rising export demand from china seems most likely to have exerted an upward pull on the price of us exports and generated positive impulse to the overall us terms of trade third it seems unlikely that there has been strong and largescale headtohead competition between us and chinese exports in global markets the greater part of us merchandise exports is in relatively capitalintense hightech goods such as computer accessories semiconductors and telecommunications equipment in sophisticated industrial machinery such as electrical apparatus industrial engines and measuring testing and control instruments in transportation equipment such as aircraft aircraft parts and aircraft engines and in medically related goods such as medical equipment and pharmaceuticals in contrast large portion of chinese exports are in relatively lowtech consumer goods such as furniture toys footwear and apparel china also exports rising volume of electrical machinery and equipment that might be seen to be in more direct competition with some us exports however these exports primarily reflect china steadily becoming the location for final assembly of many consumer electronics computers and information technology goods the technical design and sophisticated components used in this assembly process are likely to be an export from the highwage economies therefore despite the hightech nature of the components and the final good this final assembly process is relatively lowtech undertaking that lends itself to the intensive use of lowskilled labor and is not in competition with us exports fourth major difference in the composition of us and chinese exports is the importance of services in 2005 the united states exported nearly 380 billion in services representing nearly 30 of all us exports the largest type of services export was in the category called other private services which includes business services financial services insurance services telecommunication services and engineering services in comparison chinas services exports in 2004 were only about 60 billion and were heavily composed of travel and tourism services services exports are growing rapidly in china up 34 in 2004 and growth over the last decade averaged 14 annual rate however chinas demand for services imports is equally strong totaling nearly 72 billion and growing 31 in 2004 with decade annual average rate of growth of 13 this pattern of trade in services suggests that whatever impact chinas increased services exports are having on the price of service exports of the united states and other advanced industrial nations may well be offset by the opposite impact from chinas growing demand for services

that chinas recent economic growth has had an eroding effect on the us term s of trade or the us share of the mutual gains from trade g8g158g157g158g155g142g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561 of course the future economic growth of china could have more adverse outcome on the us gains from trade the path of economic development for china and other lowwage economies is likely to lead to change in their resource endowments and to their becoming more like the capital and skillabundant endowments of advanced economies as result this raises the probability that rising proportion of their expanding output will be of goods and services in direct competition with the exports of the advanced economies also continued rapid economic growth by china could exert an indirect negative effect on the us terms of trade through its upward push on the world price of petroleum and industrial commodities particularly metals of which the united states is net importer china is the worlds second largest energy consumer behind the united states and the demand continues to grow because 60 to 70 of chinas energy needs are likely to be met by using coal the impact of its growth on petroleum prices is likely to be more moderate than its large scale of output would suggest nevertheless its demand for petroleum will rise with its expanding size and add to worldwide upward pressure on the world price of oil china is net exporter of aluminum but it is expected to have continued strong demand for steel and copper and further price increases for these metals are probable the upward push on metal prices could be moderated by stronger supply response in the future however there are also several reasons that suggest there may not be significant deterioration of the us terms of trade associated with future economic growth in china first as already observed the chinese economy is far more open to imports than were japan and other east asian economies at comparable stage of their development and the openness of the domestic chinese market seems likely to increase this would likely increase the probability that already strong chinese demand for us exports will grow stronger as their economic growth proceeds of particular importance in this regard is the ongoing chinese liberalization of trade in servicesan area where the us economy has significant comparative advantage and good prospect of generating substantial gains from trade also the chinese economy still has huge needs for basic economic infrastructure and this will probably maintain strong demand for wide spectrum of capital goods that must be imported from the advanced economies including the united states global insight projects that chinas merchandise imports will increase by 475 nearly fivefold over the next 10 years from 660 billion in 2005 to 3133 billion in 2015 assuming us exports to china grow at the same rate as the projected increase in chinas total imports us merchandise exports to china could increase from 418 billion in 2005 to 1984 billion in 2015 second given that many production processes will continue to be geographically fragmented and that large share of the final value of this type of chinese exports will be derived from imported components large share of the gains from trade associated with the sale of this type of chinese export will accrue to the workers and inventors outside of china who produced these components including many in the united states the importance of valueadded versus source of final export is illustrated by the apple ipod which is assembled in china from components produced in other countries and exported to the united states for final sale although the ipod is an export of the chinese economy it is estimated that 163 of the ipods 299 retail value is captured by american companies and workers involved in its design distribution and

is contributed by china because much of the final goods exported from china are like this it seems reasonable to expect sizable portion of any future growth of such gains to accrue to the us economy third also unlike other trading partners in asia 55 of chinese exports are produced by us owned and other foreignowned firms therefore even if china comes to account for the bulk of valueadded on the products produced and exported by such enterprises relatively larger share of the gains from trade would accrue to us and foreign investors through repatriated earnings to the domestic parent than was true of the growth of japan and other east asian countries fourth for china to compete on large scale in the future against us exports on world markets it would have to have command of the same scope and level of industrial technology as the united states this would likely require that china not only effectively absorb existing technology but also be able to regularly generate new technology as the united states does some argue that the current structure of the chinese economy raises doubts about this occurring again unlike what occurred in japan and other east asian economies technological transfer and diffusion in china has so far been more limited recent analysis by george gilboy points to possible reasons why the chinese economy is unlikely any time soon to challenge the technological leadership of the united states europe and japan 3 first as noted earlier foreign funded enterprises produce nearly 60 of chinas exports and the share of hightech exports may be near 90 moreover beginning in the 1990s the chinese government allowed foreign enterprises to move away from joint ventures and establish wholly owned foreign enterprises and these now account for 65 of recent foreign investment in china such enterprises are much less inclined to share their technical knowledge for doing so would give up their competitive advantage over both indigenous chinese companies and other foreign enterprises in their ability to expand market share in china second chinas unreformed political system suppresses the development of horizontal networks that establish fruitful linkages between firms and research institutions investors suppliers and customers as well as other chinese firms the importance of such horizontal networks is that they are thought to be the principal means by which new technology and productive knowledge is nurtured and spread through the economy third most chinese firms have not invested strongly in the creation of new technologies chinas rd spending as share of gdp falls well below the average share devoted to rd by the advanced industrial economies

of us economic policy induced changes in the terms of trade are most often the collateral effect of policies aimed at other economic goals moreover termstrade policy narrowly focused on trade between

are unlikely to be directly aimed at achieving particular goal for the terms of trade the target of these powerful policy instruments is economic stabilization securing sustained economic growth low inflation and low unemployment4 macroeconomic policy could have an indirect but significant and enduring effect on the terms of trade it seems probable that consistently wellrun economy in which macroeconomic policy has steadily secured rapid growth low and stable inflation and low unemployment is more likely to be an economy that provides strong incentive for technological advance and innovation has an abundance of healthy and forwardlooking industries and is prolific creator of broad array of goods for which there is persistent strong demand by the rest of the world such demand response could have positive effect on the terms of trade of course to the extent that sound macroeconomic policy only enhances the ability to supply goods to the world market there may be negative effect on the terms of trade this is certainly not an argument against sound macroeconomic policy merely that more is gained somewhat under the first scenario

the manufacture of automobiles or the development of new drug the steady improvement of technology over time is what drives sustained improvement in nations economic wellbeing forestalling the slowing of economic growth that would otherwise happen due to the onset of diminishing returns and allowing the production of more and better output from any given endowment of economic resources one manifestation of such improvement will be steady improvement of productivity another manifestation however could be an improvement in the nations terms of trade as strong international demand for new and improved products increases their export price sending positive impulse to the us terms of trade what is the public policy issue here improving technology is largely process of generating new ideas however the production of new ideas is likely an activity toward which the private market system will allocate less than the socially desirable level of resources to the extent that new ideas lead to profitable outcomes and those profits can be secured by private firm the market economy will generate new ideas and foster technological change an inherent attribute of ideas 4 such macroeconomic policies can however have significant indirect effect on the terms of trade the pursuit of stabilization goals will often cause the dollars exchange rate to increase or decrease and exchange rate movements will directly affect the relative price of exports and imports and change the terms of trade in the 1980s for example the combination of tight monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation with an expansive fiscal policy caused by tax cuts aimed at reducing the federal tax burden and by spending increases aimed at strengthening national defense increased the level of domestic interest rates inducing large net inflow of foreign capital seeking the higher relative return on us assets that in turn generated sizable appr eciation of the dollar the united states terms of trade rose with the dollar the improvement in the terms of trade wa s substantial but not long lived with change in the configuration of macroeconomic policy and an ebbing of foreign capital inflows the improvement in the terms of trade was reversed before the end of the decade

idea does not preclude someone else from also using it further ideas will often have the attribute of limited excludability meaning the owner of the idea will find it difficult or impossible to charge fee for its use these attributes will likely cause divergence of private benefit and social benefit meaning that what the creator of the idea can expect to gain will be less than what the overall economy can expect to gain in this situation less than the socially desirable level of idea generation will occur therefore this is an activity which may warrant some level of government involvement and support if it is to be done on socially optimal scale such government support could include public f unding of research and development rd particularly in the area of basic scientific research where the prospect of market failure is the greatest public funding for investment in human capital particularly education in the sciences and engineering where benefits of cumulative knowledge often extend beyond the individual and public support for mechanisms to establish and enforce property rights such as patent and copyright administration of course these are activities that the us government does now 5 therefore the critical question is whether such support is accurately targeted and undertaken on an adequate scale this is not an easy question to give precise answer to because the lack of market price for the full benefits of the activity makes it difficult to judge relative scarcity as regards spending on rd there is considerable amount of economic evidence that the social rate of return to rd for variety of research projects often greatly exceeds the private rate of return suggesting that too little research is being undertaken6 it is also true that total rd spending in the united states by industry and government has hovered around 25 of gdp for nearly 30 years the overall steadiness of this share however masks divergent paths for industry and government rd spending while the dollar spending levels by industry and government have both increased since the 1980s as percentage of gdp industrys share has risen and that of government has fallen it is government sp ending on rd that largely provides support to basic research and this is an area where the incidence of market failure in idea production is probably the greatest also because there is great amount of serendipity in the emergence of technological breakthroughs from basic research it is probably prudent to cast rather wide research net than to pursue narrower set of relatively

trade improvement could outweigh the distortion costs of the tariff and improve the imposing countrys economic well being7 the export sector can also in theory be an avenue by which trade policy induces positive terms of trade effect in contrast an export subsidy because it tends to lower export prices will cause the terms of trade to decrease therefore generating positive effect on the terms of trade through exportoriented trade po licy would require negative subsidyor an export tax that raises the price of exports if this positive effect on the terms of trade is large enough it may outweigh the negative effects that arise from the distortion costs of the export tax in practice however trade policies that attempt to increase an economys terms of trade by levying tariffs on imports or taxes on exports are of doubtful practical value first these are policies that could have potential relevance only for very large trading economies such as the united states whose exports and imports represent large proportion of worldwide sales and are therefore able to influence the exports or imports price in the world market second there is reason to believe that such price effects are particularly large third if the potential gain is large or small there is every reason to believe that using these policy devices to generate terms of trade gains is not very likely to be sustainable due to retaliation by other nations if these trade policy devices are used by the united states or any nation it would be use of monopoly power to extract extra gains from other trading nations this would unlikely be matter of indifference to affected nations but would quickly prompt retaliatory actions that would tend to not only erase any initial economic gains to the united states but reduce the economic wellbeing of all trading nations if cycle of retaliation and counterretal iation induced large contraction of world trade although erecting trade barriers may not be viable means to improve the terms of trade reducing trade barriers could be for the united states such lowering of trade barriers could improve the us terms of trade for two reasons firs t because the level of us trade barriers is already very low relative to the level of those in china reduction of those barriers would likely have stronger positive effect on the demand for us exports than it will on us demand for imports tending to increase export prices relative to import prices and improve the us terms of trade second services trade is likely to be high on the agenda of any new round of trade negotiations the prospect of lower barriers to services trade may bode well for the us terms of trade services account for much smaller share of us trade than they do of gdp the united states is the worlds largest producer of services and it seems very likely that it could export an array of strongly demanded products to the rest of the world this can also lead to an improvement in the terms of trade as that demand pulls up us export prices in the postwar era the lowering of trade barriers has been primarily achieved through periodic multilateral agreements among the worlds trading nations the most recent being the uruguay round which went into effect in 1994 many would argue that it is time for new round of multilateral reductions of trade barriers but problems encountered in preliminary negotiations do not bode well for new agreement in the near future in recent years however the united states has pursued and implemented the lowering of trade barriers through regional agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta and the central american free trade agreement cafta and through bilateral free trade agreements such as those concluded in recent years with australia chile and singapore it is possible that bilateral agreement leading 7 in the standard analysis this positive effect on the rms of trade as well as the positive effect on the protected industries is most often outweighed by the costs of the tariff to the wider economy brought about by the tariffs distortion of consumption and production incentives the economic concept of the optimal tariff relates to finding the tariff rate that would maximize this favorable effect

given government nurturing will grow to generate large economic returns through sales in domestic and foreign markets commercial aircraft and computer software are current industries that may have this attribute without this public support however these special industries will not emerge or will emerge at too small scale while there are many variants of the argument for government promoting particular industries two have some plausible economic merit one is support for industries that generate what economists call positive externalities this means that the firms or industrys actions have the potential to generate substantial economic benefits that spill over to other firms or sectors but none or only fraction of those benefits can be appropriated by the initiating firm 8 in this environment without government support the firm will not have the incentive to invest in the knowledgecreating process at level that th whole society would find most economically beneficial the likely existence of significant positive externalities is theoretically valid argument for government support for an industry in practice however it is problematic endeavor9 to be economically effective such support needs to be targeted at the knowledge that would not otherwise be produced this is likely difficult task even if the right target is identified it will be virtually impossible to know what amount of support is called for because these types of activities do not carry market price from which to judge relative scarcity policy of support runs the risk of being too blunt an instrument to just raise economic efficiency as it is possible that it creates other costly distortions the other theoretically valid argument for government promotion of particular industry is based on the possible existence of strategic industries these are industries in which only very few firms would be able to operate profitably and in which each firms action will have strong repercussions on the profit potential of other comp etitors in this oligopolistic market structure firms will likely have significant degree of monopoly power and the potential to earn above normal profits capturing large share of those profits would increase the home nations economic wellbeing in this environment nations may be tempted to compete for those profits without government support those profits will most likely be appropriated by the first few firms to establish themselves in the industry subsequent entry by other firms would be deterred as they can only expect to incur losses who enters and who is deterred can be influenced by the government of one country making strategic intervention that gives support with subsidy sufficient to ensure that its firm will earn profit whether firms from other nations enter or not because any unsubsidized firm would now 8 the generation of new ideas is often the activity of central economic importance for economic wellbeing yet because an idea can have limited excludability it can be difficult for the firm to fully appropriate the ec onomic benefits of the idea it has created the new idea may easily spill over to benefit other enterprises without

government intervention has thereby shifted potential profits from the foreign to the domestic firm and raised economic wellbeing in the home economy again while it is conceptually possible for strategic trade policy to raise national economic wellbeing its practical significance has been widely questioned by economists perhaps the greatest doubt as to the efficacy of strategic trade policy is that the information required for the government to successfully execute the policy most likely exceeds what would be readily available economic theory indicates that the conditions needed for the execution of successful strategic trade policy are many and that favorable outcome will be extremely sensitive to small deviations from any of those necessary conditions this means that pursuing such policy with substantially incomplete information could easily result in subsidies supporting more inefficiency than efficiency and leading to more loss than profit 10 in addition economic studies have suggested that even if the policy is well implemented the realized gains could be very small for all these reasons it is unlikely in practice that federal government support of strategic industries would be viable means for raising the terms of trade and overall economic welfare11 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the rapid growth of the chinese economy over the last decade accompanied by burgeoning trade with the united states suggests that there is large and growing potential for trade with china to have substantial effects on the price of both us imports and exports the price effects on imports and exports would also indicate that chinese economic growth is having significant impact on the us share of the mutual gains fro m trade with china over the past 25 years including the recent decade during which trade with china began its rapid climb the united states overall terms of trade has shown sustained trend up or down given its current stage of economic development it seems likely that chinas main impact on the us terms of trade over the last decade has been through the price of us imports the limited data that exist for the price of united states imports from china indicate th transmission of favorable impulse to the us terms of trade over the near term it also seems likely that the impact of the economic growth of china on the us terms of trade will continue to be dominated by the favorable effects of falling prices for us imports from china over the longer term conclusions are more tentative on the one hand it is certainly likely that with continued successful economic development china may produce goods that compete with us exports on the other hand that successful development will also 10 also if large subsidies are to be handed out without all n ecessary information available policy makers can anticipate some politicization of the process and the rising probability th at more subsidies will be given than can be analytically justified success is likely to be even less tractable if tradin g partners can be expected to retaliate against policy that will clearly make them worse off 11 for an appreciation of the evolution of

rising demand for foreign goods and services including many from the united states some deterioration of the us terms of trade may be the unavoidable consequence of successful economic development in large emerging economies such as china as well as india russia and brazil that leads to some added competition with us exports the economic benefit to the world economy emanating from such large numbers of people accomplishing the transformation from poverty to steadily rising standard of living is not something the united states has an interest in forestalling and may warrant the cost of some modest deterioration of the united states gains from trade however there is evidence of any significant trend of deterioration in the us terms of trade for more than 25 years despite substantial economic growth in the rest of the world including many emerging economies over this period this suggests that the united states has the ability to maintain the competitiveness of its exports in rapidly changing world economy this ability is probably rooted in the united states capacity to be dynamo of economic innovation the open steady flow of new ideas and an open flexible market economy are potent combination for fostering economic innovation despite the power and agility of the private market economic policy likely can indirectly have positive influence the economys terms of trade this can occur as beneficial byproduct of an array of policies that compensate for areas of market failure and support an economic infrastructure that furthers the economys ability to generate innovation and sustained economic growth these policies will raise the probability but certainly not ensure favorable terms of trade effect emerging from economic growth in the rest of the world relevant policies would likely include macroeconomic policies that minimize economic instability and raise the incentive for economic ag ents to undertake the forwardlooking activities of investment and innovation policies that gi ve focused public support to knowledgeproducing activities such as education and scientific research that may be undervalued and underproduced by the private market and continued initiatives to lower trade barriers at home and abroad in this way terms of trade gains would likely be seen as emerging from process that increases the gains to each trading partner although not necessarily equally and not as zerosum game in which the united states gain is loss to other nations
