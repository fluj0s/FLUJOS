it should b noted that assurance can never be absolute the most that the internal audit service can provide to spa is reasonable assurance that there are major weaknesses in ris k management governance and control processes 32 the matters raised in this report are only thos which came to our attention during our internal audit work and are not necessarily compr ehensive statement of all the weaknesses that exist or of all the improvements t hat may be required 33 in arriving at our opinion we have taken the f ollowing matters into account the results of all audits undertaken during the ye ar ended 31 march 2009 the results of followup action taken in respect f audits from previous years whether or not any fundamental and significant rec ommendations have not been accepted by management and the consequent risks the affects of any material changes in the organis ations objectives or activities matters arising from previous reports to the audit committee andor authority board whether or not any limitations have been placed on the scope of internal audit surrey police authority june 2009 internal audit annual report for the year ended 31 march 2009 page 3 whether there have been any resource constraints i mposed upon us which may have impinged on our ability to meet the full internal udit needs of the organisation and what proportion of the organisations internal aud it needs have been covered to date annual opinion on the basis of our audit work we consider that sp as governance risk management and internal control arrangements are ge nerally adequate and effective certain weaknesses and exceptions were h ighlighted by our audit work only one of which was considered as fundamental t hese matters have been discussed with management to whom we have made n umber of recommendations all of these have been or are in the process of being addressed as detailed in our individual reports 34 in reaching this opinion the following factors were taken into particular consideration risk management during the period we conducted review of risk man agement arrangements for the authority and force the authority having adopted t he forces framework historically the focus of internal audit review of risk management had been at force level only and so this was the first time an explicit rev iew of the authority had been undertaken consequently number of areas for imp rovement were identified two of which were considered significant these related t the need to finalise the authority risk register and to ensure that identified risks w ere explicitly linked to the authoritys overall objectives the review at force level was undertaken in syste matic manner and overall substantial assurance provided during the year at the request of the authority we used delivered risk management workshop to the authority board this was delivere d by specialist risk management trainer who is not member of the core internal au dit team
