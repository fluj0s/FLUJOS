response to two energy crises have generally been viewed as less successful than the earlier two efforts this report compares and contrasts the three initiatives in 2007 dollars the cumulative cost of th manhattan project over 5 fiscal years was approximately 21 billion of the apollo program over 14 fiscal years approximately 96 billion of postoil shock energy rd efforts over 35 fiscal years 115 billion measure of the nations commitments to the programs is their relative shares of the fede ral outlays during the years of peak funding for the manhattan program the peak year funding was 1 of federal ou tlays for the apollo program 22 and for energy technolog rd programs 05 another measure of the commitment is their relative shares of the nations gross domestic product gdp during the peak years of funding for the manhattan project and the apollo program the peak year funding reached 04 of gdp and for the energy technology rd programs 01 besides funding several crite ria might be used to compare these three initiatives including perception of the program or thr eat goal clarity and the customer of the technology being developed by these crite ria while the manhattan project and the apollo program may provide some useful analogies for thinking about an energy technology rd initiative there are fundament differences betw een the forces that drove these historical rd success stories and the forces driving energy technology rd today critical differences include 1 the ability to transform the program or threat into concrete goal and 2 the us to which the technology would be put on the issue of goal setting for the manhatta n project the response to the threat of enemy development of nuclear bomb was the goal to construct bomb for the apollo program the threat of soviet space dominance was translated into specific goal of landing on the moon for energy the response to the problems of insecure oil sources and high prices has resulted in multiple sometimes conflicting goals regarding use both the manhattan project and the apollo program goals pointed to technologies primarily for governmental use with little concern about their environmental impact for energy in c ontrast the hopedfor outcome depends on commercial viability and mitigation of environmental impacts from energy use although the manhattan project and th apollo program may provide some useful

project the manhattan project took place from 1942 to 19462 beginning in 1939 some key scientists expressed c oncern that germany might be building an atomic weapon and proposed that the united states accel erate atomic research in response following the pearl harbor attack in december 1941 the united states entered world war ii in january 1942 president franklin d roosevelt gave secret tentative approval for the development of an atomic bomb the army corps of engineers was assigned the task and set up the manhattan engineer district to manage the project bomb research and design laboratory

japan surrendered few days after the second bom b attack at that point the manhattan project was deemed to have fulfilled its mission although some additional nuclear weapons were still assembled in 1946 the civilian atomic energy commission was established to manage the nations future atomic activities and the manhattan project officially ended according to one estimate the manha ttan project cost 22 billion from 1942 to 1946 21 billion in 2007 dollars which is much greater than the original cost and time estimate of approximately 148 million for 1942 to 19443 general leslie groves who managed the manhattan project has written that members of congress who inquired about the project were discour aged by the secretary of war from asking questions or visiting sites4 after the project was under way for over year in february 1944 war department officials r eceived essentially blank check for the project from congressional leadership who remained completely in the dark about the

discussions regarding the apollo program began in 1960 congress did not decide to fund it until 1961 after the soviet union became the first nation to launch human into space the goals of the apollo program were to land americans on the moon and re turn them safely to earth to establish the technology to meet other national interests in space to achieve preeminence in space for the united states to carry out program of scientif ic exploration of the moon and to develop mans capability to work in the lunar environment8 the program included threepart spacecraft to take two astronauts to the moon surface support them while on the moon and return them to earth9 saturn rockets were used to launch this equipment in july 1969 apollo 11 achieved the goal of landing americans on the moon and returning them safely to earth the last lunar landing took place in december 1972 the apollo program was only one part of nasas activities during this period nasas peak funding during the apollo pr

for more discussion of this issue see crs report rl33528 industrial competitiveness and technological advancement bate over government policy by wendy h schachtmoral equivalent of war except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not to destroy22 the threat to which investment in ergy technology rd responds however is largely economic rather than military in addition the threat posed by climate change which is related to energy cons umption will likely be gradual and long term23 goal clarity another issue is the degree to which there is clarity and consensus on the program goal the manhattan project had clear and singular goal the creation of nuclear bomb for the apollo program the goal was also clear and singular land american astronauts on the moon and retu rn them safely to earth in the case of energy technology rd however the overall goal of clean affordable and reliable energy is multifaceted while energy independence has from time to time been rallying cry energy technology rd s in fact been driven by at least three not always commensurate go als resource and technolog ical diversity commercial viability and environmental protection to help reduce the risk of dependence on single energy source diversity of res ources and energy technologies have always been seen as goal of the energy rd program second unlike the manhattan project or the apollo program the doe energy technology rd program seeks ultimately to be commercially viable third the energy rd program must meet environmental goals including reducing the impact of energyrelated activities on land water air nd climate change technology customer another comparison criterion is the cust omer for technologies that may result from the rd the government was the customer for both the manhattan project and apollo program the private sector is the ultimate customer for any energy technology developed as re sult of federal energy rd programs therefore the marketability of any technolog ies developed will be key determinant of the degree to which the program is successful more over the inherent involvement of the private sector raises number of issues related to the appropr iateness of different government roles some believe that focusing rd on one particular technology versus another may result in government instead of the marketplace picking winners and losers24 some experts believe that the most important driver for private sector deployment or commercialization is not th need for new technologieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34645crs10 25 see for example david goldston

america for brighter economic future washington dc national academy press 2007but regulation or economic incentives25 others however believe that without government support and intervention the priv ate sector is unlikely to conduct the rd necessary to achieve the public goal of clean affordable and reliable energy and that current technologies are in sufficient to achieve this goal26 implications for congress when the manhattan project and the apo llo program are used as analogies for future doe energy technology rd th following points may be important to consider to be equivalent in annual aver age funding doe energy technology rd funding would need to incr ease from approximately 3 billion in fy2008 to at least 4 billion per program year to match the manhattan project funding or 7 b illion per program year to match apollo program funding levels or doe energy technology rd funding at its peak to be equiva lent of peak year funding would require even greater increases in terms of federal outlays energy technology rd funding would need to increase from 05 to 1 manhattan project or 22 apollo program of federal outlays as percentage of gdp this f unding would need to increase from 01 to 04 of gdp for both the manhattan project and the apollo program both the manhattan project and th apollo program had singular and specific goal for the manha ttan project the
