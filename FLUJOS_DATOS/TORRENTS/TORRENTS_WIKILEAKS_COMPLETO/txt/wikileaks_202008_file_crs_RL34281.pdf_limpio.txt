judiciary to draw on diverse pool of candidates for positions on the federal bench 2 force federal judges concerned about their financial futures to resign from the bench before they become eligible

to inflation and allow salaries from different time periods to be compared with one another though the cpi includes compone nts which vary across regions of the country eg housing food and gasoline the cpi represents national average for urban consumers and may better reflect the true cost of living in some regions of the country than in others nominal values are the actual am ounts paid to federal judges and other workers at given time and cannot be compared over time this report uses 2006 dollars as its baseline because that is the year for which the most recent comparison data to

expresse d concern about what they view as continuing decline in their real salary level2 chief justice roberts has characterized the current judicial pay rate as constitutional crisis3 particularly noting that judicial salaries remain steady or decrease as the real salaries of lawyers law professors and wage earners continue to increase the salary for district court judges is currently 169300 the salary fo r court of appeals judges is currently 1795004 in 2006 dollars the median salary for district court judges between 1955 and 2006 was 167047 the median salary for court of appeals judges over the same time period was 178139 while the judges curre nt salary is only slightly below the 19552006 median the salary vel has steadily decreased since 1991 when the real salary of district judges was 185170 nd of court of appeals judges was 196419httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34281crs2 5 for more details on the nature of these restri ctions see below outside earned income 6 see recent

of an active judge on th eir district or circuit performs in four months s 1638 also includes provision that restricts the reimbursable seminar related travel for federal judges to 2000 per trip and 20000 per year with exceptions for events approved by the stat department and those sponsored by the federal government state governments not including public educational institutions bar associations and the national judici college s 1638 also outlaws the acceptance of honorary memberships valued at more than 50 per year and applies the regulations of the judicial conference on outside earned income to justices of the us supreme court5 this report reviews the most common arguments that have been advanced in recent years for and against raising federal judicial salaries examines large body

those of the benchmark year of 1969 the year of highest real salaries for federal judges since at least 1913 should congress choose to act it can increas but not decrease j udicial salaries the constitution prohibits congress from diminishing the salaries of article iii federal judges7 arguments for and against raising judicial salary the degree to which federal judges pay has changed depends on how it is measured while real judici salary for district cour t judges declined 215 between 1969 and 2006 such calculation does not take into account real income growth for other classes of wage earners according to paul volcker chairman of the national commission on public service the real compensation of the average wage earner has grown 185 since 1991 and the real salaries of federal workers more generally have grown 1518 the real growth of salaries fo r individuals whom federal judges regard as their professional peers par ticularly partners in law firms and law professors may have been even greater9 using those benchmarks the 2003 volcker commission study reported more notable decline in real judicial salary judicial salaries are the most egregious example of the failure of federal compensation policies federal judicial salaries have lost 24 percent of their purchasing power since 1969 which is arguably inconsistent with the constitutional provision that judicial salaries may not be reduced by congressthe lag in judicial salaries has gone on too long and the potential for diminished quality in american jurisprudence is now too large10 several professional organizations have expressed concerns similar to those made by chief justice roberts and other cu rrent and former members of the federal judiciary the american ba r association the national ba r

increasing th salaries of federal judges11 in addition the current administration of president george w bush has expressed support for raising federal judges salaries12 on balance the majority of expressed opinions on the topic of judicial salary appear to favor some form of increase in the pay of federal judges though the specific amount of the pay and future prospects for judicial compensation may divide judges policym akers and professi onal organizations the consequences of such decline in judicial salary are alleged to be the creation of problems of recruitment and retention in the federal judiciary abner mikva who served in congress as cour t of appeals judge and as white house counsel has argued that low judicial pay has several cons equences for the judiciary it is true that more judges faced with th alternatives of senior status or outright retirement are choosing the more lucra tive path of retirement but they have served their time and vacancy occurs whether or not the judge retires or takes senior status i chose retirement rather th an senior status so that i could become white house counsel while i received pay in that j ob i have had the opportunity to earn substantial income si nce i left the white house and became neutral with jams disputeresolu tion firm the public obviously benefits from the ongoing service of senior judge but it is not flaw in the system that allows judges to have the option to ma ke up for some lost earning opportunities after retirement the real problem of inadequate judicial pay is the limits it puts on attracting judges to the bench in the first place i saw these limits both as white house counsel for president clinton when i was very much involved in finding candidates to fill judicial vacancies and as member of various selection panels since i returned to the private sector wyers most appropriate for consideration as judges are at the height of their ea rning power in the private sector at one time law schools were good place to look but even those salaries have advanced beyond the judicial levels now in existence to ask lawyer to go on the bench from the private sector is usually to ask that person to take drastic reduction in earnings as well as the other problems of living in public fishbowl13 those who argue against raising judicial salary tend to make four arguments first they note that the salaries of federal judges are high relative to all workers in the united states the 2006 salary of fede ral district court judges 165200 would put judges somewhere between the 90th and 95th percentile among all american households assuming other members of the household had income as defined by the census bureau court of appeals judges 2006 salary of 175100 and supremehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34281crs5 14 for 2006 the household income for the 90th percentile of american households was 133000 the household income for the 95th percentile was 174012 see us

judges and the perks of being federal judge prestige job security opportunity to sel ect and work with law clerks interesting work retirement package that offers full salary upon qualifi cation more than compensate for any shortcomings in judicial salary15 third some have argued that raising judicial salaries may not solve some of the problems thought to be associated with low and declining judicial salary as judge richard posner judge on the seventh circuit court of appeals who has written extensively on judicial salary argues raising salaries would not do great deal to attract commercial lawyers to judgeships the lawyer who doesnt want to exchange 1 million income for 175000 income is unlikely to exchange it for 225000 income chief justice roberts doesnt name figure to which he thinks judicial salaries should be raised but he can hardly expect congress to raise salaries by more than 30 percent and that only intermittently so th at inflation will eat away at the salary until the next jump16 fourth they contend that many of the c onsequences one might expect from declining salaries including problems recruiting and retaining federal judges have not manifested themselves in the degree to which advocates for judicial salary contend17 effect of judicial salary on recruitment and retention of federal judges an examination of the relevant data the difference of opinion on the necessity of raise in judicial salary stems in part from disagreement on some of the cons equences of what might be considered low judicial salary in particular those who advocate and oppose increasing judicial salary disagree ove r the extent to which declines in judicial salary make it more difficult to recruit federal judges from private practice depriving the federal judici ary

retirement to leave the bench to work in priv ate practice increasing turnover in the federal judiciary and lead more judges after becoming eligible for retirement to leave the judiciary often for jobs in the private sector or elsewhere rather than remaining in the judiciary in semiretired senior status depriving the federal judiciary of important resources of manpower and expertise to date little systematic evidence has been collected which would allow congress to evaluate the degree to which the current patterns of recruitment and retention on the federal judiciary deviate from historical patterns and the degree to which those deviations if they do exist can be attributed to fluctuations in judicial salary this report collects and analyzes evidence that can be used to evaluate how increases and decreases in judicial pay have affected the federal judiciarys ability to draw on diverse set of professional b ackgrounds and deter federal judges from leaving their positions early to earn more money inability to recruit qualified candidates those who seek higher federal judicial salaries including several current and former federal judges contend that relatively low judicial salaries deprive the federal judiciary of the ability to recruit lawyers from private practice as result federal judges are increasingly drawn from other ranks of the judiciary and government service rather than from private practi ce the ad hoc group on federal judicial salaries for example has argued that the declining earning power of federal judges raises the prospect of an alteration of the federal bench from one drawn from all elements of the legal profession to one populated only by the independently wealthy and those for whom federal judici appointment represents salary enhancement18 justice stephen breyer in prepared re marks he delivered in april 2007 to the subcommittee on the courts the internet and intellectual property of the house judiciary committee outlined what he viewed as the consequences of such shift federal district court is community institution the federal judiciary will best serve that community when its members come from all parts of

prior to their appointments to th federal bench though the proportion of judges coming to the federal bench from private practice has declined since the eisenhower adminis tration current levels are roughly equal to those of the presidential administrations of franklin d roosevelt and harry s truman the appointment practices of dwight d eisenhowers administration were exceptional in the extent to which dist rict court judges were drawn from private practice the eisenhower administration ppointed 651 of its federal judges from private practice while other administr ation since 1933 has appointed more than 55 of its federal judges from the same population four presidents since 1933 franklin d roosevelt harry s truman william j clinton and george w bush have appointed fewer than 40 of federa l district judges directly from private practice since 1933 the percentage of federal judges whose immediate pr ior position was another judgeship either at the stat or federal level has increased the percentage of district cour t judges appointed by president george w bush who were already judges 468 is 25 times greater than the percentage of district court judges appointed by president franklin d roosevelt who were already judges 186 since 1933 only presidents ronald reagan and george w bush have appointed smaller percentage of district court judges from the judiciary than their immediate predecessors the data presented in figure 1 do not illustrate relationship between judicial salary and the immediate prior positions of federal district court judges while the percentage of federal judges whose immediate previous position was another judgeship has increased on fairly consiste nt basis since 1933 the real salaries of federal judges have risen and fallen

consistent with the argument that lower judicial salaries translate into more federal judges whose immediate prior position was another judgeship these examples suggest that any conclusions about th decrease in real salary causing changes in the composition of pr ofessions leading to federal judgeships should be made with caution early departures of federal judges federal judges concerned about the ade quacy of their salary might choose one of two methods to make more money than they do as federal judges first they may simply resign as federal judges and take positions that provide higher levels of compensation second they may choose to re tire taking an annuity equal to their salary upon retirement that will never increase rather than taking senior status which entitles judges to continued costofliving adjustments if congress authorizes such adjustments for active judges advocates of higher judicial salary argue that federal judges resign and retire at greater rates during periods of low judicial salary in testimony before the subcommittee on courts the internet and intellectual property of the house judiciary committee justice samuel alito noted the following twenty

10 1869the degree to which these numbers represen t trends or aberrati ons in the federal judiciary could help illustrate how the deci sions federal judges make about remaining in or leaving their positions are affected by judicial salary if there is relationship between salary and early departure then one way to increase the stability of the judiciary would be to increase the salary of federal judges if on the other hand judicial salary and the met hod and frequency of departur from the federal judiciary are unrelated then increasing judicial salary may not alter the decisions of federal judges to depart for other positions recent history of retirement options for federal judges before evaluating the relationship between salary and patterns of depart ure from the federal bench review of the options federal judges have for departure may prove useful in the past 53 years there have been two significant changes to the retirement system for federal judges one in 1954 and one in 1984 congress also made modest changes to senior status in 1989 and 1996 in 1954 congress enacted legislation allowi ng judges to take senior status if they had reached 70 years of age with 10 years of service as an article iii judge or 65 years of age with 15 years of service at the time senior status allowed federal judge to retain his office but retire from active service23 thus receiving their salary but did not specify how much work j udges in senior status must do to retain their offices judges could also resign with salary if they were 70 years old and had served as article iii judges for at least 10 years24 the 1954 legislation was the first legislation that allowed judges younger than 70 to leave active service and receive their salaries though they could only take senior status and could not resign with salary until they were 70 years old and had served for 10 years25 before that time only judges 70 and older could choose to depa rt while retaining their salary and only then

between 1985 and 2007 may not be large 29 judges compared with 695 who took senior status in that time frame variations over time may still help explain the effect of judicial salary on the departure decisions of federal judges if declining judicial salary explains the choice judges make between retiremen t and senior status it might be argued that judges in the 20012004 and 20052007 periods should have retired at rates comparable to the 1997 2000 period whereas the retirement rates for those two periods are actually lowe r than the 19972000 time period and the retirement rate for the 20052007 time period wa s the lowest of any time period since 1985 evaluating the data the data evaluated to this point note onl the degree to which judicial salary is correlated with the professiona l backgrounds of district j udges and the departure via resignation or retirement of federal judges establishing correlation is necessary but not sufficient condition to establish cau sation this section evaluates first the strength of the correlations establishe d by the data and second considers what intervening variables might influence the relationship between judicial salary and the kind of candidates recr uited to become federal judges and how federal judges depart the bench any conclusions made about causation from correlations should be made with these considerations in mind strength of correlations the data presented here suggest that there are at best weak correlations between judicial salary levels nd the pool of candidates from which judges are drawn while the federal judiciary consists of different mix of individuals than it did 50 or 70 years ago c oncluding that these trends are caused by lower judicial salary raises several concerns changes in the immediate prior position of district court judges appear to ar ise independent of fluc tuations in judicial salary the decline in private practice as prior occupation dates to the eisenhower administration and the increase in service as judge as prior occupation dates at least to the franklin d roosevelt administration while judicial salary has risen and fallen several times over those same time periods blishing the correlation that is prerequisite for causation requi res more convincing data th an the data presented thus far by advocates of hi gher judicial salaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34281crs16 33 there is small body of academic literature that evaluates the influences on judges decisions to leave the bench that literature has reached competing conclusions deborah barrow and gary zuk find that salary increases reduce retirements by district court judges in given year but have effect on the numbe r of retirements by court of appeals judges james spriggs and paul wahlbeck find that in creases in inflationadjusted salary delay departure for court of appeals judges appointed by democratic presidents but have effect on judges appointed by republican presidents david nixon and j david haskin find that the effect of salary on individuallevel retirem ent decisions is mixed but that more court of appeals judges retire in years with lower salary albert yoon argues that judicial salaries do not appear to effect judicial tenure or judicial retirement however all of these works span several different eras of retirement po licy and do not appear to distinguish between retiring and taking senior status see deborah j barrow and gary zuk an institutional analysis of turnover in the lower federal courts 19001987 journal of politics vol 52 2 may 1990 james f spriggs ii and paul

california law review vol 91 4 jul 2003similarly determining that low judicial salaries cause judges to depart early either by resigning or by retiring rather than taking senior status can be difficult the correlations between judicial salary and th number of judges who resign or retire rather than taking senior status again appear to be limited the proportion of judges resigning declined in every fouryear period between 1985 and 2000 and judicial salary rose in all but the last 19972000 fouryear period in that time interval suggesting that there may have been at least between 1985 and 1996 an inverse relationship between judicial salary and the proportion of judges who resign that pattern however does not n ecessarily hold for the 19972006 period over those 10 years real judicial sala ries dropped during the 19972000 period and then fluctuated little yet the number of judges who resigned varied from 0 in 19972000 to 78 in 20012004 two periods in which real judicial salaries differed by less than 11 the median real salary for di strict court judges was 166618 for 19972000 and 168441 for 20012004 finally the percentage of judges who opt ed to retire rather than take senior status between 1985 and 2007 appeared to decline to 122 between 2005 and 2007 from 495 between 1985 and 1988 if low judicial salary caused retirements then the rate of retirements should ve remained consta nt from 1997 to 2007 period of nearly constant real salary for federal judges instead the percentage of judges who retired rather than take senior status declined over that time period concluding that judicial sa lary has caused fewer judges to be drawn from private practice or more from other ranks of the j udiciary or that judicial salary causes judges to resign or retire are claims that require the developmen t of more conclusive evidence33 possible intervening variables even if correlations are established they may exist due to intervening factors some unconsidered

nominated will politely decline because of the ugliness uncertainty and delay that now characterizes the confirmation process some cannot risk putting their law practices their livelihoods on hold for

driven by job satisfaction in addition to concerns about judi cial salary judges whose caseloads are higher may be more likely to resign than judges whose caseloads are lower several studies have indicated that the perjudge caseload in many districts and circuits is much higher than it wa s 30 or 40 years ago and may contribute to decisions judges make to depart the federal bench36 judges may

judges with the perception that their salaries continue to fall further behind where they were in 1969 than the actual dollar figures illustrate th at perception and any deleterious effects that perception may have on who becomes judge how long judges remain on the bench and the quality of the work they provide as federal judges may magnify observed effects in ways that are difficult to measure using objective criteria that is federal judges may not be exiting the federal judiciary at greater rates during periods of lower salary but the perception that they are doing so may affect the morale of the judiciary magnitude of effects although statistical analys is may not reveal strong effect for salary on the career decisions of federal judges seve ral former federal judges have pointed to salary as one of their reasons for departure37 furthermore though the effect of judicial salary on recruitment and retention in the federal judiciary may be modest some advocates for higher judicial salary argue that the role of judicial salary in career considerations may continue to grow as the american bar association and federal bar association have noted of the departures of federal judges even though the absolute number of departures is not large the trend is alarming because the number is increasing significantly even after factoring in the overall growth of the federal

in governance studies continuedhave occurred in judicial sa lary over time it also re quires choosing an appropriate time frame over which to evaluate claims made in favor of and against raising judicial salary any choice of baseline has strengths and wea knesses one useful way to choose baselines may be to consider changes in the nonsalary compensation that federal judges receive in moneta ry terms the most significant nonsalary benefit is the retirement package availabl to federal judges who choose to vacate their position by retirement or by taking senior status when comparing judicial salary over time it may prove useful to keep the changes in judicial retirement benefits in mind comparisons of judicial salary within rather than across the eras defined by retirement benefits 19551984 19841989 and 1989present could be more useful directly comparing salary data across these time periods should be undertaken with caution as any such co mparison does not account for the nonsalary compensation available to federal judg by creating the rule of 80 the 1984 legislation39 made it easier for judges to qualify for either senior status or retirement which may have increased the attractivene ss of federal judgeships without direct increase in the salary in that time interval the 1989 legislation40 may have made senior status more attractive option because judges in senior status could qualify for the same salary adjustments as active judg at the same time the 1989 legislation may have encouraged federal judges to retir rather than taking senior status because it required for the first time that federal judges perform certain level of work to qualify to remain in senior status the judicial conference and federal j udges who have testified on the issue of

supposed to be diminishment of compen sation lets keep it real and lets say the compensation should stay the same compar ed to the average american that it was when i took office thats what i think most judges would say45 appropriate comparisons for judicial salary starting point for considering the appropriate vel of judicial salary ma be determining the proper comparison group for federal judges judici salaries have been compared with those of lawyers in private practice head s of nonprofit corpora tions and judges in other countries46 other occupation offers perfect comparison to the work of federal judges accordingly making an comparisons across professions may prove problematic many federal judges come from private practice but many also come from legal academia state judiciaries nd other positions in the government see figure 1 above one may consider comparin g salaries in those professions from which judges come to judicial salaries with the proviso that such comparison likely does not fully account for the compensa tion monetary and nonmonetary that federal judgeships offer members of the judiciary also compare the salaries of federal judges with those of law school professors and deans in 1969 the dean of harvard law school made 40000 219728 in 2006 dollars very close to the thensalary of 38333 for us district court judges and almost id entical to the 40417 salary of us court of appeals judges today according to the administrative office of the us courts the deans of top law schools earn 430000 or 957 more than the 219728 real salary of the dean of

have considerable job security li ke law professors fe deral judges have diverse workload like law professors federal judges enjoy certain amount of prestige but the monetary component s of the two profe ssions may not lend themselves to perfect comparisons federal judges may enjoy retirement benefits that are more generous than those of law prof essors but law profe ssors likely have much more freedom to set their own schedules nd choose work that they find interesting law professors may also ear n additional salary as cons ultants though restrictions may be imposed by their universities on the consulting they may do federal judges may earn more than 15 of the annual ba pay rate for level ii of the executive schedule in outside earned income in 2007 federal judges we re limited to earning more than 25200 in outside earned income49 comparing the two professions has othe r limits as well law schools are free to bid for the services of faculty members in market such market does not exist for federal judges as only the federal gove rnment purchases the services of federal judges such market for law professors may drive up salaries of the best law professors whereas such competition for services does not exist within the judiciary better judges are not paid more than other judges at the same time both legal academia and the judiciary are part of broader market for legal services and the federal judiciary must compete with legal academia private practice and other government agencies for the rvices of qualified individuals nothing published by the federal

delinking congressional and judicial salaries related to the issue of judicial salary is the relationship between the salaries of federal judges and members of congress52 to argue that judicial and congressional salaries are linked might create the mistaken impression that judicial and congressional and executive salaries as executive level ii salaries are also linked at the same level all must move at precisely the same rate such an impression is only partially correct there is constitutional or statutory requirement other than the provision of law establishing the citizens commission on public service and compensation that the salaries of federal executive branch officials and federal justices and judges be limited by the salaries of members of congress or that member pay be limited by the salaries of these federal executive and judicial officials53 unlike adjustments to executiv schedule ex and congressional salaries which take effect under the ethics reform act of 1989 unless

employees and members of congress the recommended adjustment takes place unless congress acts to block the increase since enactment of the ethics reform act of 1989 congress has bloc ked enactment of the incr ease for ex employees and members of congress in 1994 1995 1996 1997 and 1999 in 2007 congress blocked enactment of the increase for members of congress but not for ex employees the 2007

parity on judicial salaries advocates of abandoning parity in judicial and congressional sa laries contend that the rise of judicial salaries has slowed since they were statutorily linked to the salaries of members of congress59 the relationship between pay parity nd salary growth however is complex60 between 1955 and 1986 period when congress in statutorily increasing judicial salaries did

congressiona l salaries rose 59 03 per year to 165200 in 2006 from 156007 in 198762 based on this evidence it appears that judi cial salaries to date have actually risen more under pay parity than absent congre ssional practice of qual salary for members of congress and federal district judges this finding is reinforced by accounting for wage growth among all workers over the same time periods

salaries to 03 per year increase from 04 per year decrease slightly less than linkage has increased the growth of judicial salaries to 03 per year increase from 05 per year decrease arguments for and ag ainst pay parity should congress choose to raise the salaries of federal judges or change how the salaries of federal judges are set it could consider ending the prac tice of parity of congressiona l and judicial salaries and allow them to increase at different rates the primary argument against pay parity is that the practice holds back judicial salaries for 20 years legislators have matched th eir salaries to those of united states district judges and deputy cabinet secret aries they hoped that coupling their own compensation with that of officials less in the public eye would salvage legislative salary increases despite voter hostility however congress has still been reluctant to increase its salaries compared to say average worker wage gains thus linkage has not produced the benefits legislators anticipated for their own salaries and at the same time it has held back less controversial salary increases for judges and executives64 there are at least two arguments in favor of pay parity first some members of congress believe that their work is equal to that of federal district judges and accordingly that both should receive the sa salary as representative f james sensenbrenner has argued i am one of those that believes that when youre dealing with constitutional officers of the government in all three branches and you and we are there should be some type of comparability in compensation since the branches are separate and coequaland i think the real question that has to be answered ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34281crs29 65 us congress house committee on

more pay or you dont deserve more pay but are the duties and responsibilities and time involved in discharging the duties of federal district judge worth that much more than the duties responsibilities and time involved in being member of the house of representatives or united states senator65 the second argument for linkage is mo re pragmatic member s of congress may favor pay parity as mechanism to justify raising their own salaries66 before 1987 congress tended to increase judicial salaries first and follow those increases by raising the salaries of members since 1928 and with the exception of the period from 1969 to 1978 when salaries for repres entatives and senators exceeded those of district judges salaries of district judges have gene rally risen before the salaries of representatives and senators were congress to deli nk salaries one might expect resumption of the pattern of judi cial salaries rising first followed by congressional salaries this pattern would mean memb ers of congress might have to consider their own salary increases as separate legislative items rather than as part of broader salary package for officials across all three branches of government pay parity is an important component of the debate ove r the salaries of federal judges should congress decide to address th issue of judicial salary it could choose to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the practice of paying federal district judges and members the same salary the three pieces of legislation introduced in the 110th congress that offer substantial increases in the salaries of federal judges hr 3753 s 1638 and s 2353 would if enacted end the practice of parity between congressional and j udicial salaries as none currently contain language increasing congressional salaries locality pay federal judges have since 1891 been paid the same salaries regardless of the location of their chambers or residences67 in contrast gene ral schedule federal employees across the country receive different salaries that depend on the location of their duty station those who argue for higher salaries for federal judges often implicitly or explicitly

location of the courthouse for the circuit court though panels occasionally hear cases at other court houses in the circuit and at other locations including law schools to hear oral arguments for one

with the code of judicial conduct in particular judg are permitted to engage in extrajudicial activities that improve the administration of justice but are expected to avoid extrajudicial activities that may create risk of conflict with judicial duties perhaps most relevant the code of judicial conduc t creates an expectation th at judges regularly report outside compensation for lawrelated and extrajudicial activities84 before 1989 there was restriction on the amount of outside earned income federal judges could earn this free dom may have allowe d federal judges to supplement their salaries but it also caused considerable controve rsy controversy surrounding outside income adversely aff ected the unsuccessful nomination of abe fortas to be chief justice in 1968 and played secondary role in the failed nomination of clement haynsworth to be an associate justice of the supreme court in 196985 congress might choose to consider ltering the limits on how much outside income federal judges may earn easing the limits might encourage federal judges to remain in active service for longer periods of time and may encourage individuals to serve in the federal judiciary who were otherwise reluctant to do so congress might also choose to leave the restrictions on outside income in place it does not appear that the imposition of outside income limits in 1989 caused federal
