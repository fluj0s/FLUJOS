6207c12 shspec174 meter reading scientific research follows certain laws and we have been rigorous in following those laws in scientology when you can get research problem down to one variable voila you are there during the last couple of months having observed that auditors werent uniformly getting unvarying results lrh took every variable out of technology that he could stripping it down and testing it to the point where we now have model session and repetitive prepchecking the meter once developed had to be refined and it was yet pcs were still wobbly at times so last night lrh watched three auditors to see what they were doing and found the one variable the meter read it works out this way all you have to do to louse up session is 1 clean one thing that is clean or 2 miss cleaning something that reacts there is little to choose as to which is the most serious person has certain knowingness matter how occluded and packed in he is the thetan always knows there is instinct as intuitiveness he knows you cant fool pc an auditor who tries is misguided pc knows when question is hot even if he doesnt know the answer he also knows when question is cold he has somethingnothing sensitivity he requires help to know what is there or to get high degree of certainty that there is nothing there his intuitive feelingness is not articulate and there is need to transfer it over into an analytical knowingness when you invalidate the knowingness of thetan you will get trouble the thetan can put up with this but he doesnt have to like it he doesnt like it even though he is used to it and has put up with got of it and been overwhelmed by it he has used it as pitch on others and to overwhelm others pcs arc breaks with his auditor are much more serious than his arc breaks with others you have heightened the pcs intuitive feelingness by putting him in session now if you tell him rud is out when it is in or in when he knows it is out he has long way to fall from his heightened insession awareness and elevated tone level it is severe shock and he gets an arc break he is now out of agreement with the auditor to the degree that he was formerly in agreement if youve got an agreement thats built as high as the empire state building the first scrap of disagreement will appear as high as that the pc will feel awful he is finally on the road to truth after all the trillenia and here is falsity it is very upsetting cleaning clean is the mistake that is most mysterious because the pc cant find what is wrong because it is nothing you can flub once on trs and still have the session going ok but if you leave one flubbed read your session will go to pot if you are accustomed to auditing with sloppy metering you have completely different idea of what auditing is like the things that are supposed to be in session arent there and auditing is basically protest not letting the auditor get too close auditing is as fast as pc is in session since the more he is in session the more easily he blows things pc is there to be audited and is very persistent as thetan thetan can he squashed and overwhelmed yet he never stops trying this is very noticeable in handling children thetan will keep reaching using disabilities to do so if all else fails if you set up perfect session and then and wild wrongness at some point you catch the pc offbalance and he goes into action reactively he is powerless to stop himself from acting it is as if you had the bank all stretched out like rubber band and someone suddenly let go of one end he is in mess he gets overwhelmed and starts dramatizing whatever is handy namely one of thousands of instances where he is still trying he will take such an incident and use it against the auditor this can get rather subtle the pc can convince the auditor that he has obtained results but then let someone else see that he hasnt made any progress he does this in such way that the auditor will find out about it it is good to know that meter reading is all that is wrong auditors have learned trs model session and repetitive prepchecking fine and we have taken havingness out of beginning ruds to eliminate that source of difficulty when we found that havingness takes the pcs attention off the bank and extroverts him which isnt good for putting the pc in session it is better to use ow to get his havingness up this also puts his attention on the bank your problems with pcs are the same old things communication control keeping the pcs attention on what he is doing getting your question answered etc you have mastered these things then sometimes had them deteriorate at which point you have been persuaded into unusual solutions q and doing something else getting anxious etc the pc is out of session its baffling what happens to cause this outofsessionness you missed meter read this wrongness may be missed by all the instructors and supervisors who see all the wrongnesses that follow from it and correct them to result lots of other wrongnesses may get located but they arent really what wrecks the session the ultimate session wrecker is the misread meter this arc breaks the pc all to hell he will start reading on arc breaks not reading because of arc breaks etc and you wind up with dogs breakfast this results from the calling of reads that arent there and missing the ones that are there the missed withholds and the missed withholds of nothing if this goes on for many sessions the pc goes on selfaudit because he doesnt trust the meter the pc cant have an auditor because he cant have the meter so he audits himself he gets anxious he keeps his own rudiments in like gopher sitting at the edge of his hole ready to duck the pc is running the session on himself purely because of bad meter calls so metering above all must be perfect there is tolerance whatever in it you must not miss single read meter reading must be perfect or you become dangerous auditor dangerous auditor is one who might miss read just one in session if read is equivocal say so and check again
