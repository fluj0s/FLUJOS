private securities litigation reform act was enacted to address the perceived problem of an increase in frivolous shareholder lawsuits the stated reason s for bringing those lawsuits were varied fraud mismanagement nondisclosure of material informationbut practically all of the lawsuits involved the loss of money by shareholders of the corporation some of the lawsuits had meri t because some corporate managers had without doubt misled or defraud ed investors however some of the lawsuits were called frivolous and were brought according to critics when for example the share value of the stock of corporation went down for reasons having nothing to do with the culpabilit of corporate managers whether shareholder lawsuit is meritorious or frivolous corporation sued must usually spend great deal of money in defending itself it has not been uncommon for corporation sued by disgruntled investors to agr ee to substantial settlement out of court some of these settlements have been described by critics as legal extortion because despite the absence of wrongdoing by managers corporations were essentially forced to pay out large sums of money to avoid even larger expenses associated with legal defense most shareholder lawsuits have been brought as alleged violations of the two major federal securities laws these laws the securities act of 1933 and the securitie s1 exchange act of 1934 were enacted in large measure in response to the intens e2 speculation in securities which led to the stock market crash of 1929 the principa l philosophy governing these securities laws is that investors and prospective investor s should have access to all material information about corporations which offer securitie s so that the public can make informed investment decisions disclosure of all materia l information is the major requirement of the federal securities laws the securities an d exchange commission sec does not rule on the riskiness of investments in particular compani instead it is charged with making certain that the public has all of th necessary information for making its own investment decisions the 1933 act attempts to assure the availability to the public of adequate reliabl information about publicly offered securities in order to accomplish this the act makes it illegal to offer for sale or to sell securities to the public
