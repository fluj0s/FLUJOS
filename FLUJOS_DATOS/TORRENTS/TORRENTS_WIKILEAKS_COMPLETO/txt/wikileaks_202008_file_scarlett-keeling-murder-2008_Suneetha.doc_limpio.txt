bit about your background on family education and career where are you located for your work generally i am practising advocate and member of the supreme court bar association i am also currently the legal counsel for the russian federation in goa my wife meenal is fashion designer and works with natural fabrics and organic dyes i have two children my daughter aishvarya is 14 and amay is 8 i have relocated to goa about two and half years back with dream that i might find more time here to spend with my children but that has not been the case have been travelling to delhi virtually every month on work i hope to reduce my trips to delhi so i could spend more time with my children before they grow up and fly away how did the scarelett case come to you greek friend whom i had helped out two years back on matters of fema and company law was approached by fiona who desperately needed sincere legal advice please give short version of the case as you see it there are several versions in the media the case is too complicated for to give short version of it while doing justice to the facts but to my mind and in few words its about the government being oppressive in 1 refusing to either acknowledge or investigate crime as serious as homicide 2 trying to cover up the homicide to protect some members of the drug mafia what is exactly your position regarding the case why did you become involved and how involved you are right nowwho else is helping fiona right nowi am not writing any suppositions and heresays but your take on it fiona was being stone walled by the police in treating scarletts death as case us 174 ipc it was recorded as an accidental death due to drowning in sea water fiona needed help and she didnt have the money to pay for it after the initial two days of assistance by fiona came to my office and confirmed that she did not have any money to pay for my fees immediately but she wanted to help her out she offered to sell her land when she returned to england to pay for my legal fees i had never intended to charge single mother of eight in matter of homicide of one of her children but i was touched by her offer and i immediately told her that i would be happy to assist free of cost let that not be burden on her mind i too have daughter who is now fourteen i could sense fionas pain as parent and felt my guidance and energy were essential at that point of time to my mind money had relevance in an issue like this it was the decent thing to do i also never expected that it would take anything more that couple of meetings with the investigating officer for us to convince him about the possibility of foul play in the matter but for considerations known only to him he refused to budge from his projected theory i have been the instructing attorney when fiona was stone walled at the police station level i have assisted to take it towards its logical conclusion today both the govt and the police acknowledge the fact of the crime and the cover up and cbi inquiry has been initiated to my mind the police officers and other individuals who have tried their best to cover up this crime should be prosecuted and charged with abetment strong punishment would send message to other police officers that neither are they above the law nor should they try and steer the course of justice tell about the crime scene in goa related to the case and how scarletts case is partis this typical case that got into lime light because fiona has been brave enough to take the bull by its horns yes there have been other instances where there is clear possibility of foul play in the reported deaths and the police have treated the case as death due to drowning or an overdose of drugs we are investigating list of such possibilities when the police had stonewalled us with their interpretation of the autopsy report i had approached some friends in the media and reconstructed the moments before the murder for them they wrote about the case in the goa papers i thought in the battle we would be assisted by the local media we never imagined that the case would get so much media attention for security reasons fiona lived in my house for four weeks and together we took the bull by its horns i must acknowledge the assistance received from dakini runningbear an american national who met fiona immediately after scarletts death dakini was the physical energy in the group and her drive helped on all matters on the ground we had discussed the possibility of the repercussions in taking the bull by the horns fighting the establishment was larger decision for as it was i who would remain in india to face the wrath in case we were unable to convince the world of the facts of the case i was told by some friends to take it easy as fiona would soon be safely back in england and the drug mafia would target and my family but to my mind stepping out in fear was not an option i read that this very year had some 12 people being killed in goa do you think the govt doesnt care enough and isnt this being handled badly its not about the entire govt its about few individuals in power who are brazenly confident that they can steer the course of justice and dont feel answerable to the public yes it is being handled callously that needs to be changed how is the law in goa equipped to handle this particular case are there loop holes law can never be without loopholes where the intentions are malafide the loophole is exploited where the intentions are bonafide the law does manage to assist justice how do you think is the tourism industry in goa india affected by the case is the law in general equipped to handle such situations do we need more laws or do we need more effectice implementation where is the weak link the tourism industry would suffer time would tell to what extent this incident has been shameful for not only goa but the entire country what has been revealed is the latitude provided to investigating officers and their abuse of the powers given to them an officer investigating homicide does need considerable powers and all civilised nations do provide for this but when these powers are visibly abused then the punishment for such an abuse should also be considerable interestingly this was not the first instance when the investigating officer of this very case has abused his powers in similar fashion in the first incident which happened three years back psi nerlon albequerque tried his best to pass homicide as suicide he was exposed suspended and promptly reinstated in service by the home department of goa such mild punishment clearly was not detrimental enough for him to have treated the case of scarlett with the level of professionalism required there have been cases of pedophile crimes going overboard in goa why is this conc in the tourism areas like goa and kerala is the law equipped to handle this or do we need more framing for this the goa childrens act is adequate in dealing with paedophiles what is missing is the political will to take these crimes seriously politicians are too busy in their struggle to remain in power also most of the crimes get the lime light only when reported the subsequent stages of investigation prosecution and acquittals are rarely followed up by the media or the public the police too keep the media at bay so they have the liberty to manipulate evidence or justice the public does have short memory and partial interest never results in complete solution crime could only be reduced if the levels of interest in the crime are sustained till conviction but that seems luxury of the first world for most of us in india interest in any crime is quickly replaced by the struggle to survive an active ngo with sufficient funds could take sustained interest in the crimes and the conduct of the various agencies involved till conviction but there might be other possibilities we need to think how the system can be corrected how are you handling the pressure yoga and pranayam how is fiona handling this what is her condition now is she hopeful tell bit about her fiona is wonderful mother her six children who had to live in my office for two weeks because of security reasons are clear indicators of the quality of her parenting the children are lovely quiet always helpful and assisting in the house work humour was the visible bond between them the older children helped the younger ones and the younger ones were obedient the sparkle of honesty and trust they have for the people around them was apparent and refreshing the entire troop would go for walk and come back to tell fiona all that they had seen she would listen despite the huge pressure of the day fiona too trusts everybody she meets there is not shred of cynicism or suspicion in her she has lot of positive energy despite her huge problems and pressures she would gladly take the time off to help an injured puppy her quick eye would spot every little animal or bird in the building she does not wear any footwear and walked bare feet everywhere the hot tarmac or the floor of the morgue did not dissuade her from being barefoot she says she loves to feel the ground below her feet and does not want to be disconnected her children too do not wear any footwear for trip to the market with my wife aurora the youngest who is five fell and cut her ankle on stone but instead of crying she smiled it off and quickly joined the others with her ankle still bleeding my wife had to make her sit on bench while she got band aid for her but the quiet positive energy was visible in handling an accident even in the youngest of the children fiona has nine acres of land in england and breeds horses dogs and chickens her children ride bare back on the ponies and swim in the sea off devon as well as the river this family truly belongs to the earth like our farmers some of whom do not wear footwear they have that sparkling quality of truth and trust which we urbanites find impossible to reconcile with fiona did not follow the institution of marriage but has nothing against it she feels that life without marriage works fine for her she might not have too much money or middle class life style but she also does not have the stress of credit card and mortgage payments that go with it scarlett was everybodys favourite and that is visible in the cards the children made for her ceremony on the beach where they found her body i am told scarlett would spend most of her time with her siblings answering questions and helping them learn she played the saxophone and enjoyed singing and dancing the youngest three just adored her and would not give her much time to herself they would often hold hands and sing and dance together has the media given you good deal so far there are several versions of the story of fiona in the reportsthehootorg did an analysis of the media coverage recentlyhere is the linkhttpwwwthehootorgwebhomestoryphpstoryid3000mod1pg1sect ionid1validtrue the media has mind of its own and the perceptions of the facts have been naturally restricted to the quantum of words in the article or the minutes of broadcast permitted by the editors fiona has had her share of bouquets and brickbats the sceptics have restricted themselves to detail of fionas failings or other peripheral issues raked up by couple of scribes the peripheral issues raked up were on unsubstantiated allegations like 1 fiona is negligent mother 2 there are forces trying to tarnish the image of goa 3 who are these outsiders who come to goa and cast aspersions on our police force 4 why cant these foreigners dress up more conservatively 5 these foreigners are trying to buy our land goa should not be up for sale 6 fiona has raked up this issue only because she wants long term visa to stay in this country where she finds life more affordable 7 this entire game is being played by some politicians who want to destabilise the govt but mostly the media has been very responsible and has focussed on the core issue of the crime of rape assault and murder as well as the attempted cover up by the police and the government the subsequent exposure by the media of goas under belly has been revealing to my mind the media in its role to ensure checks and balances in the executive has passed the litmus test here now that the cbi enquiry is to come in what is the possible direction that the case can take does fiona hope for justice yes fiona is hopeful for justice she is aware that her tiring efforts cannot bring scarlett back to life but sustained campaign would expose the nexus between the drug mafia the police and the politicians such an expose could prevent similar crimes in the near future is this the first case which has put you in international limelight have you had offers of help from anywhere else in the world on this this is not the first international case i have handled i have also handled the matter of the russian mafia in goa and that case is still not over there have been offers for assistance but plenty of statements of moral support future plans reg the case that you can revea there are future plans regarding the case which i can reveal right now whats your advice to the tourists that visit india your levels of alertness must remain high in dealing with unknown persons or situations you must be clear that if you do become victim of crime justice is very long and arduous walk here with that caution always in mind i would say that india remains beautiful country and is definitely great tourist destination
