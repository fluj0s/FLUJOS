department of defense reorganization act gna of 1986 commonly called the goldwaternichols act is considered landmark legislation as it reorganized the department of defense dod to more unified military structure joint personnel officer management organizing directing educating and evaluating military members of two or more military departments to accomplish an assigned mission was established as major aspect of gnas design to improve warfighting capabilities the objective was to improve the quality of officers assigned to joint organizations increase educational and experience levels of these officers and expand the interaction among the military services officers corps by addressing interservice issues while many experts believe the gna has been success the passage of time the constraining provisions of the law and some implementation issues have led some to believe the gna joint officer personnel management program could benefit from reexamination and possible revision indeed the original framers of the gna predicted that change would be necessary as the dod evolved into more joint oriented military force reinforcing this view the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has indicated need for joint officer personnel management change major problem is that the current provisions of the law for joint officer personnel management are so specific that the dod predicts it can not continue to meet the requirements this is in part because the dod has drawn down its military personnel strength by nearly 40 while operational requirem ents have increased further the law does not allow all officers to be credited with all their joint experience and technological advances in distributive and distance learning can not be utilized to fulfill joint education requirements for the officers assigned to these positions this report covers the background and intent of the gna as well as the present joint officer personnel management program the dod has proposed options for its revision to congress they include replacing the joint specialty officer designation with special duty identifier decoupling promotion comparisons and employing distributive and distance learning for joint professional military education the senate version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 s 2549 introduced language concerning joint officer personnel management which is consistent with the dod proposal with two exceptions the first difference is noted in the area of promotion comparisons and the second is in joint professional military education other potential options include forming commission or special committee conducting hearings or mandating study to further assess the program changes to joint officer personnel management

reorganization act tenyear retrospective edited by dennis j quinn washington dc national defense university press 1999department of defense dod reorganization act of 1986 proposals for reforming the joint officer personnel management program introduction and background introduction the goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization act of 1986 gna1 also called the goldwaternichols act changed the department of defense dod joint officer personnel management setting in law course for more interaction among the us military services prior to the enactment of the law each service existed independently of and in relative isolation to the other services they were not joint2 oriented training missions equipment etc tended to be service specific thereby limiting service interoperability and joint operations the gna brought the services closer and most experts believe that this has resulted in more coordinated military operations and increased the war fighting capabilit ies of the dod3 however over time number of factors such as changes in the strategic environment the implementation of the specific provisions of the law and the nearly 40 downsizing of military personnel strength have changed and in the view of many experts may have made revisiting the gna necessary one aspect of the gna which some including general hugh shelton the chairman joint chiefs of staff have singled out specifically is joint officer personnel management any changes would be subject to congressional oversight due to the complexity of joint officer personnel management this report is divided into eight primary sections 1 the background section provides descriptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs2 4 public law 96513 december 12 1980 94 stat 2835 et seqof the situations that preceded the gna and the provisions of the law 2 the joint officer personnel management under the gna section examines officer personnel management provisions and administrative changes of the law 3 this section understanding joint officer personnel management in relation to the gna describes specific terms and concepts of joint officer personnel management in relation to the law 4 the dod compliance reports to congress section examines the current compliance by the dod and shortfall in reporting requirements 5 unintended developments of the gna are reviewed 6 this section outlines the dod proposal which was submitted in the chairman joint chiefs of staff omnibus in early 2000 to address perceived problems with the gna 7 the section on legislation in the 106th congress 2nd session examines the differences in the dod proposal and the proposed legislation and 8 finally some congressional options are addressed in the last section this report does not provide general discussion of overall officer personnel management issues outside the boundaries of the gna particularly those governed by the defense officer personnel management act dopma4 broader aspects of dopma which established the basic parameters of overall officer personnel management for the us armed forces and not joint management are briefly analyzed at the end of this report to clarify some specific joint officer personnel management points background on the gna an act to reorganize the department of defense and strengthen civilian authority in the department of defense to improve the military advice provided to the president the national security council and the secretary of defense to place clear responsibility on the commanders of the unified and specified combatant commands for the accomplishment of missions assigned to those commands and ensure that the authority of those commanders is fully commensurate with that responsibility to increase attention to the formulation of strategy and to contingency planning to provide for more efficient use of defense resources to improve joint officer management policies otherwise to enhance the effectiveness of military operations and improve the management and administration of the department of defense and for other purposes opening statement goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization act of 1986 congressional authority over the organization of the military establishment with regard to the rules and regulations of the land and naval forces is found in the constitution of the united states art 1 sec 8 after world war ii the cabinetlevel department s of war and navy and newly independent department of the air force were brought under considerable central control of new department of defense via the national security act of 1947 and the 1949 amendments to the 1947 act congressional intent was to provide three separate fairly autonomous military departments independently administered yet unified in effort and subject to more centralized supervision under the secretary of defense however the act allowed the services to maintain their respective identities and missions indeed somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs3 5 the goldwaternichols dod reorganization act tenyear retrospective p 13 6 see appendix for historical timeline detailing defense reorganizationhave noted that this structure encouraged the services to compete for limited resources in some cases such competition encouraged independence and self sufficiency and in others discouraged interoperability or mutual support the dod reorganization act of 1958 increased the subordination of the military departments to the central authority of the secretary of defense the 1958 act also clarified that the military departments were to be separately organized versus separately administered continuing trend of steadily reducing the independence of the military departme nts this amendment also established the chain of command from the president through the secretary of defense and the joint chiefs of staff to the unifiedspecified commands which controlled the operational forces of the dod around the world from 1958 until the early 1980s there was little relevant congressional action concerning the organization of the dod then as result of interoperability problems and shortcomings during significant military operations the 1980 iran hostage rescue attempt the 1982 destruction of the us embassy and marine barracks in beirut and the 1983 invasion of grenada the need for defense reorganization became apparent experts highlighted the lack of crossservice communications interoperability and imbalances in servicejoint centralizationdec entralization functionalgeographic and specialistgeneralist tensions as inherit shortcomings of the pregna structure the services had evolved with their own unique identities missions languagesjargons personnel systems etc there were real concerns and some evidence that senior military leaders lacked an understanding and appreciation of joint operations as well as the other services capabilities the services did not value joint operations or staffs they had desire to waste their most talented officers in joint assignment officers were rewarded and promoted for working within their respectiv services assignments outside the service while necessary were often shunned and viewed as career ending tours to some extent specific service practices seemed almost foreign to members of the other services the senior uniformed leadership of the services was virtually unanimous in opposing the gna and arguing that the then current joint operational architecture needed major fixing one conspicuous dissenter from this mindset however was general david c jones chairman of the joint chiefs of staff cjcs who appeared before the house armed services committee hasc on february 3 1982 and testified that it is not sufficient to have just resources dollars and weapon systems we must also have an organization which will allow us to develop the proper strategy necessary planning and the full warfighting capabilitywe do not have an adequate organizational structure today5 his call for defense reform set into motion four years and 241 days of discussions and debates resulting in the passage of the gna6 the effect was to move away from the service chiefs responding first and foremost to servicespecific parochial interests and to move toward more centralizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs4 7 formed in 1984 renamed the

uniform system for evaluating the readiness of each cinc to meet mission requirements improve joint officer management policies the gna specifically addresses the policies procedures and practices for the management of active duty officers in relation to joint duty this report deals in depth with this area the main objective of the gna was to enhance jointness8 without damaging the positive aspects

complications with implementing the directives as result in the fiscal year fy 1988 and fy1989 national defense authorization acts congress altered the law to allow waivers in education and experience requirements to give authority to the deputy secretary of defense for designating joint specialists and to allow cumulative credit toward joint tour length requirements in addition although not suggested by the dod congress made changes to restricting career specialties which could be designated cos in 1993 recognizing the changing environment of employing troops congress made another change to allow joint duty credit for operations desert shield and desert storm14 with the assignment of jpme graduates minimum of at least 50 mandated to joint duty congress also afforded the military

in relation to the act are also covered joint duty assignment listi ng jdal joint specialty officer jso and critical occupational specialty cos the gna created number of new provisions with regard to personnel management specifically these include jdal jso and cos in addition specific requirements were created with regard to these however for number of reasons explained later the services have sometimes fallen short of meeting all the requirements established under the gna the following describes jdal jso and cos these are described in terms of how they were designed under the gna in addition the manner in which they have evolved is considered joint duty assignment listing jdal under the gna the secretary of defense is required to establish jdal the jdal is listing of military positions involving joint duty that satisfies the requirements of the gna this list includes military position s in multiservicemultinational commands or activities involved with the integrated employment or support of the land sea and air forces of at least two of the three military departments designated military positions are those which include involvement in matters related to national military strategy joint doctrine and policy strategic planning strategic and contingency planning and commandcontrol of combat operations16 not all military positions in multiservice environment are designated as jda and included in the jdal in addition this list explicitly details the requirements of each position for example the jdal contains the rank and primary specialty of the officer to serve in particular position although position may be filled by an officer who has been designated to carry out the particular duties of the position the officer may not be of the required rank thus the position is occupied but the specific requirements of the designation is not viewed as being in compliance with the gna initially in 1987 the secretary of defense designated 8000 jda positions for inclusion in the jdal of the 8000 jdas gna mandated that 1000 of them would further be designated as cos positions today the jdal consists of 9100 joint positions and 850 of those are designated as cos military positions17 table 1 details the positions of the jdal by service and assignmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs9 table 1 joint duty position distribution by service as of sep 30 99 usa

specialty officer jso by law the dod was mandated to create the occupational category jso as noted in the introduction and background section in order to be designated jso an officer is required to have jpme such as satisfactory completion of the national war college to be in qualifying joint duty assignment such as antiterrorism action officer on the joint staff which is included in the jdal and to be nominated by the secretary of the service and so designated by the secretary of defense merely being assigned in joint arena or attending joint war college is insufficient to receive designation as jso the services have utilized two methods to produce jsos the first method was employed from 1987 to 1989 during this period the established requirements of the law were so new that it was reasonable to acknowledge that few military officers could satisfy the criteria nevertheless in order to fulfill the requirements of the law congress provided the dod with the authority to designate individuals as jsos via transition boards individuals so designed by these transitional boards were not subject to all the educational and assignment requisites of the law in other words this original period provided dod with the flexibility to jump start the personnel requirements in order to have sufficient number of officers designated as jsos as result of this designation method by fy1990 more than 12000 officers were designated as jsos in 1990 the gna had been in place for sufficient period for officers to have had the opportunity to meet the established criteria of the jpme jda and secretary of defense designation therefore in fy1990 the gna required that all the requirements of the law to be designated jso be met currently there are about 6000 jsos critical occupational specialty cos within the jso designations the law created the cos cos officers are those jsos who are trained and educated primarily in joint operational war skills table 1 lists these war skills by service in creating coss title iv of the gna gives some special considerations to this grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs10 18 in 1996 rand released study which analyzed supportability of assignments and careers promotion objectives and jpme allocations and in second 1996 study rand released algorithm results for ranking joint military positions to determine potential jdal size but

excessive time away from the operational military positionspecialty would result in quick deterioration of the skills thus this category of officers has less stringent timing requirements for jpme and

some consider the optimum jso and cos numbers to be moot point since the law sets the numbers and others havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs11 difficulty embracing study of the optimum number since the determination might not result in change to the numbers designated in the law 2 still others have found this determination to be in the too hard to do category since the everchanging missions of the services and world strategic situations should drive the jdal numbers defining the optimum number today would likely be obsolete tomorrow despite the goals in establishing the jdal as well as the jso and cos various forces have modified how they were originally implemented andor how they have since evolved beginning first with the jdal it is interesting to note that since the end of the gulf war the size of the military has decreased by nearly 40 in other words the dod now has just over onethird fewer military personnel in uniform however the list of positions on the jdal has not been reduced to reflect this decrease there is continually lag between what is reflected in the jdal and the actual joint requirements based upon the joint activities being dynamic organizations changing organizational structures areas of responsibility and mission priorities are constant requirements change therefore everchanging future needs of the joint community may well be different from what is produce d by the jso program or is reflected in the jdal it takes the services minimum of four years to produce the inventory to meet the requirements the actual length of time required to reflect joint mission changes in the jdal coupled with the time the services require to producetraineducate the officers of specific specialties necessary for joint duty falls short of realtime mission changes the time lag between mission changes appearing in the jdal and the reality of joint mission requirements is primarily an administrati vely driven lag and this lag is even more evident in critical military positions turning next to the management of jsos following the end of the transition board and the beginning of the stricter adherence to the gna requirements in fy1990 the number of officers designated as jsos has decreased this decrease occurred for various reasons first as noted above the number of officers has decreased as result of the number of jsodesignated officers who left the service following the gulf war second the more rigid adherence to the requirements has meant that fewer officers qualify as jsos the original concept of the law was to produce jso who would follow joint dominated career path but jso careers have not evolved in this manner the cincs and joint agencies defense intelligence agency ballistic missile defense organization defense logistics agency etc continually express need for officers with high degree of expertise in their designated career specialities for their respective services officers with this current service expertise rotating in and out of the joint arena have become the nucleus of the joint environment rather than jso for whom joint duty assignments are more common than assignments in their service apparently the cincs and directors of joint agencies believe that previous joint experience can be of value but it does not outweigh the cincsjoint activities perceived need for officers current in the most recent development in their specialty and service doctrine likewise the continual cross flow of officers with both joint and service expertise is perceived as valuable to the services by creating linkage between the operational world and the joint environment as it has evolved it wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs12 19 the dod utilizes the joint duty assignment management information system jdamis to track jsosjsonominees with joint experience in compliance with the gna the jdamis tracking number assigned to each eligible officer is independent of the service position number to which the individual is assigned and these differing numbers can contribute to administrative tracking burdens of the gna 20 the multiple comparisons require very detailed understanding of promotion data and require substantial amount of time to assess in 1996 rand study margaret c harrellappear that the original concept of jointdominated career path jso does not meet the needs of either the joint arena or the services as result of the above issues the jso population has fallen from 12000 officers in 1990 to approximately 6000 today by fy2005 it is anticipated that this number will fall below 4000 this shrinking jso population will eventually lead the dod to report noncompliance with the gna19 the dod will be forced to not fill military positions of the jdal and report noncompliance in maintaining the end strength of the jdal or conversely the dod could maintain the end strength of the jdal with personnel who do not meet the promotion criteria of the act thus reporting noncompliance with promotion expectations assignments and joint tour lengths specific assignments and tour lengths were established to provide stability within the joint community and to ensure officers obtained credible level of joint experience the gna requires that of all military positions in the jdal at least 50 must be filled by officers who have been nominated or selected as jso all cos positions must be filled by designated jsos all jsos and at least 50 plus one officer of all officers attending jpme school must be assigned to joint duty within the first or second assignment following jpme the law sets minimum tour lengths for joint military positions at 36 months for field grade officers and 24 months for generalflag officers the law does allow for restricted number of waivers of these time minimums in relation to all joint military positions joint policy further states that the tour length shall not exceed 48 months without secretary of defense approval the law specifies that to become gofo one must have served in joint duty assignment in the grades of 0406 specific jpme course capstone is also required for all newly selected general officersflag officers promotions the gna contains numerous requirements and restrictions concerning the promotion of officers in relation to joint duty so as to ensure that the jsos and joint staff officers being assigned to the joint arena were equal in quality to and were promoted at least at the same rates as the officers being assigned to servicespecific headquarters staffs they thus mandated that specific promotion statistics be

joint staff category is for current and previously assigned officers who serve with the joint staff the jso category is for officers who have been designated as jso by the secretary of defense officers can be counted in both of these two latter categories the other joint category is for all others not counted as joint staff or jso who are currently or who were previously assigned to joint military position listed in the jdal officers coded joint staff or jso are not included in the other joint category promotion rates for officers of the joint staff and jso categories are compared to promotion rates of officers of the servicespecific headquarters staffs promotion rates for officers in the other joint category are compared to the promotion rates for the servicespecific averages the promotion rates for each category are compared for every field grade promotion board these assessments are further calculated for officers competing for promotion inthepromotion zone ipz abovethepromotion zone apz and belowthepromotion zone bpz21 within each assessment the promotion rates are also compared for officers currently serving joint and for those having served joint previously in their first post joint promotion cycle in total there are 40 promotion categories tracked five grades three promotion zones three joint categories and two assignment categories the intent of monitoring promotions within gna was to first increase and then to maintain quality of officers placed in joint assignments the serving in and have served in comparison standards were designed to raise the quality of officers assigned within the joint arena and to ensure those serving in the joint arena were not discriminated in the servicespecific arena for having served joint the gna provides that the quality of officers serving in the joint environment will be competitivecomparable to the officers serving in servicespecific headquarters staffs the intent was not however for joint officers to be promoted at an increased rate or before any other officer who was better qualified for promotion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs14 22 report of the panel on military education of the one hundredth congress of the committee on armed services 101st congress first session april 21 1989 many analysts and personne l involved in the tracking and reporting of the multiple comparisons believe that the process has become bureaucratic and burdensome and offers minimum value in addition many assert that the tracking process has become an inhibitor to assigning the right person to specific defined requirement due to the overarching requirement to meet promotion standards the mandated promotion targets have become the priority the result of the longterm higher standards for jsos has been relatively small pool of highly qualifiedpromotable personnel which does not allow for matching the best qualified officer to the joint requirement the small pool appears to be counter to the original intent of gna to expand the population to ensure all joint qualified officers were identified foravailable to meet joint requirements joint professional military education jpme joint education has its origins in the gna and the house armed services committee panel on military education of 1989 known as the skelton panel for its chairman representative ike skelton22 it was intended that joint perspective be ensured by immersion of officers into multiservice environme nt of academics sports and living accommodations in which the student body and faculty are proportionally representative of all military departments becoming joint team player communic ating with members of other services and understanding the services capabilities and limitations for mission accomplish ment are goals of the jpme programs gna authorized statutory joint professional military education jpme requirements for officers to be designated as jsos as noted earlier to be designated jso an officer must have completed an appropriate program at joint professional military education school 10usc 663 this can be accomplished in two ways first an officer can graduate from the national war college nwc or the industrial college of the armed forces icaf at the national defense university in washington dc these are the only two joint senior service schools war colleges with an academic yearlong curriculum for officers in the grades of lieutenant colonelnavy commander or colonelnavy captain nwc and icaf produce about 300 graduates year second an officer can also fulfill the jso jpme requirement by graduating from 1 either servicespecific senior service school war college with an academicyear curriculum for officers in the grades of lieutenant colonel or colonelnavy commander or captain or intermediate service school staff college with an academicyear curriculum for officers in the grades of majornavy lieutenant commander by residence seminar or correspondence programs and 2 by graduating from the 12week course of the armed forces staff college afsc in norfolk virginia another joint school the second method referenced above is the primary tool for most officers to obtain jso status the educational focus is upon the joint operational art of war although the largest number of graduates fill strategic level jdas within the joint staff or on cinc headquarter staffs the annual graduates number around 900 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs15 23 colonel frank h ayers jr jpme 2010 jcsj7 briefing february 4 2000 24 office of the assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs rsc ddram 11471148 fy1998 the ready reserve reserve components is comprised of military members of the reserve and national guard organized in units or as individuals liable for recall to active duty to augment the active components in time of war or national emergency 25 the provisions of the gna are not specifically applied to the reserve components see reserve officer personnel management section below with the active duty services actively seeking jpme assignments for their eligible officers and with the gna currently not applying to reservists seats are virtually nonexistent their attendanceaddition each course must contain balanced student body from the three service departments an issue arises in relation to the timing of the afsc courses given that the course dates and reassignment timings do not necessarily align most students report to the jda and then return on temporary duty tdy to afsc for the required course for example the afsc course begins the first duty monday in march and the assigned officer had reporting date of 10 january to the cincs staff in the hawaii pacific command the officer reports to the new assignment in hawaii by 10 january and works for about 40 days prior to being sent back to virginia for 12 weeks to complete the afsc course during the time at the course the officers duties in hawaii either go undone or must be completed by other officers who have their own duties in addition the military must pay for the officers return travel expenses and pay per diem living expenses for the duration of the course while this officer is in virginia the family has possibly been left to settle the household and themselves into completely new environment the impact of the tdy and return jpme completion results in the temporary assignmentloss of primary duty performance of an equivalent of 210 officers per year23 with the limited seating currently offered in jpme substantial number of military members serving in jdas are never formally educated in joint matters the total jpme production today is around 1200 graduates annually with jdal of 9400 based upon 36month average tour length it is not feasible for the dod to produce enough jsos under the current laws to fulfill requirements to further compound the issue many joint positions are currently filled or augmented by reserve component officers24 yet todays jpme virtually never reaches these officers25 given scheduling career requirements manpower needs and availability as well as operational contingencies some being emergency deployments which can not be anticipated it is very difficult to produce sufficient numbers of qualified jsos under the current legislative requirements of the gna jpme is one limiting factor based upon seat availability for the services in producing jsos couple the jpme requirements with those of the assignment process and it becomes clear that the dod can not succeed under the current provisions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs16 joint waivers virtually every aspect of the gna joint officer personnel management can be waived for some reason at some level during the early years following enactment of the law the services commonly utilized every available waiver under the oversight of congress and within the spirit of the law the services have steadily declined the utilization of but by means eliminated joint waivers as joint officer personnel management has evolved utilization of waivers varies by service but the bottom line is that there are multiple ways consisten t with the law to bypass the requirem ents for example it is not uncommon for 36month joint tour length requirement to be waived to 24 months and full credit for the tour rendered in order for an officer to move to needed comman d position from grade designation to jpme to mandatory jsodesignees in cos military positions waivers can be and are granted although permissible these waivers are reflection of requirements in the law and implementation of personnel management issues which arguably do not support sound joint officer personnel management reserve officer personnel management the provisions of the gna are not specifically extended to the reserve components nevertheless the reserve components are mandated to apply the gna active duty joint officer personnel management parameters to the extent possible currently these are not applied and the reserve components lack procedures to identifytrack positions which provide reserve officers with the knowledge and experience that come from working with other services and from joint operations given the demands of todays environment coupled with the military drawdown the reserve components are included in most every mission from disaster relief within the continental united states to ongoing operations in iraq bosnia and kosovo effective utilization of the total force the active and reserve components combined is viewed as critical to continued success in joint operations realizing the importance of the reserve components and the importance of capturing reserve component joint utilization working group cochaired by the assistant secretary of defense reserve affairs and the assistant chairman joint chief of staff reserve matters has been established to determine the application of joint officer personnel management for the reserve components the charter of the working group includes 1 defining reserve component positions which yield joint experience using the broadest possible definition of joint 2 establishing dod policy to provide guidance to the services concerning joint officer personnel management for reserve components 3 assisting the services in creating processes to track reserve components members joint experiences 4 advising reserve component leaders on implementing career tracks for the best and brightest officers to gain joint experience and 5 encouraging joint duty as career enhancer for reserve component members the working group is targeting the june 2000 reserve component senior leadership conference to present their findingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs17 dod compliance reports to congress the secretary of defense is required to report to congress each year the services compliance with the personnel requirements of the gna the report contains limited narrative and detailed data charts which supposedly denotes the dods progress in compliance or noncomplia nce with the directives of the gna however in reality the report provides detailed data which presents snap shot in time and many of the required charts do not demonstrate any specific compliance in addition the report does not cover trend analysis or yeartoyear comparisons which would further demonstrate progression or noncompliance for example in the latest report dod covers compliance utilizing fy1999 and provides summary of jsos as specifically required in the gna table 3 summary of joint specialty officers jso usa usaf usmc usn total designated as jsos 362 223 70 203 858 designated as jso nominees 714 814 173 574 2275 jso nominees designated under cos provisions 368 365 101 316 1150 secretary of defenses annual report to the president and congress 2000 httpwwwdticmilexecsec the dod reported that 858 officers had been designated as jsos that 2275 officers had been designated as jso nominees and that 1150 jso nominees were designated under cos provisions in addition the total numbers are reported by service as noted earlier there has never been an optimum jso number determination however this summary does not demonstrate any specific level of compliance it merely provides factual data more complete view of the fy1999 compliance charts of the annual report can be found in appendix d although dod has made progress with compliance in accordance with the gna the annual report does not always reflect the magnitude of progress or document longterm areas of concern for example the report appendix d table 12 shows that the navy did not meet the 06 promotion objective in the other joint category in fy1999 but the joint staff office which tracks compliance has found that the navy consistently fails from year to year to meet the 06 promotion objectives in the other joint category thus requirement for multiyear longterm trend analysis versus oneyear information could provide better understanding of dod compliance with the gnahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs18 26 an advanced specialty course is designed to provide advanced education in the specific corps specialty such as aircraft investigation qualification or senior security police management the command course offers specific training in issues necessary for commanding units ie legal environmental public affairs pme provides individual military members with the skills knowledge understanding appreciation which enables them to make sound decisions in progressively more demanding positions within the national security environment it focuses on servicespecific joint and leadership issuesunintended developments of the gna for joint officer personnel management there are several joint officer personnel management unintended developments since gnas enactment which have developed over time the first development is that the jsos did not necessarily evolve as envisioned by the original framers and cos has become misnomer in addition the time demands upon an officer has made not only joint officer personnel management but all personnel management difficult and precise balancing act to ensure an officer can meet all requirements the second development concerns the application of the promotion standards when applied they allow for some of the best officers to avoid joint duty until they are selected for promotion to brigadier generalnavy real admiral lower half the third development compliance reporting has led to the promotion criteria rather than sound personnel management being primary factor in joint duty and very few officers serve second tour in the joint arena these unintended and unforseen developments indicate why the dod predicts significant noncompliance in the near future and why the dod has made proposals which follow this section joint specialty officers the jso career path as discussed earlier did not necessar ily evolve as envisioned the very nature of the skills and expertise which contribute to the joint culture is possibly twoedged sword in the management of personnel and in an individuals career goals in addition to joint duty outside the specific career specialty the officer must maintain specialty expertise in hisher primary specialization area ie pilot submariner infantryman officers need service expertise to be promoted and serving in joint duty assignments competes with time available in an average career to acquire service expertise it is precisely this expertise which is most valueadded in the joint arena thus there can be negative effect upon the officers career progress as well as negative effects for utilization within the service and within the joint arena career management it was never intended in the original concept of the jso that placing an officer in joint tour for specified time would create difficulties in career manage ment in the course of twentyyear career an exceptional officer often spends one year in primary specialty training followed by three years of primary specialty duty two years inresidence professional military education two to four years in command and three years on headquarters staff this allows for seven years of typical career to be devoted to advanced specialty training jpme joint duty and pursuit of higher education26 kathleen van trees medlock noted student of military personnel management studied typical army officer and found that fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs19 27 kathleen van trees medlock critical analysis of the impact

briefing 7 january 2000figure 1 typical officer career paththe time of eligibility to begin the jso process typical army officer has twelve years to become jso and prepare for competition for promotion to brigadier general during those twelve years the officer must complete assignments in command service headquarters staffs and two service school rotations as well as devoting three to four years to jso qualifications27 given this timing currently only 29 of officers designated as jsos return to joint duty once less than 10 return to joint duty twice28 align these numbers with the end of the cold war current optempodeployments and downsizing of the military forces and typical career officer must have extraordinarily precise personnel management to succeed within the current system anything which derails this progression will throw career off track plus it is even more difficult to work joint assignments into the careers of officers who are promoted belowthezone as the services express concern over assigning officers to complete jpme and serve in joint military positions in order to be designated as jso they are implicitly relating that it is extremely difficult to fit both the joint experiences and the service experiences which they consider equally important into typical career path another unintended jso consequence is related to the initial implementation of the gna which allowed for the transitional jso the transitional method afforded an oversized pool of jsos from which to draw the expertise needed to meet jointhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs20 29 major marilyn howe the future of joint officer management jcsj1 briefing january 7 2000requirements as noted the transitional jso pool which is 46 of jsos today is rapidly shrinking as this group of officers reaches retirement eligibility and as it is nearly impossible for the services to replenish the pool with bylaw jsos the transitiona l losses coupled with the bylaw losses are two times the production rate for jsos the pool of eligible jsos has been on the decline since the high of 12000 in 1990 and is projected to be below 4000 by 200529 the evershrinking pool is making it more and more difficult to fill all military positions also unforeseen when enacted but noted by many is the concern that the services are have to be by law meeting the jso requirements and expectations of the law at the expense of sound joint officer personnel management for example officers with good records and the potential for promotion to make the grade of colonelnavy captain often meet the requirements and are designated as jsos without regard for the specialty being required within the jdal likewise an officer with high potential for promotion who has completed pme in residence who has held command and served in jda is likely to be designated jso regardless of the existence of requirements for the officers specialtygrade on the jdal or promotion potential for gofo also the assignment of an officer graduating from the national defense university ndu is often more influenced by the statutory requirement to place at least 50 plus one member of each ndu graduating class into an approved jda than it is driven by where the individual officer can best be utilized this desire to comply with law has developed gap between the jdal requirements and the jso inventory in other words the internal composition of the skillsspecialties of the jsos are not necessarily the composition required to fill the jdal the fact that only 29 of officers having been designated as jsos ever serve in jda following jso designation highlights this consequence promotions as with the case of jsos when the promotability standards are applied unintended developments appear some of the best qualified officers in specific specialities never serve in joint assignments while other quality officers are denied the opportunity to serve joint compliance with the promotion standards affect todays joint officer personnel management with the services seeking to promote officers who have the highest potential for command leadership and continued promotion it is not difficult for the best officers to bypass joint the law as written and the current promotion system allows the services to groomgrow officers without joint experience until they reach the grade of brigadier general navy rear admiral lower half this pool of officers is usually the very best of the best in addition promotion standards by design also exclude some excellent officers from serving in joint positions due to their lack of promotability to colonelnavy captain for example an officers career which has centered around specific area of expertise such as russia may not possess the qualities sought for promotion to 0httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs21 6 considered an expert this officer might be the perfect 05 to serve as desk officer in the joint staff paradoxically though the demand to reserve jda positions for promotable officers could preclude service in the joint arena promotion standards were envisioned as ensuring improved the quality of officers assigned within the joint arena however it also eliminates some of the most experienced best qualified officers from utilization in the joint arena as with jso assignments to ensure compliance with the law promotability potential has become top priority when nominatingdesignating officers as jsos the requirement for sufficiently large pool of jsos to meet requirements is often countered by the promotability issues the end result is relatively small carefully selected highly qualifiedpromotable jso pool which will not meet jdal requirements in the near future although not counter productive to efforts to maintain highly promotable pool of jsos it currently contributes to the gap between the number of jsos and the specialty requirements mentioned earlier to measure the quality of joint personnel on narrow continuum of single promotion board for specific grade and category does not present the whole picture of the officer of the officers career or of the officers future potential or utilization since officers are promoted based upon their immediate future potential single board only measures performance at the time of eligibility in essence the current promotion comparisonsnarrow views do not allow for the distribution of quality over time to be measured thus it is misleading measure of longterm quality for example the services could be meeting quality targets over time if an aggregate were measured and yet not be meeting every specific board target critical occupational specialty critical position has become misnomer within todays jdal it is often the least critical positions which carry the cos designation when the joint officer personnel management program cannot deliver the intended cos officer the cincsjoint activities 1 accept officers who meet the legal requirements but not necessarily the mission needs 2 live with vacancy because cos officer to fill the critical military position is not available 3 process waiver for nonjso to be assigned to the critical military position or 4 move the critical military position designation to another military position so they can acquire an officer to meet the mission needs in all cases but especially in the case of moving the critical military position designation the original intent of the law is manipulated to meet mission needs the end result is that the least critical of the military positions the ones which can be left vacant or can be filled by nonjso are the ones designated as the critical military positions this evolution has developed system in which it is impracticable to determine the future cos needs of the joint world and to properly planprepare in advance for the future needs the process does not allow for keeping pace with real world realtime needs careerism another significant consequence is the shift from service to joint orientation and in some cases preference at the time of gna enactment the services werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs22 30 careerism positioning to enhance individua l prospects for promotion

promoted careerism nor do their core values allow for careerism at the time of the gna the services were gaining momentum in cataloging careerism as opprobrium but today following the requirements of gna and the services embracement of joint duty joint careerism ie jockeying for joint staff or unified command position is surfacing within the officer corps31 today personnel from all the services seek joint assignments which has become prerequisite for promotion to general or flag officer32 this has the potential to serve as positive consequence when viewed from the perspective of having the best and brightest officers serve in joint positions or on the other hand it can be negative consequence if it grows to counter one of the armed forces strong core values service before self the current dod view in 1996 ten years after the gna was enacted one of the initial framers of the legislation former senate staffer james r locher noted congress had hoped that the department after several years of implementing title iv would conceptualize better approach to joint officer management that has not occurred the goldwater nichols objective of improving joint officer management has been achieved but dod still lacks vision of its needs for joint officers and how to prepare and reward them33 three years later secretary cohen shared the current dod view in his january 2000 report to the president the department and the joint staff are currently completing an extensive review of both the law and policy governing joint officer management the recommendations from this review promise to uphold the fundamental tenets of goldwaternichols while streamlining the processes that will allow the department to continue to meet the challenges of the 21st century34 the dod believes it has evolved to the point that joint is normal although it has not evolved to the exact letter of the law the dod has studied and designed proposal concerning several aspects of the law governing joint officer personnel management their proposal includes replacing the jso with special duty identifier deleting the cos separating promotion comparisons and jso designations redesigning promotion comparisons realigning joint tour lengths with standard service tours lengths redesigning and expanding jpme and redefining the annual report to congress the proposal has beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs23 approved by the cjcs and presented to some key congressional members and staffers the first and overarching aspect of the proposal is to replace the jso designation with special duty identifier the gna focused on specialist career track for the jso which has not evolved within the services and the dod proposes replacing the jso with jso special duty identifier the dod sees this change as means of placing emphasis on building larger pool of officers with joint expertise and education the jso duty identifier would allow for the automatic granting of jso status to every officer who completes the required joint education and joint duty assignment there would be required order of educationassignment as currently exists in the law the jso designation board which selects jso nominees based upon meeting criteria and promotion potential would longer be necessar this new designati on process would allow for evercurrent identification of all joint qualified personnel thus allowing immediate identification of eligible officers required to meet everchanging immediate joint requirements the intent is to expand the jso pool to include all qualified officers and to provide greater variety of grades and specialties having the right officer who meets the requirements is the highest priority of the joint environment and the expansion of identifying all joint trainedqualified officers meets this key need with the jso special duty identifier being utilized the cos would be deleted the cincjoint agency owners of the joint military positions would establish all requirements through the officer requisition process currently utilized by the services and there would be requirement for the cos the dod proposal to delete the cos would supposedly offer the joint activities the flexibility to determine requirements and to requisition qualified officers to meet them with the deletion of the cos and the associated restrictions for filling cos military positions the ability to quickly locate officers with the desired expertise to fill timemissioncritical requirements would according to the dod be enhanced the dod envisions the multiple jdal fillrate tracking requirements ceasing as all joint military positions would be created equal the proposal also includes decou pling promotion comparisons from jso designation this delinking will allow identification of all officers who are joint qualified versus identifying only those select officers who would enhance the statistics by meeting promotion standards although delinked promotion standards would continue as quality indicator for officers assigned to joint military positions to ensure the quality of officers assigned to jdas promotion comparisons would be redesigned the dod proposal is designed to continue comparison but would delete much of the administrative criteria currently required it proposes to compare those currently assigned in the joint staff to those currently serving in the service headquarters staffs and compare those assigned in the joint agencies to the service average the proposal would delete the requirements for comparing those who have previously served joint and jsodesignees specifically the dod believes its proposal would continue to measure the quality of the officers without allowing the reporting requirements to become more important than matching the correct person to the requirement thus an officers special backgroundexpertise would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs24 35 every authorized military position has an assigned tour length most common lengthstandard length for tour is 36 months however for military positions authorized within very intensedemanding areas of operations tour lengths vary from 12 months to 24 months 12 month tour is commonly referred to as short tour there are short tour authorizations within the continental united states for example an assignment in korea specifically in close proximity to the north and south border would be classified as short tour the area of operation experiences an intense optempo in significantly dangerous area thus affording the uniformed member experience abovebeyond that of uniformed member performing similar duties in headquarterswithin the united states 36 joint task force is temporary operation which is created to handle specific mission for which there are permanent military positions authorized and for which there is intent to authorize permanent military positions although the duty is joint and hosts considerable joint experience of value to cincs joint credit is seldom authorized due to the lack of permanent military positionsthe driving factor in assignments the dod proposal would continue with the current service quality screening process before an officer could be assigned to jda the dod believes that joint tour lengths should be aligned with standard service tour lengths35 the current provisions for tour lengths with its many exceptions and waivers can be confusing and the tracking process requires extensive oversight the dod proposal is designed to advance the intent of the gna concerning joint tour stability yet provide more simplified process this proposal would grant the secretary of defense additiona l authority in determining full joint credit for tour of duty and would allow the secretary of defense more discretion in deeming which assignmentssituations grant valuable joint experience joint tour of 36 months like the majority of standard tour lengths would remain the standard for most joint duty however for example joint tour in korea would be aligned to the current assignment standard for short tour 12 to 18 months these short tour locations sustain high optempo and the joint experience in this type arena is commensurate to that of officers serving longer tours in less strained environments in addition serving in joint task force jtf headquarters36 is considered valuable joint duty the proposal would allow for full joint credit to officers who amass 365 days in jtf headquarters when deployed via 90day rotations the current cumulative credit authorization enacted in 1996 for credit after 36 months would be deleted the proposed credit for short tours in remote areas and for jtf service would recognize valuable joint experience which otherwise goes unnoticed and uncredited to the individual officer today the dod proposal would support the original legislation which recognizes there are legitimate reasons for curtailment of 36month tour and it would retain 24 months as the minimum service for joint tour credit in most cases in addition the proposal establishes provision for the owning joint activity to agree to the early release of an officer if the owning activity does not agree the officer will not be moved prior to completion of the joint tour the proposal deletes the use of cumulative credit for partial tours as known today officers either complete the joint tour to receive full credit or leave early and receive credit an automatic incentive to enhance stability in tour lengths if an officer is moved from one joint position tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs25 another joint position joint credit between consecutive joint duty would be recognized the tour length proposal is drastically simplified as compared to todays requirements the firm tour length standards to be rigorously implemented meet the requirements of the joint arena and mirror the way the forces operate today the dod believes that the career focus should be broad joint education and recommends expanding the capabilities of joint education as well as opening joint education to much greater number of officers however to accommodate this expansion education must first be delinked from assignments thus allowing for the expansion of education and allowing the education to reach significantly higher number of officers the dod proposal focuses upon one stop strategiclevel jpme which will delete the tdy and return issues expand jpme to much larger total force audience at reasonable price as it deepens and broadens the jpme content the proposal includes an elective course design at the current senior service schools distributed jpme via joint seminar formats distance jpme to the individual officer online and allows for afsc to be expanded into joint operations school extending an afsc exported curriculum and faculty if requested as an elective course at the current senior service schools would meet the joint requirements and eliminate an extensive number of tdy and return losses as noted earlier this would allow joint education within currently established school afsc inresidence outreach the expected audience would be approximately 650 officers per year the second aspect of distributed jpme would consist of an afsc exported curriculum into the joint arena the program would be taught in seminar format one session per week for six months at the cinc headquarters this proposal would also delete tdy and return losses as well as delivering jpme to officers who currently have opportunity for jpme in addition to the basic curriculum from afsc cincspecific concerns issues and topics could be incorporated into the program it is estimated that this proposal could reach an additional 600 officers who currently receive education in joint matters the third aspect employs distance learning by exporting the afsc curriculum directly to individual officers on their homeoffice personal computers this is envisioned to be six month course using off the shelf technology and virtual seminars this aspect would greatly expand jpme to the total force by providing anywhereanytime jpme capability the annual audience could reach 2500 officers who currently receive jpme in addition to reaching an expanded officer pool at the strategic jpme level it is proposed that the expansion of the current afsc to 10month 100 student joint operational school this residence program would qualify as intermediate service school and fulfill the requirement of jpme afsc would also establish two month summer course which would cover the requirements which are currently in place as afsc this program would reach approximately 100 students annually and 300 students during the summer program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs26 the dod proposal would increase the number of officers currently educated in joint matters annually from 1200 to approximately 4350 without significantly increasing jpme expenses above current spending levels the dod proposes expanding the intent of the gna by educating additional students for onetime investment in advanced distributed learning the design would allow for all officers destined for joint duty the opportunity to receive joint education commensurate with rank and responsibilities in addition the dod sees this proposal as recasting jpme as an educational component of continuum of lifelong joint learning the entire dod proposal of the gna maintains the standards for the secretary of defense to monitor the state of joint officer personnel management and redefines the measurements which would continue to be reported to congress in the annual defense reports to satisfy the concerns of those who might interpret the dod proposal as cutting away too many of the aspects which have enhanced jointness the dod would report 1 jso special duty identified officers by gradeservicespecialty 2 analysis of how well the service secretaries are assigning personnel to joint positions 3 number of good of the service waivers for gofo selected 4 percent of officers departing from joint duty before earning full joint tour credit 5 percent of ndu class seats filled by course 6 listing of jtf headquarters currently approved for joint duty credit 7 promotion comparisons and 8 significant information as determin ed by the secretary of defense although extensive in nature the dod believes the proposed reporting will convey the continued progress of jointness without allowing the reporting constraints to adversely affect personnel utilizationjoint officer personnel management in sum the proposal maintains jdal of assignments in which officers gain significant experience in joint matters but in doing so it would delete many of the current waiver options critical military positions would be deleted the jso pool would be greatly expanded and there would be quota for at least 50 of jdal military positions to be manned by jso nominees promotion comparisons would be for officers currently serving joint general officersflag officers would continue to require joint duty prior to promotion to 07 and completion of capstone the sequence rules for jpme prior to jda would not be required and jpme would be redesigned to afford greater number of officers including guardsmen and reservists the opportunity to complete joint education assignment requirements of 50 plus one would be dropped for ndu graduates and the annual report to congress would be updated to ensure reported information focused on meeting the joint arena requirements by reporting what matters to congress in their oversight role with the intent of staying within the gna provisions of the law the proposed changes are suggested to offer more flexibility in joint officer personnel management and to afford greater chance of getting the correct officers with the appropriate skillseducation matched to realworld requirements the proposal synchronizes the joint management process with the services personnel management processes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs27 37 cjcs 2000 posture statement to congress office of the chairman joint chiefs of staff 8 february 2000 24

assured congress he is not seeking to weaken jointness but to improve it to champion it just as is supported by joint vision 202038 he is seeking the flexibility in personnel management to fulfill the strategic concept of decisive force power projection overseas presence and strategic agility the dods goal is to transform joint personnel management balanced with the performan ce of missions in dynamic environment to maximize jso production as early as possible in career for better personnel utilization the new dod proposal is not without controversy some find the proposal to be too farreaching in lifting the gna joint officer personnel management constraints and reporting aspects of the act concerns of this nature focus on the fact that the proposal gives additional authority to the secretary of defense and jcs which could fall short of the original intent of the gna given the dods reluctance to seek jointness at the time of its enactment some hold distrustful view of the dods ability to selfmanage joint officer personnel still others have expressed disappointment in the dod view they have described it as making administrative and mechanical change to ease the burden of reporting and have found that the proposal lacks innovation and major redesign for the future of joint officer personnel managem ent the proponents of the dod proposal believe it will streamline the process while maintaining the original intent of the gna and will allow for sound joint officer personnel management legislation in the 106th congress second session the senate version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 s 2549 subtitle b joint officer management sec 521528 provides the following language concerning joint officer personnel management39 the committee recommends series of provisions that would streamline the designation and management of joint speciality officers the recommended provisions would simplify the requirements to be designated as joint speciality officer would require that joint professional military training be conducted in residence would establish the promotion objectives for joint speciality officers as group to be equal to or greater than the rate of officers of the same armed force in the same grade and competit ive category serving on the headquarters staff of that armed force would establish the minimum tour length to qualify for joint tour and would modify the required contents of the annual report to comply with the simplified management requirements40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs28 this legislative language from s2549 is consistent with the dod proposal with two major exceptions first section 522 of the bill would alter promotion comparisons to compare all officers serving in and having previously served in joint duty assignment to officers of the same armed force in the same grade and competitive category who are serving on the headquarters staff of that armed force whereas the dod proposal would discontinue the comparison of officers having previously served in addition the dod proposal called for comparing joint staff assigned officers to headquarters staffs and all other officers in joint duty assignments outside the joint staff to the service average as result the senate language would increase noncompliance reporting because it raises the promotion criteria standards above what is currently expected if the army and air force placed every promotion allocation toward joint officer none toward the service most likely they could not meet the criteria set by the senate language the second major exception is that there were significant changes to joint professional military education in the legislative language specifically there was change to allow the utilization of current technology specifical ly distributive or distance learning for accomplishing joint education options for congress framers of the gna wrote of need for congressional oversight and congressional finetuning of the law to ensure the continual progression set in motion by the original legislation as already mentioned the dod has made proposal to make changes in the joint personnel officer management program in early february 2000 general shelton cjcs submitted these suggested program changes in the gna to congress in the posture statement to the house and senate committees on armed services this and other congressional options are presented below options for congressional action continue the status quo there are those who believe dod did not originally embrace jointness and that more effort should be made to make it work on its own terms before altering it if this option is elected the dod believes dilemma is quickly approaching under the rules of the current law the dod will have the option to produce additional jsos to meet requirements but doing so will draw the dod into situation where the promotion targets are not met or the dod could maintain the current promotion standards and fail to fill the requisite number of jdal military positions thus creating an impact on joint operations which has yet to be defined either dod choice would lead to reporting noncompliance to congress in addition maintaining the status quo will not allow the dod the utilization of current technological advances to expand jpme within the current active force and to introduce jpme to the reserve components adjust the gna congress could accept the pledge of the dod to progress with the original intent of the gna and allow flexibility concerning how to best proceed proponents of the dod proposal believe it will allow the dod to grow and groom the required airmensoldierssailorsmarines with an appropriate joint view tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs29 41 with consideration to allowing joint credit for additional grades couple of significant points surface joint agencies and cinc staffs would be allowed greater personnel management flexibility based upon the number of 03s assigned the joint staff and osd would experience little impact based upon the small number of 03 assignees b expanding the eligibility criteria to include 03s would expand the jso pool increasing the number of gofo eligible officers and would offer relief for the 50 assignment rules and c expanding the eligibility could also negatively affect the promotion targets based upon the difficulty to predict 03 promotion potential at such young career point and it could increase the assignment gap between serving joint and gofo promotionmeet the everexpanding future needs of both joint operations and the military departments congress could modify the gna by accepting only select aspects of the proposal establishment of jso duty identifiers to expand the jso population deletion of critical positions decoupling of promotion comparisons from jso designations redesigned promotion comparisons adjusted tour lengths delinking of jpme and the assignment process redesigned jpme or congress could modify the dod proposal by adding additional aspects solicit cincspecific and servicespecific chiefs of personnel opinions of and suggestions concerning the overall dod proposal dod did solicit in 1997 prior to proposal formulation of their current proposal offer joint credit to all officers regardless of grade when serving

business plan to meet requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30609crs30 42 public law 96513 december 12 1980 at the time of its enactment dopma was the first comprehensive change in officer personnel management laws since 1947furthermore congress could adjust the gna as presented in the senate committees report srept 106292 congress might accept the language in s 2549 and doing so will enhance some aspects of joint officer personnel management such as allowing joint duty identifiers to track all joint experience but the language concerning promotion criteria will intensify the noncompliance reporting predicted by the dod and it will not allow for the expansion of joint education by utilizing available technologies pursue other options commission hearing special committee study congress could elect to establish commission hold hearings appoint special committee or mandate study to further investigate the dods proposal such action would allow congress to seek opinions from academics senior currentretired military and other experts before determining course of action choosing the correct mix of persons to participate in commission hearing special committees or study is important because of the intricacies of the gna the gna in relation to the defense officer personnel management act although the focus of this report is joint officer personnel management in relation to the gna congress may also want to consider military personnel management in relation to the defense officer personnel management act dopma42 as the gna focused on the dod organization and manning for joint operations dopma created uniform laws for the military services with the intent to allow for the recruitment and retention of an appropriate number of quality officers and to afford all officers consistent career opportunities dopma addresses grade tables authority to manage the officer force fieldgrade allocations promotion proceduresopportunitiestimelines provisions for career expectationsappo intment of regular officers competitive categories and tenure issues change in the dopma could have residual effects on joint officer personnel management but it probably would not change the challenges presented in this report some believe that an extension of the retirement eligibility of 20 years could resolve the joint officer personnel management issues they profess that extending the years required in career would allow for additional time for the fulfillment of joint requirements although adding manyears by any means whether it be via extending career lengths or expanding authorized endstrengths could have positive effect decrease optempo increase quality of life etc it would not address the joint officer personnel challenges faced today such as bureaucratic complexity the prospect on noncompliance reporting and other issues discussed above in addition many believe that the negative effects if not grandfathered view of broken promise or decreased retention etc could far outweigh any net gain to increase effectiveness and efficiency of joint officer personnel management change must be addressed within the governing laws of the gna
