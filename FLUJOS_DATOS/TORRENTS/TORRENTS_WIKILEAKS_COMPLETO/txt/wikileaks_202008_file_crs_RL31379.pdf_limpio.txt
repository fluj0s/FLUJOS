associated with the devel opment and accessibility of drugs in the marketplace one of the most prominent legi slative initiatives in this area is the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 the 1984 act and also commonly known as the hatchwaxman ac t which made veral significant changes to the patent laws as they pply to pharmaceutical products the provisions contained in the 1984 act were designed to balance the need for innovative new pharmaceuticals and the availability of less expensive generic drugs over the 18 years since passage of the hatchwaxman act there have been concerns expressed as to whether or not imp lementation of certain portions of the law has led to unintended c onsequences that have affected this balance some argue that there has been pattern of abuse associated with the provisions of the 1984 act and that changes should be made to preven t such actions others claim that such pattern exists and that while few isolated cases of misinterpretation of the law have arisen these can be addressed through existing pr ocedures and legislative changes are not necessary the hatchwaxman act requires that when company submits new drug application to the food and drug administration fda for approval patent information associated with that pharm aceutical be listed in an fda publication commonly known as the range book responsib ility for maintaining the integrity of the orange book is an issue in some cases certain generic pharmaceutical companies have taken the position that specific listing is inappropriate they maintain that subsidiary patents have been added to the orange book that do not relate to the patented drugs active ingredient but still delay generic competition however the patent system has long llowed improvement pate nts so long as sufficient inventive advance exists the 1984 act created statutory exemp tion from certain claims of patent infringement associated with submitting request to the fda for marketing approval for generic version of patented pharmaceutical several incentives are provided to generic firms to challenge the validity of existing patents through what is termed paragraph iv filing including 180day market exclusivity period for the first generic company to make but not necessarily win the challenge once paragraph iv filing has been made and the patent owner declares the intention to sue for patent infringement the fda is prohibited from considering the generic product for 30 months or until the patent is found invalid or not infringed critics argue that these provisions encourage the filing of sham paragraph iv certifications as generic companies attempt to obtain the first to file position and then work out settlement with the brand name firm that delays in troduction of generic version of the drug others maintain that settlements do not necessarily interfe re with the timely marketing of generic drugs and are less expensive than court cases that typically take longer than 30 months and are extremely costlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31379contents introduction 1 p t n t s n d t h h t c h w x m n c t 2orange book listings 3 determination of the

most prominent legi slative initiatives in this area is the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 the 1984 actand also commonly known as the hatchwaxman act the hatchwaxman act is designed to use patent law and market ex clusivity procedures to met dual goals of increased innovation in the pharmaceutical arena and expa nded availability of less expensive drugs the provisions of th 1984 act are intended to achieve balance between incentives to encourage ongo ing technological progress in the pharmaceutical industry and mechanisms to expedite the marketing of lowercost generic products over the 18 years since its passage there have been concerns expressed as to whether or not implementati on of certain provisions of the hatchwaxman act has led to unintended consequences that have affected this balance some argue that there has been pattern of abuse associ ated with the provisions of the 1984 act and that changes should be made to preven t such actions others claim that such pattern exists and that while few isolated cases of misinterpretation of the law have arisen these can be ddressed through existing pro cedures thereby negating the need for change this report explores several of the majo r patentrelated issu that have been raised in relation to the application of th 1984 act discussions have focused on the process established in the hatchwaxman act by which brand name pharmaceutical companies protect their patents and the mechanisms by which generic firms may challenge these patents experience accumulated during implementation of the law has afforded new perspective on whether or not the balance remains in place there are numerous opportunities to observe and termine how the provisions of the law have been applied as well as how court cases and regulatory activities have shaped the legislation and affected its original goals and objectives the information provided in this paper is intended to be used as companion piece to

patents are issued by the united states patent and trademark office uspto generally for term of 20 years from the date of filing the patent grants its owner the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invent ion to be afforded patent rights an invention must be judged to consist of patentable subject matter possess utility and be novel and nonobvious the application must fully disclose and distinctly claim the invention for which protection is sought the grant of patent does not provide the owner with an affirmative right to market the patented invention pharmaceuti cal products are also subject to marketing approval by the food and drug administration federal ws generally require that pharmaceutical manufacturers show their produc ts are safe and effective in order to bring these drugs to the marketplace 21 u sc sec 355b uspto issuance of patent and fda marketing consent are di stinct events that depend upon different criteria the hatchwaxman act made several significant changes to the patent laws as they relate to pharmaceutical products1 these changes include provisions for extending the term of pharmaceutical patent to reflect regulatory delays encountered in obtaining marketing appr oval by the food and drug administration fda statutory exemption from patent infringement for activities associated with regulatory marketing approval for generic drugs establishment of mechanisms to challenge the validity of pharmaceutical patent and reward for disputing the validity enforceability or infringement of patented and approved drug the 1984 act also provides the fda with certain authorities to offer periods of marketing exclusivity for pharmaceutical independent of the rights conferred by patents the provisions in the 1984 act are speci fically and uniquely applicable to pharmaceutical patents and different from traditional infringement procedures associated with other patented products and processes statutory exemption is created for certain claims of patent infringement based on acts reasonably related to seeking fda approval to market drug that has been patented by another firm the generic company is permitted to use data paid for and compiled by the original manufacturer to establish the drugs safety and efficacy this may allow bioequivalent drug to reach the market as soon as the patent on the original pharmaceutical expires nowhere else in patent law does such robust experimental use exemption exist in the absence of the research developm ent and testing performed by the brand name pharmaceutical companies generic drugs would not exist the generic industry relies on the information genera ted and financed by the brand namehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31379crs3 2ibid 321 usc 355b1companies while there is controversy over the actual cost of developing new pharmaceutical the process remains very expensive and fraught with risk in addition almost all other pr oducts may be brought to market without government approval and thus enjoy the full 20 years of patent protectio n allowed by law pharmaceutical firms however must use portion of the patent term to apply for fda market approval thereby forfeiting certain rights afforded other goods additional special provisions for addressing pharmaceutical patents are contained in the 1984 act including sp ecific procedures for challenging the enforceability validity or infringement of approved drug patents to encourage patent challenges the first generic applicant to file challenge is provided with 180 days of market exclusivity by the fda when the patent is found invalid not infringed or unenforceable or when the patent expires to balance such arrangements that appear to favor generic manufacturers the hatchwaxman act provides that the patent term for pharmaceuticals may be extended for portion of the time lost during the fda pproval process to obtain such an extension patents associated with approved drugs are to be listed in what is commonly called the orange book many experts agree that the 1984 act has had significant effect on the availability of generic subs titutes for brand name drugs generics generally are rapidly available after patent expiration and at lower pri ces concurrently given the increasing investment in research and development rd and the gains in research intensity of the pharmaceutical industry it appears that the 1984 act has not deterred the search for and the development of new drugs2 however some in congress and in the public are questioning whether or not participants in the process are misusing the provisions such that the original goal s can longer be achieved concerns have been raised as to actions associated with pharmaceutical patents listed in the orange book patent challenges by generic firms and the award of market exclusivity among other things these i ssues are discussed below orange book listings the hatchwaxman act requires that when company submits new drug application nda to the food and drug administration fo r approval patent information associated with that pharm aceutical be listed in an fda publication approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations commonly known as the orange book the law di rects nda applicants to identify any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application or which claims method of using such drug and with respect to which claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted3 the orange book provides

lengthening or shortening the 30month stay5 determination of the validity of orange book patents responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the orange book is an issue that has been discussed in the context of changes to the 1984 act the uspto issues patents on pharmaceuticals based on utility novelty and nonobviousness the fda provides market approval for drugs based on fficacy and safety in particular cases certain generic pharmaceutical companies have taken the position that an orange book listing is inappropriate in several instances gene ric competitors have argued that despite listing tied to an approved drug in actua lity the drug does not embody or otherwise make use of th at patented invention if these assumptions are correct the listed patent serves as barrier to generic competition because it does not cover the approved drug the role of the fda in adjudicating orange book listing disagreements is limited if generic pharmaceutical compan disputes the accuracy of an orange book listing that enterprise must presen t the grounds for disagreement to the fda in writing the fda will then request th at the nda holder confirm the propriety of the listing unless the nda holder withdraw s or amends the listing the fda will not alter the patent information in the orange book under the 1984 act orange book listing i ssues have typically been resolved once the

laboratories inc v novartis pharmaceutical corp 7 presents an additional deve lopment concerning the orange book this litigation resulted from the effo rts of wouldbe generic competitor to contest patent listing in the oran ge book as previously noted some commentators believe that nda holders are encouraged to list as many patents as possible with regard to an approved drug this incentive results from the mandate in the 1984 act that each anda must include an appropriate certification for every patent listed in the orange book the ben venue decision resulted from novel litig ation strategy employed by generic pharmaceutical company this cause of action may allow the propriety of orange book listings to be litigated befo re an anda application is filed in ben venue the patentee novartis pharmaceutical corporation listed in the orange book patent covering chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of the approved pharmaceutical wouldbe generic competito r ben venue laboratories then filed an anda application with paragraph iv certification under the 1984 act novartis then possessed the op tion of bringing patent infringement charge against ben venue employing an original procedural t actic ben venue filed declaratory judgment action in the united states district court of the district of new jersey 32 days after it filed an anda according to ben venue the challenged patent should not have been listed in the orange book because the chemical intermediate did not appear in the final drug product novar tis argued that ben venues lawsuit should be dismissed novartis pointed to the following language from the 1984 act until the expiration of fortyfive days from the date the notice is received action may be brought under section 2201 of title 28 for declaratory judgment with respect to the patent8 according to novartis because the generic competitor had not waited the stipulated 45 days its laws uit was premature and should be dismissed the new jersey district court ultimately rejected ben venues substantive arguments however the court also held that ben venues suit was not barred by the 1984 act judge bassler reasoned that th ben venue suit was not with respect to the patent because it did not raise the issue of validity or infringement of the patent instead the suit was limited to the issue of wh ether the patent should have been listed in the orange book observing that there is indication anywhere in the statute that congress even considered orange book listings as potential source of litigation9 the court held that the 1984 act di

th 1984 act10 possible result could be proliferation of satellite litigation that apparently was not contemplated by congress when it enacted the 1984 act although the ben venue decision issued from district court and th erefore does not stric tly bind other courts its reasoning may prove pers uasive to other tribunals subsequent judicial decisi ons from the us court of appeals for the federal circuit have fu rther addressed ben venue style delisting lawsuits these federal circuit decisions have considered whether courts possess jurisdiction to delist patents from the orange book this jurisdictional issue depends in part on how the generic manufacturer states the basis of its cause of action in the pleadings it files with the court in mylan pharmaceuticals inc v thompson 268 f3d 1323 fed cir 2001 an anda applicant contended that its cause of action arose under the patent laws the anda applicant observed that listin g in the orange book was necessary element of the patent infringement charge brought by the nda holder therefore an argument the patent should be delis ted was effectively defense to patent infringement reasoned the anda applican t as result the anda applicant concluded that it could simply rely upon the patent laws as basis for jurisdiction in the federal courts the federal circuit disagreed however according to the federal circuit the 1984 act did not provide private cause of action for delisting patents from the orange book following mylan pharmaceuticals inc v thompson an anda applicant could not request that patent be removed from the orange book merely as defense to patent infringement however in the 2002 decision in andrx pharmaceuticals inc v biovail corp 11 the federal circuit suggested anothe r jurisdictional avenue for generic manufacturers seeking to delis t patents under the orange book there the federal circuit suggested that an orange b ook listing could be challenged under the administrative procedure act or apa12 the apa is general statute that in part allows adversely affected individuals to seek judicial review of an agency action under the apa an anda applicant coul d conceivably sue the fda directly asserting that the fdas denial of an anda due to an orange book patent listing was arbitrary capricious or not in accordance with law13 because the anda applicant in andrx pharmaceuticals inc v biovail corp had not specifically stated that its cause of action was founded upon the apa the federal circuit rejected this basis for ju risdiction as result the federal

whether the apa will ultimately provide an effective jurisdictional basis for patent delisting suits late listed or l ater listed patents several additional issues have been raised in conj unction with the procedures of listing in the orange book some obs ervers have alleged that certain nda holders have added subsidiary patents to the orange book in order to delay generic competition15 according to this view an nda holder will obtain from the united states patent and trademark office and submit to the fda numerous improvement patents directed towards advances in the pharmacological formulation associated with the drugs active ingredient for example an nda holder might list formulation patents that change drugs m ode of administration to patients increase its shelflife or stability or allow more efficient delivery these additional patents may provide the nda holder with an added period of intellectua l property protection at least with respect to the patented improvement adding new patents for drug close to the expiration date of the original patents is called late listing by generic companies and later listing by brand name firms the law provides the opportunity to extend market exclusivity by including these new patents in the orange book16 some experts argue that this has encouraged firms to list patents for produc ts that are not considered marketable17 according to attorney alfred b engelberg cursory inspection of the fda or ange books patent and exclusivity listings will reveal that most approve d products have more than one listed patent sometimes there are five or six patents listed for single product some of these patents claim unapproved uses special crystalline forms of the active ingredient specific formulations tablet

furthers compliance with fda regulations although the 1984 act provides safe har bor from patent infringement it also requires wouldbe manufactur ers of generic drugs to engage in specialized certification procedure the core feature of this process is that request for fda marketing approval is treated as an artificial act of patent infringement this feature was intended to allow judicial re solution of the validity enforceability and infringement of patent rights before generic competition enters the market25 under the hatchwaxman act each holder of an approved nda must list pertinent

application at the end of 30 months even though litigation is ongoing34 such an automatic 30month injunction differs from typical infringement cases not involving pharmaceuticals commonly the company suing for infringement places bond to cover their competitors ma rket losses should the patent be found invalid or not infringed if the patent owne r prevails the infringer is required to pay for lost income and may be required to pay treble damages if the infringement was willful the patent owner ma also have the offending product taken off the market however given the situation with pharm aceuticals it would be highly improbable that drug once available for sale and in individual medicine cabinets would be removed in addition given the value of certain pharmaceuticals on the market it may be impossible for the brand name firm to recoup its monetary loses from generic firms with significantly fewer capital resources however some argue that if the patent is found to be invalid or not infringed the brand name company already has received 30 months of exclusive marketing without penalty this engelberg asserts gives an incentive to brand name firms to list as many patents as possible in the orange book because each infringement action provides 30month stay on fda approval35 yet experience suggests that the 30 month delayofapproval provi sion may not be as significant as it was intended some commentary indicates that generic pharmaceutical companies have been reluctant to market approved generic drugs until the associated patent litigation has been definitively resolved as observe d by elizabeth h dickinson associate counsel for drugs in the office of the ch ief counsel fda if litigation is pending and the agency approves an anda at the end of the thirtymonth period most generic drug companies seem unwilling to risk liability for damages by bringing generic drug product onto the market befo re the patent litiga tion is resolved36 180day market exclusivity the 1984 act provides prospective generi c manufacturers with reward for challenging patent associated with an approved pharmaceutical this reward consists of 180day generic drug market exclusivity period awarded by the fda to the first generic applicant that files pa ragraph iv certification the 180day market exclusivity period ordinarily begins on the earliest of two dates 1 the day the drug is first commercially marketed or 2 the day court holds that the patent which is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed implementation of this provision has led to concerns by some in the community originally fda regulations required that generic firm filing an anda had to be sued for patent infringement and win in court in order to receive approval for market exclusivity however in

changed to liminate the necessity for successful defense by generic manufacturer against claims of patent infringement prior to receiving the 180day market exclusivity critics argue that this emphasis on first to file rather than on the ccessful defense of patent infringement law suit has transformed the intent of the law or iginally this provision was planned as an incentive for generic companies to challeng patents by offering an opportunity for the firm to recoup its litigation costs durin g the period of market exclusivity now the sole criteria for obtaining the 180day exclusivity is obtaining the firsttofile position some experts claim that the mova interpretation of the law has led to the filing of substandard or sham andas as generic companies race to establish themselves as being the first to file37 the first filer may have an incentive to submit paragraph iv certification without any in tent to actually challenge the patent additional generics can not be brought to market until the expiration of the 180day exclusivity period yet if court deci sion issues and the generic firm does not begin to market its product other generi c versions of the pharmaceutical cannot be approved this creates situation where according to senator orin hatch the blocking position the statute grants to first filers creates perverse incentives for patent settlement38 similarly professor rebecca eisenberg argues because the 180day exclusivity does not begin until the first challenger either prevails in court or brings generic product to market and because there is requirement of diligence in pursuing eith er goal the first generic challenger may find it more profitable to enter into collusive settlement agreement with the patent owner that affirms the valid ity and infringement of the patent and defers generic competition until the patent expires39 arguments have been made that the 180day market exclusivity provision has created litigation cottage industry in which generic drug companies search for soontoexpire patents of popul ar proprietary drugs and ch allenge vulnerable patents in court40 it may be easier and less expensive to make an agreement with

generi c pharmaceutical association settlements are not inherently bad for the consumer the courts often urge settlement rather than dragging suit out for years sometimes quick settlement actually helps the generic get to market sooner46 not all settlements with generic firms have brought lower cost generic drugs47 the federal trade commission has brought several suits against brand name pharmaceuticals and generic companies charging them with anticompe titive behavior resulting from out of court settlements of patent infringement challenges for example in the past several years the

temporary monopolies on new technology52 commencement of the 180day exclusivity provision interpretation of the 1984 acts provi sions regarding the 180day market exclusivity period has spawned some add itional disagreement under the 1984 act the first applicant that submits paragra ph iv certification may be granted 180day period of generic exclusivity some diffe rence of views has arisen over when this 180day period should commence the relevant st atute states if the anda contains certificati on described in paragraph iv and is for drug for which previous pplication has been submitted under this subsection containing paragraph iv certification the application shall be made effective not earlier than one hundred and eighty days after i the date the secretary receive s notice from the applicant under the previous anda of the first commerc ial marketing of the drug under the previous anda or ii the date of decision of court in an action described in clause iii holding the patent which is the subject of the certification to be invalid or not infringed whichever is earlier53 the 1984 act therefore triggers the 180day ge neric exclusivity period in one of two ways either 1 when the generic manufacturer commences commercial marketing of its drug or 2 when court decision finds the nda holders patent invalid or not infringedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31379crs15 5421 cfr 314107e

could trigge r the 180day exclusivity period however the fda interpreted the 1984 act as requiring decision of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit to commence the 180day exclusivity period54 the fda explained that anda applicants whic h prevailed at the di strict court level might wish to delay marketing their generic drug until the patent infringement litigation was more conclusively resolved on appeal55 the fda thus hoped to eliminate what it perceived to be difficult choice for generic applicants either 1 launch generic drug while the litigation was still pending on appeal thereby risking infringement liability if the district cour ts opinion was overturned by the court of appeals or 2 wait until the appeal was decided which almost certainly meant that the 180day exclusivity period would have elapsed56 in its january 4 2000 decision in mylan pharmaceuticals inc v shalala 57 the united states district court for the district court of columbia held that the fdas interpretation of the phrase decision of the court was erroneous according to judge roberts the correct interpretation of that phrase included decisions of us district court judge robe rts further reasoned that not hing prevented the first anda applicant from utilizing the 180day period if it concluded that the risk of reversal by the court of appeals was low58 that the fda interpretation prolonged the period at which drug prices remained at inflated levels59 and that exclusivity periods were valuable commodities that could be traded to among other parties the nda holder60 additional observations the hatchwaxman act was constructed to balance incentives for the investments necessary to devel op new innovative pharmaceuticals while encouraging the introduction of widely ava ilable and less expensive generic drugs there appears to be little doubt that th 1984 act has had positive impact on the availability of pharmaceuticals in the united states61 since passage of the law the amount of investment by pharmaceutical companies in biomedical research and development has increased while the availability of lower cost generic drugs has expanded significantly since the passage of the 1984 act however some assert that both the brand name and generic firms ma be utilizing the provisions of the 1984 act in ways that circumvent the original purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31379crs16 62a bitter pill supra note 41 63see forthcoming crs report patent administration current issues and possibilities for reform by john r thomas 64agreement on

always acted in consumers best interests to the generics big pharma is willfully abusing patent laws pursuing product extensions that benefit the bottom line not consumers and driving up drug costs determining whos right is by means easy62 in exploring the issues raised in this report it might be worthwhile to note that several additional laws have been enacted since the passage of the hatchwaxman act that may influence the debate and alter the context in which the original provisions are assessed under pl 107109 and previ ously th 1997 fda modernization act the food nd drug administration is per mitted to grant 6 month extension of market exclusivity for drug on which pediatric testing has been performed the fda is also permitted by pl 97414 the orphan drug act to provide 7 years of market exclusivity for orphan drugs those pharmaceuticals that are developed to address diseases that affect fewer than 200000 individuals year the american inventors protection ac t pl 106113 allows dayforday extension of the term of patent for certain delays at the patent and trademark office as senator orin hatch remarked in his opening statement during may 24 2001 hearings it may be worthwhile inquiry to examine the implications of the fact that the 1999 american inventors protection act generally permits all patents to be restored up to 17 years of patent life if there is undue delay at the pto but under the 1984 hatchwaxman law patent term restoration in recognition of the lengthy fda review of new drugs is capped at 14 ears why should uspto review time be treated differently than fda review time within this context it may be important to note that the laws and regulations associated with patents nd patent terms differ from th procedures circumscribing market exclusivity afforded by the fda some experts are questioning the quality of the patents issued by the us patent and trademark office and are interested in what effect this might have on the implementation of the hatchwaxman act and beyond patent quality may affect court decisions cerning the validity of patents under the 1984 act the patent infringement process instigated by paragraph iv filing andor antitrust suits63 other considerations include existing international treaties to which the us is signatory that may influence activity in the patent arena in general all patent categories are to be treated equally according to the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights or trips agreement world trade organization members concur th at patents must be
