legislation to replace expiring law governing the programs and policies of the us depart ment of agriculture usda the new food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 1 10246 hr 6124 contains provisions on marketing crop insurance and disaster assistance protection against pests and diseases export promotion research and domestic food assistance all of which are important to the competitiveness of the specialty crop sector of us agriculture the sector includes fruit vegetable tree nut and nursery crop producers processors manufacturers wholesalers importers and exporters although specialty crops are not eligible for direct support under usdas farm commodity price and income support programs the policies that congress sets for the those programs affect them chief among these policies is one that largely restricts commodity program participants from planting fruits and vegetables on program base acres specialty crop interests long have maintained that the provision is essential to protect the sector from the economic damage that could occur if additional acres of vegetables in particular suddenly came into production the food conservation and energy act of 2008 extends the planting restriction through fy2012 but authorizes pilot program in seven midwestern states to allow planting of fruits and vegetables exclusively for processingon base acres pl 110246 also includes for the first time in the history of the farm bill separate title covering horticultural specialty and organic crops title x the title provides substantial mandatory funding over the life of the farm bill and beyond for several major new and continuing programs the key provisions include 1 reauthorization of the program making block grants to states for research marketing and promotion projects benefitting specialty crops providing 466 million over 10 years in mandatory funds 2 reauthorization of the program of costshare assistance to producers for organic certification with onetime transfer of 22 million in mandatory funds 3 expansion of the current farmers market promotion program to increase direct farmertoconsumer marketing opportunities providing 33 million in mandatory funds 4 establishment of federalstate pest and disease detection and control program with 377 million in mandatory funds over 10 years and 5 cr eation of network of nurseries to grow pest and diseasefree plant stocks for horticultural crops with 20 million in mandatory funds the title also contains section authorizing 10 million annually in appropriations for research on colony collapse disorder in honeybees the nutrition title of pl 110246 contains provisions intended to increase the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in the school lunch and other domestic nutrition assistance programs for greater detail on these provisions see crs report rl33829 domestic food assistance the farm bill and other legislation in the 110th congress coordinated by joe

income support programs nonetheless the policies that congress sets for those programs significantly affect the specialty crop sectors economic wellbeing federal policies on trade conservation credit marketing programs domestic food assistance and research also all affect the specialty crop sector1 congress sets the policies in these areas for the most part in an omnibus multiyear authorizing law commonly called the farm bill in may 2008 congress passed new farm bill to replace the previous one the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 which expired in 2007 congress extended it until the new bill could be enacted some stakeholders and policymakers called for specialty crop issues to occupy larger role in farm bill policy discussions than in the past they noted that the traditional farm commodity support programs are under pressure from constraints on the federal budget as well as from developments in existing trade obligations and from negotiations on further trade agreements2 policies covering us agriculture more compre hensively could provide way to address those pressures while increasing us competitiveness they argued several major legislative proposals focusing on policies and programs of importance to the specialty crop sector were introduced in the 110th congress in preparation for the 2007 farm bill debate these bills included hr 1600 cardoza the eat healthy america act hr 1551 kinds 919 menendez the healthy farms f oods and fuels act and s 1160 stabenow the specialty crops competition act among others the administration also proposed several

onethird of us crop cash receipts and onefifth of us agricultural exports according to usdas economic research service ers when floriculture greenhouse and nursery crops are included specialty crops account for approximately 50 of all us cash receipts of farm crops 3 despite their relatively large share of crop receipts specialty crops occupy only about 3 of us harvested cropland although certain

at least half of their gross value of production from the sale of fruits vegetables tree nuts or horticultural crops according to ers survey data specialized fa rms account for 95 of the total value of us specialty crop production although more than half of them have annual sales of less than 250000 and identify offfarm income as their primary means of support specialized farms may produce one or two other commodities in addition to their specialty crop according to ers and about 15 of them also participate in the major commodity support programs the remaining 5 of the value of us specialty crop production comes from nonspecialized fruit and vegetable farms which may produce as many as four other commodities often including livestock besides their specialty crop nearly half of these farms grow one or more of the major commodity crops and participate in the price and income support programs according to ers vegetables dry beans and potatoesfor processingare grown primarily on

specialty crop industry is the status of continuation of policy set in previous farm bills that restricts the ability of participants in the farm income and commodity price support programs to plant fruits and vegetables on acres on which they receive benefits base acres congress first inserted this provision in the 1996 farm act pl 104127 after it had adopted proposal to allow producers of program crops to respond to market signals and grow different crops on base acreage the restriction was extended through 2007 by the 2002 farm bill specialty crop producers in general have maintained since 1996 that allowing program crop producers to switch even small numbers of acres to fruits or vegetables would negatively affect markets and thus growers annual income in 2005 world trade organization wto challenge to us farm commodity programs raised questions concerning the use of the planting flexibility restriction under existing trade commitments 7 discussion on whether to extend the restriction in the next farm bill thus has an important trade policy aspect as well as domestic market aspect number of reports have been issued since late 2006 that examine the possible effects on domestic fruit and vegetable producers of eliminating the planting restriction these analyses suggest that the adverse effects of removing the restriction likely would be small relative to the overall industry although there could be larger impacts on individual producers commodities and regions g11g151g561g157g145g142g561g7g151g138g140g157g142g141g561g4g146g149g149g561 the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 maintains the 2002 farm bill provision restricting the planting of fruits and vegetables on base acres however the act authorizes pilot project in seven midwestern states that will allow fruits and vegetables exclusively for processingto be planted on 75000 base acres usda is required to evaluate and report to congress on the impact the pilot project

the act authorized 445 million in annual appropriations for the program congress appropriated 7 million in each of fy2006fy2008 expansion of this program and an effort to provide mandatory funding for it was major focus in the farm bill debate specialty crop interests have consistently urged congress to provide mandatory funds for the block grant program arguing that the government should increase its investment in the sector in light of its value to us agriculture as whole however producer groups and lawmakers from states where commodity crops predominate were not in favor of redirecting money to support other programs if it meant reducing the current level of support for the commodity programs g11g151g561g157g145g142g561g7g151g138g140g157g142g141g561g4g146g149g149g561 title x of pl 110246
