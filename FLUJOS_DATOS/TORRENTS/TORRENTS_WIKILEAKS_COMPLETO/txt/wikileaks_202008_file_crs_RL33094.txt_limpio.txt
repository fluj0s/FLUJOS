resolved sooner or later into judicial one wrote the famous french chronicler alexis tocqueville in democracy in america his classic 1835 study of early american life1 from the beginnings of the republic when federal courts handed down decisions that strengthened the national government to many of todays most hotly debated issues affirmative action war powers racial redistricting and abortion federal judges have been at the storm center of numerous controversies bolstered by its prerogative of judicial review as asserted by the supreme court in the landmark case of marbury v madison 1803 and the publics perception that the highest court is the primary but not exclusive interpreter of the constitution federal jurists regularly pass judgment on the compelling issues that confront the nation2 meanwhile congress and the white house also interpret the constitution as the supreme court stated in united states v nixon 1974 in the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the government must initially interpret the constitution and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others3 the american constitutional system of separate institutions sharing power inevitably produces tension between congress and the courts while the framers outlined the structure and authority of congress in some detail in article i little by comparison is in article iii dealing with the courts thus the beginnings of the court owe less to constitutional mandates and more to legislation establishing its structure the judiciary act of 1789 for example and to the rulings of the early justices such as chief justice john marshall 18011835 as noted legal scholar explained congress was created nearly full blown by the constitution itself the vast possibilities of the presidency were relatively easy to perceive and soon inevitably materialized but the institution of the judiciary needed to be summoned up out of the constitutional vapors

congress and federal courts are common when the elective branches are called to account by decisions of the nonelective judicial branch composed of judges with lifetime tenure famous instance occurred during the new deal when the supreme court arguably acted as superlegislature making policy through its judicial interpretations invalidating 13 acts of congress in one term 19351936 so frustrated was president franklin d roosevelt that he tried in 1937 to have congress pass legislation expanding the size of the court so he could nominate judges more sympathetic to his new deal program widespread legislative and public opposition to the socalled courtpacking plan led to huge defeat for roosevelt nonetheless sensitive to the economic and social problems joblessness dislocation and so on affecting the country the court soon began to shift its attitude in constitutional interpretation for example the court handed down decision in 1937 upholding minimum wage law that only few months earlier it had ruled unconstitutional5 this turnabout by the court ending its penchant for limiting congressional power was as wit of the period put it the switch in time that saved nine6 the purposes

pp 10321033 crs3 constitutional authority broad features whether it is enacting minimum wage health or other laws congress derives its policymaking authority from two key parts of the constitution article i and the fourteenth amendment article i section 8 grants congress the right to legislate in number of specific areas such as laying and collecting taxes coining money and raising and supporting armies in addition an elastic clause gives congress the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers under the postcivil war fourteenth amendment state shall deny any person of life liberty or property without due process of law or the equal protection of the laws the amendment provides that congress shall have the power to enforce these provisions by appropriate legislation congress as the courts have noted also has implied or inherent powers not specifically mentioned in the constitution such as its right to conduct investigations as an adjunct to its lawmaking function federal courts however can impose constraints on the exercise of these constitutional pillars of legislative authority7 as for the courts article iii of the constitution states the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish left to congress was the establishment of the elaborate judicial structure of district and circuit courts of appeals that exist today not to mention the legislatures authority to create number of specialized courts such as bankruptcy and tax courts where judges serve fixed terms the constitution also specifies the cases and controversies over which the court has original jurisdiction such as issues involving the constitution federal law and treaties in addition the supreme court has appellate jurisdiction the authority to review cases on appeal under the constitution but with such exceptions as congress may determine the presidents appointment of judges to the federal courts is subject to the advice and consent of the senate basically these provisions define the core authorities and limitations of the federal judiciary judicial role the judiciarys role is carried out in three main ways first its interpretive decisions can uphold or broaden the legislative powers of congress congress acted within its authority said supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg who agreed with court decision upholding 1998 law further extending copyright privileges for authors artists and inventors such as commercial artist walt disney who created the worldfamous animated cartoon character mickey mouse8 second it can check overreaching by the congress through its implied power of judicial review 7 for an authoritative and comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the constitution see johnny h killian george costello and kenneth r thomas eds the constitution of the united states of america analysis and interpretation washington gpo 2004 8 joan biskupic justices defer to congress power to extend copyright usa today jan 16 2003 p 4a crs4 third and equally significant the supreme court can act as policymaking catalyst especially when the house or senate is stymied in making decisions the landmark civil rights case of brown v board of education 1954 is classic example9 the decision struck down the separate but equal doctrine upholding state laws that permitted racially segregated public schools until this decision majorities in the senate could not enact civil rights bills because of filibusters conducted by southern senators the brown case galvanized congress to enact the civil rights act of 1957 the first civil rights law since 1875 the genius of system of divided powers wrote law professor is that when one branch is closed to the desires of the populace or the demands of justice another may open up10 the brown decision had little immediate effect on the enactment of new anti discrimination laws until congress responding to largescale civil rights demonstrations began to pass landmark legislation such as the civil rights act of 1964 prohibiting racial discrimination in public accommodations11 checks and balances each national branch of government has the constitutional wherewithal to influence the others the supreme court affects congress whenever justices interpret the meaning of the constitution treaties federal statutes administrative rules and regulations and the decisions of lower federal and state courts12 in turn congress has the authority to affect the size funding and jurisdiction of federal courts and the senate alone is directed under the constitution to approve or reject court nominees chosen by the chief executive federal courts issue rulings but they depend on the political branches to enforce those decisions alexander hamilton in distinguishing judicial power from legislative or executive power wrote in the federalist 78 the judiciary has influence over either the sword the president or the purse congress and can take active resolution whatever it may truly be said to have neither force nor will but merely judgment13 9 brown v board of education 347 us 483 1954 10 jamin raskin courts v citizens the american prospect vol 14 march 2003 p a25 11 some law professors and political scientists suggest that courts rarely mount serious challenges to the preferences of political majorities as stanford law dean larry kramer put it there is now general consensus among social scientists that courts have not been strong or consistent countermajoritarian force in american politics in other words supreme court decisions are more of mirror than catalyst reflecting public opinion far more than they shift it see rosa brooks court that nudges more than it leads angeles times july 20 2005 p a15 12 colton c campbell jr and john f stack jr diverging perspectives on lawmaking the delicate balance between congress and the court in colton c campbell jr and john f stack jr eds congress confronts the court lanham md rowman and littlefield 2001 p 2 13 typically when the supreme court rules an act of congress unconstitutional the result is that the act is longer enforced by the president and congress if it wishes to promote the policy of the nullified act drafts new legislation without features that the court is likely continued crs5 nevertheless federal courts have issued many rulings that require large financial expenditures in areas such as improvements in prison conditions and mental health institutions in the area of war contemporary presidents have taken military action either with or without authority from congress important functions of federal courts in the military arena are to check presidential power and to adjudicate the proper allocation of warmaking authority between congress and the white house the court as referee and umpire the referee role the supreme court serves as both referee between the two national elective branches and as the umpire of federalstate relations ever since the court claimed the power of judicial review in 1803 and struck down an act of congress it has considered large number of separation of power issues most notably during the new deal and in the past few decades superlegislature or legislating from the bench the charge of judicial activism is an oftrepeated epithet in general judicial activism means one of several things the willingness of judges to invalidate decisions of the elective branches or officials to make up the meaning of the constitution or of statute to realize their policy preferences or to overturn precedent the doctrine of stare decisis to suit their personal views14 someones view of activism however often depends on whether he or she supports the direction of the court decisions that expand congresss authority to legislate may be opposed by those who prefer matters to be handled by the states conversely decisions that restrict the reach of the legislative branch are likely to be opposed by those who favor national approach to problems criticism has been lodged against judicial activism by the rehnquist court in its first seventyfive years the supreme court struck down only two acts of congress wrote law professor cass sunstein in the eighteen years since ronald reagan nominated 13 continued to strike down when the court declares an executive branch action unconstitutional the executive has commonly acquiesced to the court ceasing to engage in the action at issue 14

law angeles times june 26 2005 p a24 stare decisis according to supreme court justice john paul stevens suggests that judges should decide like cases in the same way which increases the likelihood that judges will in fact administer justice impartially and that they will be perceived to be doing so see john paul stevens the life span of judgemade rule in norman dorsen ed the evolving constitution middletown ct wesleyan university press 1987 pp 196197 crs6 william h rehnquist as chief justice the court has invalidated more than three dozen15 1983 supreme court decision immigration and naturalization service v chadha invalidated many more laws than three dozen chadha also demonstrates how the legislative and executive branches can achieve workable accommodations in the aftermath of major court ruling chadha declared many forms of the legislative or congressional veto unconstitutional legislative veto is statutory enactment that permits presidents and agencies to take certain actions subject to later approval or disapproval by one or both houses including designated committees of each chamber with unelected executive officials necessarily involved in the complexities of modern policymaking congress has little choice but to delegate authority to administrative entities to craft the rules regulations and policies required to implement various laws congress may however attach strings to such delegated authority such as the legislative veto in chadha the court held that the legislative veto violated the separation of powers the principle of bicameralism and the presentation clause of the constitution legislation passed by both chambers must be presented to the president for his signature or veto the decision wrote justice byron r white in vigorous dissent strikes down in one fell swoop provisions in more laws nearly 200 enacted by congress than the court has cumulatively invalidated in its entire history16 congress repealed some legislative vetoes amended others and employed its wide range of oversight techniques to monitor executive actions yet despite the chadha decision legislative vetoes many requiring an agency to seek the approval of specific house or senate committees before implementing an agency decision continue to be enacted into law more than 400 by the end of 200417 the legislature and executive each recognize their value the executive wants to receive delegated authority and congress wants to retain some control over that authority short of passing another law are they constitutional not by the courts definition will that fact change the behavior between committees and agencies probably not an agency might advise the committee as you know the requirement in this statute for committee priorapproval is unconstitutional under the courts test perhaps agency and committee staff will nod their heads in agreement after which the agency will seek the prior approval of the committee18 since chadha the supreme court has heard challenges to the continued use of legislative vetoes 15 cass r sunstein the rehnquist revolution the new republic vol 231 dec 27 2004jan 10 2005 p 32 16 ins v chadha 462 us

oklahoma spring 1984 p 2 crs7 classic supreme court decision involving the emergency power of the president was youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer 1952 during the korean war and in the face of threatened strike by steel workers president harry truman issued an executive order directing secretary of commerce charles sawyer to seize control of the nations steel mills steel companies brought suit to restrain sawyer from taking control of the mills in 63 decision the supreme court held that in the absence of congressional authorization truman lacked the authority to take possession of the mills even as commanderinchief the fatal flaw in trumans executive order wrote justice hugo black in the majority opinion was that the presidents order does not direct that congressional policy be executed in manner prescribed by congress it directs that presidential policy be executed in manner prescribed by the president19 lawmakers are not reluctant to bring separation of power challenges to the judiciary mindful of the courts referee role they sometimes seek to employ it for their own goals increasingly members turn to the court to accomplish ends they were unable to achieve in congress often they ask the court to defend congressional prerogatives against perceived usurpation by the president war making is the principal example not since world war ii has congress declared war although it may enact legislation that is its functional equivalent recent presidents of both parties have committed american troops to combat on their own initiative as public law scholar pointed out with respect to war power suits brought by members from the vietnam war to the present day members of congress have gone to court to contest presidential wars and defend legislative prerogatives in most of these cases the courts held that the lawmakers lacked standing to bring the case even when legislators were granted standing the courts refused relief on numerous grounds judges pointed out that the legislators represented only fraction of the congressional membership and that often another group of legislators had filed brief defending the presidents action courts regularly note that congress as whole has failed to invoke its institutional powers to confront the president20 usually courts dismiss these suits and offer two rationales 1 the lawsuits raise political questions best left to the elective branches to resolve and 2 they represent 19 youngstown sheet tube co v sawyer 343 us 579 1952 whether in the majority or in dissent the justices outlined many different positions with respect to trumans action all six justices in the majority wrote separate opinions each taking slightly different view of emergency power only justices black and douglas advocated doctrine of express and enumerated powers the other seven justices in four concurrences and three dissents recognized that implied and emergency powers might have to be invoked justice jackson developed theory of constitutional powers that had three scenarios presidential authority reaches its highest level when the president acts pursuant to congressional authorization his power is at its lowest ebb when he takes measures incompatible with the will of congress in between these two categories lay zone of twilight in which congress neither grants nor denies authority in such circumstances congressional inertia indifference or quiescence may sometimes at least as practical matter enable if not invite measures of independent responsibility fisher american constitutional law p 259 20 louis fisher the law litigating the war power with campbell v clinton presidential studies quarterly vol 30 sept 2000 p 568 crs8 conflicts between groups of lawmakers pitted against each other not constitutional clashes between congress and the president21 the umpire role as the federalism umpire the supreme court has sometimes taken more limited view of federal authority in relation to state prerogatives as one law professor noted the revival of doctrine of federalism that constrains the power of congress has been signature feature of the rehnquist court22 the rehnquist court stressed states rights in several cases through use of the tenth amendment powers not delegated to the national government or prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or to the people and the eleventh amendment states are protected from being sued in federal court in united states v lopez 1995 the supreme court overturned federal law banning guns near school grounds23 for the first time since the new deal the court found congress to have exceeded the bounds of its constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce in this case the movement of guns across state lines that could end up on school playgrounds24 quickly congress moved to pass legislation that made clear its authority under the commerce clause to restrict guns from school zones in 1996 it enacted measure which the president signed that said it shall be unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce at place that the individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe is school zone25 this legislation has not been subject to legal challenge as another example in alabama v garrett 2001 the supreme court held that states are immune from suits brought by handicapped state employees under the 1990 americans with disabilities act ada writing for the majority chief justice rehnquist indicated that states are not required by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled so long as their actions towards such individuals had rational basis the reason lay in an expanded notion of states sovereign immunity from suits by private citizens even if they can show they have been injured in violation of federal law an interpretation disputed by some legal scholars26 21 tom

the nations power the supreme court sides with the states berkeley ca university of california press 2002 see crs report rs20828 continued crs9 another dispute between the courts majority and minority in alabama v garrett involved opposing views of legislative and judicial powers rehnquist asserted that it is the responsibility of the united states supreme court not congress to define the substance of constitutional guarantees claim broader than chief justice john marshalls famous 1803 pronouncement in marbury v madison that the duty of the courts is to say what the law is evidence of discrimination against disabled state employees had been amassed by congressional panels but rehnquist dismissed this evidence as anecdotal justice stephen g breyer dissenting in garrett countered in fact congress compiled vast legislative record documenting massive societywide discrimination against persons with disabilities he appended 39 page list of findings from the adas legislative history breyer onetime capitol hill staff member went on to remind his colleagues of the constitutional primacy of legislative judgments unlike courts congress can readily gather facts from across the nation assess the magnitude of problem and more easily find an appropriate remedy unlike courts congress directly reflects public attitudes and beliefs enabling congress to better understand where and to what extent refusals to accommodate disability amount to behavior that is callous or unreasonable to the point of lacking constitutional justification unlike judges members of congress can directly obtain information from constituents who have firsthand experience with discrimination and related issues27 federalism cases are filled with complexities unsurprisingly the court does not exhibit fixed view as to whether it will read congresss power broadly or narrowly three years later in tennessee v lane 2004 the court took different view from garrett with respect to state sovereignty under the ada28 briefly george lane was paraplegic who had to crawl up two floors to reach county courtroom in tennessee because there was elevator lane had been charged with crime at subsequent hearing he refused to crawl up the stairs and was arrested for failure to appear at the hearing on his case he sued tennessee under the ada and won financial settlement why the different outcome in lane compared to garrett part of the explanation is that the court considered wider range of evidence in garrett the court considered only state employers such as the university of alabama in lane it also examined tennessees treatment of the disabled by county and city employers significantly lane involved access to the courts one of the countrys key political institutions the court is concerned about access to employment by disabled persons but it has traditionally demonstrated greater concern for access to political institutions by disadvantaged groups 26 continued university of alabama v garrett federalism limits on the american with disabilities act by nancy lee jones 27 board of trustees of the university of alabama v garrett 531 us 356 2001 28 tennessee v lane 124 s ct 1978 2004 crs10 2005 case raised some question about whether federalism would be long lasting legacy of the rehnquist court29 in gonzales v raich the court deferred to congressional power when it ruled that federal law banning marijuana trumps state laws allowing its use for medical purposes30 in the judgment of american university law professor herman schwartz despite gonzales the federalism revolution is very much alive the courts current federalism doctrines will likely be extended and expanded in coming years with or without rehnquist31 the terrorist threat and federalism as the nation confronts an ongoing terrorist threat against the homeland it is uncertain whether the supreme courts recent tendency to defer to state sovereignty will continue whenever you see national emergency federalism disappears stated law professor in national emergency you give the national government the power to get done what needs to get done32 it is the president who gains power during wartime when the balance between liberty and security tilts toward the latter and not the former possible condition of extended war against terrorists raises number of important issues whether and to what extent federal courts will sanction infringements of individual privacy allow terrorist suspects to be imprisoned without normal legal protections permit greater governmental secrecy and authorize more searches of personal records an issue is whether curbs on civil liberties stricter surveillance of the populace for example are effective strategies for fighting terrorism after september 11 2001 federal district judge gladys kessler said the court fully understands and appreciates that the first priority of the executive branch in time of crisis is to ensure the physical security of its citizens by the same token she added the first priority of the judicial branch must be to ensure that our government always operates within the statutory and constitutional constraints which distinguish democracy from dictatorship33 the supreme court demonstrated that it can rein in executive power even during wartime when in june 2004 it handed 29 linda greenhouse the rehnquist court and its imperiled states

court34 congress also must address how to protect the homeland against terrorism without trampling on constituents civil liberties35 the challenge it faces is that partisan polarization in congress makes it difficult to reach consensus on many issues involving the clash between liberty and security polarization on the supreme court is also not unusual as highlighted by its recent spate of 54 decisions on the balance of power between national and state governments both garrett and lane were 54 judgments these and other rulings have raised again the issue of how assertive courts should be in overturning decisions of the popularly elected congress lawmakers are accountable to their constituents every time they face reelection although judges are not immune to the tides of public opinion they do not face accountability through elections the tension between policymaking by lawmakers versus judgemade decisions is perennial statutory interpretation it is the conventional view that the supreme court is the ultimate arbiter of constitutional law and this is often the case but congress like the president is also involved in constitutional interpretation neither of the three national branches has monopoly on constitutional or statutory interpretation as each branch often tests and retests decisions made by the others good example how the interpretive decisions of the court can trigger both legislative response and further ruling by the court is highlighted by the controversial case of miranda v arizona 1966 chief justice earl warren who delivered the opinion of the supreme court stated that the case goes to the roots of our concepts of american criminal jurisprudence the restraints society must observe consistent with the federal constitution in prosecuting individuals for crime he added that the constitutional issue we decide is the admissibility of statements obtained from defendant questioned while in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way36 the court decided among other things that suspect taken into custody by police must be accorded certain procedural safeguards suspect must be told prior to any questioning by police of his right to the presence of an attorney retained or appointed his right to remain silent and cautioned that anything he said might be used as evidence against him in court of law 34 charles lane

the miranda warnings by police proved quite controversial and the court was attacked for hamstringing the ability of police to convict criminals it was asserted that between 75 and 80 of the convictions in major crimes were dependent upon confessions and police officers and prosecutors across the country echoed the sentiments of new york citys police commissioner michael j murphy that if suspects are told of their rights they will not confess37 congress responded to the criticism of miranda by including within the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 pl 90351 provision allowing under appropriate circumstances voluntary confessions of arrested persons whether or not they were informed of their rights before questioning38 this provision however was never implemented because of doubts about its constitutionality the supreme court resolved the doubts in dickerson vunited states 2000 holding that miranda was constitutional decision that could not be overturned by statute and consequently the 1968 provision was unconstitutional39 such disagreements between congress and the courts occur in part because communications between the legislative and judicial branches are less than perfect neither branch understands the workings of the other very well40 judges are generally aware that ambiguity imprecision or inconsistency may be the price for winning enactment of legislative measures the more members try to define the language of bill the more they may divide or dissipate congressional support for it abner j mikva fourterm house democrat from chicago who went on to become federal judge and later counsel to president bill clinton recounted an example from his capitol hill days the issue involved controversial stripmining bill being managed by representative morris k udall then chairman of the house interior now called resources committee theyd put together very delicate coalition of support one problem was whether the states or the feds would run the program one member got up and asked isnt it fact that under this bill the states would continue to exercise sovereignty over strip mining and mo replied youre absolutely right little later someone else got up and asked now is it clear that the federal government will have the final say on strip mining and mo replied youre 37 robert f cushman leading constitutional decisions 15th ed englewood

and robert katzmann courts and congress washington the brookings institution 1997 to be sure there are many lawmakers especially those who serve on house and senate judiciary panels who have good understanding of federal courts by the same token there are federal judges such as supreme court justice stephen breyer who once served as professional staff aide on the senate judiciary committee who also have good understanding of how congress works crs13 absolutely right later in the cloakroom i said mo they cant both be right and mo said youre absolutely right41 called upon to interpret statutes judges may not appreciate the efforts required to get legislation passed on capitol hill or understand how to divine legislative history as manifested in hearings reports and floor debate for example prior to house passage in the 109th congress 20052007 of bill dealing with classaction law suits the judiciary chairman and other lawmakers read into the house record lengthy colloquy meant to guide federal judges42 the courts are debating what is the proper way to approach statutory interpretation should judges focus only on the plain meaning of the statutory language or should legislative history be consulted to help judges ascertain what congress intended when it employed certain statutory phrases role of legislative history group of federal judges led by supreme court justice antonin scalia argues that legislative history is open to manipulation by individual members of congress executive officials congressional staffers and lobbyists and therefore is unreliable as an indicator of statutory intent of course decisions by executive and judicial officials are also influenced by the ideas legal briefs or written reports submitted to them by lobbyists law clerks and others the essence of scalias view is that laws mean what they actually say not what legislators intended them to say but did not write into the laws text for anyone to read43 other federal judges including supreme court justice breyer defend the value of legislative history finding it useful in statutory interpretation it is dangerous breyer asserted to rely exclusively upon the literal meaning of statutes words44 the dispute over legislative history is well illustrated by congresss passage of the civil rights act of 1991 the law overturned in whole or in part seven civil rights cases decided by the supreme court45 yet the 1991 legislation was filled with ambiguities and so lawmakers created their own legislative history during floor debate memorandum was even put in the congressional

putting explanatory language in committee report by saying justice scalia this lawmaker further said that if scalias view on legislative history became dominant congress would be required to develop new category of legislation the we really meant it statute47 the disagreement between congress and federal judges over the utility of legislative history was summed up by the chief counsel of the

constitutional amendment generally if the supreme court bases its decisions on constitutional grounds then congress can only change them by constitutional amendment50 on four occasions congress successfully used the arduous process of amending the constitution to overturn decisions of the supreme court in chisholm v georgia 1793 the court held that citizens of one state could sue another state in federal court to prevent rash of citizen suits against the states the eleventh amendment reversed this decision it guarantees the states immunity from suits by citizens outside its borders the dred scott v sandford 1857 decision which denied africanamericans citizenship under the constitution was nullified by the thirteenth abolishing slavery and fourteenth granting africanamericans citizenship amendments the sixteenth amendment overturned pollock v farmers loan and trust co 1895 which struck down federal income tax the twentysixth amendment invalidated oregon v mitchell 1970 which said that congress had exceeded its authority by lowering the minimum voting age to eighteen for state elections51 lawmakers are often reluctant to amend the constitution as one house member said i just think the constitution has served us very well over long long period of time and one needs to make compelling case before we start amending the constitution to do anything52 the constitution has been amended only twenty seven times by comparison there have been about 11000 proposals introduced since 1789 to change this fundamental document53 there are occasions when certain 50 congress can also respond to constitutional rulings through statutory means as noted in the earlier discussion of miranda as public law scholar louis fisher wrote 1986 decision goldman v weinberger again illustrates how the first amendment is shaped not merely by court opinion but by legislative action as well an air force regulation provided that headgear may not be worn indoors except by armed security police in the performance of their duties an air force officer an orthodox jew and ordained rabbi claimed that the regulation prevented him from wearing his yarmulke skullcap and therefore infringed on his freedom to exercise his religious beliefs the supreme court split 54 upheld the regulation as necessary for military discipline unity and order in one of the dissents justice william brennan claimed that the courts response is to abdicate its role as primary expositor of the constitution and protector of individual liberties in favor of credulous deference to unsupported assertions of military necessity however other institutions of government are capable of protecting individual liberties congress among them as brennan later noted guardianship of this precious liberty of religious freedom is not the exclusive domain of federal courts it is the responsibility of the states and other branches of the federal government congress passed legislation in 1987 to permit military personnel to wear conservative unobtrusive religious apparel indoors provided that it does not interfere with their military duties see fisher american constitutional law pp 571572 51

amendment to limit justices terms to 18 years55 group of lawyers contends that supreme court justices serve too long 187 years is the average length of tenure on the rehnquist court which gives rise to aging justices who may become outoftouch with the times or too impaired to know it to avoid the difficulties of winning approval of constitutional amendment they propose complex legislative approach that would force justices into senior status after roughly 18 years on the high court56 withdrawal of jurisdiction under its constitutional authority to determine the courts appellate jurisdiction congress may threaten to withdraw the supreme courts authority to review certain categories of cases57 the cases that promote court jurisdictionalstripping actions by congress share certain features they are controversial abortion and school prayer for example they are triggered by state or federal court decisions the massachusetts supreme courts decision that it is discriminatory to prohibit gay marriages for example and they arouse partisan and ideological passions among lawmakers and the electoral groups affiliated with each party despite numerous legislative threats to constrict or withdraw jurisdiction on only one occasion in american history did congress prevent the supreme court from deciding case by removing its appellate jurisdiction this extraordinary action was taken by congress dominated by radical republicans who wanted to prohibit the supreme court from reviewing the constitutionality of the reconstruction acts of 1867 the acts

prompted chief justice rehnquist in his 2004 annual report on the federal judiciary to stress the importance of judicial independence and the need to protect judges from political threats because of the decisions they make judges do not always decide cases the way their appointers might have anticipated he said but for over 200 years it has served our democracy well and ensured commitment to the rule of law65 impeachment of judges federal judges like other national civil officers are subject to impeachment under article ii of the constitution they are appointed for life during good behavior only one supreme court justice samuel chase was impeached by the house this occurred in 1804 during bitter partisan battles between federalists and jeffersonian republicans the judiciary was the last bastion of federalist influence after thomas jefferson won the presidency in the 1800 election intemperate and arrogant behavior on chases part including campaigning for john adamss reelection in 1800 aroused the ire of the president and his republican allies in congress on march 12 1804 the house voted 7332 along party lines to impeach chase the senate however failed to convict chase the importance of chases acquittal by the senate was underscored by chief justice william rehnquist the acquittal of samuel chase by the senate had profound effect on the american judiciary first it assured the independence of federal judges from congressional oversight of the decisions they made in the cases that come before them second by assuring that impeachment would not be used in the future as method to remove members of the supreme court for their judicial opinions it helped to safeguard the independence of that body66 other supreme court justices have either been threatened with impeachment or been the subject of impeachment investigations for example william douglas in 1953 and in 1970 more recently few lawmakers have suggested that judges who base their decisions on international precedents risk being impeached chief justice rehnquist responded to these impeachment threats by stating that judges judicial acts may not serve as the basis for impeachment any other rule would destroy judicial independence since judges would be concerned about inflaming any group that might be able to muster the votes in congress to impeach and convict them67 65 rehnquist backs

sometimes proposed that court decisions overturning federal laws must be accomplished by supermajority vote of the justices some of the more extreme proposals have urged that such decisions be

the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint judges of the supreme court the founders opposed lodging the power to appoint solely in the executive they also opposed giving it exclusively to congress as whole or to the senate in particular the framers compromised and provided that judicial selections required joint action by the president and the senate the president has the sole prerogative to nominate but the power to confirm or not is the senates alexander hamilton in the federalist papers 66 viewed this division of responsibility in stark terms there will of course be exertion of choice on the part of the senate they may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige him to make another but they cannot themselves choose they can only ratify or reject the choice he may have made hamiltons view requires some modification however giving two elective institutions voice in the appointments process necessarily meant that nominees would be subject to political process individual senators house members interest groups the american bar association which since 1952 has rated judicial candidates the press and media and even sitting judges all may play role in influencing both the choice of judicial nominees and senate action if any on these nominees the fact that federal district and appellate court jurisdictions are geographically based means that senators from those states especially if they are of the presidents party commonly have large say in suggesting judicial candidates to the white house norms and practices extraconstitutional norms and practices shape the confirmation process president george washington quickly learned the importance of the newly emerging norm of senatorial courtesy an informal practice in which presidents consult homestate senators before submitting nominees for federal positions in their state when washington failed to seek the advice from the georgia senate

of the person recommended by the senators75 related to senatorial courtesy is the blueslip policy of the judiciary committee which applies only to district and circuit court nominees it refers to blue approval papers that senators are asked to submit on nominees for federal judgeships in their states for the past few years both homestate senators had to submit positive blue slip for nominee to be considered by the judiciary committee76 although exceptions and changes have been made to this policy it does encourage the president to seek the advice of senators before he submits judicial nominees to the senate an array of other senate practices influences whether any action occurs on judicial nominations particularly holds request by senator to his or her party leader to delay floor action on measures or nominations the committee chairs prerogative of determining whether hearings will be held and the majority leaders willingness to schedule floor consideration of the nominations an unresolved issue is the balance between advice and consent presidents often favor consent over advice the senate tilts in the other direction the george w bush administration seems to think that advice and consent means advise and rubber stamp declared senator77 another senator pointed out that the senates constitutional role is limited to advice and consent it does not mean advice and obstruction78 adding to the controversy is the lack of agreement on what qualifications are appropriate for service as federal jurist the constitution makes reference to what presidents or senators

standard qualifications that everyone expects in prospective judges legal experience ethical behavior recognized competence and so on an ageold question is whether political or ideological litmus tests are appropriate for presidents to use when selecting judicial nominees or for senators to use when deciding whether to vote for confirmation79 what place should persons legal philosophy or ideology have in the appointments process unsurprisingly many presidents search for ideologically compatible nominees to place on the federal bench the presidency of ronald reagan was the first to put in place an institutional apparatus to ensure that reagan judicial nominees were compatible with the philosophical and policy orientation of the president80 in the opinion of north carolina law professor michael gerhardt the george w bush administration follows this general approach in selecting judicial nominees the people counseling bush on judicial appointments are convinced that his father erred in appointing some judges notably david souter who has become reliable vote for the supreme courts moderate wing and cast pivotal vote for reaffirming roe v wade upholding womans right of abortion during the first trimester consequently bushs counselors conduct extensive interviews with prospective nominees about their judicial philosophies many of the nominees have been active members of the federalist society established in the early 1980s to organize cultivate and sharpen conservative thinking about the constitution activity within the federalist society constitutes an important and sometimes the only evidence of young conservatives ideological commitment81 since the policy or ideological views of judicial candidates influence presidential nominating decisions it should not be startling to people that senators have increasingly openly opposed judicial nominees on policy and judicial 79 political scientist henry j abraham has identified six characteristics that nominees to the supreme court or to federal appeals and district courts should possess absolute personal and professional integrity lucid intellect professional expertise and competence appropriate professional educational background or training the capacity to communicate clearly especially in writing and demonstrated judicial temperament some other criteria presidents have used for example geographical and religious ones have gone by the wayside in recent years other criteria such as race and gender have emerged moreover the senators have more explicitly considered the nominees views

about the proper scope of questioning regarding nominees ideology judicial values or views on controversial issues or particular court cases underlying the argument over the proper scope of questions for judicial nominees is longrunning debate over whether senators should weigh nominees ideology or confine themselves to vetting his resume and making general judgments about his character83 after president bush nominated circuit court judge john g roberts on july 19 2005 to replace the retiring sandra day oconnor on the supreme court judiciary democrat noted that there is higher level of inquiry for supreme court nominees than circuit court nominees this is different ball game altogether he said it is longer im going to follow supreme court precedent you are going to make supreme court precedent and do it for lifetime there are many different more important questions that have to be asked84 judiciary republican stated however that it is beyond the pale to ask nominee how he would rule in particular case85 with the death of chief justice william rehnquist on september 3 2005 president bush withdrew roberts as oconnors replacement and named him instead to succeed rehnquist as chief justice justice oconnor agreed to remain on the supreme court until her successor is confirmed by the senate roberts nomination as chief justice prompted democratic leader to say that the

senate rejected the nominee by 58 to 42 margin borks nomination fight gave rise to madeup verb to bork which means to attack nominees by launching politicallybased campaign against them95

hearings or waited years before any action took place on their nomination96 for example richard paez waited four years from his original nomination before he was confirmed to sit on the ninth circuit court of appeals the principal gop methods for frustrating clintons judicial nominees were denying them hearings or floor votes during the brief period from june 2001 to november 2002 when democrats held the senate they blocked many of president bushs judicial nominees through holds blue slips and other actions in the 108th and 109th congresses with democrats again in the minority it was their turn to block many of bushs controversial nominees only this time since democrats do not control committees or the floor schedule they have been compelled to use the more incendiary weapon of the filibuster to stop the bush nominees they oppose but the result has been the same frustration in the white house and more acrimony in congress97 as one commentator noted what distinguishes the judicial battles of the clinton and bush presidencies from those of earlier eras is that they have come to resemble political blood feuds in which each side seeks to avenge the earlier assaults by the other side98 the struggle over who should be federal judge has intensified fierce political strategic and tactical conflicts between the parties and branches overlay the 96 congressional record daily

bench were delayed or stalled after president bush named john g roberts jr to replace the retiring sandra day oconnor on the supreme court some people suggested that ginsburgs confirmation should set the standard for the senates consideration of roberts although ginsburg was an advocate for issues viewed as controversial by many republicans she was acknowledged to be like roberts wellqualified candidate for the supreme court still differences between the two nominations for example the disparity in the judicial record of the two with ginsburg having 12year record of service as circuit court judge compared to roberts twoyear record on the same court aroused concern among some democrats although the white house has released thousands of documents relating to roberts service 19811982 as special assistant to attorney general william french smith and as legal adviser 19821986 in the reagan white house the bush administration has refused to release materials from roberts service

variety of factors contribute to this development such as intense electoral competition between the parties narrow majority party control of the senate neither party can consistently attract 60 votes to stop filibusters and the ability of various advocacy groups aligned with each party to bring indirect pressure on senators by mobilizing their network of activists to support or oppose judicial nominees circuit court battles the wrangling over judges has been especially contentious for several circuit court nominees the politicization of the judiciary has recently been the most focused and most virulent at the appellate or circuit level stated federal judge james robertson99 four main factors explain this development first both parties understand that although the supreme court is viewed as the court of last resort it only decides about 80 cases each year two decades ago the number was double that100 today the 13 regional appeals courts decide more than 63000 cases each year101 circuit courts are playing more important role in setting law for vast areas of the country decision by the 9th circuit for example is binding on nine states where 19 percent of the nations population lives102 the circuit courts remarked law professor are the supreme courts for their region103 second circuit courts especially the district of columbia circuit court of appeals are often recruiting grounds for supreme court nominees for example three of the nine members of todays supreme court antonin scalia ruth bader ginsburg and clarence thomas served previously on the dc circuit president bushs supreme court nominee judge roberts sits on this court the dc circuit is also important as senator noted because congress has vested it with exclusive or special jurisdiction over cases involving many environmental civil rights consumer protection and workplace statutes104 third the contests over circuit court nominees are perceived by many individuals and organizations as warmup for the anticipated battles involving supreme court vacancies i think its warmup for the supreme court remarked c boyden gray white house counsel to the first george bush and head of group titled committee for justice105 conservative and liberal groups have long been prepared for vacancies on the supreme court raising money crafting strategies 99 james robertson cure for what ails the

24hour plan and 72hour plan because there is recognition we need to move quickly right out of the box once the president names nominee said an aide to senate leader106 the plans and preparations were activated when president bush on july 19 2005 nominated judge roberts to replace the retiring sandra day oconnor on the supreme court groups on the left moveonorg for example and right progress for america for instance responded quickly to the presidents announcement less than two hours after the announcement two white house aligned conservative groups had posted proroberts web commercial and launched new web site promoting his confirmation while the liberal activist group moveonorg swiftly branded him right wing corporate lawyer107 finally the confirmation battles represent clash between president bush and senate democrats over who will control the ideological balance of power on the courts president bush has been more consistent and insistent than say gerald r ford or reagan in nominating conservatives to the bench said law professor108 there is little doubt that president bush has been successful in recasting federal courts in more conservative direction for example when the 108th congress began in 2003 494 percent of active judges on the lower federal courts were appointed by republican presidents by the time congress adjourned in december 2004 that figure stood at 525 percent109 gop court appointees now constitute majority of judges on 10 of the nations 13 federal appeals courts with as few as three more judicial confirmations on key courts giving bush majority on all but one federal appeals court the ninth circuit in san francisco many congressional republicans want to split this circuit into several additional court circuits in part they argue because its workload is too large and cumbersome110 worth noting is that the party label of judicial nominees does not mean for example that gop appointees will decide cases in way that always satisfies 106 janet

control judiciary as two journalists pointed out the judicial confirmation fight may have more to do with the kind of republican who joins the courts in particular the supreme court while democrats are determined to block judicial nominees they see as conservative ideologues the republican leadership pushes for rightleaning judges112 the partisan battles and recriminations over judges play out in both the judiciary committee and on the senate floor the judiciary committee is polarized to degree that ive never seen exclaimed gop senator who sits on the panel113 another judiciary republican expressed comparable view im very concerned not only about the broken judicial confirmation process but also how badly it seems to have poisoned relations in the senate and hurt our ability to do other things as well114 democratic senator who serves on the judiciary panel has different take on why there are problems with the confirmation process whats broken is not the senate confirmation process its the white house nominations process the process isnt working now because president bush is trying to stack the courts with rightwing extremists115 republicans deny that they are trying to pack the judiciary with conservative activists they contend that their nominees are highly qualified professionals who represent the mainstream of judicial thinking these diverse perspectives are difficult to resolve because unlike the lawmaking process opportunities for compromise on controversial judgeship nominations are limited it is typically zerosum game the president either wins senate confirmation of his nominee or he loses article ii of the constitution does authorize the president to make recess appointments to all judicial levels district appellate and the supreme court president eisenhower for example used his recess authority to name earl warren william brennan and potter stewart to the supreme court116 needless to say many senators become vexed when presidents use

during the recess of the senate117 other contemporary developments several other significant points are important to note about the contemporary confirmations process most judicial nominations are approved by the senate roughly an 85 approval rate for the period extending from the late 1970s to the late 1990s118 another analysis found that recent presidents have filled the federal bench at roughly the same rate over the past quartercentury about 45 to 50 new federal judges each year119 however both senatorial parties often present differing views of the other partys role in processing judicial nominations democrats sometimes talk about president clintons nominees being pocket filibustered in the judiciary committee never to see the light of day republicans lament what they perceive as pattern of systematic obstructionism on the floor against several of president bushs nominations120 in addition to heightened partisanship recent judicial nominations also confront longer confirmation delays sheldon goldman devised an index of obstruction action on nominee and delay it takes more than 180 days from the date of nomination to senate floor vote for district and appeals court nominees from 1977 through 2002 accounting for periods of divided or unified government he found an increasing pattern of delay and obstruction especially for circuit court nominees for example the average number of days from the date the nomination was reported by the judiciary committee to the date of confirmation by the senate ranged from low of 18 days for the 97th congress 19811983 for district court appointees and 117 congressional record daily edition vo 146 december 15 2000 p s11834 in 1960 the senate passed resolution sres 334 to discourage presidents from using recess

appeals court nominees to 383 days for district court nominees for the 105th congress 19971999 and 685 days for appeals court nominees for the 106th 19992001121 number of reasons account for the delays especially for the relatively small number of nominees who wait many months or several years for confirmation scholars confirm for instance that an approaching presidential election not to mention divided government usually produces two outcomes longer delays and more rejections of presidential electionyear nominees122 historically various other factors influence whether nominee is confirmed quickly or subject to lengthy delays or outright rejection such as candidates race or gender the position to which candidate is nominated especially if it tips the balance of power on the court the extent of bipartisan support for nominee the use of dilatory tactics by senators the philosophic outlook of candidates the extent of presidential consultation with senators the likelihood that candidate might later be nominated to the supreme court and more president bush even offered his own plan to speed senate action on judicial confirmations123 part of his plan for example would require the chamber to vote on judicial nominee within six months of its receipt by the senate sometimes moreover the white house is faulted for its slowness in naming candidates to fill judicial vacancies new judicial front opens the nuclear or constitutional option the frustration level over judicial nominees has risen exceptionally high in todays senate largely over filibusters against relatively small number 10 judges blocked 204 confirmed in the presidents first term of bush nominations senate republicans contend that lawmakers who cite those numbers are mixing apples and oranges

sparked unusual partisan acrimony was miguel estrada during the 108th congress supporters of his nomination said opponents were blocking floor action in the hopes they could find some damning information about his record126 opponents said that controversy over the estrada nomination could have been resolved quickly if the bush administration had supplied the memos from the solicitors office of the department of justice while he worked there and that he wrote and allowed more questioning of estrada at another round of judiciary committee hearings127 the administration refused to release the memoranda meanwhile the senate tried seven times unsuccessfully to invoke cloture closure of debate on the nomination in the end estrada withdrew his name from consideration and remained in private law practice interesting the same solicitor general disclosure issue has arisen with respect to robertss nomination to the supreme court senate democrats want documents prepared by roberts

november 1213 2003 for the senate to conduct an aroundtheclock debate on the state of the nominations process with vice president dick cheney presiding to underscore the administrations concern and the majority leader sponsored resolution sres 138 setting forth declining vote procedure 60 votes required on the first cloture attempt 57 on the next 54 on the third attempt and finally 51 or majority cloture to end judicial filibusters the senate took action on sres 138 at the start of president bushs second term the names of several judicial nominees whom the democrats filibustered during the 108th congress were resubmitted to the senate further escalating tensions between senate democrats and the white house mindful that these nominees could be blocked by filibusters the majority leader considered ways to break such efforts by employing parliamentary procedure the socalled nuclear or constitutional option allowing simple majority to confirm judicial nominees because the word nuclear implies that something catastrophic might occur in the senate republicans prefer to call the procedural maneuver the constitutional option to underscore their contestable view that the constitution requires only majority vote to confirm judicial nominees 51 senators if everyone votes under senate rule xxii 60 votes are required to invoke cloture and end filibuster many republicans contend that filibusters impose an unconstitutional supermajority requirement of 60 votes for the confirmation of judges judgeships 125 donald lambro misleading filibuster myths washington

majority vote democrats reply that the constitution authorizes each chamber to determine the rules of its proceedings which today means as already noted 60vote requirement to end judicial filibuster if cloture is successfully invoked then senators have the right to confirm judges by majority vote128 the distinction then is that supermajority vote is necessary to terminate extended debate while simple majority vote is the standard to confirm judicial nominees procedural scenario there are various nuclear or constitutional option scenarios but most involve ruling by the presiding officer vice president cheney could be in the chair to cast tiebreaking vote that could lead to new senate precedent requiring only 51 votes to end debate on judicial nominee one widely circulated parliamentary plan could proceed as follows129 1 the majority leader or surrogate would likely ask unanimous consent and if someone objected then offer nondebatable motion to proceed to executive session to consider judicial nomination viewed as controversial by number of senators 2 debate on the nomination would begin and continue for an unspecified but extended period of time 3 cloture motion or petition would be filed at some point in the proceedings to end the debate cloture motion requires 60 votes to adopt and the vote occurs two calendar days of senate session after the petition is filed 4 unable to attract the 60 votes as would be expected on contentious nomination the majority leader or colleague would make point of order that further debate on the nominee is dilatory and must end after certain number of hours or days 128 crs report rl32102 constitutionality of senate filibuster of judicial nomination by jay r shampansky 129 many senators are mindful of scholarly article that

presiding officer presumably the vice president would sustain the point of order which would establish new senate precedent ending judicial filibusters 6 senator opposed to the chairs decision would likely appeal the ruling of the presiding officer which is debatable motion 7 however another senator would offer nondebatable motion to table the appeal which would be voted on immediately and requires simple majority vote for approval tabling the appeal would uphold the presiding officers ruling and create the most authoritative type of precedent one established by vote of the senate this precedent would be used to stop future judicial filibusters some implications and possible consequences this yettobetried maneuver has sparked considerable discussion and controversy two overlapping issues constitutional and procedural highlight several of the main points in contention constitutionally various lawmakers and analysts who advocate use of the maneuver argue that only simple majority is required to approve judicial nominees their reasoning the constitutional clause article ii section 2 that deals with advice and consent specifies twothirds vote to approve treaties but is silent on the number of votes needed to approve judicial nominees accordingly it is reasonable to conclude they say that the framers wanted judicial nominees to be approved by majority not supermajority vote other lawmakers and analysts contest that argument they stress the senates constitutional right to establish its own rules one of which rule xxii requires 60 votes to end filibuster130 this parliamentary mandate means that senators are obligated to follow chamber rules to end extended debate on any judicial nominee further as chamber rules stipulate if there is filibuster on proposal to change senate rules including rule xxii an even higher supermajority threshold is required to end one twothirds of the senators present and voting or 67 if all 100 members vote rule v of the senate is also cited by opponents of the nuclear or constitutional option the rules of the senate shall continue from one congress to the next congress unless they are changed as provided in these rules in polarized senate proponents of upordown majority votes on judicial nominees recognize that they cannot attract 67 votes to change rule xxii let alone win the 60 votes needed to terminate judicial filibusters on controversial nominees the parliamentary dilemma faced by those who want to end extended debate on judicial nominees is that they are boxed in by the requirements of the current and continuous rules of the senate these inherited or entrenched procedures effectively prevent majority of the senate from writing new rules to govern and regulate debate on judicial nominees this practical reality gives rise to the nuclear or constitutional option it would permit the majority party by majority vote 130 the senate and house have established other supermajority requirements by rule such as the houses suspension of the rules procedure twothirds vote or the 60vote requirement in the senate on certain budget matters crs36 to adopt new and binding senate precedent that would end judicial filibusters in the senate precedents established in this authoritative manner trump the formal rules of the chamber and are followed in similar procedural circumstances until they are changed or repealed another procedural issue deserves mention it is highlighted by this hypothetical proponent of the nuclear option as mentioned in the above scenario might raise point of order and state that debate on nominee must end immediately or at certain time the rationale would be that judicial filibusters prevent the senate from giving its advise and consent as required by the constitution current senate practices state however under the precedents of the senate the presiding officer has authority to pass upon constitutional question but must submit it to the senate for its decision131 constitutional points of order are subject to filibusters which require 60 votes to end under rule xxii and they are subject to nondebatable motions to table proponents of the nuclear or constitutional option would then confront at least two hurdles first they may lack the 60 votes required to end filibuster on the constitutional point of order second if opponents have the votes to table this returns the senate to the status quo the delaying tactics underway before the presiding officer submitted the constitutional point of order to the senate and if the motion to table is rejected any filibuster on the constitutional point of order may continue thus successful use of the nuclear option under this scenario would oblige the presiding officer on his own initiative and authority to set aside or ignore senate precedents and rule in favor of the constitutional point of order any appeal of the presiding officers ruling upholding the constitutional point of order could be tabled by majority vote of the senate this procedural scenario would also establish new senate precedent ending judicial filibusters the point is that an upordown vote on judicial nominees which president bush and many senate republicans insist upon is prevented by the senates current rules and precedents and the majority partys inability in polarized environment to attract 60 votes the constitution as democrats point out does not require an up ordown vote on nominees or even that they be voted upon likewise there is requirement for committee to vote on nominee and report the judicial candidate for floor action thus advocates of the nuclear or constitutional option plan to set aside established procedures what may be called the regular order and create new practices and precedents by majority rather than supermajority vote of the senate as flexible and adaptable institution the senate can change its procedures by outofthe ordinary means even if doing so creates dismay and discontent among some senators leading senate opponent of this parliamentary option and an acknowledged authority on the chambers rules and precedents pointed out the nuclear or constitutional option has been around long time since 1917 in fact the year the cloture rule was adopted by the us senate it required genius to 131 floyd m riddick and alan s frumin senate procedure

determination to execute the procedural maneuver132 if the nuclear or constitutional option is successfully employed opponents of the procedural maneuver have indicated they will use all available procedural tools the parliamentary fallout to block and frustrate all but the most essential business of the senate when asked about the parliamentary steps opponents could take if the option were employed former senate democratic leader tom daschle stated the senate runs on unanimous consent it takes unanimous consent to stop the reading of bills the reading of every amendment on any given day there are fifteen or twenty amendments and halfdozen bills that have been signed off for unanimous consent the vast majority of the work of the senate is done that way but any individual senator can insist that every bill be read every vote be taken and bring the whole place to stop133 if the procedural maneuver had been employed opponents also had readyto use contingency plan it involved the continuous introduction of popular initiatives expanding tax credits for health care raising the minimum wage and releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to counter the rising price of gasoline three benefits were expected to flow from this strategy first it would clutter up the senate calendar limiting the time proponents had for their own priorities second because opponents of the parliamentary option would be proposing real legislation proponents would have harder time casting them as mere obstructionists finally it would put proponents on record as voting against measures many americans support134 supporters of the nuclear or constitutional option highlight the tyranny of the minority that is frustrating senate confirmation of judicial nominees opponents counter that its use would weaken the senates ability to check executive power undermine the chambers traditional respect for minority prerogatives heighten partisan acrimony change the ideological makeup of federal courts and make the minority rule senate function more like the majority rule house some senators also point out that proponents of the nuclear or constitutional option could find themselves in the minority some day and would need the filibuster to protect against the tyranny of the majority135 any shortterm gains in judicial confirmations could produce future costs to their longterm

chambers party leaders devoted weeks during early 2005 trying to reconcile their fundamental disagreements over how judicial nominees are to be considered by the senate the majority leader for example proposed that after 100 hours of debate every nominee should receive an upordown vote by the senate136 the minority leader opposed any curb on the right to filibuster unacceptable judicial nominees the majority leader emphasized that the nuclear or constitutional option would apply only to judicial nominations and that filibusters on legislative measures or executive nominations would continue unchanged there was certainty that this promise would bind future senates or that the procedural maneuver might not be subsequently applied to other measures or matters leadership talks broke off on may 16 2005 with the majority leader indicating that the nuclear or constitutional option would be employed before the memorial day recess137 on may 18 the majority leader called up the controversial nomination of priscilla owen to be federal circuit court judge her ascent to the court had been blocked for several years by judicial filibusters with speculation rampant that chief justice rehnquist suffering from thyroid cancer would resign relatively soon from the supreme court the majority leader wanted the nuclear or constitutional option in place to ensure that minority could not filibuster

nominees vote to invoke cloture was slated for the next day but it was expected to fail the majority leader then would employ the nuclear or constitutional option138 however he never had the chance to execute the procedural maneuver to end judicial filibusters he was blocked by an accord reached by an ad hoc group of senators seven republicans and seven democrats this bipartisan group of senators

11th circuit the other two william myers 9th circuit and henry saad 6th circuit would face what would likely be unbreakable filibusters as of september 2005 they have not been confirmed second the seven republicans promised not to support any amendment to or interpretation of the rules of the senate that would force vote on judicial nomination by means other than unanimous consent or rule xxii this feature effectively prevents the majority leader from using the nuclear or constitutional option and protects the minoritys right to filibuster in return the seven democrats agreed that judicial nominees should only be filibustered under extraordinary circumstances and each signatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether such circumstances exist with 44 democrats and 1 independent senator who often votes with the democrats this provision of the memorandum sidetracks the minority partys ability to sustain filibuster forty one senators are sufficient to block invocation of cloture however extraordinary circumstances is an ambiguous phrase and became source of some interpretive controversy republicans suggested that democratic support of three conservative appellate court justices owen brown and pryor meant that democrats would find it difficult to filibuster conservative supreme court nominee the minority leader disagreed theres nothing in the agreement that prevents us from filibustering somebody thats extreme whether its on the district court on circuit court or the supreme court he said140 one of the gop signers of the accord observed if one of the seven democrats decides to filibuster and i believe its not an extraordinary circumstance for the country then i have retained my rights under this agreement to 139 see keith

whom have the right to pull out of the accord at any time142 third the accord sent signal to the white house that the president should consult with senate democrats and republicans on prospective judicial candidates as the memorandum of understanding stated143 we believe that under article ii section 2 of the united states constitution the word advice speaks to consultation between the senate and the president with regard to the use of the presidents power to make nominations we encourage the executive branch of government to consult with members of the senate both democratic and republican prior to submitting judicial nomination to the senate for consideration such return to the early practices of our government may well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately accompanies the advice and consent process in the senate we firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the traditions of the united states senate that we as senators seek to uphold gop senator who signed the accord pointed out the white house might have an easier time winning prompt confirmation if it consulted more with members of the senate there is feeling that in the past the senate was more involved in giving suggestions and signing off on nominations than it is now144 the agreement aroused some consternation inside and outside the senate with many wondering whether it would remain in effect for long i dont know whether its something thats here to stay or just passing moment remarked democratic senator145 the majority leader who saw his decision to use the nuclear option circumvented by the accord stated that the constitutional option remains on the table i will not hesitate to use it to ensure an upordown vote on judicial nominees146 the minority leader contends that the nuclear or constitutional option is off the table 141 maura reynolds and richard simon senate deal reached on filibusters angeles times may 24 2005 p a8 142 congressional record daily edition vol

is problematic until it is subject to likely test on supreme court nomination president bush may hold the fate of the agreement in his hand if the president chooses polarizing figure for the high court the seven democrats would face enormous pressure to support filibuster and that would pressure the seven republicans to reverse direction and back the filibuster ban147 there were early indications that despite judge robertss conservative credentials he was viewed as credible and nonpolarizing candidate who was unlikely to provoke an extraordinary circumstance filibuster diverse definitions of extraordinary circumstances unsurprisingly soon after justice sandra day oconnor announced on july 1 2005 that she would retire from the supreme court there was considerable speculation in the press and media about the durability of the bipartisan pact if president bush nominated controversial candidate someone that many perceive to be out of the ideological mainstream in terms of his or her judicial views would that amount to extraordinary circumstances and trigger filibuster signers of the accord have competing interpretations comments from different senators who signed the memorandum of understanding illustrate the point148 in my mind extraordinary circumstances would include not only extraordinary personal behavior but also extraordinary ideological positions nominees political ideology is only relevant if it has been shown to cloud their interpretation of the law pattern of irresponsible judgment where decisions are based on ideology rather than the law could potentially be extraordinary are they going to be activist their political philosophy or ideology may not bother at all if theyre not going to be an activist based on what weve done in the past with bush nominees since may 23 2005 ideological attacks are not an extraordinary circumstance extraordinary circumstances means exactly what it says in the agreement we will use our discretion and our judgment in making that determination if any member who signed the accord considered that another member was filibustering judge under circumstance that was not extraordinary then any member had the right to pull out of that agreement and to go back and say i am going to use the constitutional option to change the precedent of the senate 147 brownsten and hook senate faces test of bushs next

s6343 crs42 president bushs nomination of judge roberts seems unlikely to provoke filibuster but many members of the socalled gang of 14 want to review his record and wait to hear his testimony which began on september 12 2005 before the judiciary committee prior to deciding whether extraordinary circumstances emerge from this process as one member of the group of 14 said of the extraordinary circumstance clause youll know it when you see it149 at bottom judicial filibuster will succeed only if several democratic signers of the accord support it and gop signatories choose not to back the nuclear or constitutional option in todays polarized environment it is simply more difficult for the senate to provide its advice and consent to judicial candidates viewed as too controversial by significant number of its members everyone understands that once the senate confirms judicial nominee there is opportunity for later senates to reverse that decision except through the arduous process of impeachment the stakes are high in confirming judicial nominees to lifetime positions on the federal bench as two congressional scholars note intense ideological disagreement coupled with the rising importance of closely balanced federal bench has brought combatants in the wars of advice and consent to new tactics and new crises as the two parties struggle to shape the future of the federal courts150 to be sure the contemporary debate over judicial nominees involves political and philosophical disagreements about the proper role of the courts in interpreting the constitution and other measures or matters many people say they want judges who will not legislate from the bench this comment may seem reasonable but in practice whether judicial activists are perceived to have exceeded their authority often depends on whether someone likes or dislikes court decisions on such large issues as the proper balance between liberty and authority between the state and the individual151 summary observations battles over judicial nominations are not new development recall that the decision in marbury v madison was triggered by president thomas jeffersons directive to secretary of state james madison to withhold granting an officially signed by president john adams judicial commission to marbury the impeachment of supreme court justice samuel chase in 1804 fdrs unsuccessful court packing plan in 1937 or todays rhetorical salvos against the judiciary in general and specific judicial nominees few decades ago it was individual justices like earl warren or william douglas who were the targets of verbal attacks and impeachment threats today it appears that many citizens are upset with courts in 149 bravin and cummings bush taps roberts for supreme court

favorable of the supreme court down from 70 decade ago the court is taking criticism from both sides of the political spectrum remarked the director of the pew research center liberals lost regard for the court in 2001 following its ruling that president bush had won the 2000 election and the court lost favor with conservative republicans possibly because of their discontent about some big social issues they are focused on152 what seems clear however is that todays judicial confirmation process for high profile nominees is often fraught with conflict and contention contentiousness is to be expected but not wanted is the rancor bitterness or namecalling that permeates debate on some nominees to be sure there are earlier examples of federal court nominees being turned down by the senate or subjected to vigorous public and senatorial debate such as president woodrow wilsons 1916 nomination of louis brandeis to the supreme court the first jew to sit on the high court yet bruising confirmation battles seem more regular and common occurrence today than in the past people may give different start times for the intensive extensive and often critical review of judicial nominees public positions ideological leanings legal philosophy and general views of past court decisions pundits may suggest the 1968 fortas nomination or the 1987 bork nomination as the period when judicial nominees began to confront senate confirmation process marked by greater rigor more partisanship and larger interest group involvement presidential candidates even raise the issue of judicial appointments during their campaigns the exact date for all this is probably less important than suggesting possible explanations as to why the contemporary confirmation process has proven to be difficult and arduous for number of recent judicial nominees there are at least six forces or factors that appear to account for much of the delay defeat or acrimony that shape the fate of relatively small number of judicial candidates wider recognition of the influential role of the judiciary in national governance heightened partisanship split party control larger interest group involvement legislativejudicial misunderstandings and constitutional ambiguities wider recognition of the judiciarys influential role policymaking by federal courts through their interpretations of laws or the constitution is fact of political life which as mentioned earlier alexis tocqueville commented upon more than century ago supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes remarked in 1917 that he recognized without hesitation that judges do and must legislate153 judicial lawmaking then is inherent in the courts exercise of judicial review in the judgment of two duke university law professors every lawyer knows that judges make law its their job in fact law students learn in their first semester that almost all tort law governing accidental injuries contract law and property law are made by judges legislatures did not 152 publics view of high court lower now washington times june 16 2005 p a5 153 southern pacific co v jensen 244 us 205 1917 cited by fisher american constitutional law p 17 crs44 create these rules judges did and they continue to do so when they revise the rules from time to time indeed one of the most fundamental doctrines of america law the authority of courts to declare laws unconstitutional is entirely made by judges nowhere does the text of the constitution mention the power of judicial review and it may fairly be debated whether the framers of the constitution intended to create such power supreme court justices must interpret broadly worded provisions of the constitution and decide the meaning of vague terms that protect liberty or prevent government from the establishment of religion or from imposing cruel and unsual punishment154 it is unclear whether the general public views judges as lawmakers what is clear is the presence of many more active players pressure groups 247 media pollsters and others engaged in discussing and influencing the judicial confirmation process the confirmation process is not distant or inside the beltway activity as it once was attentive constituents and many others all understand that judges have the authority to decide consequential questions involving criminal law reapportionment churchstate relations presidential elections federalism war powers and many other areas understandably many people today are getting engaged in fighting for or against the confirmation of judicial nominees further important judicial decisions are often decided by narrow margins small wonder that wouldbe justices especially for the supreme court are usually subjected to intense senate and public scrutiny would judge roberts for example seek to overrule roe v wade 1973 if placed on the supreme court155 will roberts favor restraints on congresss lawmaking prerogatives in favor of states rights what is judge roberts approach to deciding civil rights cases or interpreting the commerce clause of the constitution most citizens may be unable to recognize roberts or name many of the supreme court justices but they do understand the key role of the judiciary in conjunction with other public and private actors and institutions in shaping american society heightened partisanship there has been by many measures an increase of partisanship in the senate reflected in part by the ideological chasm between the two parties the two senate parties as journalist david broder noted are more cohesive internally and further apart from each other philosophically156 good indicators of heightened partisanship are the large number of partyline votes majority of democrats facing off against majority of republicans and the increase in party cohesion the philosophical 154 erwin chemerinsky and catherine fish judges do make law its their job usa today aug 24 2005 p 11a 155 roe v wade 410 us 113 1973 156 david s broder dont bet on bipartisan niceties washington post jan 1 2003 p a19 crs45 agreement in both parties on these votes only once in the past halfcentury in 1995 has the percentage of partyline votes exceeded that for 2005 in 1995 when republicans won control of both chambers for the first time in 40 years the percentage of senate partyline votes was 688 ten years later it was 686157 as for party unity in 2005 senate republicans have an average score of 91 compared to an 89 average for senate democrats158 judiciary committee democrats and republicans have also found themselves aligned against each other in disputatious confirmation meetings159 what all this means is that in generally narrowly divided senate with few centrists it is quite difficult to forge sufficient consensus to win approval of judicial nominations especially when senators are not reluctant to employ an array of parliamentary devices filibusters holds etc to achieve their objectives in the judgment of one senator the whole congress has become far more polarized and partisan so it makes it difficult to reach bipartisan agreements the more significant the issue the more partisan it becomes160 intense electoral competition between the two parties adds further partisan dimension to senate proceedings split party control split party control of the senate and white house may make it more difficult for presidents to win approval of their judicial nominees and contribute to confirmation delays the chair of the judiciary committee for example may be ideologically outofsync with the president and view unfavorably some judicial nominees submitted by the white house some scholars suggest that the evidence is not clearcut as to whether there is much difference between unified and divided government in the approval of judicial nominations161 on the other hand judgeship confirmation statistics compiled during periods of unified and divided government from the presidencies of jimmy carter through the first three years of george w bushs administration indicate general pattern of higher confirmation success rates during periods of unified compared to divided government162 there is also little doubt that divided government contributed to the 157 gregory giroux if history is any judge parties will be at loggerheads over court nominee cq today july 5 2005 p 18 the time

nominees to facilitate their approval by lessthan friendly senate whether the government is divided or unified the approach of presidential elections as noted earlier does produce confirmation delays the minority party in the senate is often keen on postponing approval of judicial candidates in the hope or expectation that their partys candidate will win the white house in the november election classic case as noted earlier involved president lyndon johnsons selection of supreme court justice fortas to replace the retiring earl warren as chief justice on the same day june 26 1968 that johnson nominated fortas republicans released statement saying the next chief justice should be chosen by the newly elected president of the united states after the people have expressed themselves in the november elections we will therefore because of the above principle and with absolutely reflection on any individuals involved vote against confirming any supreme court nominations of the incumbent president164 larger interest group role given that federal judges have lifetime tenure and make decisions on important social economic and political issues it is understandable that interest groups are actively involved in the judicial confirmation process interest groups labor unions for example presented testimony for the first time in 1930 against president hebert hoovers unsuccessful nomination of john parker to the supreme court165 from active participation in only small number of judicial confirmations interest group involvement public and private grew steadily over time as groups recognized the increasing importance of courts and the judges appointed to them in 1957 for example william j brennan was questioned for total of three hours over two days of hearings with interest group testimony before the full committee twelve years later the senate judiciary committee quizzed thurgood marshall politically controversial nominee for about seven hours with only one interest group representative testifying in 1987 robert bork answered questions for thirty hours over four and half days the hearings themselves lasted for twelve days including eightyseven hours of testimony taken from 112 witnesses with some 86 representing interest groups166 groups of all ideological stripes many aligned with either major party are actively engaged in lobbying for or against

supporters running radio and television ads and raising large sums of money to battle for or against bushs nomination of judge roberts to serve on the supreme court many individuals expect roberts to be confirmed and to vote in generally the same way as one of his mentors the late chief justice rehnquist various groups and lawmakers indicate that the successor to replace justice oconnor swing vote on the court might trigger confirmation battle as judiciary member said during the several days of hearings on judge roberts this is just warmup for the next fight168 the conservative progress for america has raised 18 million to win senate approval of bushs choice for the high court the liberal people for the american way also has raised millions to challenge roberts nomination moreover for the first time the us chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers nam will be activating their network of allies and grassroots supporters we cant sit on the sidelines with the third branch of government making so many decisions affecting business said the nam head169 both organizations have endorsed roberts170 thats not all this will be the first supreme court confirmation battle in 11 years which means it will be the first such battle of the internet age with its legion of bloggers and the first of the new age of media polarization with phalanxes of partisan commentators on competing allnews cable channels171 interest groups have also created computerized war rooms and telephone calling strategies in an effort to exert the most pressure on wavering senators172 these groups in short are important actors in the confirmation process either slowing down expediting or encouraging the approval or rejection of selected court nominees todays confirmation battles bear the hallmarks of an electoral campaign as political scientist noted the transformation of the supreme court appointment process into mechanism similar to that of an electoral

debate their way and responding quickly to the claims and charges of the opposition needless to say many groups will use supreme court vacancy to raise cash for their lobbying efforts174 further because opposing groups have raised so much money to contest roberts candidacy it seems certain that there will be some political fireworks associated with his confirmation matter who got nominated there is just lot of money waiting to talk noted notre dame law professor richard garnett175 legislativejudicial misunderstandings friction between the legislative and judicial branches is inevitable in our separation of powers and checks and balances system one scholar suggests that currently there is an antagonistic relationship between congress and the courts with some people complaining about an imperial judiciary176 many reasons account for this view controversial court decisions or judicial actions that strike down congressional enactments for example but there is another that may be overlooked interbranch tension may result from misunderstandings about the values and incentives of the legislative and judicial worlds communications and understanding gap may produce hostile attitudes and responses toward the judiciary among some on capitol hill house chairman for example wrote fivepage letter to circuit court judge chastising him for giving drug courier lighter sentence

have had agenda other than creating better relations between the two branches of federal government178 the leaders in attendance at the luncheon included the top four party leaders of the house and senate as well as leaders of the house and senate judiciary committees bipartisan congressional caucus was formed recently with the goal of improving the relationship between the legislative and judicial branches179 as one its coleaders explained why does it matter if the congress and the courts are at war because if the separation of powers has eroded and an independent judiciary is impaired decisions become increasingly politicized public confidence in the rule of law erodes and people begin taking the law into their own hands 174 years ago supreme court chief justice john marshall warned the greatest scourge an angry heaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and sinning people was an arrogant corrupt or dependent judiciary180 the bottom line if the executive and legislative

before he became judge stated it would be nice if there were greater dialogue between the legislative and judicial branches as to legislative intent not as to constitutionality and not as to policy decisions but as to the question of what happens when congress passes law and the court interprets it frequently the congress never gets back to the subject matter so members dont get chance to say the courts have misinterpreted what congress wanted them to do so it would be nice if there were some formal system that would allow the congress to review legislative interpretations of the courts and say this isnt what we meant at all here is what we meant but i see way to do this and still maintain separation of powers see abner j mikva on leaving capitol hill for the bench new york times may 12 1983 p b8 crs50 constitutional ambiguities the constitution splits and intermingles presidential and senatorial authority in several specific areas including judicial nominations the founders granted the senate and president shared responsibility for judicial nominations but they never elaborated the specific roles of each branch scholars and others have long debated the meaning of advice and consent is the president to exercise predominance in this area or are both branches expected to be full and equal partners in the confirmation process both sides can find numerous statements from the framers and others to bolster their point of view senators from opposite parties sometimes have divergent views of what the word advice means in the constitution article ii one senator for example stresses that the president should consult in advance with lawmakers before he selects consensus candidate presidents who have listened to the senates advice and selected highly qualified consensus candidates have had problem obtaining senate consent he said182 another senator noted that president clinton consulted with key senators on his two supreme court nominees stephen breyer and ruth bader ginsburg who were easily approved by the senate he added that is not the only time advice has been sought in 1869 president grant appointed edwin m stanton to the supreme court in response to petition from majority of the senate and the house in 1932 president hoover presented senator william borah the influential chairman of the senate foreign relations committee with list of candidates he was considering to replace justice oliver wendell holmes borah persuaded hoover to move the name of the eventual nominee benjamin cardozo from the bottom of the list to the top and cardozo was speedily and unanimously confirmed183 still another senator underscored that the senate is not conominator of judicial candidates citing the constitutions language that the president alone nominates although consultation in theory may or may not be good idea he said there is constitutional requirement or senate tradition that obligates the 182 congressional record daily edition vol 151 june 23 2005 p s7205 this senator also highlighted the advisory process already in place for federal district judicial nominations in selecting district judge nominees in our states the white house sends us the list of persons being considered seriously and asks for our comments on each as well as our suggestions for additional names to consider when they have narrowed down the list they share the short list with us so that we can give our final advice as to which ones are best and which ones would raise problems almost always our advice is considered and respected as result most district judges go through the confirmation process quietly and expeditiously and obtain the consent of the senate p s7206 183 ibid p s7208 one account stated that the senate confirmed cardozos appointment to the supreme court in

by the senate crs51 president or anyone in the executive branch to consult with individual senators let alone the senate as an institution further senators should behave in manner that is both respectful and deserving of such special consultative role in the supreme court nomination process if they expect the administration to meet them halfway184 he added that president bush engaged in unprecedented consultation before his nomination of judge john g roberts jr meeting with 70 senators during his decisionmaking process185 democratic senator had different view of the bush administrations consultative process they called up about 60 senators there was lot of quantity but not much quality in terms of an actual dialogue they didnt have real backandforth with us186 to conclude famous presidential scholar wrote that the constitution is an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing american foreign policy187 if the reference to directing american foreign policy is substituted with shaping the composition of the federal judiciary corwins statement would apply equally well to struggles between the senate and white house over the selection and approval of federal judges our tripartite system of governance has stood the test of time for over 200 years part of the explanation for this achievement is that each branch of government contributes something unique to the policymaking process the president can act with dispatch provide unity and national perspective to policymaking and command from administrative entities policy political procedural and legal expertise on all matters under the sun congress is an open and accessible institution capable of representing and responding to the diverse views and interests of complex polity the supreme court and lower federal courts protect individual and minority rights check legislative and executive authority adjudicate disputes between the states and federal government and more generally uphold such values as fairness and equality under the law the dynamic and evolving interplay of the three branches conspicuously present in the judicial confirmation process means that all three institutions
