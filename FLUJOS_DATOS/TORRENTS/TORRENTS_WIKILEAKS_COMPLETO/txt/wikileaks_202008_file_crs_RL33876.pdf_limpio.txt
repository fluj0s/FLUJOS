any person by reason of the service of such person or the service of any other person in the armed forces7 because of differences between economic conditions and living standards in the united states and the philippines pl 79301 also provided that any benefits paid to commonwealth army veterans would be paid at the rate of one philippine peso to each dollar 8 for veteran who was member of the us armed forces with the assumption that one peso would obtain for philippine veterans in the philippine economy the equivalent of 1 of goods and services for american veterans in the american economy

information on the intent of congress in passing the first rescission act as it affects veterans of the commonwealth army however statements made by senator carl hayden during hearings on the second rescission act which affected new philippine scouts provide some indication of legislative intent in the passage of the first rescission act and to the subsequent passage of the second rescission act furthermore other events at the time may provide some context in which the rescission acts were considered at the end of world war ii when congress was considering 200 million appropriation for the support of the philippine army senator carl hayden of the senate committee on appropriations sent letter to general omar bradley then director of the veterans administration requesting information concerning the status of the filipino servicemen and the potential cost of their veterans benefits in his response to the committee general bradley indicated that the total cost of paying veterans benefits to members of the philippine commonwealth army and their dependents under then existing veterans laws w ould amount in the long run 75 years to about 3 billion it seems clear from senator haydens statements that the passage of the first rescission act was meant to balance competing financial interests by providing some benefits such as pensions for serviceconnected disability or death while at the same time reducing the us liability for future benefits to accomplish this senator hayden senator russell and senator brooks included language by way of an amendment to the first rescission bill stating that 7 ibid now codified at 38 usc 107 8 for example if veteran who was member of the us armed forces received 50 for benefit veteran who was member of the commonwealth army would receive 50 pesos for the same benefit 9 in 1942 the solicitor of the va ruled that members of the commonwealth army called in to the service of the united states by the presidents order of july 26 1941 were eligible for benefits under the veterans national life insurance act in 1945 general omar bradley then director of the veterans administration expressed an opinion to the senate appropriations committee that the term veterans included these commonwealth army veterans filipino american veterans and dependents association v united states of america 391 f supp 1314 nd cal 1974

military naval or air service in the us armed forces furthermore hearings on the second rescission act also clearly indicate that it was congresss intent to limit wartime benefits given to new philippine scouts because neither the president nor the congress has declared an end to the war new philippine scout upon separation from service would be entitled to the same benefits as an american soldier who served in time of war unless this amendment to the second rescission act is adopted new philippine scout would be entitled to claim every advantage provided for the gi bill of rights such as loans education unemployment compensation hospitalization domiciliary care and other benefits provided by the laws administered by the veterans administration because hostilities have actually ceased the amendment makes it perfectly clear that these wartime benefits do not apply and that the 50000 men now authorized to be enlisted in the new philippine scouts will be entitled only to pensions resulting from serviceconnected disability or serviceconnected death 10 in addition the passage of the rescission acts may have been influenced by other bills under consideration by congress at that time in 1946 congress passed the philippine rehabilitation act pl 79370 and the philippine trade act pl 79371 the terms of the rehabilitation act required the united states to pay claims for rehabilitation of the philippines and war damage claims up to 620 million of this sum 220 million was allocated for repair of public property the remaining 400 million was allocated for war damage claims of individuals and associations the philippine trade act provided for free trade between the united states and the philippines until july 3 1954 these bills under consideration at the time would have provided economic stability to the newly emerging nation according to senator hayden as i see it the best thing the american government can do is to help the filipino people to help themselves where there was choice between expenditures for the rehabilitation of the economy of the philippine islands and payments in cash to filipino veterans i am sure it is better to spend any equal sum of money for example on improving the roads and port facilities what the filipino veteran needs is steady employment rather than to depend for his living upon monthly payment sent from the united states 11 therefore it seems clear that congress considered the rescission acts in the context of providing for the comprehensive economic development of the soon to be sovereign republic of the philippines 10 us congress senate committee on appropriations subcommittee on deficiency hearings on hr 5604 79th cong 2nd sess march 25 1946 p 29 11 us congress senate committee on appropriations

clear that it is the position of the united states that the primary responsibility for providing medical care and treatment for commonwealth army veterans and new philippine scouts rests with the republic of the philippines 16 the committee report accompanying pl 9772 stated the longstanding position of congress with regard to health care for filipino veterans there is little doubt that in 1948 when congress enacted pl 80865 authorizing 5year grant program to provide medical benefits to filipino veterans with serviceconnected illnesses including the authorization for constructing and equipping hospital in luzon it intended that this program be temporary and that the philippine government would eventually assume responsibility for funding the program and operations of the hospital these grants were renewed for an additional 5 years in 1954 but on decreasing annual scale of payments pl 83421 the committee report on this bill stated that progressively reducing these grants over five years was to make clear the intent of congress that the philippine government would be expected to gradually assume full responsibility for the hospital however because of the moral obligation of the united states to provide care for filipino veterans and the concern that the philippine government would not be able to maintain high standard of medical care to these veterans if assistance by the united states were withheld this program was extended in 5year increments through fy 1978 pl 89612 enacted in september 1966 expanded the program to include medical care for nonserviceconnected disabilities if the veteran were unable to defray the expense of medical care and included new philippine scouts in the coverage 17 furthermore pl 9772 gave the v the authority to contract for the care and treatment of us veterans in the vmmc and to provide grant authority of 500000 per year for period of five years for making grants to the vmmc to assist in the replacement and upgrading of equipment and the rehabilitation of the physical plant and facilities of the center the grant program was further authorized by making amendments to the grant amount and the time frame for entering
