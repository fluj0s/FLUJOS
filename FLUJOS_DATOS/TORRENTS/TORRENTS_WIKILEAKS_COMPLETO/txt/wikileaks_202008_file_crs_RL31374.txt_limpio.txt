social policy division health expenditures in 2005 summary in 2005 the most recent year for which data are available just under 2 trillion was spent on health care and healthrelated activities this amount represents 69 increase over 2004 spending the majority of health spending 84 went towards paying for health care goods and services provided directly to individuals these goods and services are referred to as personal health care the remaining 16 of health spending covered research public health activities administrative costs structures and equipment personal health care expenditures grew 71 in 2005 continuing downward trend in the growth of expenditures that peaked in recent times in 2001 at 87 from the beginning of 1992 to the end of 2000 personal health expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 58 historically low levels not seen since 1960 compared with spending increases over the past 40 years the 71 increase that occurred in 2005 is relatively moderate in particular the years 1979 through 1981 experienced growth rates between 138 and 159 relative to the overall economy personal health expenditures increased in 2005 in 2005 personal health expenditures accounted for 133 of gross domestic product gdp up from 132 of gdp in 2004 and 2003 128 of gdp in 2002 and 122 in 2001 for the nine years prior to 2001 health spending as percentage of gdp was relatively constant from 1992 to 2000 personal health expenditures as percentage of gdp stayed between 115 and 117 during the three decades prior to the 1990s personal health expenditures as percentage of gdp increased almost every year home health care spending was the fastest growing category of personal health care in 2005 home health care spending in 2005 was 111 higher than the amount spent in 2004 yet because home health care represents about 3 of personal health expenditures it was one of the smallest contributors to overall growth in personal health spending hospital care which grew 79 in 2005 and accounts for more than onethird of personal health expenditures contributed the most to overall growth in personal health spending spending on physician and clinical services which grew at 70 in 2005 and accounts for onefourth of personal health expenditures was the second largest contributor to overall growth in personal health spending over 85 of personal health expenditures in 2005 were financed by thirdparty payers the largest payer private health insurance financed 36 of all personal health expenditures the secondlargest payer the federal government accounted for 34 of all personal health spending certain categories of health care are funded primarily by thirdparty payers whereas other categories are financed almost entirely outofpocket the federal government is the largest payer of hospital care and nursing home and home health care private health insurance is the largest payer of dental services and prescription drugs outofpocket expenditures are the largest source of

the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary 1 research excludes amounts spent by pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment suppliers crs2 this report focuses on expenditures for personal health care since these goods and services constitute most spending on healthrelated activities the latter half of the 1990s experienced historically low growth in personal health care spending from the beginning of 1994 to the end of 1999 health spending increased at an average annual rate of 56 this low growth is attributable to changes in both the private and public sectors in the private sector the increased use of managed care limited cost growth during the mid1990s vigorous fraudandabuse investigation and the balanced budget act of 1997 which slowed growth in hospital home health and nursing home payments constrained health expenditures in the late 1990s2 the effect of these changes in public and private sector have subsided in 2000 personal health expenditures grew at 67 11 percentage points higher than the average rate over the previous six years personal health expenditures grew at even higher rates in 2001 87 but have fallen steadily since then looking from broader historical perspective spending growth in recent years is still much lower than that in most years since 1960 see figure 1 in particular the years 1979 through 1981 experienced growth rates between 138 and 159 figure 1 growth in nominal personal health expenditures 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 source congressional

factors contribute to growth in nominal health spending higher population higher prices and higher real per capita expenditures which some experts label the intensity of care real per capita expenditures indicate qualitative and quantitative increases in the amount of care received by individuals figure 2 depicts the role of population prices and real per capita expenditures in nominal health expenditure growth caution should be used when interpreting data on real health expenditures however real expenditures are estimated using price indexes for medical care goods and services but such price indexes are imperfect4 as result of these imperfections it is difficult to isolate prices and real per capita health expenditures from nominal health spending figure 2 factors influencing

domestic product spending on personal health care in 2005 increased relative to the overall economy in 2005 personal health care expenditures accounted for 133 of gross domestic product gdp up from 132 of gdp in 2003 and 2004 128 of gdp in 2002 and 122 of gdp in 2001 these increases mark departure from the experience of the previous nine years when health spending as percent of gdp was relatively constant between 1992 and 2000 personal health care expenditures averaged 116 of gdp see figure 3 figure 3 personal health care spending as percent of gross domestic product gdp 16 14 12 10

actuary growth in categories of medical care four categories of medical goods and services compose more than 84 of personal health care expenditures hospital care physician and clinical services prescription drugs and longterm care which includes nursing home and home health care in 2005 home health care was the fastest growing category of health expenditures increasing 111 above 2004 expenditures see table 1 crs5 however growth rates of individual categories of services can be deceptive at indicating how much particular category of medical care contributed to overall spending growth as indicated in table 1 the category with the largest dollar increase was hospital care in 2005 spending on hospital care was 447 billion higher than in 2004 an increase of 795 home health care expenditures were 47 billion higher in 2005 than they were in 2004 an increase of 111 thus even though home health care increased more than hospital care in terms of percentage growth hospital care grew more than home health care in dollar terms that is growth in hospital care contributed most to increased personal health care expenditures in 2005 the 447 billion increase in hospital expenditures in 2005 accounted for 41 of the 1101 billion increase in overall personal health care spending figure 4 shows how much dollar growth in each category of personal health care contributed

research service crs calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary 5 that hospital care can exhibit large dollar growth yet moderate percentage growth is attributable to the fact that hospital care constitutes relatively large share of total personal health expenditures crs6 figure 5 share of personal health expenditures devoted to major categories of medical care 19602005 50 47 45 44 41 39 40 37 35 30 26 25 25 23 22 22 20 15 11 12 10 11 10 10 9 7 7 6 5 4 0 1960 1970 1980 1990 2005 hospital care physician and clinical services nursing home and home health care prescription drugs source the congressional research service crs calculations using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary much attention has been directed at spending on prescription drugs the share of personal health expenditures devoted to prescription drugs has more than doubled since 1981 when drugs accounted for only 54 of personal health expenditures yet 1981 represented the trough of 20year decline in spending on prescription drugs as share of personal health expenditures while the percent of personal health expenditures spent on prescription drugs has grown significantly over the past two decades prescription drug spending represented only slightly greater share of personal health expenditures in 2005 as it did in 1960 this trend is illustrated in figure 56 longterm care which includes nursing home and home health care composes larger share of health care than in the past in 1960 about 4 of personal health care expenditures were spent on nursing home and home health care in 2005 about 10 of personal health spending was directed towards providing nursing home and home health care 6 it is worth noting that data on prescription drug spending include only those drugs received in noninstitutional establishments spending on drugs dispensed in nursing homes or hospitals is considered spending on those respective categories consequently data on prescription drug expenditures are likely to be understated crs7 financing health care in 2005 85 of personal health expenditures were in the form of thirdparty payments private health insurance was the largest payer of personal health care in 2005 it paid 36 of personal health expenditures the federal government the second largest payer accounted for 34 of all personal health spending the health care system underwent shift over the last four decades from one financed primarily by outofpocket expenditures to one financed primarily by private insurance figure 6 shows how the funding of personal health care has changed from 1960 to 2005 ultimately all health care is funded by individuals through outofpocket expenditures including insurance deductibles and copayments insurance premiums taxes and charitable contributions7 figure 6 source of funding for personal health expenditures 19602005 state and local 11 funds 13 34 federal funds 9 4

medicaid services office of the actuary 7 even when an individuals employer contributes part of the insurance premium economic theory suggests that the individual accepts lower wage in exchange for this benefit thus individuals pay for all insurance premiums either directly or in the form of forgone wages crs8 although private insurance and the federal government are the largest payers of overall personal health expenditures their role in financing health care varies by type of medical care figure 7 illustrates how major categories of health care were funded in 2005 detailed numbers for figure 7 are provided in table 2 the two largest categories of personal health care hospital care and physician services were financed primarily by private insurance and the federal government small share of these services were paid outofpocket conversely almost all expenditures on nondurable medical goods which includes mostly overthecounter drugs were paid outofpocket although this category represents only small share of all personal health care expenditures private insurance plays relatively small role in financing nursing home and home health care these services were funded mostly by the federal government and outofpocket expenditures dental services and prescription drugs are funded mostly by private insurance and outofpocket expenditures the federal government plays relatively small role in the financing of these services state and local funds account for small share of expenditures in all categories the contribution of theses funds is largest in nursing home and home health care and in hospital care figure 7 source of funding for major categories of personal health care expenditures 2005 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 hospital physician nursing prescription dental
