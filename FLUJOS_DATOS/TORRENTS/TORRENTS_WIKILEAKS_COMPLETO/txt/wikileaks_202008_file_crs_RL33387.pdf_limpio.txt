purcell and debra whitman domestic social policy division april 20 2006 abstract the aging of the american population and the impending retirement of the baby boom generation will place signiﬁcant strains over the next several decades on social security and on retirees own ﬁnancial resources the decline in birth rates since the 1960s and increases in life expectancy will result in fewer workers relative to the number of retirees consequently social security beneﬁts will have to be ﬁnanced by working population that is shrinking relative to the number of retirees and retirees will have to stretch their savings and other assets over longer periods of retirement than their parents and grandparents experiencedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33387g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

reti rement of the baby boom generation will place financial strains on social security public and private pensions and on retirees personal savings since the 1960s birth rates have fallen and average life expectancy has increased consequently the number of workers relative to the number of retirees is projected to decline and retirees will have to stretch their savings and other assets over longer periods of retirement than their parents and grandparents experienced this crs report presents data collected by the census bureau from 1969 through 2005 that describe how the demographic traits employment patterns and the sources and amounts of income of people 65 and older have changed over period of nearly 40 years americas elderly today are older more racially and ethnically diverse better educated and less likely to be widowed than the elderly population of the late 1960s the increasing number of americans living to age 80 and older is of particular significance because it is the very old who are most likely to need medical social and longterm care services and who are at the greatest risk of depleting their financial resources and slipping into poverty rates of employment among older persons have been rising in recent years employment rates fell among men 55 and older from the late 1960s to the early 1990s since then employment rates have risen for older men but they remain below the employment rates of the 1970s among older women employment rates have steadily increased but older womens employment rates today remain lower than those of men the same age earnings social security pensions and income from assets comprise the majority of income among people 65 and older today just as they did 35 years ago wages and salaries today constitute greater proportion of the aggregate income of the elderly than at any time since the late 1970s since the early 1990s both the share of aggregate income received from assets and the percentage of older persons with asset income have fallen social security has remained fairly stable share about 40 of the total income of people 65 and older the percentage of men receiving pension income rose until the early 1990s and then fell more women today have pension income but their average pension is half the amount that men receive median household income rose faster among elderly households than among nonelderly households from 1969 through 2004 but in 2004 the median annual income of households in which the householder or spouse was 65 or older 25 210 was just half of the median income of younger households 50466 the rise in the income of elderly households coincided with decline in the poverty rate among people 65 and older from 25 in 1969 to just 10 in 2004 also since the 1960s the rate of decline in median personal and household income that occurs as people pass age 60 and begin to retire has slowed growth in real wagesand in the social security and pensions based on these wageshas contributed greatly to the economic wellbeing of todays retirees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33387g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g155g146g140g138g151g156g561g3g144g142g561g348g347g561g138

of americans born in 1969 was 705 years it has been estimated that those who were born in 2003 will live for an average of 775 years1 women continue to have longer average life expectancy than men but both men and women have experienced gains in average life expectancy since the 1960s man who reached age 65 in 1969 could expect to live another 130 years whereas woman who turned 65 in 1969 had remaining life expectancy of 165 years man who reached age 65 in 2003 could expect to live another 168 years whereas woman who turned 65 in 2003 had remaining life expectancy of 198 years as more people live into old age the ageprofile of the population will shift in 1969 186 million people in the united states94 of the populationwere age 65 or older in 2005 there were 367 million americans age 65 or older representing 124 of the population see figure 1 by 2025 according to projections made by the bureau of the census there will be 635 million people age 65 or older comprising 182 of the us population see table 1 these demographic trends will strain the components of the traditional threelegged stool of retirement income social security pensions and personal saving the social security board of trustees has estimated that the social security trust fund will be exhausted by 2041 unless actions are taken to preserve it 2 pensions are the second largest source of income among the elderly after social security but only about half of all workers in the united states have pension coverage through their jobs moreover the traditional pension that provides lifelong annuity is becoming less common today more workers participate in savings and thrift plans than in traditional pension plans key characteristic of these savings plans is that the worker must actively participate deciding whether to contribute to th plan how much to contribute and how to invest the funds workers who do not choose to save or who save too little may face difficult financial circumstances in retirement 1 us national center for health statistics vital statistics of the united states 2 social security and medicare boards of trustees status of the social security and medicare programs

challenges social security pensions and retirement savings will continue to occupy the attention of congress as the baby boom generation retires and more households begin to rely on social security pensions and savings to provide the majority of their income as policymakers consider proposals that would affect the main income sources of older americans it may be helpful for them to know how the

census bureau through the current population survey cps survey of the ci vilian noninstitutional population of the united states the cps was begun in the 1940s as way to measure unemployment each month on the basis of random sample of us households it is still the source of the official rate of unemployment reported each month by the bureau of labor statistics the cps also is used to collect annual income data each year in march the survey includes detailed set of questions on the amounts and sources of income people received during the previous calendar year over the years the number of income questions has expanded and today information is gathered on more than 50 different sources of income and noncash benefits such as food stamps employer provided pension plans employersponsored hea lth insurance plans medicaid medicare and home energy assistance the survey also collects detailed information on the employment status work experience occupation and industry of employment of people 15 years old and over the number of households surveyed has increased over the years in march 1969 the earliest survey crs analyzed for this report the cps sample included 47000 households and contained records for 152000 individuals in march 2005 the most recent survey studied for this report the cps sample included 100000 households and contained records for 216000 individuals

diverse better educated and less likely to be widowed than the elderly population of the late 1960s and early 1970s the increasing number of americans living to age 80 and older is of particular importance to policymakers because it is the very old who are most likely to need medical social and long term care services and who are at the greatest risk of depleting their financial resources and slipping into poverty g3g144g142g561 the american population is not only growing larger it is getting older during the past 35 years the total us population increased by 47 rising from 198 million in

americans have changed since the 1960s and the trends in employment among older workers have differed between men and women from the late 1960s to the early 1990s employment rates fell steadily among men 55 and older since then employment rates have risen for older men but they remain below the employment rates that prevailed among men 55 and older as recently as the late 1970s among older women the trend in employment since the late 1960s has been one of steady increase as the larger numbers of women who entered the labor force in the 1960s and 1970s have begun to pass age 55 despite this steady increase however older womens employment rates today remain lower than those of men the same age moreover among both men and women employment rates continue to drop significantly after age 70

for the increased employment among older individualsparticularly the upturn in employment among older mencannot be determined with complete certainty two factors often cited by economists are longterm developments in the design of employer sponsored pensions and the decline in the proportion of retirees with access to employer sponsored group health insurance with respect to pensions the trend for the past 25 years has been away from traditional definedbenefit pensions that pay guaranteed annuity for lifeand which often pay earlyretirement subsidies to encourage workers to retire at 55toward defined contribution plans such as the 401k the typical 401k plan does not include any type of subsidy for early retirement and some workers may have begun to delay retirement in order to retire with larger account balance in the area of health insurance rapidly rising health care costs have discouraged employers from beginning or continuing to offer health insurance to retirees 14 in the absence of this coverage more workers may choose to continue working until age 65 when they become eligible to enroll in medicare

age and the recent trends in employment rates among older americans also differ between men and women although women have lower labor force participation rates than men most of the increase in employment among older americans since the mid1980s has been the result of the increased labor force participation of women employment rates among older men have begun to rise over the past 15 years but they remain substantially lower than the employment rates that prevailed among men up until about 1980 employment rates among older women in contrast were higher in 2004 than at any point in the previous 35 years in 1969 91 of men between the ages of 55 and 59 were employed at some time during the year see table 7 the employment rate among men in this age group declined steadily over the next

received by people 65 and older this was slight increase from 1975 the first year for which separate data on pension income are available from the cps when these four sources provided 95 of income received by people 65 and older wages and salaries today constitute greater proportion of the aggregate income of the elderly than at any time since the late 1970s and while this is due in part to

1990s interest rates and dividend yields have fallen and both the share of aggregate income received from these sources and the percentage of older individuals with income from assets have fallen since that time social security has for most of the past 35 years remained fairly stable share about 40 of the income of people 65 and older trends in pension income have been more complex trends in the percentage of people receiving pension income have differed between men and women the proportion of men 65 and older with pension income rose between 1980 and the early 1990s by that time almost half of men 65 and older received some pension income since about 1992 however the proportion of men receiving pension income has fallen to about 44 although the percentage of women 65 and older with pension income has continued to rise although very slowlywomen 65 and older are only half as likely as men to receive income from this source moreover womens pension income is on average only half that of male pension recipients the share of income the elderly receive from pensions has fallen since the early 1990s because the proportion of men with pension income has fallen and the rise in the proportion of women with pension income has been offset by the smaller amounts they typically receive because the proportion of the total workforce who participate in employersponsored pensions has remained stable at about half the workforce since the 1970s it is unlikely that the share of total income of the elderly received from pensions will rise substantially in the next 10 to 20 years few individuals age 65 and older do not receive any income between 1969 and 2004 the percentage of people 65 and older receiving income from at least one source increased from 90 to 97 18 among people who

provided third of the total income of the elderly both of these percentages declined sharply over the next decade and by 1980 the proportion of people 65 and older with earned income had fallen to 17 and earnings had fallen to 16 of the aggregate income of the elderly the proportion of americans age 65 and older with earnings has increased slightly in recent years rising from 16 in the early 1990s to 18 in 2004 as share of aggregate income however earnings have risen more substantially growing from 15 of the total income of the elderly in the mid1990s to 23 in 2004 see figure 4 the increase in the proportion of income from earnings is the result mainly of four factors 1 growth in real wages 2 increase d employment among people 65 and older 3 an increase in the percentage of working elderly who are employed fulltime and 4 drop in interest and dividend income that resulted from falling interest rates falling dividend yields and 18 the majority of individuals without income were women in 1969 16 of women and 1 of men r eceived income by 2004 the share of men who r eceived income had risen slightly to 2 and the share of women who received income had fallen to 4 19 the median lies at the middle of the income distribution half of the population have higher incomes and half have lower incomes mean income is generally higher than median income because relatively small percentage of people have very high incomes the median is therefore widely considered to be more accurate measure of average income

fell fewer people chose to hold such assets in 1969 interest dividends rent and royalties provided 20 of the aggregate income of people 65 and older this proportion steadily increased over the next two decades and peaked at 26 of total income in 1986 the share of the income of the elderly composed of income from assets has progressively fallen since 1986 and in 2004 only 12 of the income of

included in broad category of other income in 1975 22 of people 65 and older received income from pensions earned through job or jobs in either the public or private sectors or as the survivor of worker who was receiving pension the percentage of people 65 and older receiving income from pensions rose until the early 1990s peaking at 38 in 1992 the proportion of the elderly population receiving pension income has since fallen slightly in 2004 36 of people 65 and older received pension income21 in 1975 income from pensions made up 14 of the total income of people 65 and older this proportion increased over the next 15 years along with the percentage of older persons receiving income from pensions reaching peak of 22 in 1993 since then pension income has comprised roughly 20 of the total income of people 65 and older each year among people 65 and older who received pension income the mean annual amount in 2004 dollars rose from 8848 in 1975 to 13953 in 2004 an increase of 58 or 15 per year median pension income rose from 6081 in 1975 to 9600 in 2004 also increasing by 58 or 15 per year g25g142g149g143g138g155g142g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561 in the late 1960s and early 1970s about 10 of the elderly population in the united states received some form of cash welfare assistance from the federal or state governments the largest source of cash welfare assistance for people 65 and older is the supplemental security income ssi program which was authorized by congress in 1972 and began making payments to eligible lowincome aged and disabled persons in 1974 22 23 the proportion of the elderly population receiving cash welfare payments has steadily fallen since the mid1970s mainly because the proportion of people 65 and older who receive social security benefits has increased and the real value of social security benefits has risen due to the growth in real wages the maximum eligible income limit for ssi benefits in contrast grows at the annual rate of price inflation 24 as share of the aggregate income of people 65 and older cash welfare payments fell from 3 in 1969 to 1 in 1986 welfare income has been less than 1 of the total income of older americans for each of the past 20 years during the period from 1969 to 2004 the mean and median amounts of welfare income received by older individuals fluctuated within relatively narrow ranges measured in constant 2004 dollars mean welfare income ranged from low of 2818 in 1980 to high of 4426 in 2002 median welfare income reached low of 2261 in 1992 and high of 3629 in 2003 21 this category includes pensions from previous employers or unions and other retirement income excluding social security and veterans administration payments it includes company or union pensions and profit sharing plans annuities military retirement federal government pensions state or local government pensions railroad retirement payments from annuities or paidup insurance policies and payments from ira or keogh acc ounts 22 for more information on ssi see crs report 94486 supplemental security income ssi fact sheet by scott szymendera 23 this category includes only cash welfare payments it does not include the value of food stamps medical assistance rental subsidies heating assistance or other inkind transfers 24 in any given year the rate of price inflation may exceed the rate of growth of average wages but over long periods of time wages grow faster than prices because average wages grow at the average rate of inflation plus the rate of growth of labor productivity prices can grow faster than wages in the long run only if labor productivity fails to increase httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33387g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g155g146g140g138g151g156g561g3g144g142g561g348g347g561g138

income recorded on the cps include workers compensation unemployment compensation alimony child support and financial assistance from friends or relatives not living in the same household during the past 30 years the proportion of people 65 and older receiving any income from these sources has consistently remained in narrow range of 6 to 8 of the elderly population as share of the aggregate income of the elderly all of these sources combined have in each of the past 30 years accounted for just 2 to 3 of total income among people 65 and older who received income from one or more of these sources in 2004 the mean amount received was 8161 and the median amount was 4799 this compares to mean and median amounts received from these sources in 1975 of 4191 and 3118 respectively all amounts are in 2004 dollars g21g152g158g155g140g142g156g561g152g143g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g496g561g139g162g561g19g158g138g155g157g146g149g142g561 the sources of income received by people 65 and older whose incomes are at the lower end of the income distribution differ from the sources of income of people at the upper end of the income distribution this was true of income throughout the period from 1969 to 2004 in 1975 individuals 65 and older whose incomes in 2004 dollars exceeded 17784 were in the top 25 the top quartile among people in this age group on average they received 30 of their income from earnings 22 from social security 19 from pensions 27 from assets less than 1 from welfare and 2 from other sources that same year individuals whose incomes were less than 6424 in 2004 dollars were in the bottom quartile among individuals age 65 and older older individuals in the bottom income quartil received less than 1 of their income from earnings 80 from social security 1 from pensions 3 from assets 13 from welfare and 2 from other sources see figure 5 and figure 6 by 2004 the sources of income in the top and bottom quartiles of the income distribution had changed relatively little in the top quartilepeople 65 and older with 2004 income of 26600 or moreearnings and pension income each had increased as shares of total income while asset income had declined somewhat as percentage of total income in both 1975 and 2004 social security accounted for about 1 out of every 5 of income among people 65 and older with incomes in the top 25 of the income distribution in the bottom quartilepeople with 2004 income of less than 9260social security accounted for about 4 out of every 5 of income earnings accounted for only 1 of income in both 1975 and 2004 although pensions and asset income increased slightly in relative significance among people 65 and older in the bottom income quartile in 2004 both of these sources of income combined accounted for just 7 of their income cash welfare declined from 13 of the income received by persons in the bottom income quartile in 1975 to 5 in 2004 this was due both to the increase in the proportion of people 65 and older who received social security benefits and to growth in the real value of social security benefits in the bottom income quartile social security increased from 80 of total income in 1975 to 86 of total income in 2004 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33387g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g152g143g561g3g150g142g155g146g140g138g151g156g561g3g144g142g561g348g347g561g138

women are not equally likely to receive income from each of the four main income sources among individuals age 65 and older and the importance of each source of income has changed for both men and women over the past 35 years see figure 7 throughout this period men 65 and older were more likely than women to have income from wages and salaries income from assets and income from pensions in 1970 25 of men 65 and older had wage and salary income compared with 12 of women by 2004 just 18 of older men had wage and salary income whereas the proportion of women with wage and salary income had increased to 13 up until about 1980 men 65 and older also were more likely than women to receive income from social security since then however the percentage of both men and women 65 and older receiving social security has ranged between 88 and 92 the percentage of both men and women 65 and older receiving income from assets increased sharply through the 1970s and 1980s by 1990 72 of men and 68 of women had asset income by 2004 these figures had fallen to 59 of men and 53 of women although the percentage of both men and women receiving pension income including survivor benefits increased substantially between 1975 and 1990 the upward trend ceased in the early 1990s moreover throughout the 20 years from 1975 to 1995 men 65 and older were more than twice as likely as older women to have received retiredworker or survivor benefits from pension since 1995 the gap between the proportion of men and women receiving pension income has narrowed slightly but this has been due more to decline in the percentage of men receiving pensi on income rather than to an increase in the proportion of women with income from pensions older men and women also differ with respect to the amount of income that they receive from each source with men typically receiving larger amounts among men age 65 and older who had wage and salary income in 1970 the median amount in 2004 dollars was 8560 see table 13 among women age 65 and older who had wage and salary income in 1970 the median amount was 6163 by 2004 the median wage and salary income of men 65 and older had increased to 20800 143 increase that same year the median wage and salary income of women 65 and older was 12000 or 95 higher than in 1970 men also had higher median income from social security through the period from 1970 to 2004 but the rate of growth in the median benefit was slightly higher for women as more women became eligible for retired worker benefits that were larger than the spousal benefit they would have received had they not worked or had worked less men had higher pension income than women and the rate of growth of pension income was faster among men than women among men 65 and older who had pension income the median amount rose from 7096 in 1980 to 12000 in 2004 an increase of 69 25 median pension income among women 65 and older rose from 4347 in 1980 to 6141 in 2004 an increase of 41 men also had higher median income from assets although for both men and women the median income from this source wa s relatively small compared to income from earnings pensions and social security 25

describes income among all us households and also among elderly householdsdefined here as those in which either the householder 27 or householders spouse is 65 or olderand nonelderly households defined here as those in which neither the householder nor spouse is 65 or older median household income rose faster among households in which the householder or spouse was 65 or older than among households headed by younger persons during the period from 1969 through 2004 nevertheless in 2004 the median in come of households in which the householder or spouse was 65 or older 25210 was just half of the median income of households in which neither the householder nor spouse had reached age 65 50466 elderly households however tend to be smaller averaging 17 residents than nonelderly households with an average of 28 residents and they do not have all of the workrelated and childrearing expenses that many nonelderly households must pay when comparing the income of elderly households with the household income of the nonelderly population it is important to keep in mind that the households in which people 65 and older live tend to be smaller than the households of younger adults during the past 35 years average household size has shrunk among both elderly nd nonelderly households and while the decline 26 in 1969 166 of all us households were oneperson

spouse was 65 or oldergrew faster than the real income of younger households for example over the period from 1969 to 2004 the real median income of elderly households grew by 74 compared to 25 for nonelderly households since 1990 however the rates of income growth in elderly and nonelderly households have been much closer together each increasing by 10 to 11 over that period since 2000 however although the real income of nonelderly households has fallen by 42 the income of elderly households has fallen by just 14 in constant dollars the total increases in medi an household income among elderly and nonelderly households since 1969 have not differed greatly between 1969 and 2004 the real income of households in which neither the householder nor spouse was 65 or older grew by 10188 in 2004 dollars during the same period the real median income of elderly households grew by 10712 one reason the percentage change in household income has been greater in elderly households is simply that the income of these households was growing from much smaller base in 1969 the median income of elderly households expressed in 2004 dollars was just 14498 an increase of 1000 from this amount would represent percentage change of 7 whereas 1000 increase in the 1969 median income of nonelderly households 40278 in 2004 dollars would represent an increase of just 25 in percentage terms the increase in median income among elderly households since the late 1960s looks relatively large because their median household income wasand ismuch lower than the median household income of the

2 from 2000 through 2004 the steady growth in income among elderly households in the lowest quartile of the income distribution since the late 1960s is largely due to the fact that the great preponderance of their income comes from social security initial social security benefits are based on the real value of average lifetime wages and the benefit formula is designed to replace higher percentage of average lifetime earnings for low wage workers during the period from 1969 through 2004 the social security national average wage index grew from 5894 to 35649 an average rate of

coincided with dramatic decline in the proportion of older americans living in poverty in 1969 nearly quarter of americans 65 and older had family incomes below the federal poverty threshold and the poverty rate among the population 65 and older was more than double the poverty rate among adults 18 to 64 years old by the early 1990s the poverty rate among people 65 and older had fallen below the poverty rate among adults age 18 to 64 and it has remained lower since that time during the same period of time the ratio of the poverty threshold to the median income of the population has fallen as wage growth has outpaced the rate of inflation by which the poverty threshold is adjusted each year as consequence those who are officially poor have become progressively less welloff than households with income at the median nevertheless the substantial reduction in the proportion of older americans living in poverty must be regarded as one of the most important economic developments of the past 35 years without the decline in elderly poverty the economic burden of supporting those who can longer work in old age would weigh that much more heavily on their adult children and many millions of older americans would likely have to give up their own households to live with other relatives

source see h tt pwwwcensus govhhes wwwpoverty histpovh stpov3html the decline in the elderly poverty rate was due both to the growth of older americans incomes and also to the constant real value of the poverty threshold the growth in wages from year to year reflects both the rising general level of prices and gains in labor productivity because labor becomes more productive over timeas result of better education and training improved methods of production and distribut ion and new technologieswages rise faster than prices over the long run as noted above from 1969 through 2004 average wages in the united states grew by about 1 more per year than prices because both initial social security benefits and most pension benefits are based on measures of careera verage wages higher real wages have caused the average social security and pension benefits of each successive cohort of retirees to exceed those of earlier cohorts the rising real values of these sources of income have led to an increasing standard of living among older americans further retirees social security benefits are increased each year by costofliving adjustment that is equal to the rate of inflation this has kept the real value of social security benefits from eroding over time 30 the increase in average real income of the elderly population which is due mainly to the higher careeraverage earnings of each successive generation of retirees is not reflected in the federal poverty thresholds the poverty thresholds are intended to measure the income necessary to maintain minimally adequate standard of living and thus they are increased each year by the rate of inflation in other words the poverty thresholds measure the amount of income necessary to maintain constant standard of living not the amount of income needed to keep up with the rising average standard of living of the working population the federal poverty thresholds were developed by government economists in the 1960s to serve as standard for measuring income adequacy 31 the thresholds are adjusted annually by the rate 30 many publicsector pension plans make regular costofliving adjustments colas to retirees pensions most privatesector pensions do not pay annual colas 31 the poverty threshold has changed slightly over time for comprehensive history of the poverty threshold see continued

that the real inflationadjusted value remains constant over time because the real value of the poverty threshold has remained constant over time while the real income of the elderly has been rising the poverty threshold has fallen as percentage of median income for example in 1970 the poverty threshold 1861 for an individual 65 or older was equal to 89 of the median income 1959 of single people age 65 and older over the next 34 years the median income grew 666 while the poverty threshold only rose 387 thus the 2004 poverty threshold for single person age 65 and older 9060 was only 60 of the median income for an individual in that age group 15000 in the future other things being equal the disparity between rising real incomes and fixed real poverty threshold will lead to decreasing

paid labor force and to rely on pensions social security and personal savings to supply more of their income positive development since the 1960s has been that the rate of decline in median personal and household income measured in constant dollars that occurs as individuals reach their mid to late 60s appears to have slowed this has occurred despite the fact that smaller proportion of people over age 60 work today than was the case 35 years ago the longterm growth in real wagesand in the real value of social security and pension benefits that are based on these wageshas contributed greatly to the economic wellbeing of todays retirees in addition the growthrecently stalledin the proportion of older americans with income from pensions has helped more people maintain standard of living in retirement that is comparable to that which they enjoyed while working more americans 65 and older also receive asset income than did in the 1960s and 1970s but the amounts received as income from this source with median value of 817 in 2004 pale in comparis on to the amounts that most people 65 and older receive from earnings pensions and social security as was noted earlier in table 6 employment rates are lower among people 60 to 64 years old than among those under age 60 and they fall even further after age 65 among people 65 to 69 years old in 2004 for example just 33 were employed at any time during the year rates of fulltime employment also decline as workers age and among older americans who remain in the workforce after age 60 many work parttime in 2004 while 86 of people 55 to 59 years old worked fulltime this proportion fell to 78 among workers 60 to 64 years old and to 59 among those 65 to 69 years old as older workers reduce their hours of work and gradually withdraw from the labor force their earnings fall and they begin to rely to greater extent on income from pensions savings and after age 62 social security 33 earnings often from parttime 33 social security retired worker benefits are first available at age 62 workers who become disabled may be eligible for social security disability insurance at any age rates of disability are higher

cps allow us to see how the median incomes differ between people of different ages and how the median incomes of people in different age groups change as they age for example the top row of table 21 shows that individuals 55 to 59 years old had median income in 1969 of 23437 measured in 2004 dollars people who were 55 to 59 years old in1969 all were born between 1910 and 1914 demographers refer to people born in the same year or group of years as birth cohort following this same birth cohort forward five years to 1974 table 21 shows that individuals who were 60 to 64 years old that year had median income of 18562 or 4875 lower than the median income of this same birth cohort five years earlier five years later in 1979 people in the 19101914 birth cohort were 65 to 69 years old and these individuals had median income of 12039 or 11398 less than the median income of individuals in this birth cohort 10 years earlier following each of the pairs of diagonal arrows in this table allows one to see how median individual incomes of successive cohorts changed as they aged the most recent birth cohort for which income data are available over 10year period comprises people who were 55 to 59 in 1994 in constant dollars the median income of individuals in this birth cohort declined from 24068 in 1994 to 22321 in 1999 at age 6064 and to 18199 in 2004 at age 65 to 69 the third column of table 21 shows median incomes at age 60 to 64 and age 65 to 69 as percentage of the median income of the same birth cohort at age 55 to 59 for example the median income of individuals who were 60 to 64 years old in 1974 was 792 of the median income of this same cohort in 1969 when they were 55 to 59 years old their median income in 1979 at age 65 to 69 was 514 of their income in 1969 at age 55 to 59 looking at the most recent cohort for which income data are available for 10year period the reader can see that the median individual income of people who were 60 to 64 years old in 1999 was 927 of the median income of the same cohort in 1994 at age 55 to 59 in 2004 when the people in this cohort had reached age 65 to 69 their median income was 756 of the median income of people who were age 55 to 59 ten years earlier in 1994 table 22 shows the median household income in selected years of people in these same three age cohorts as table 21 55 to 59 60 to 64 and 65 to 69 here similar pattern is apparent with median household income falling as people age among those who were 55 to 59 in 1969 median household income was 39151 measured in 2004 dollars five years later in 1974 the median household income of this age group who were then 60 to 64 years old was 33789 or 5362 lower than the household income of this cohort in 1969 by 1979 at age 65 to 69 the median household income of this cohort was 25357 or 13794 lower than the median household income of this cohort 10 years earlier for the most recent 10year period median household income among those who were 55 to 59 in 1994 was 50400 in that year five years later in 1999 when they were 60 to 64 years old the median household income of this cohort was 48211 by 2004 at age 65 to 69 the median household income of this cohort was 37989 34 34 average household size declines as people age but the decline in the median household incomes shown in table 22 appears to be due mainly to the declining income of the pe ople in households rather than to decline in the number of people in the household when we looked at households of fixed sizes we still found that median household incomes continued

age 60 to 64 and age 65 to 69 as percentage of the median income of the same birth cohort at age 55 to 59 the median household income of people age 60 to 64 in 1974 was 863 of the median household income of this same cohort five years earlier when they were 55 to 59 years old by 1979 the median household income of people age 65 to 69 was 648 of the median household income of this same age cohort 10 years earlier when they were 55 to 59 years old for the most recent cohort for which ten years of income data are available the median household income of people who were 60 to 64 in 1994 was 957 of the median income of the same cohort five years earlier at age 55 to 59 by 2004 when they had reached age 65 to 69 the median household income of this cohort was 754 of the median income of the same cohort ten years earlier when they were 55 to 59 years old the data displayed in tables 21 and 22 show that real median incomes have risen at both the individual and household level among all three age groups since 1969 real median individual income was more variable than median household income but the trend was upward for both some of the increase in real median incomes in the three age categories was due to increased employment among older persons particularly women since the mid1990s employment among men 60 and older also has risen over time the ratio of median individual and household incomes at ages 65 to 69 to income at age 55 to 59 also has risen although the changes in the household income ratios were variable rather than increasing steadily although at the median the trend in incomes shown in tables 21 and 22 is positive it is important to keep in mind that by definition half of all individuals and households have incomes less than their respective medians for some people their income in old age may be less than the amount needed to maintain their desired standard of living many financial analysts recommend that workers aim for an income replacement rate of 70 or more in their first year of retirement if they want to maintain the standard of living they enjoyed while working 35 the median household income of people who were 65 to 69 years old in 2004 was 75 of the household income of people in this age cohort 10 years earlier when they were 55 to 59 years old thus household that was at exactly the median income for its birth cohort in both 1994 and 2004 and that had retired in the interim would probably find itself ab to maintain standard of living in retirement that was comparable to the lifestyle they had enjoyed while working those whose income from pensions savings and social security do not reach this thresholdwhose income in retirement falls below 70 of their preretirement incomemay have to make difficult adjustments in order to keep their spending in retirement within their more limited incomes for most individuals the most direct way to boost the income they will have in retirement both in absolute terms and relative to preretirement income would be to increase the percentage of earnings that they save in employersponsored retirement plans individual retirement accounts or other savings plans continued fell between ages 55 to 59 and 65 to 69 for example the median household income in 1979 of persons 65 to 69 years old who lived in twoperson households was 73 of the median household income in 1969 of persons 55 to 59 years old who lived in twoperson households the equivalent ratio for oneperson households was 67 likewise the median household income in 2004 of persons 65 to 69 years old in twoperson households was 81 of the median household income in 1994 of persons 55 to 59 years old in twoperson households the equivalent ratio for oneperson households was 76 35 the ratios in table 22 are not true replacement rates which measure income in the first year or or n years of retirement to income in the last year or n years of employment the ratios in the tables are based on the median income of everyone in each age cohort whether working fulltime parttime or fully retired nevertheless they demonstrate the effect on the median income of each c ohort of the gradual retirement of the members of

increases in real wages and also to public policies that have contributed to improving pension security and encouraged retirement saving perhaps the single greatest contributor to the improved economic situation of the elderly in the united states has been the growth in real wages that they experienced during their working lives in real terms measured in 2004 dollars the median annual earnings of workers between the ages of 18 and 64 rose from 21777 in 1969 to 28251 in 2004 among households in which neither the householder nor spouse was 65 or older real median income rose from 40278 in 1969 to 50446 in 2004 growth in real wagesand in the social security and pensions based on these wageshas contributed greatly to the economic wellbeing of todays retirees actions taken by congress over the past 35 years also have affected the incomes of older americans in 1974 congress passed the employee retirement income security act erisa which set funding standards and vesting requirements for pension plans sponsored by employers in the private sector this law also authorized individual retirement accounts iras which encourage workers to save for retirement by deferring income taxes on some contributions and on investment earnings in the revenue act of 1978 congress added section 401k to the internal revenue code which authorized employers to establish retirement savings plans for employees in which contributions and investment earnings grow on taxdeferred basis until retirement legislation affecting social security has also contributed to increasing the income of older americans the social security amendments of 1972 provided for automatic costofliving adjustments colas which prevent the real value of social security benefits from being eroded by inflation the 1977 social security amendments established the current benefit formula in which initial benefits are based on each workers careeraverage wages indexed to current values based on national average wage index this assures that each successive cohort of workers receives social security benefit that reflects the growth in real wages that occurred during their working lives in 2000 congress repealed the earnings test for workers who have reached the social security full retirement age this test reduces benefits for social security beneficiaries whose earnings exceed threshold set in law the earnings test now applies only to beneficiaries under the full retirement age as the 78 million members of the baby boompeople born between 1946 and 1964approach retirement congress is likely to continue to debate changes to the federal laws affecting pensions retirement savings and social security future retirees are likely to live longer and will need to accumulate relatively greater retirement assets than past retirees if they are to maintain their standard of living through these longer periods of retirement with social security facing financial shortfall and the number of privatesector pensions continuing to decline it is likely that relatively greater share of current workers future retirement income will have to be financed from their own personal savings
