substance the watchdogs mean t to protect public investors independent auditors boards of directors wall street analysts and regulators were not an effective bar to corporate management bent on artificial inflation of financial results the costs of the accounting scandals ve been high firms have gone into bankruptcy thousands of workers have lost their jobs and retirement savings and

the sarbanesoxley act pl 107204 sweep ing reform of accounting regulation the 108th congress is unlikely to consider legislation as farreaching as sarbanes oxley but several issues related to accoun ting reform remain these include questions of accounting for stock options and financial derivatives contracts the possibility of replacing our current rulesbased accounting system with principlesbased system and oversight of the implementation of the acc ounting reforms mandated by the sarbanes oxley act sarbanesoxley act implementation congresss intent in passing sarbanesoxley was to restore confidence in financial markets by increasing corporate accountability enhancing public disclo sures of financial information and strengthening corporate gove rnance more severe criminal penalties for securities fraud were also enacted the securities and exchange commission sec has adopted more than dozen final rules to imple ment the acts provisions these rules raise standards of accountability for corporate ex ecutives boards of directors independent auditors and corporate attorneys the most difficult phase of implementation has been the launching of the public company accounting oversight board pcaob created by sarbanesoxley the pcaobs mission is to regulate the auditors of publicly traded companies and to ensure that corporate financial statements are subj ect to tough outside scrutiny and that the auditorclient relationship is free from commercial conflicts of interest the first nominee for pcaob chairman withdrew after it became known that he d served as director of company under sec investigation for securitie s fraud this incident also led to the resignation of sec chairman harvey pitt the second choice to head the pcaob william mcdonough was former president of the federal reserve bank of new york and was widely respected in the markets he took office on june 11 2003 and under his leadership the pcaob has gotten up and runni ng without further controversy or mishap it remains to be seen whether the pcaob will become the effective regulator that congress intended accounting for stock options accounting for stock options is long standing controversy under current accounting rules stock options granted to executives and employees are generally not counted as cost to the company unlike other forms of compensation for more on options accounting see crs report rs21392 stock options the accounting issue and its consequences by bob lyke and gary shorter gr ants of options must be disclosed in footnotes to financial statements but do not affect the bottom line companies are thus able to issue options without reducing thei r reported profits mo st accountants believe that options should be expensed or charge d against earnings as matter of principle and consistency however an argument in favor of the status quo is that options enable cashpoor startup companies to attract and retain skilled employees and managers they could not afford otherwise in this view compensation via options fosters growth and innovation and if options were counted as cost and reported prof its reduced hightech and other growing firms would have less

generally defers to fasb fasb standards are recognized as official by the sec and are therefore mandatory for companies that sell stock or bonds to the public and must file periodic financial reports with the sec 3 many stock options can be exercised only at stock price above the current market price at the time the option is issued the point is to create an incentive executives options become valuable only if the market price of the stock ri ses to the options exercise price which is good for all shareholders but if the assumption is zero volatility that the share price will never continuedof capital the change in accounting methods in this view even though it would not require one dollar of additiona l cash expenditure by companies that issue options would have real and undesirable economic consequences the postenron scandals have sharpened the dispute critics of current accounting rules now argue that some companies have been too generous with options and that executives with huge personal stakes in the companys share price have strong incentives to practice deceptive accounting to conceal ba d news from the market alan greenspan in 2002 congre ssional testimony noted that grants of options designed to align managements interests with those of the sh areholders perversely created incentives to artificially inflate reported earni ngs in order to keep stock prices high and rising the incentives they created overcame the good j udgment of too many corporate managers1 in april 2003 the financial ccounting standards board fasb2 proposed requiring the expensing of options and bega n its normal process of public comment and deliberation fasb appeared to be on course to adopt fina l standard by the end of 2004 but congressional action may result in delay hr 3574 which passed the house on july 20 2004 by vote of 312111 would prevent fasb from adopting an options accounting standard in 2004 the major provisions of the bill include the following section 2 requires companies that report to the sec to record as an expense the fair value of options issued to the ceo and the four other most highlypaid individuals in the company under current sec rules total compensation including stock and options for these five individuals must be disclosed in the annual proxy statement options granted to other executives and empl oyees could continue to be treated under current accounting rules that is disclosed in the footnotes with effect on the bottom line section 2 also provides that in deter mining the fair value of an option to be expensed the company shall assume that the volatility of the underlying stock is zero this pr ovision would result in many options having value of zero and thus th bottom line impact of many expensed options would also be zero3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21530crs4 3 continued move those options will never come into the money and their accounting value will always be zerosection 2 would however permit companies to treat options as an expense voluntarily as many have be gun to do since the enron scandal section 3 prohibits the sec from recognizing any fasb standard relating to the expensing of options until an economic impact study had been completed by the department s of commerce and labor the study would be due one year from enactment of the bill section 4 requires the sec to adopt rules mandating that companies financial statements include more extensive and transparent discussions of the extent and economic impact of their option plans other legislation before the 108th congress would affect the tax treatment of certain stock options section 342 of hr 2 as amended and passed by the senate on may 15 2003 would have imposed an excise tax on stockbased compensa tion including stock options received by executives involved in certain corporate inve rsion transactions where companies move their corporate domicile to foreign tax haven such as bermuda to reduce their us taxes this provision was not included in the bill as enacted but similar tax provisions appear in hr 4520 passed the house on june 17 2004 and s 1637 passed the sena on may 11 2004 derivatives accounting and disclosure financial derivatives are in struments without an intrin sic claim on any corporate or financial asset instead their value is linked to the price of some ot her asset or financial indicator an interest rate stock index or commodity pri ce some derivatives markets such as the futures exchanges are regulate d others the overt hecounter market are not enron was major dealer in unregulat ed derivatives and although that companys worst problems lay elsewhere some now belie ve that unregulated derivatives should be subject to disclosure and repor ting requirements in order to give regulators new tools to prevent or respond to episodes of financial instability or ttempts to manipulate market prices derivatives affect accounting statements because they must be assigned fair value at the end of each accounting period and changes in fair value reported as income many overthecounter derivatives are comp lex contracts for which trading market exists fair values are calculated according to firms own valuati on models which critics believe are susceptible to manipulation by tr aders whose pay is of ten linked to portfolio gains or losses and by companies seeking to manage their reported earnings since the enron failure several energy derivatives dealers have admitted to making wash trades which lack economic substan ce but give the appearance of greater market volume than actually exists and facilitate d eceptive accounting if the fictitious trades are reported as real revenue in 2002 energy rivatives trading diminished to fraction ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21530crs5 preenron levels as major trad ers and their customers and shareholders reevaluated the risks and utility of unregulated energy trading several major dealers have withdrawn from the market entirely internal enron memoranda released in may 2002 suggest that enron and other market participants engaged in variety of manipulative trading practices during the california electricity crisis for example enron was able to buy electricity at fixed price in california and sell it elsewhere at the higher market price exacerbating electricity shortages within california the evidence to date does not indicate that energy derivatives as opposed to physical spotmarke t trades played major role in these manipulative strategies numerous firms and individuals have been charged with civil and criminal violations related to the manipul ation of energy prices in california and elsewhere even if derivatives trading was not major cause enrons failure raises the issue of supervision of unregulated deri vatives markets would it be useful if regulators had more information about the portfolios and risk ex posures of major dealers in derivatives although enrons bankruptcy appears to ve had little impact on energy supplies and prices similar dealer failure in the future might damage the dealers trading partners and its lenders and could conceivabl set off widespread disrupti ons in financial andor real commodity markets legislation considered during the 108th congress would have given among other things the commodity futures trading commission cftc more authority to pursue fraud including wash transactions in the otc market and to require disclosure of certain trade data by dealers in energy derivatives in 2003 the senate twice rejected legislation samdt 876 and samdt 2083 that would have increased regulatory oversight of energy derivatives markets by the cftc and ferc principlesbased accounting the recent corporate scandals revealed two kinds of problems with our accounting system one was that companies and sometimes their auditors ignored the rules the other was that the rules themselves are so complex that even when they are followed to the letter investors may not get clear pict ure of firms financial condition enron created numerous offthebooks affiliates and part nerships and entered into complex transactions with them these transactions were not in all cases violations of generally accepted accounting practices gaap but th ey did make enron s financial reports impenetrable to outsiders the sarbanesoxley act called for more st ringent enforcement of current rules but also called for an sec study of an alternative accounting system called principlesbased accounting the basic idea is that system based on few basic principles requiring accountants to produce true and fair pict ure of the economic r eality of companys finances could be more effective than detailed sets of rules which invite search for loopholes fasbs chairman robert herz s endorsed the concept of principlesbased accounting noting that under the current ruleb ased system people see the trees and not the forest some fear that reduction of complex rules to few principles could lead to confusion over what is legal and result in selective enforcement but at this point we canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21530crs6 only guess what principlesbased accounting system in the united states would look like the sec staff study appeared in july 2003 its general tenor was that principles based accounting held promise in the long rm but the sec has not made fundamental transformation of accounting in to shortterm priority
