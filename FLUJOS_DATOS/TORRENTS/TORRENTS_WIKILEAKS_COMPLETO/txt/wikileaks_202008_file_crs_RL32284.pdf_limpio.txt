projectbased section 8 pr ogram vouchers are portable subsidies that lowincome families can use to lower their rents in the private market vouchers are administered at the local level by quasigovernmental pub lic housing authorities phas projectbased section 8 is form of rental subsidy that is attached to unit of privately owned housing lowincome families who move into the housing pay reduced rent on the basis of their incomes the section 8 program began in 1974 pr imarily as projectbased rental assistance program however by th mid1980s projectbas ed assistance came under criticism for seeming too costly nd concentrating poor families in high poverty areas congress stopped providing ne w projectbased sec tion 8 contracts in 1983 in their place congress created vouchers as new form of assistance today vouchers numbering more than 2 million are the primary form of assistance provided under section 8 although over 1 million units still receive projectbased assistance under their original contract s or renewals of those contracts congressional interest in the section 8 program has increased in recent years particularly as the program costs have ra pidly grown led by cost

1437f s ection 8 projectbased rental assistance and tenantbased vouchers have become the largest co mponent of the department of housing and urban deve lopments hud budget with appropriations of more than 22 billion in fy2008 the rising cost of providing rental assistance is due in varying degrees to expansions in the progra m the cost of renewing expiring long term contracts and rising costs in hous ing markets across the country the most rapid cost increases have been seen in the voucher program partly out of concern about cost incr eases and partly in response to the administrative complexity of the current program the administration has called for reform of the voucher program and its f unding each year since 2002 in response congress has enacted changes to the way that it funds the voucher program and the way that phas receive their funding c ongress has not enacted the program reforms advocated by the administration alt hough it has considered its own reform proposals in order to understand why the progra m has become so expensive and why reforms are being considered it is first im portant to understand the mechanics of the program and its history this paper will provide an overview of the section 8 program and its history for more information see crs report rl33929 recent changes to the section 8 vouc her renewal funding formula crs report rl34002 section 8 housing choice voucher program issues and reform proposals in th 110th c ongress and crs congressional distribution memorandum factors behind cost increases in the section 8 housing choice voucher program fy2000fy2004 all by maggie mccarty background information from 1937 until 1965 public housing and the subsidized mortgage insurance programs of the federal housing adminis tration fha were the countrys main forms of federal housing assistance as problems with the public housing and other bricks and mortar federal housing construction programs such as section 235 and section 236 of the national housing act ar ose particularly their high cost interest grew in alternative forms of housing assistance in 1965 new approach was adopted pl 89117 the section 23 program assisted lowincome familieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32284crs2 1 phas are statechartered quasigovernmenta l bodies that administer public housing and section 8 vouchers 2 hud uses rela tive measure of income for determinin g benefits and eligibility for section 8 lowincome families have adjusted gross incomes at or below 80 of the local area median income very lowincome families ve adjusted gross incomes at or below 50 of the local area median income and extremel lowincome families have adjusted gross incomes at or below 30 of the local area median incomeresiding in leased housing by permitting public housing authority pha1 to lease existing housing units in the private market and sublease them to lowincome and very lowincome families2 at belowmarket rents however the section 23 program did not ameliorate the growing problem s with huds housing c onstruction programs and interest remained in veloping and testing new pproaches the experimental housing allowance program is one exampl of such an alternative approach table 1 the experimental housing allowance program the experimental housing allowance program ehap began with mandate to hud from congress in 1970 to test the impacts and feasib ility of providing lowincome families with allowances to assist them in obtaining existing decent rental housing of their choice pl 91152 congress was interested specifically in finding the answers to several key questions how many families would make use of allowance payments what kind of housing would they choose and in what neighborhoods how would housing markets respond to the increased demand for housing at what cost could housing allowance program be administered in order to answer these questions hud contracted for the conduct of three experiments the demand experiment to test how families would respond to housing allowance the supply experiment to test how markets would respond to subsidies and the administrative agency experiment to test the administrative capacity and funds required to administer housing allowance program the first reports came out in 1973 and final report was issued in 1980 the ehaps key findings are listed below in order to ensure housing quality subsidies have to be tied to housing standards however stricter housing standards limit participation participation is also linked to subsidy amount as the subsidy increases so does participation mobility and location of residence are mainly governed by ties to relativesneighbors and friends and are not affected by housing allowance payments housing allowance program has virtually effect on the price of housingand does not stimulate new construction or major rehabilitation however it does help preserve the existing housing stock by stimulating repairs housing allowance program can be effec tively administered at the local level the early findings of ehap helped to set the tone for the debate that created the section 8 program raymond struyk policy questions and experimental responses in housing vouchers for the poor lessons from national experiment edited by raymond struyk and marc bendick jr washington urban institute press 1981httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32284crs3 due to criticisms about cost profiteerin g and slumlord practices in federal housing programs president nixon declared moratorium on all existing federal housing programs including section 23 in 1973 during the moratorium hud revised the section 23 program and sought to make it the main assisted housing program of the federal government however at the same time congress was considering several options fo r restructuring subsidized housing programs after all the debates and discussions that typically precede the passage of authorizing legislation were complete d congress voted in favor of new leased housing approach and the secti on 8 program was created early section 8 the section 8 program is named for sec tion 8 of the united states housing act of 1937 the original program blished by the housing and community development act of 1974 pl 93383 consisted of thr ee parts new construction substantial rehabilitation nd existing housing certificates the 1974 act and the creation of section 8 effec tively ended the nixon moratorium in 1978 the moderate rehabilitation component of th program was added but it has not been funded since 1989 in 1983 the new construction and subs tantial rehabilitati on portions of the program were repealed and new com ponent section 8 vouc hers was added in 1998 existing housing certificates were rged with and converted to vouchers new construction and substantial rehabilitation under the new construction and substa ntial rehabilitation components of the early section 8 program hud entered into longterm 20 or 40year contracts with private forprofit nonprofit or public orga nizations that were willing to construct new units or rehabilitate ol der ones to house low and very lowincome tenants under those contracts hud agreed to ma ke assistance payments toward each unit for the duration of the contract those assistance payments were subsidies that allowed tenants residing in the units to pay 25 later raised to 30 of their adjusted income as rent the program was responsible for the construction and rehabilitation of large number of units over 12 million units of housing with section 8 contracts that originated unde r the new constructi on and substantial rehabilitation program still receive payments today by the early 1980s because of the rising costs of rent and construction the amount of budget authority needed for the section 8 rental assistance program had been steadily increasing while the number of units produced in year had been decreasing at the same time studies emerged showing that providing subsidies for use in newly constructed or substantially re habilitated housing wa s more expensive than the cost of providing subsidies in existing units of housing also because contracts were written for such long terms appropriators had to provide large amounts of budget authority each time they funded new contract see below for an illustration of the implication of longterm contracts as the budget deficit grew members of congress became concerned with the high costs associated with section 8 new construction and substa ntial rehabilitation and these segments of the sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32284crs4 8 program were repealed in the housin g and urbanrural r ecovery act of 1983 pl 98181 table 2 what do long term contracts mean for congress the following example illustrates how congress appropriates funds for longterm contracts compared to oneyear contracts in 2003 housing subsidy cost an average of 6000 per year if congress wanted to fund 10 new section 8 subsidies in 2003 the cost of doing so would depend on the length of the contract congress decided to fund if the contract was 40year contract as was the case in the beginning of the section 8 program then congress must appropriate 10 vouchers x 6000 x 40 years 24 million if the contract was oneyear contract as is the case with section 8 contracts today then congress must appropriate 10 vouchers x 6000 x 1 year 60000 thus it would have cost congress less in 2003 to provide one year contracts than it would have to provide multiyear contracts the tradeoff is the cost in subsequent years for example assume that congress intends to maintain those 10 subsidies in 2004 if congress funded those subsidies under 40year contracts in 2003 then the subsidies would not require new funding again until 2043 meaning congress would not have to provide appropriations in 2004 however if congress funded those subsidies under oneyear contracts in 2003 then the subsidies would require another years worth of funds in 2004 note this example does not include an estimate for inflation when funding multiyear contracts congress generally includes an estimate of inflation and adds it to the total cost moderate rehabilitation the housing and community development amendments of 1978 pl 95557 added th moderate rehab ilitation component to the section 8 program which expanded sec tion 8 rental assistance to projects that were in need of repairs costing at l east 1000 per unit to make the housing decent safe and sanitary over the next 10 year s however this component of the program was fraught with allegations of abuse the process of awarding contracts was considered unfair and politicized calls for reform of the moderate rehabilitation program led to its suspension it has not been funded since 1989 existing housing certificates the existing housing certificate compone nt of the section 8 program was created in the beginning of the secti on 8 program and tinued until 1998 under the existing housing certificate program p has and hud would enter into an annual contributions contract acc for the number of units that would be available to receive assistance contracts were or iginally written for five years and were renewable at huds discretion for up to 15 years in the contract hud agreed to pay the difference between the tenants rental payment and the contract rent of unit the contract rent was gene rally limited to the hudset fair market rent fmr for the areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32284crs5 3 housing quality standards hqs are mini mum standards set by hud that t acceptable conditions for interior living space building exterior heating and plumbing systems and general health and safetytable 3 what is fair market rent fmr fmrs are gross rent estimates that include both shelter rent paid by the tenant to the landlord and the cost of tenantpaid utilities except telephones each year hud sets fmrs either at the 40th percentile rent or at the 50th percentile rent for each metropolitan or nonmetropolitan statistical area in the nation as well as for each state for most areas the fmr is set at the 40th percentile rent paid by recent movers which means that 40 of all standard qua lity rental housing units rented within the past 18 months have rents at or below the fmr for some high cost areas the fmr is set at the 50th percentile rent or the median rent so that 50 of standard units fall at or below the fmr in some lowcost communities the fmr is raised to the statewide fmr if it is higher after entering into contract with hud phas would advertise the availability of certificates for lowincome tenants the existing housing certificate program was primarily tenantbased meaning that the assistance was attached to the tenant families selected to receive assistance were given certifi cates as proof of eligibility for the program with their certificates fa milies could look for suitable housing in the private market housing was considered suitable if it rented for the fmr or less and met housing quality standards hqs3 once the household found unit they signed lease and agreed to pay 30 of their adjusted income for rent the remainder of the rent was paid by hud to th landlord on behalf of the tenant if family vacated unit in violation of the l ease hud had to make rental payments to the landlord for the remainder of the m onth in which the family vacated and pay 80 of the contract rent for an additional month if the family left the unit at the end of their lease they could take their certificate with them and use it for their next home hud also paid the pha an administra tive fee for managing the program the amount of this administrative fee was set by congress in appropr iations legislation each year phas were permitted to use up to 15 of their section 8 certificates for projectbased housing in projectbased section 8 exis ting housing the subsidy was attached to the unit which was selected by the pha and not to the tenant this meant that when tenant vacated unit another eligible tenant would be able to occupy it and hud would subsidize the rent as long as contract was in effect between the pha and the owner in 1998 the quality housing and work opportunity reconciliation act qhwra pl 105276 merged the secti on 8 existing housing certificate program with the voucher program see below and converted all certifi cates to vouchers effectively ending the section 8 existing housing certificate program the voucher program the largest component of todays section 8 program the voucher program was first au thorized by the housing and urbanrural recovery act of 1983 pl 98181 it was originally demons tration program but was made permanent in 1988 like th section 8 existing housing certificate program the voucher program is administere d by phas and is tenantbased with ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32284crs6 projectbased component however unde r the voucher program families can pay more of their incomes toward rent and lease apartments with rents higher than fmr todays section 8 program todays section 8 program is really two programs which combined serve almost 35 million households section 8 projectbased rental assistance the first program under section 8 can be characterized as section 8 project based rental assistance this prog ram includes units created under the new construction substantial re habilitation and m oderate rehabilita tion components of the earlier section 8 program that are s till under contract with hud although new construction subs tantial rehabilitati on or moderate rehab ilitation contracts have been created for number of years bout 13 million of these units are still funded under multiyear contracts that have not ye t expired and do not require any new appropriations or multiyear contracts that had expire d and are renewed annually requiring new appropriations families that live in section 8 projectbased units pay 30 of their incomes toward rent in order to be eligible families must be lowincome however at least 40 of all units must be available for very lowincome families if family leaves the unit the owner will continue to receive payments as long as he or she can move another eligible family into the unit owners of properties with projectbased section 8 rental assistance receive subsidy from hud called housing assistance payment hap hap payments are equal to the difference between the tenants payments 30 of income and contract rent which is agreed to between hud and the landlord contract rents are meant to be comparable to rents in the local market and are typically adjusted annually by an inflation factor establis hed by hud or on the basis of the projects operating costs projectbased section 8 contracts are managed by contract administrators while some hud regi onal offices still serve as contract administrators the departments goal is to contract the function out entirely to outside entities including state housing fi nance agencies phas or private entities when projectbased hap c ontracts expire the landlord can choose to either renew the contract with hud for up to fi ve years at time subject to annual appropriations or convert the units to ma rket rate in some cases landlords can choose to optout of secti on 8 contracts early when an owners terminates an hap contract with hud either through optout or expiration the tenants in the building are provided with enhanced vouc hers designed to allow them to stay in their unit see discussion of enhanced vouc hers below in 2008

the housing choice voucher program the voucher program is funded in huds budget through the tenantbased rental assist ance account the federal gove rnment currently funds more than 2 million section 8 housing choice vouchers phas administer the program and receive an annual budget from hud ach has fixed number of vouchers that they are permitted to administered and they are paid administrative fees vouchers are tenantbased in nature meaning that the subsidy is tied to the family rather than to unit of housing in order to be eligible family must be very lowincome 50 or below area median income

contribution is in effect only for the first year after the first year if rent increases and the family wishes to continue to live in th unit then the family can choose to contribute more than 40 of its income toward rentfamilies who receive vouchers use them to subsidize their rents in private market apartments once an eligible fa mily receives an available voucher the family must find an eligible unit in order to be eligible unit must meet minimum housing quality standards hqs and cost less than 40 of the familys income6 plus the hap paid by the pha the hap paid by th pha for tenantbased vouchers like the hap paid for section 8 projectbased rental assistance is capped however with tenantbased vouchers phas have the flexibility to set their caps anywhere between 90 and 110 of fmr up to 120 fmr w ith prior hud approval the cap set by the pha is called the payment standard once family finds an eligible unit the family signs contract with hud and bot h hud and the family sign contracts with the landlord the pha will pay the hap the payment standard minus 30 of the familys income and the family will pay the difference between the hap and the rent which must total between 30 and 40 of the familys income after the first year family can choose to pay more than 40 of their income towards rent phas may also choose to adopt minimum rents which cannot exceed 50 see box below for an example table 5 how is voucher subsidy calculated first pha sets payment standard payment standard is maximum subsidy level that is equal to anywhere between 90 and 110 of fair market rent fmr then pha calculates maximum housing assistance payment hap hap is the amount that the pha will pay the landlord and it is equal to the greater of the re nt for an apartment or the payment standard minus 30 of familys income the family can then go out to the rental market and find an apartment in order to be approved that apartment cannot rent for more than the maximum hap plus 40 of familys income if the rent for the unit is less than the hap plus 30 of households income the household must still pay 30 of their income toward rent but the hap will be reduced for example consider family who earns 900 per month and lives in community with an fmr of 800 per month for the appropriate size apartment if their pha has payment standard of 110 of fmr then the maximum hap family can receive is 610 per month 800 110 900 30 the family can therefore shop for an apartment with rent of up to 970 per month 610 900 40 if the family finds an apartment for 970 per month the pha will pay the maximum hap 610 and the family will pay 40 of their income per month 360 if the family finds an apartment for less than the payment standard say 750 per month the family will pay 30 of their income toward rent and the pha will pay the difference between the rent and 30 of the familys income in this case the family will pay 270 900 30 and the pha will pay 480 750 900 30 once family is using voucher the fa mily can retain the voucher as long as the pha has adequate funding for it and the family complies with pha and program requirements if family wants to move the tenantbased voucher can move with the family once the family moves to new area the two phas the pha thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32284crs9 7 the feature of voucher that permits family to move from one jurisdiction to another while retaining their assistance is referred to as portability the administration of portability has proven to be complicated for phas in so cases the originating pha is billed for the cost of the familys voucher by the receiving pha in other cases the receiving pha transitions the new family onto one if its vouc hers and the original voucher reverts to the originating pha

fss program was established by congress as part of the national affordable housing act of 1990 pl 101625 the purpose of th program is to promote coordination between the voucher program and other pr ivate and public resources to enable families on public assistance to achieve ec onomic selfsufficiency families who participate in the program sign fiveyear contracts in which they agree to work toward leaving public assistance while in the program families can increase their incomes without increasing the amount they contribute toward rent the difference between what the family paid in rent

onstration directed hud to select up to 30 phas to participate the goals were to reduce federal costs provide work incentives to families and expand housing choice mtw allows participating phas greater flexibility in determining how to use federal section 8 voucher and public housing f unds by allowing them to blend funding sources and experiment with rent rules with the constraint that they had to continue to serve approximately the same num ber of households it also permits them to seek exemption from most public housing nd housing choice voucher program rules an evaluation for mtw

milies with combined fy2008 budget of more than 22 billion they reflect major commitment of federal resources that commitment has led to some successes more than 3 million families are able to obtain safe and decent housing through the program at cost to the family that is considered affordable however these successes come at high cost to the federal government given current budget deficit levels congre ss has begun to reevaluate whether the cost of the section 8 prog rams particularly the vouche r program are worth their benefits proposals to reform the prog ram abound and whether the current section 8 programs are maintained largely in their current form changed substantially or eliminated altogether are questions currently facing congress
