internationally understood that the united states is an exporter of terrorism contrary to common belief the american export of terrorism or terrorists is not recent phenomenon nor has it been associated only with islamic radicals or people of middle eastern african or south asian ethnic origin this dynamic belies the american belief that our free open and integrated multicultural society lessens the allure of radicalism and terrorism for us citizens the report looks at number cases of us exported terrorism including attacks by us based or ﬁnanced jewish muslim and irishnationalism terrorists it concludes that foreign perceptions of the us as an exporter of terrorism together with us double standards in international law may lead to noncooperation in renditions including the arrest of cia oﬃcers and the decision to not share terrorism related intelligence with the united states wikileaksorgsecretnoforn secretnoforn cia red cell red cell special memorandum 5 february 2010 what if foreigners see the unit ed states as an exporter of terrorism snf much attention has been paid recently to the increasing occurrence of americangrown islamic terrorists conducting attacks against us targets primarily in the homeland less attention has been paid to homegrown terrorism not exclusively muslim terrorists exported overseas to target non us persons this report examines the implications of what it would mean for the us to be seen increasingly as an incubator and exporter of terrorism snf contrary to common belief the american export of terrorism or terrorists is not recent phenomenon nor has it been associated only with islamic radicals or people of middle eastern african or south asian ethnic origin this dynamic belies the american belief that our free open and integrated multicultural society lessens the allu re of radicalism and terrorism for us citizens late last year five young mu slim american men traveled from northern virginia to pakistan allegedly to join th pakistani taliban and to enga ge in jihad their relatives contacted the fbi after they disappeared without telling anyone and then pakistani authorities arrested them as they allegedly attempted to gain access to alqaida training facilities in november 2008 pakistaniamerican david headley conduc ted surveillance in support of the lashkaritayyiba lt attack in mumbai india that killed more than 160 people lt induced him to change his name from daood gilani to david headley to facilitate his movement between the us pakistan and india some american jews have supported and even engaged in violent acts against perceived enemies of israel in 1994 baruch goldstein an american jewish doctor from new york emigrated to israel joined the extremist group kach and killed 29 palestinians during their prayers in the mosque at the tomb of the patriarchs in hebron which helped to trigger wave of bus bombings by hamas in early 1995 some irishamericans have long provided financial and material support for violent efforts to compel the united kingdom to reli nquish control of northern ireland in the 1880s irishamerican members of clan na gael dynamited britains scotland yard parliament and the tower of london and detonated bombs at several stations in the london undergroundin the twentieth century irishamericans provided most of the financial support sent to the irish re publican army ira the usbased irish northern aid committee noraid founded in the late 1960s provided the provisional irish republican army pira with money that was frequently used for arms purchases only after repeated highl evel british requests and then londons support for our bombing of libya in the 19 80s did the us government crack down on irishamerican support for the ira snf this memo was prepared by the cia red cell which has been charged by the director of intelligence with taking pronounced utofthebox approach that will provoke thought and offer an alternative

on 20350204 drv frm for s06 secretnoforn secretnoforn american freedoms facilitate terrorist recruitment and operations snf primarily we have been concerned about alqaida infiltrating operatives into the united states to conduct terrorist attacks but aq may be increasingly looking for americans to operate overseas undoubtedly alqaida and other terrorist groups recognize that americans can be great assets in terrorist operations overseas because they carry us passports dont fit the typical arabmuslim profile and can easily communicate with radical leaders through their unfettered access to the internet and other modes of communication terrorist groups such as alqaida have rely noticed the ease with which headley was able to travel multiple times on us visa between the us pakistan and india without arousing suspicion from officials alqaida and other extremist groups have also probably noticed that the us government has been more concerned with preventing attacks on the us by homegrown terrorists or foreigners than wi th americans going overseas to carry out attacks in other countries most foreign governments do not suspect that american citizens would plot or perpetrate attacks against their citizens within their borders foreign terrorists have recruited homegrown us extremists for attacks abroad and are likely to increase the use of this method because so far it has slipped below the radar of the governments of the us and other countries the ubiquity of internet services around the world and the widespread use of english on popular websites such as youtube fa cebook myspace twitter and various blogs enable radical clerics and terrorist recruiters to bypass americas physical borders and influence us citizens for example selfproclaimed recruiter for the pakistani taliban reportedly contacted the five men in northern virginian via youtube and then exchanged coded emails with th group terrorists apparently know that detection is especially difficult in cases where the potential us recrui t is not affiliated with any known terrorist group snf impact on foreign relations if us seen as exporter of terrorism snf if the us were seen as an ex porter of terrorism foreign pa rtners may be less willing to cooperate with the united states on extrajudic ial activities including detention transfer and interrogation of suspects in third party co untries as recent victim of highprofile terrorism originating from abroad the us gove rnment has had significant leverage to press foreign regimes to acquiesce to requests for extraditing terrori st suspects from their soil however if the us were seen as an expor ter of terrorism foreign governments could request reciprocal arrangement that would impact us sovereignty foreign regimes could request information on us citizens they deem to be terrorists or terrorist supporters or even request the rendition of us citizens us failure to cooperate could result in those governments refusing to allow the us to extract terrorist suspects from their soil stra ining alliances and b ilateral relations in extreme cases us refusal to cooperat with foreign government requests for extradition might lead some governments to consider secretly extracting us citizens suspected of foreign terrorism from us soil foreign intelligence operations on us soil to neutralize or even assassinate individuals in the us deemed to be threat are not without precedent before th us entered world war ii br itish intelligence carried out information operations against prominent us citizens deemed to be isolationists or sympathetic to the nazis some historians who have examined relevant archives even suspect that british intelligence officers assassinated nazi agents on us soil snf secretnoforn secretnoforn foreign perception of the us as an exporter of terrorism also raises difficult legal issues for the us its foreign allies an d international institutions to date the us is not signatory to the international criminal court icc and instead s pursued bilateral immunity agreements bias with other countries to ensure immunity for us nationals from icc prosecution the us has threatened to terminate economic aid and withdraw military assistance with countries that do not accede to bias if foreign regimes believe the us position on rendition is too onesided favoring the us but not them they could obstruct us efforts to detain terrorism suspects for example in 2005 italy issued criminal arre st warrants for us agents involved in the abduction of an egyptian cleric and his rendition to egypt the proliferation of such cases would not only challeng us bilateral relations with other countries but also damage global counter terrorism efforts if foreign leaders see the us refusing to provide intelligence on american terrorism suspects or to allow witnesses to testify in their courts they might respond by denying the same to the us in 2005 911 suspect abdelghani mzoudi was acquitted by german court because the us refused to allow ramzi bin alshibh suspected ringleader of the 911 plot who was in us custody to testify more such instances could impede actions to lock up terrorists whether in the us or abroad or result in the release of suspects snf wikileaks the sunshine press httpwikileaksorg the document you have been reading was passed to us by an individual stepping forward
