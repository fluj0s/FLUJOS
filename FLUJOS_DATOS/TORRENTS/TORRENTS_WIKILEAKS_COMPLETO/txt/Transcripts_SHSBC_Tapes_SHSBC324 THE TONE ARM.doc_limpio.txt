the tone arm lecture given on 15 august 1963 sorry for being late whats the date audience the 15th fifteenth female voice fifteenth of august of what audience of august 1963 female voice oh i beg your pardon 1913 1913 female voice ad 13 ad 13 thats wrong date all right thank you this is lecture on the subject of the tone arm ive been trying to figure out how to build meter that just had tone arm and i cant quite figure out how to keep it centered you know itd be an extremely elementary meteritd be very cheap meter and were coming down to point now where we actually should build up something for coaudit or for book auditor seeand we shouldnt worry him with the needle we should build him piece of meter if i could just figure out how to center tone arm you know id be very happy about it ill probably get it licked in the next few days or anyway we need just meterjust meter and it would have to give the equivalent sensitivity here it would have to give the equivalent sensitivity of 16 on its tone arm action see mark v at sensitivity 16 for its tone arm actionand then just follow through its tone arm action now preferably it ought to be able to spin all the way audience mmmm not have any stop at the bottom of it should have the same numbers on it exactlyshould have probably onehand electrodejust onehand electrode and it probably ought to have belt clip of some kind or another so you could hang it on the pc with belt or something you could run it on cchs then couldnt you it ought to be very rugged and really shouldnt be any bigger than just the area of the tone arm there couple of batteries in the back of it or something like that have to be about the same voltage that goes through this mark v you get the idea audience mmmm now the reason i mention this meter to you havent quite figured out how you can center it you need something to center so you know what the tone arm should be see you cant really have light it burns up too much juice maybe if you put littlea little telltale at the bottom of it that was very crude metermovement of some kind or another and you kept that centered and so forth why maybe that would be all right possibly over here little bit to the right maybe little telltale there that had little white center there maybe little black something that you kept at the button when it moved off the button why that was that and you could get your tone arm reads im trying to show you that this meter of yours can be subdivided to that remarkable degree and can still be an extremely serviceable auditing machine see doesnt have to have any lie detection in connection with it or healing adjunct or anything elseits just whether or not discharge is occurring you would see that and you realize that you couldits impossible to run gpm with tone arm actionits impossible if youre getting dialwide rocket reads even though it returns every time across the dialbecause you are blowing one dial width of tone now this shows you how much tone arm action you are actually getting here ill show you on this very meter here this meters not centered well but lets get it down here very delicately now that is approximately oh lets be very very something or otherits about 285 on one end of this needle now lets take that needle the whole width of the dial and get it balanced herejust about in the test areaand dialwide slash on the thing would apparently give us something like onetenth of tone arm divisionup and down now thats translating your needle action into tone arm action well of course that is not enough youll still get tone arm action dont you see even though just the needle is moving but as youve just seen its onetenth of division and if thats all you were getting every twenty minutes that is not enough your minimum is 25minimum 25 divisions but if the pc were running that with considerable Ã©lan and that sort of thing and good perception and so onyou still would be blowing some charge you got that actually its enough charge to blow somatic now whats interesting iswhats interesting is is that is enough for healing isnt that interesting that is enough for healing some guy has got bad foot and you actually find the engramthe accident where he hurt his foot seeand you get needle blowoffnot tone armyou get needle blowoff you cant run this thing with any tone arm motion you get needle blowoff through this thing and you can erase the somatic in his foot and he will feel much better you will get into this when you eventually get r3t which i am putting together which might become r2t its the itsa line combined with dating and its just the itsa line and dating that is all really it isbut you get into some remarkable circumstances with that now that would be enough to make his foot feel all right just that tenth of divisionmake his foot feel all rightbut is actually not enough to make him feel better by reason of auditing see youve got that careful delineation because this was the puzzle of the dianetics auditor this used to drive the old hda around the bend hed heal aunt sallys arthritis and aunt sally didnt believe in dianetics and used to make the old hda about blow his brains out see she didnt feel any better well the hell she didnt she used to sit there all crippled up you i see this one or two of you are thinking of cases of this youve had it happen havent you and she isnt any longer going gimp every time she gumpsand yet she didnt think auditing did her any good she had nothing much to say about it its terrible lose you get some big winyou get some big win from your point of view physiological change on the pcand then so help pete the pc never finds out about it you got that as an example all right this is quite fascinating i mean you have toactually have to experience it to believe it you can get rid of somebodys warts its oh you oh my god warts warts warts warts its all you ever heard about was his warts you know and you can get rid of his warts something like this happens you see them go man you know i saw goiter one time go girl was running up and down the foundation hallway at elizabeth new jersey showing off her pc and doing it fast because the goiter was diminishing so rapidly that it really didnt last off the display you say this is weird auditingbut it wasbut the goiter started to go down and she took it around and showed it to various people and they could see it go down in half an hour goiter there which was the size of cantaloupe just disappeared into the persons throatjust like that really fascinating its too much to say that woman did not ever appreciate this but i will say that afterwards she really didnt know about auditing she still had an open mind on the subject its quite marvelous to behold you can do some of the most remarkable things now that let point it out is what drove us out of healingnot the tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk of the medical boys we couldnt have cared less but auditors in actual fact did not find it very satisfactory area of action they had too many loses and actually we lost too many auditors and looking back on it it was fairly wise to keep them from attacking the healing profession all the time but we have just passed over and weve told people that they mustnt heal and all that sort of thing these days for various reasons its kept them out of trouble and all that sort of thing theres also technical reason back of thiswhich i myself earlier was not aware of but which i have become aware of now just nowis the fact that without complete understanding of the tone arm it is doubtful if an auditor will ever be able to predict whether he wins or loses and will therefore many times get tremendous shock with the pc saying they have lost when the auditor was sure they had won all these are very important data theyre very important to the morale of an auditor you see that ta sitting there absolutely fixed or with tenth of division running through gpm or something stupid like this going on you sit there and watch that taabsolutely fixed sitting therenot necessarily high but just absolutely fixed there it is at 50 and you go onand you audit and you audit and you audit and you audit and its just fixed right there this is what you know you might not know much else in that session but this one for sure you know that the pcs going to drop curve on you at the end of the session one way or the other and within twentyfour hours is going to be subject to some sort of upset now you really dont see this outsidethesession upset as often as it happens they get little bit upset thats because you ordinarily pick up the person now you know that if this person is audited session after session after session after session with stuck ta they will eventually just start going to pieces you maybe have seen that they somehow or another have been able to hold their head up but theyre little bit nattery theyre not reallyit doesnt encourage arc breaks particularly it just isnt nyahnyahnyahnyah theyre just not doing you know and so on and theyre not sure of whether they should be audited or not and they dont know whether scientology works or not this is the sort of thing that you can expect from notonearm change session after session after session but perhaps you havent followed through session with tone arm change resulting in an upset of some kind or another in the pcs personal life within the next twenty four hours thats fascinating see you should take little cognizance of this i dont say that this is inevitable i dont say that the upset is catastrophic i dont say that anything horrible will happen to the person and actually they can have bad luck even when they had little tone arm action you know case in bad shape may have little tone arm action nothing to amount to anything and they still go on having bad luck all thats all thats part of the game but i just want to show you that these data are tied togetherthe pcs personal life and the amount of tone arm action he gets in the session theyre tied together now this gives you then prediction you sit there and you watch that tone arm matter what youre saying you watch that tone arm just sitting there or getting minimal motion and the least you can expect is sort of cool i dont know goals and gains well you thought the person did pretty good you were running through something you thought did them lot of good even though you werent getting any tone arm action and goals and gains well they made some gainthey made some gains minimalminimal response minimal action if you follow that through theyre liable to be subjected to little bit of upsetlife in life well i should base this on this one thing that youve actually restimulated charge because all auditing restimulates charge any auditing restimulates charge thats for sure that whatsit line as it goes across therei am sure somebody out in san bernardino or someplace is going to misread this orbloemfontein or somebodygoing to misread that august 4 hcob ad 13 august 4 and theyre going to say you see an auditor that gets in whatsit line restimulates the pc so you shouldnt get in whatsit line because that results in restimulation which gives body discomfort and i can just hear this all being explained in some lecture it gives body discomfort arc breaksall the sins of auditing come from the whatsit line because obviously it says right there see that it restimulates the pc and we know that is bad and they have it all explained and therefore will refrain from ever getting in whatsit line the pcs go around the bend sit there with nothing to answer nothing to do and you think im being too snide and cynical but donti know how these things backfire i know ill catch on to one sooner or later and 99 percent of everybody why theyll get it right down the groove right down the groove and can you imagine it somebody long time ago who had been trained here for several months eventually revealed why they could never complete listall lists had cyclic rock slams rock slams rock slams rock slams rock slamsso therefore you couldnt complete the list because it still had rock slamming items on it it went on and on and on and on and onand everybody just took it for granted that this person was unable to complete list on the person the pc therefore was very unusual and extraordinary pc and nobody ever bothered to look over the auditors shoulder because rock slam was any movement of the needlea tick fall anything oh some of you were here i see itnodding perfectly sensible auditor i dont know how the dickens this was ever gotten missed i straightened her up in hurry but youre going to find these things extant noany auditing inevitably must restimulate auditing must restimulate in doing ows on somebody thats what makes that tricky process thats what makes that process which is not now being pounded hard it isnt that it doesnt work its that auditors dont seem to uniformly have good luck in restimulating the ows necessary to pull off the case so youll get ow being run this way any prepcheck of overts well now lets see what have you done well i thought nasty thought the other day all right thats fine now what was that thought lets seewhat what was the nasty thought heres the what question what was the nasty thought who was it about joe all right what was the nasty thought about joe thats basic all right thats fine all right lets get another nasty thought about joeis there any earlier nasty thought about that well yesterday i thought nasty thought about him tooyesterday all right we got yesterdays now we got today good tell all about the nasty thought now all right thats fine youyou thoughtyou thought he wasnt as tall as he should be all right thats good see were really making headway on this pc were picking up all of his overts you say its the pcs fault you seethey blame it on the pc and say well the pc just isnt coming up with his overts the auditorthe auditor just is never restimulating his overts one of the favorite methods of restimulating somebodys overts if not the best one its still one that was very commonly used by somebody who has great success with that type of prepcheckingis what have you done not now what have you thoughtwhat have you done to joe done you know done done done what have you done to joe done you know to joe done its what is known as impingement see and the pc aaaahhhh stole his lunch one day ah good thats in the realm of restimulation so any type of auditing which requires extraordinary targeting and restimulation becomes more difficult to do the more difficult auditing is the significances of restimulation which the auditor must engage in with the pc now the degree of the restimulation restimulated in the significance becomes even greater level of skill thats really smooth how much gpm are you going to restimulate to get the gpm run the very smooth auditor restimulates just exactly the items which he wants to restimulate in the gpm and gets them blown now as the skill deteriorates the greater the number of items are restimulated by the auditor the greater the number of gpms restimulated by the auditor to get one gpmuntil youll eventually get some auditor who has sixty or seventy gpms restimulated with half the items in each one in high level of restimulation in order to get one pair of items this sounds like an exaggeration but it almost isnt you get the amount of skill well this is the regulation of restimulation thats your whatsit line and the only thing thats called for on the whatsit line is have heart see know what youre going for know what youve got to get to and have heart take it easy see thats the thing lets go for the engram necessary you know to be run at this particular time in r3rlets go for this thing and lets run it and lets restimulate and run as much of it as the pc can handle lets dont restimulate the whole chain in order to get one engram slightly run see you could actually hunt and punch around q and helps to mess it up you see well i got this i got this this incident here its got aits got an airplane in it and it seems to be diving diving at the ground oh oh all right okay any earlier incidents there of airplanes diving at the ground and so on well yeah yeah heres another airplane diving good good anywell give thegive the earliestgive the earliestthe earliest incident of airplanes diving at the ground yeah well heres whole bunch of airplanes diving at the ground heres lot of incidents of airplanes diving at the ground uhso on seems to be able to get to mei feel very funny as matter of fact im not quite sure its the use of that word earliest and getting engram after engram after engram without running any engrams get the idea i mean when you finallywhen you finally get through with this poor pc you overrestimulated you havent permitted him yet technically by running things or listening to his itsa line or anything elsehavent permitted any of theof the charge to come off of the incidents he had available next thing you know why hes got so many incidents available that theyre sitting in one place and the banks so charged up that it looks like live bomb so does the pc hes getting very hard to handle and so forth restimulation is inevitable the very tools of the trade in the auditing session result in restimulation now auditing works because of restimulation and the blowing of that charge and its cycle you restimulate and you get the charge off and you restimulate and you get the charge off and you restimulate and you get the charge off and you restimulate and get the charge off you restimulate thats all that auditing istheres more than that now of course the odd part of it is that you dont have to personally sit on top of the charge which is being blown off so therefore you can blow an early charge on any chainblow an early charge on any chain of incidents without the rest of it being particularly in restimulation and youll get the charge blowing off the rest of it out there lightyear away and it all kind of starts shattering and going to pieces and dropping apart and you dont see it particularly register on the meter this is what marks faster auditing see its getting the charge which triggers off charge that is what regulates it but thats merely faster thats the only thing that does but whether it is charge restimulated in present time or charge restimulated ten years ago or charge restimulated ten umptybumpty trillions it is nevertheless chargeand its going to be restimulated on the whatsit line now if you dont put in the itsa line and let the charge come off that is restimulated then the pc gets too much of it banked uppardon the punand he just more or less drowns in this stuff and he doesnt know whether hes coming or going after while he doesnt know who his auditor is and so forth he arches arc broken with somebody on the track and he arc breaks with the auditor and bypasses charge and he dramatizes and all that sort of thing this is strictly because hes overwhelmed its how much charge do you restimulate now ive shown you two examplesrestimulating too much charge and restimulating too little charge and theyre equally errors because in the first place restimulating too much charge eventually auditing gets doneand restimulating too little charge auditing gets done and theyre both sins its not necessarily true that the person who restimulates too little charge is more virtuous than the person who restimulates too much charge in fact i would say hes the real sinner because at least this pc sometime or another may be able to sit down with somebody who will listen to him and get off the charge he has now become aware of see that possibility exists so the real is not restimulating any charge and youll find somebody who pulls off from running an engram because the pc hurt too much well i dont think that has anything to do with auditing i never heard that influence an auditing session before so he hurt too muchwhats that got to do with it what auditing are we dealing with here auditing i ever heard of pc hurt too much whats that got to do with it i dont understand you mean you ended the session because the pc hurt too much you can kill more pcs that way pcs saying ow ow oh its terrible oh its terrible you say all right well its too terrible we wont finish running it and you want to see somebody in terrible condition man that pc is now in terrible condition you just bypass the rest of the pain right there you see lock it all up and boom id go so far as to say that earlier on the track when theyre in good shape thetans enjoy pain if you dont believe it sometime tell somebody waste some p in thank you waste some pain thank you waste some pain thank you waste some pain thank you waste some pain thank you youll see him all of sudden get this haunting idea go ahead get the idea of wasting some pain good waste some pain good waste some pain he looks at you you know i like this stuff its very remarkable sadism is not peculiar sadism is lower harmonic of an actual fact any sensation is better than sensation and anything is better than nothing now thats different from only being able to enjoy pain that speaks of very lowscale character but pain ordinarily didnt bother you at one time or another i can see you now putting yourputting beam into power line insulators for kicks you know wondering how much zing youll get out of it hey joe come over here i think i found one thats couple of hundred thousand volts that stuff over there thats only ten thousand well just look at your effect scale you realize that as thetan goes up scale he can stand more effect he can feel in different ways about the same effect too this has nothing to do with it then thats particularity of sensation or particularity of reaction an auditor really doesnt have anything to do with the particularities of action you cant say that actions are bad actions or good actions as far as what the pc is going through you can only say is his mind on his ease or not on his case if he conceives all the bad actions taking place in his environment he for sure has an arc break ie newspaper reporters and so forth theyre arc broken someplace or anotherto such degree that theyre practically psychotic and they can only see the environment you see they cant get interested in their own case therefore they violate the basic definition of auditing and theyre therefore unauditable most newspaper reporters are unauditable scientologists have every once in while triedim not starting on the subject of news but there just happens to be breed of eatand he has hard time because hes running up social overts all the time and he eventually gets tremendous amount of missed withholds now joe id like to write this story about you joe and were really going to write good story about you joe and police think that joe has murdered his wife see and hes just trying to get some hot dope joe sees the story on the headlines murder suspect in love nest slaying see his overt is creating fantastic arc break see the guy told him something in confidence and he went and wrote it in some other way dont you see he gets caught in this all the time and he eventually with this piledup series of overts he starts dramatizing it so there he ishes just caught and iteverybody talks to him missed withhold missed withhold missed withhold missed withhold dont you see overt is create the arc breakbetray betray betray missed withhold betray missed withholdbetray next thing you know there he is see total arc break with the entire environment im just giving somejust that as an example of somebody who gets chronically in this condition and you can put your pc in exactly that conditionnot because of overts or withholds particularlybut by just taking great big slug of restimulated charge letting the pc not get hold of very much of it restimulate it pretty well out of his sight you see and then drop nice iron curtain down in front of the charge and boy that charge glances off that nonexistent itsa line and goes right back on the pckapow its just like shortcircuiting things you could evenyou could even dream up an electrical circuit that would do thisitd be quite factual dream up an electrical circuit so that this condenser over here and so forth could build and build and build and then the line this condenser is supposed to bleed over here and the charge dissipate and then get knifeedge or something that crosses that line to block that dissipation line dont you see and get the charge so that its rerouted back to bulb we will call the pcand boy let assure you that bulb will light up see or you could even have little neon circle around the pc called restimulation red neon tube around this bulb and boy you would not see the pc light up you would see the tube light up and even that would be more graphic the pc goes out and the tube lights up dont you see you could make all sorts of graphic representations of this that would demonstrate it because its as crudely demonstrable as that im not talking allegorically theres allegory mixed up in it at all its just fact auditor says dada dada da and pc says hmmmm well all right thank you in the multitudinous ways he can cut the line and the auditor says dadadadadada da and the pc says well uhm actually well sssitsdoesnt read on the meter here dont bother to answer that very good dadadadadadada da bow and you can practically hear the electrodes connect finally in the pcs skull bzzzzzzzzzz pc goes out of control and is longer capable of selfcontrol because all of his control mechanisms are shottheyre shortcircuited with charge after all he controls his body his voice his thinkingness and so forth with neurondirected currents as long as hes in body and the second these things get too charged up why any action that is there to be duplicated in terms of dramatization will of course get duplicated and he then cannot get through this charge in order to assert control of his voice his limbs or otherwise he sort of sits back himself in total amazement at watching himself in this arc break and also totally incapable of halting it until you finally identify locate and indicate that charge and the second you locate and indicate the charge you have dissipated it to that degree that the person all of sudden says phewf and youve given him back his controls itd be the same as taking the pilot out of the cockpit of the airplane and throwing him back halfway down the fuselage meantime having thrown enough tanglefoot into the cockpit that itd short circuit all of the various instruments controls and so forth naturally the plane will go into spin its as elementary as that its not any graphical or allegorical or odd thing i meanits sitting right there in front of you you can look at it straight in the eye and see it happen now reverselyreversely we dont give the session any fuel to run on dont let any current run in the lines at allno current at all thatll be the end of that session is it all right with you if i start this session now all right you sure there isnt something you want to say oh youre notnot saying anything all right it is all right if i start the session now isnt it all right well here goes start of session all right very good okay were going to run some sort of process here but you just feel free to tell anything you want to tell now whatwhat do you want to tell you havent got anything to say much huh well i dont have much to say either all right well maybe we can put twoanda half hours in here without getting into trouble seen any pictures lately thats pretty dangerous subject lets talk about books huh lets talk about books we havent read hows that well of courseof course its noauditing situation your pc by the way will get just as upset on dry run why because he keeps trying to find something he keeps trying to find something to talk about and he hasnt got anything to talk about and youre now however running an electrical circuit 4 with current at all eventually running it with current at all you run it dry and it sort of takes on spongelike characteristic and the condenser will start picking up charge whether you want it to or not simply out of the intention that auditing is going to occur and this nocurrent circuit will gradually bleed some charge out of the bank in spite of the auditor in spite of the pc it is still mischarge and the pc will still explode you cant win the only thing you can do is to restimulate the amount of charge necessary to keep the session going and thats how much charge you restimulate see that thats how much charge you restimulate you make it as basic and as fundamental and as significant as possiblebut you dont keep going for charge and charge and charge and charge leaving charge unblownbecause youre eventually going to swamp your pc matter how tough he seems you still will swamp the pc now this tone arm is the instrument which measures the adequacy of restimulation that shows you that an adequate amount of charge is being restimulated in the session and that it is being adequately dispelled on the itsa line and this shows you that the cycle of whatsititsa is in progress and the amount of restimulation is adequate to get auditing done now the funny part of it is that its absolutely miles of margin you would sayyou look at some pcs that have fragile delicate tone arm and you wont think theres this much marginbut in actual fact on the usual pc theres just really miles of margin you can overrestimulate and still get tone arm action you actually underrestimulate and get some tone arm action in other words this is high level of tolerance the tolerance is tremendously high thats perhaps happy thing but it doesnt give you split hairline estimation you can have the pc pretty well swamped and still be getting tone arm actionyou can be running the pc too shallowly and still be getting adequate tone arm action see so theres lot of tolerance in this it isnt anything that you have to measure very precisely most auditors therefore groove into the situation that they get tone arm action then they dont worry about too much restimulation or too little restimulation now if you get too much restimulation you get an inevitable cessation of tone arm action if you get too little restimulation you get an inevitable cessation of tone arm action the result is the same for both conditions there is nothing in the meter that tells you youre getting too little or too much but the mechanics of auditing all by themselves any valid auditing question that gives tone arm action is restimulating enough charge to cause auditing to occur so auditing itself prevents to marked degree the lower too little restimulation from occurring if it is done for instance if youre doing anything and getting tone arm action you probably are at the minimal now thats alsoyoure told by the amount of significance which you are auditing youre auditing let us say gpms man and youre piling it on hot and heavy well let tell you at time during that session are you going to have too little tone armtoo little charge at time are you going to have too little charge youre fooling with stuffyoure fooling with stuff that obviously is going to give chargeheavy engrams heavy gpms backtrack stuff all this sort of thing that is all capable of furnishing niagaras of chargeand just ticked will furnish niagara of charge so when youre using upperlevel processeswhen youre using upper level processesthe only error that you pay any attention at all to is too much charge being restimulated and thats the only area you pay any attention to youre sitting there throwing the gpms at him and that sort of thing well youre sitting there pushing items at him all right youre running chain of engrams all rightfine fine fine theres certainly available niagaras of charge so on higherlevel processes you only have the too much charge error on highlevel processes you only have too much charge as an errorand thats the only thing that halts the tone arm action you actually cant err in the direction of minimal charge because if you just stopped running the gpm the guy would startand let the itsa line inthe guy would start drifting up through the locks telling you about locks and that sort of thing itd be impossible for him to remain static in the bank in the vicinity of this much living lightning dont you see you cant make the minimal ta error in running high artillery build an atom bomb or build an atom bomb that doesnt explode enough you see it cant be done thats the whole trouble you take the savannah that atomic ship that they built and these submarines theyve done pretty good job on the submarines on that atomic ship and so forth their trouble all this atomic designthe trouble is just too much hate theres too much horsepower they cant get rid of it theres enough there to run the ship and to warm all the water around the ship and cook all the fish for halfadozen fathoms down below the keel and they still cant get rid of the stuff you seetheres just too much power and that is your problem in auditing high level processes this is one thing for you to know manin spite of the fact that you dont think the pc is getting much contact with it because you arent getting tone arm action youve got him running through any gpm and youre not getting tone arm actionlet tell you that it is never too little charge see now you get this pc going through the incident and youre not getting tone arm action and youre just getting flash in some central organization recently they wereno tone arm actionno tone arm action and halfinch rocket reads choked was considered adequate to run gpm and everybody was walking around looking like corpses fortunately the assoc sec landed in time grim all right now whats this condition whats this condition all about too much charge pc shuts it down tone arm locks upno tone arm action cant be any such thing as minimal charge you see you say well its beyond the reality of the pc well youve explained it in dozen different ways i dont care how you explain it its just too much charge because unreality equals force and invalidation if you want to know what unreality is its force and invalidation you can add on the thought level disagreement force invalidation invalidation slightly on the thought level too uncoordinated forceraw force that sort of thing thats unreality so that person to whom things are the least real is that person swamped by the most charge your problem in such case is how do you bleed it offnot how do you restimulate it how can you open up line to decondense the condenserthats the problem not how do you restimulate charge lifes done that for you adequately and the pc has cooperated gorgeouslyand the pcs got themselves in charged up state that theyre like living lightning theyre swamped all the time dont feel good this that the other thingall these various body conditions sort of arc breaky with life and so forth theres just too much charge the auditorthe auditor has to be skilled wirelayer to attach the discharge line with sufficient delicacy that it wont blow all at once because the pc would simply explode into an arc break or something so youve got to bleed it off very carefully now what do youwhat do you put the lead to what do you put the whatsit line to how do you tap this thing thats the big problem look you could sit there and say well do you have any gpms in restimulation well lets run gpm this persons tone arm was never known to move from 65 or from 10 see oh lets run gpm oh great oh man its like emptying the pacific ocean into the atlantic ocean because the atlantic ocean doesnt have enough water in it or something see and after youve emptied the pacific ocean into the atlantic ocean why youre going to find the atlantic ocean is now too full thats for sure people are going to be wearing rubber boots in new york thats for sure but lets look at this then then it is not problem of emptying the atlantic ocean at all to one of these fragile tone armspardon not throwing more charge in there at all its not even problem of emptying it its problem of how do you get few drops out of it you know the few drops that the pcs knowingness and reality will carry as channel youll find such people very often beg you for oneshot clear process you know they actually sell this so hard they probably create psychiatry create these heroic methods see the old effect scale is in process here see to these people you say did you ever solve any problems you ever you ever think about anything would you like to tell about it well yes yes they dont know if its safe see and youll see them clam up lot and not talk lot and go into large pauses and all of this kind of thing dont you see but gradually youll all of sudden see your tone arm move see youve opened up safe chargebleeding line theyre not suspicious of it theyre not worried about it they know nobody can handle this stuff see theythats what they know thats the biggest knowingness there is they got the idea theyre theyre just delicate that if they think the wrong thought theyre going to go nuts see theyre in atheyre careful theyre careful all the time they must think pure thoughts if i walk this tightwire called life exactly right i dont know maybe imaybe id better not walk it today tomorrowtomorrow thatd bethatd be best well start tomorrow whoooo i almost stepped on the thing see everything is live wire the scientologist whos had quite bit of auditing particularly you guys youd make laugh at you if you told you felt like you were going mad or something like this i frankly would just laugh in your face i wouldnt put the itsa line in at all id laugh because frankly you couldnt possibly make it once in while after session has blown your brains out or something of the sort you might feel like sobbing and crying to yourself quietly but youd still know youre going to come out of it well that isnt how this character whos never had any charge bled off at all feels man that is the carefulness created in psychotherapy of past ages that is the general philosophy of such peoples lives if theyre just cautious if theyif they just arent adventurous in any way they somehow or another will get through well what are theywhat are they doing theyre just they know theyre living on bomb and theyre afraid to connect it up to anything so theyre afraid to say anything to anybody or anything like that i know one pc up in londonfinally we found out hed been collecting all the blackness in the universeall the blackness in the universe to keep other people from having to suffer from it that was his final act of kindness and this guythis guy looked like an animated corpse complete withcomplete with formaldehyde scar you know this was bird man he was gone dog now you run any pc too high grade pick up too little charge on the backtrack you keep him looking bad while hes getting better lets get into another ramification of this you might even deteriorate the condition of his body while hes getting better theres particular reason making him look pretty but the pointthe point im making here is that you actually can run him too steep by far for his body tolerance and still get tone arm action but when you exceed thatwhen you exceed that your tone arm action will cease this is all on the subject of charge and nothing else well all of this is very very interesting but what do you do what do you do and what actually has happened here and how did somebody get that charged up somebody comes off the street never had any auditing never studied any booksno reason for all this charge to exist you realize by cognition alone they read books and get charge off one way or the other we discharge lot of things that we never see on an emetertremendous quantity of it oh thereve been lot of cases of birds lying in bed sick they read something like dianetics evolution of science something like thatand been in the hospital for lord knows when the doctors are about to operate and they say to hell with them and get up and get on their clothes and go out and never been sick since you know weird things like this have happened well that was showing that there was link existed for the charge and some must have blown at that particular moment and brought the case to an equilibrium so it knocked out the psychosomatic illness anybody with psychosomatic illness is simply suffering from too much restimulated charge that he doesnt know what it is or how to get rid of it or anything else if you ever want to meet nasty character meet somebodyi mean nastytempered charactermeet somebody with cancer theyre uniformly nasty tempered well how muchtheyre in an almost total continuous arc break just fabulousarc break going on all the time certain particular types of cancer are worse than others arthritisarthritis is case in point arthritics raaooow see well what is all that stuff gathered up on the bones and binging into the cells and all of this sort of thing well this isnt any esoteric charge like poor old wilhelm reich what was it he had orazone or something the fda killed him you know just as sure as they stood him up in the street and shot him down with gun and he was never arrested for anything he ever did they faked him contempt of court charge you know and threw him in prison and the old man was already an escapee from hitler and he just went into pure terror and died the good old fda anyhow poor old wilhelm reich he was always talking about this stuff that was drifting all over everything you understandhe was talking about charge you find old jung hes always talking about some kind of mysterious influence in his vicinity you know stuff broke around him you know he never attributed it to himself its very remarkable but stuff everything was breaking and snapping he and freud were in room one day and whole bookcase split down the back just fantastic things going on around him he neverhe never said for moment or he never thought for moment that it was himself see these guys are actually dealing with force forces of one kind or another well i dont care whether we measure them like poor old reich and call them by an odd name or measure them and not know anything about them at all except note their effect as in jungs case or wherever we look we see the evidence of what were talking about and calling charge this guy is going this way down the street see all the time well whats holding his hand like that he wouldnt be holding his hand like that man theres something holding his hand like that all right call that charge hesheres somebody elseheres somebody else and hes got himself neckhurts him all the time all the time all the time all the time well we isolate it down we find out after while its pole trap or its something like that or somebodys stuck in gpm or something like this has happened to himthats what gives him the somatic but thats the particularity of the charge giving its time and date location and so forth it is simply just charge and it is in restimulation so it chews the devil out of him sometimes you notice right after session youve got somatics and you walk away from session and they vanish well its case of momentary restimulation other times you walk out of session you have an awful somatic and it doesnt vanish and the next day youre still feeling foggy and two or three days later youre not foggy anymore well that is the period of destimulation of charge usually from three to ten days now of course if you continuously stimulate charge and continuously stimulate it continuously stimulate it and never pick it up give it way to bleed off or anything like that it becomes chronic charge and that is what happens in life you get restimulation of charge and it becomes chronic now actually you have to enturbulate thetan pretty badly to put him in condition where he can get chronic charge you have to give him an implant every twentyfive thirty forty fifty sixty seventy years you have to hit him hardand sometimes even then you dont hit him hard enough i know theyre probably being critical right now on the subject of theyve got to step up the megatrons in the betweenlife areathose damn scientologists coming through here blowing out all the fuses rewire the place make you feel creepy well it shouldnt make you feel creepy they wouldnt do anything for you i dont think theyre that energetic anymore theyre dependent upon system so theyve got to charge up your bank and charge you up and so forth so that you can get charged up and be uncomfortable enough to consider yourself entrapped i just ran intowhile they prepare you for the series of implants which you will get at the end of each lifetimeyour preparation series its just series of gpms the wildest most vicious gpms i ever ran into practically everybodys got them at least twice carefully misdated carefully misdated and every goal called wrong goal audience mmmm theres at least thirty or forty wrong dates on every one of the gpms and thats how they get you to return because between the wrong dates they tell you to get out and come back here see thats how they freeze that in i wondered how they made you feel all the time youre being dragged around and everything im on theim on the trail of that now but that wasits very elementary how they get you to return every timethey sandwich the command to return between series of about eighty gpms and somebody is going to come up with the idea that he ought to whatever other idea he gets but makes you think more and more that theyre not native to this galaxy because this particular series does not carry the significances the goals are oppositeterminated yes but the goals themselves are of characteristic as to make life the opposite terminal so that livingness gives you the oppterm this is very nice goals are lovely to be wrong to get caught you know that sort of thing all derogatory goals so they make you of course be the opposite thing to this see so they naturally stay hungup better and then theyre all misdated so you could produce this on laboratory basis research basis see you can produce too much charge as research basis you could have this pc pc is running with tone arm action powpowpow powpowpow powpowpow not letslet show you now the ceilings you could go into theyre not all wired for asbestos sound and take unlimited amount of bang they cant theyre not like you either because theyre still thinking that careful thought man see and youre going to put little bit more charge on it theyre not going to think that careful thought theyre just going to go thud youre running person who is awful close to thud whether its his individual tolerance or not we wont discuss but you can get ta action off this person tayoull have this problem all the time as an auditor im going to talk to about im talking about one of the commonest problems youll have see you get this person they got getting ta action goes pingpingpingpingping and it goes from 34 and 34 and 34 and 35 and 425 and 34 and 275 and it justnice tone arm action youretheyre just sitting there talking see theyre just sitting there talking and nobodys running any process on them so you say well thats fine this person gets good tone arm action so therefore were going to run the goal to forget all right so we run the goal to forget and the tone arm action is from 35 to 4 with wide strikes now this is perfectly all right but watch it manwatch it man all youve got to do is bypass some charge leave an item charged mess it up give it an arc break be little bit unskilled in auditing andpow that discharges gone there goes your ta actiongone you arent going to get it back either not without an awful lot of work and now this persons jumpy person doesnt quite know whats going to happen to him something catastrophic has occurred dont you see theyre not getting results out of auditing they dont think auditing is giving them the type of results see so your first indication that you are moving case up to zenith on highlevel processes and if theyre going to hit that point of tolerance and go right straight on through the sound barrier bongthe first point is lessening ta action now watch it man because when the ta action lessens you are already running the case beyond tolerance now im talking now about your routine 2 routine 3 routine 4 processeswhich you havent got yet4 but yourthis is your skilledthis is your skilled auditing level you understand thosethose are the things you watch that you watch that diminishing tone arm ordinarily you wont see it because you dont study it until after the sessionor half the session goes by and you suddenly realize that you know this character was moving from 30 to 425 yesterday and by george this whole session so far the pc has only moved from 475 to 45 and see whats happened here now youre not in troubleyoure not in trouble you can go on you see your tolerance is pretty good you can go on only watch it start auditing more carefully start being very careful to keep that itsa line wide wide wide open and be very careful that the charge you do restimulate is actually brought off the case start to audit that case more delicately dont you see and dont change to another type of auditing dont restimulate another single item until youve gotten what youre doing squared away some cases are quite masochistic they want to go earlier and tear up the whole track youve got ease that has already had lessening tone arm action and he wants to go back on the backtrack and restimulate whole chain of goals what do you do then ill just leave it up to you because man youve opened up whole chain of goals on this characteryouve opened up something new when you havent got something old finished off and you are now in trouble and many pc will sit there on very hard sell and try to persuade you to do exactly that and you can just cut your throat man understand that that pc has had diminishing tone arm action youve already seen diminishing tone arm action on the pc now the pcs going to get ambitious and wants to tear up lot more charge oh boy thats the way you get your tone arm stuck now the way the best way to keep from worrying about stuck tone arm is not to stick it now thats really the best way now the next best way is notice it is diminishing and the moment you see it diminish haul out of thereas far as more restimulation is concerned lets start gettinglets start getting thorough see weve got gpm ill show you one way to do thisweve got gpm and all of sudden during that whole session that tone arm has diminished ill give you an example we run the center goal out of the bear implants one of the centers weve assessed for it on 3on r3r and we run the center goal out of the bear implants and we say well weve got that well just run the rest of that series of goals so at that level of the track you assess you list for the next goal to run yeah but you had good ta action see and your ta action goesgone what happened you restimulated the three or four adjacent goals in that series of five goals and you now have four or five gpms in restimulation and that amount of charge has caused cessation of tone arm action see this so that you can ordinarily trace back any ceased tone arm action that has been moving to some additional charge stirrer upperwhich then was in way at all handled you say well you couldnt handle it well then the real subject of this lecture which i should have given you earlier but can be told to you in very few inches of tape is simply this the problemthe puzzlethe mystery is the high tone arm thats the whatsit line you understand the whatsit line or restimulation in general gives you the high or very low tone arm but the common denominator the overcharged ease the overcharged case is always the whatsit lineeven if life is putting in this whatsit or even if the pc is putting in this whatsit and the wrong thing to do is to get more whatsits on the case let show you totally wrong process i dont care if it was part of 212 ive just discovered this thistoabsolutely completely bassackwards wrong process completely blyawwis tell something youve been worried about all you would have to do all you would have to do is get one with puzzle mystery you know whatsit type item you know whatsit item you know what have you not understood in life that would be marvelous see thats whatsit type item and have him just list whatsit type items and the tone arm is going to go right on up there and its eventually going to stick like crazy why because thats nothing but whatsits even though the pc is giving them the pc is not given any opportunity to do anything but concentrate on whatsits see terribly elementary situation here if you wanted to cure that you could have assessed it to central or reading whatsit or any of the whatsits on the list the pc seemed to be interested in and just ask him what solutions had he had for this and thats your itsa and watch the tone arm start moving into action again how many problems does this solve would be totally incorrect auditing question thats absolutely backwards thatll just park tone arm now lets get it right way to how many solutions are there have you had lets not dream them up or invent themhow many solutions have you had to this problem thats totally correct because the pc is where he is because everything has cured everything i have an index someplace or another done in 1958 i ought to bring this to you i have to give you another lecture on it next week but the cures are the cures are the cures are the cures it even goes into matter energy space and time how each one is the cure for the next one cure cure cure cure cure thats what gives you the itsas the itsa line then goes in see how have you tried to solve this problem got problem see what solutions have you had for this problem im just trying to give you graphic auditing working example see that puts the itsa line in and brings the tone arm down so you ask foryou give the case new problems new problems new problemsyou give him chance to give any solutions to the problems your line will go up see you give him itsas itsas itsas itsas itsas eventually itll come down and eventually it wont go any lower because they havent got any problems to give any itsas for see they havent got any whatsits to give any itsas for now is the time to find out another whatsit already in restimulation and get all the itsas for that whatsit that is already there and then find another one on the case that was already in restimulation and find all the itsa lines for it and you could coax anybodys tone arm down following through this you got it its elementary once you start looking at the thing but it can be very baffling and i know very well that youre still going to have some awful headaches sitting there looking at some pc whose tone arm has suddenly ceased to act and ceased to move and trying to get the pc to answer the question trying to pick the lock trying to get that fantastic and horrible combinationthat one little delicate point that the pc will release some charge onthat will start the tone arm acting again trying trying to bleed that charge off what is something small enough or tiny enough that the pc can let go of and youll get the tone arm acting again pc lets go of nothing so long as you have tone arm action so therefore tone arm action is necessary to get off any charge oddly enough knowingness and reality do not increase unless charge is released from the case so then the case knows nothing has happened if you dont increase his knowingness okay all right thats all i have to tell you about it thank you very much
