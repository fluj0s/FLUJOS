1 u classified by ambassador marcelle m wahba for reasons 15 b and d 2 c mfa minstate hamdan bin zayid contacted the ambassador on june 2 to convey information about the uaegs ongoing assistance to jordan and morocco with regard to jordan hamdan reported that the uae has agreed to continue supporting jordans oil needs for the next three months hamdan indicated the level of support would continue to be the cash equivalent of 25000 barrels per day the uae began helping to fill jordans oil needs at the outbreak of hostilities with iraq in march while the jordanians in recent representations to the uae asked for support to cover the next year hamdan advised that the uae due to its own financial crunch would only be able to provide assistance for the next three months 3 c hamdan also informed the ambassador that following the terror attacks in casablanca the uaeg provided 40 million in cash assistance to morocco the moroccans intend to use the money to purchase much needed equipment the emiratis have asked the moroccans to provide an accounting for the money spent hamdan confided that he had told his kuwaiti and saudi counterparts the uaes donation was 80 million in an effort to encourage them to give more he wanted to make sure that the usg knew the real uae contribution in the event that this is raised with us 4 c comment jordan and morocco both enjoy extremely close ties to the uae the emiratis have long felt it important to provide economic assistance and support to these two moderate arab states the fact that abu dhabi is offering cash assistance vice assistanceinkind is measure of just how close these ties are since the emiratis usually balk at writing checks the uaes strong official ties with jordan and morocco are bolstered by personal relationships between the ruling families jordanian king abdullah ii is close friend of uae armed forces chief of staff muhammad bin zayid alnahyan mbz the two frequently hunt in morocco and tanzania joined more often than not by englands prince andrew the ties with the moroccan monarch are equally warm shaykh zayid and other emirati ruling family members maintain vacation palaces in morocco and have poured money into assistance projects there end comment wahba
