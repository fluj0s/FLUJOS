conditions and changes through the late holocene 2700 years in the eastern north atlantic realm is presented in order to contribute new knowledge about the north sea region the faunal distribution fluxes of benthic and planktonic foraminifera and grainsize data were analysed from gravity core geob 60032 from the skagerrak the data indicate environmental changes ie stability and productivity both in the bottom and surface waters major shifts recorded at around 2200 1900 1500 1200 and 400 cal yr bp are interpreted as climatic changes the resulting intervals are linked to wellknown historical epochs such as the subatlantic pessimum the roman period the migration period the medieval warm period and the little ice age the benthic foraminiferal flux indicates that highly productive phases are generally connected with relatively cool climates moreover the planktonic foraminiferal flux reflects decreasing influence of north atlantic surface water masses since the end of the migration period at around 1200 cal yr bp keywords foraminifera paleoenvironment paleoceanography skagerrak late holocene 1 introduction meteorological and hydrographical instrumental data recording northern hemisphere climate variations are only available for the last 250 years further back in time useful information for the reconstruction of past climatic changes is for example preserved in marine sediments ia in microfossil assemblages those indicators that have close relationship to parameters such as temperature and salinity are called environmental proxies for that particular parameter wefer et 1999 although the climate of the holocene last 11500 years is designated as rather stable significant changes occurred within this period the knowledge of the exact timing of the onset and the duration of these climatic changes as well as the background for the variations is however still sparse examples of climatic shifts in the late holocene include the medieval warm period coinciding with the viking period and nordic settlement of iceland and greenland and the climatic depression of the little ice age when coolness and rainfall resulted in crop failures and diseases in europe lamb 1977 schönwiese 1988 lozán 1998 grove 2002 since the beginning of industrialization such natural climatic variations are increasingly influenced by mankind due to close coupling of atmospheric and oceanic circulation rodhe 1987 van weering et 1993a and due to high sedimentation rates eg van weering 1981 van weering et 1987 pederstad et 1993 van weering et 1993 b the skagerrak area bears high potential for environmental reconstruction and appears to be promising place to study holocene climate changes number of investigations have been carried out on recent as well as on subrecent foraminiferal data from the skagerrak eg qvale et 1984 qvale and van weering 1985 corliss and van weering 1993 seidenkrantz 1993 conradsen et 1994 alve and murray 1995 alve 1996 bergsten et 1996 alve and murray 1997 in general surface sediments were examined in these studies with respect to the spatial distribution of benthic foraminifera and their response to water mass properties for the holocene paleoenvironmental interpretations based on several proxies were presented by conradsen and heiernielsen 1995 knudsen et 1996 and knudsen and seidenkrantz 1998 multidisciplinary study of core from the northern part of the skagerrak contributed new knowledge on the general climatic development in the area through the late glacial and the holocene stabell and thiede 1985 the time resolution for the late holocene part in these studies is however not high enough for detailed correlation with our record benthic foraminiferal assemblages and the sedimentological development through the late holocene in the skagerrak were described by hass in 1993 1994 1996 and 1997 who investigated sites located further to the east at water depths of about 420 m in the present paper we partly follow hasss approach in adopting the links to historical epochs comparisons to his cores were however problematic eg because of differences in temporal resolution and water depth this study is part of the holsmeer project aiming to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions in the north atlantic realm through the last 2000 years benthic and for the first time planktonic foraminiferal distributions were used as proxies for the interpretation of environmental and climatic changes in the skagerrak area during the late holocene c 2700 years 2 geographic and oceanographic setting in this study sediment core geob 60032 which was obtained from the central skagerrak basin at 57583n and 9232e at water depth of 312 m fig 1 was investigated the skagerrak is the deepest part 700 m of the norwegian trench which has been formed by repeated glacial advances from the east and the south during the quaternary the trench has the topography of large fjord rodhe 1987 and runs parallel to the norwegian coast the asymmetric skagerrak basin has an irregular steep northern and more regular gentle southern slope fig 1 it serves as natural sediment trap receiving input from number of northwest european source areas and from remobilization of north sea sediments the modern current system is influenced by the largescale atmospheric and oceanic circulation pattern as well as by the outflow of baltic waters eg rodhe 1987 the skagerrak surface circulation is part of the anticlockwise movement of the north sea waters fig 1 large amount of north atlantic water enters the skagerrak directly through the tampen bank current tbc and while the southern trench current stc brings water masses from the northwestern north sea another contributor to the current system is the south jutland current sjc which runs parallel to the danish west coast and continues as the north jutland current njc in the innermost skagerrak the njc and stc waters are supplemented by less saline baltic outflow water the baltic current bc these combined waters turn towards northwest and west and form the norwegian coastal current ncc which continues towards north along the norwegian coast fig 1 the deep water circulation in the skagerrak follows more or less the same pattern as the surface circulation but the velocity of the bottom currents is lower than that of the surface currents dahl 1978 qvale and van weering 1985 rodhe 1987 volumetrically large part of the high salinity and oxygenrich bottom water is of north atlantic origin minor amount is derived from dense water formed in the northern north sea during very cold winters løjen and svansson 1972 in general the highest current speeds occur on to the convex southern slope of the skagerrak rodhe 1987 to which the inflowing water masses are constrained due to the relatively high nearbottom current velocities nondeposition or reworking of sediments may occur locally especially in the shallow areas with water depths of less than 100 m van weering 1981 salge and wong 1988 kuijpers et 1993 3 material and methods the sediment core geob 60032 core length 1049 cm which consists mainly of silty clay was obtained in 19xx 1999 during rv meteor cruise m45 5 in the skagerrak environmental proxy data were analysed within the upper 400 cm of the core at five centimetre intervals the sediment samples for foraminiferal analyses were wet sieved on 63 and 150 µm sieves see grainsize distribution fig 2 in order to obtain better comparison with previous foraminiferal analyses in the area the samples were subsequently dry sieved on 100 µm sieve foraminifera in the size fraction 100 µm were concentrated by the help of the heavy liquid ccl4 159 gcm3 as described by meldgaard and knudsen 1979 the major part of the fauna consisted of calcareous benthic foraminifera which were generally well preserved some agglutinated foraminifera occurred but due to their poor preservation potential in the geological record these were excluded from the analyses the planktonic fauna consists of only few species at least 300 specimens of benthic calcareous and 300 specimens of planktonic foraminifera were identified and counted in each of the 80 samples where possible in total 165 different foraminiferal taxa were determined the 15 most important taxa 13 benthic and 2 planktonic are listed in appendix the percentage distribution of the most important benthic species in the core was used for the subdivision of the record into intervals figs 35 and for the interpretation of environmental conditions moreover the benthic and the planktonic foraminiferal fluxes were considered for the interval definitions and interpretation the foraminiferal flux as measure for productivity was determined with the following equation f d t f foraminiferal flux specimenscm2year number of foraminifera per gram d dry specific density gcm3 t years per centimetre core interval for the dry specific density an average value of 20 gcm3 knudsen and seidenkrantz 1998 was inserted the fluxes are shown in figures 5 planktonic and 6 benthic 4 chronology the chronology of the entire core geob 60032 down to its base at 1049 cm is discussed in order to understand the changes in sedimentation rates throughout the record the agedepth model was constructed on the basis of 11 ams 14c datings and 210pb measurements taking changes in grain size distribution into account fig 2 the 210pb determinations for the uppermost part of the record were performed at the netherlands institute for sea research nioz by measuring 210pb activity via its αparticles emitting grand daughter 210po following the method described by van weering et 1987 the 210pb activity in the upper 40 cm decreases significantly downcore enabling an accurate estimation of the sedimentation rates 18 mmyr for the last 200 years fig 2 the ams 14c datings were made at the leibniz laboratory for age determinations and isotope research at the university of kiel they were carried out on approximately 10 mg carbonate from mixed benthic foraminifera or from shell fragments respectively table 1 all ages were corrected for fractionation and the 13c values are listed in table 1 the 14c ages were calibrated with calib4 stuiver et 1998 using the marine model calibration curve standard reservoir correction of 400 years r0 is built into this model see also heiernielsen et 1995b the ams 14c datings do not all increase continuously with core depth fig 2 table 1 few of the datings on benthic foraminifera appear to give too old ages compared to the others reworked older material moved by hydrodynamic transportation might have caused such age discrepancies temporary intense bottom currents may thus have led to the transport and re deposition of certain amount of foraminiferal tests in the sediment this is the background for considering the too old ages for the upper three ams 14c datings as result of partly reworked assemblages fig 2 similar process of reworking may also explain an apparently too old age for the 803 cm level deviations towards too old ages have previously been reported by heiernielsen et 1995a and by knudsen et 1996 from high energy holocene deposits of northern denmark the distribution of the grainsize fractions 63150 and 150 µm through core geob 60032 fig 2 also indicates varying hydrodynamic conditions in the area during the late holocene presumably significant coarsening of the sediment in the upper 200 cm from mean value of about 4 to 8 weight percent of the grainsize fraction 63150 µm points to gradually higher current velocities in the area the distinct grainsize change at 138 cm depth is suggested to represent the level of change in sedimentation rate fig 2 table 2 this level is therefore introduced as an age zone boundary between two linear segments of the age model accordingly the sedimentation rate from core top down to 138 cm amounts to 120 mmyr this is close to the sedimentation rate obtained by the 210pb measurements second linear segment determined by four ams 14c datings indicates sedimentation rate of 165 mmyr between 138 cm and dated sample at 446 cm third linear segment between 446 cm and the deepest date at 1003 cm is determined by two datings on shell fragments and two on benthic foraminifera the accumulation rate in this interval is 553 mmyr these sedimentation rates are in agreement with the results of previous studies in the area van weering et 1987 kuijpers et 1993 pederstad et 1993 thus the suggested age model for core geob 60032 fig 2 table 2 is based on linear interpolation between the top of the core and two age zone boundaries the agedepth model shows that the upper 400 cm of the core comprise the last 2700 years of the late holocene the temporal resolution in this study is approximately 30 to 40 years per sample 5 foraminiferal analyses and faunal interpretation the percentage distribution of the most important benthic foraminiferal species is shown in figs 3aj and 4 among those cassidulina laevigata b elphidium excavatum i pullenia osloensis g and stainforthia fusiformis j are the most abundant few planktonic specimens are found and they are generally smallsized the flux of each of the two most common planktonic species globigerinita uvula and turborotalita quinqueloba b is shown in fig 5 together with the percentages of the benthic group of miliolids c the environmental indication of the foraminifera is interpreted on the basis of modern distributions and ecology of the species in the skagerrak and north sea areas for the interpretation of the data it is important to be aware of possible reworking chapter 4see above which may have influenced the original fauna by removing or introducing additional species andor specimens species like excavatum as well as some species of the group of miliolids are common in relatively shallow highenergy environments of the southern slope of the norwegian trench conradsen et 1994 these are suggested to be easily transported into the area of investigation qvale and van weering 1985 conradsen and heiernielsen 1995 for instance the increasing abundances of excavatum fig 3i after around 1000 cal yr bp may be at least partly due to reworking from shallower areas even though three radiocarbon ages from the analysed sequences of the core appear to give too old ages major disturbances of assemblage compositions were clearly visible 51 benthic foraminifera on the basis of major faunal changes the record was subdivided into six intervals fig 3 af the assemblages are described and their environmental indication is interpreted in the following from the bottom to the top to simplify the description the species are lettered with j the time interval 26902200 cal yr bp the most common species in this interval are c laevigata b s fusiformis j p osloensis g and hyalinea balthica c the percentages of c laevigata b are relatively constant stainforthia fusiformis j changes from low frequencies in the lower part to higher values from around 2500 cal yr bp drop in percentages of h balthica c is recorded at the same level pullenia osloensis g decreases steadily through the entire interval the percentages of bulimina marginata and melonis barleeanus are low with strong variations and general decrease through the interval the percentages of cibicides lobatulus show maximum values during the upper part fig 4 in modern faunas of the skagerrak area c laevigata is abundant on the southern and the northern slopes of the norwegian trench this species is related to the boundary zone between the stable bottom water mass and the surface waters with more variable environmental conditions qvale and van weering 1985 conradsen et 1994 the opportunistic species s fusiformis is especially abundant on the shallower part of the southern slope alve and murray 1995 1997 bergsten et 1996 stainforthia fusiformis and b marginata are both associated with high contents of organic carbon in the sediment qvale and van weering 1985 alve and murray 1997 pullenia osloensis appears to be confined to the deeper part of the norwegian trench bergsten et 1996 hyalinea balthica is most common in the deepest part as well but mostly in small numbers and is linked to high organic carbon contents qvale and van weering 1985 hass 1997 considered h balthica to be an indicator of low oxygen contents in stagnant bottom waters melonis barleeanus is most abundant in the deeper part of the norwegian trench where it seems to be connected with stable welloxygenated bottom waters qvale and van weering 1985 bergsten et 1996 cibicides lobatulus is an indicator of high bottom current velocities murray 1991 during interval the foraminiferal assemblages generally point to high input of organic matter to the area an interpretation which is based on relatively high amounts of one or more of the species s fusiformis j h balthica c and b marginata the decrease in h balthica c and p osloensis g together with the increase in s fusiformis j indicates change from relatively stable bottom waters towards more variable conditions in the later part of the interval h balthica decreases while s fusiformis increases how does that fit to the interpretation that both indicate high toc contents what do the productivity indicators tell the increasing trend in percentages of the less common species excavatum i and ammonia beccarii h also points to gradually higher environmental variability and c lobatulus shows increasing bottom current velocities towards the end of the interval the time interval 22001900 cal yr bp b the dominant species in this interval are s fusiformis j c laevigata b and p osloensis g globobulimina turgida d is relatively common too with frequencies close to those in the previous interval the onset of this interval is characterised by an increase in percentages of p osloensis g and an abrupt decrease in beccarii h after an abundance peak in excavatum i at around 2200 cal yr bp the frequency of this species returned to similar low values as before interval stainforthia fusiformis j and c laevigata b occur with continued high frequencies the percentages of p osloensis g are generally slightly higher than during the later part of the previous interval decreasing trend in percentages of uvigerina mediterranea f is already apparent since around 2500 cal yr bp while the percentages of m barleeanus became very low at around 2300 cal yr bp the percentage values are continuously low through interval b uvigerina mediterranea is slope species overlapping the area of c laevigata in the modern norwegian trench qvale and van weering 1985 it does not live in highenergy environments but seems to require stable water conditions the decreasing trend may point to an increase in variability through the interval the composition of species eg with high percentages of s fusiformis j and c laevigata b indicates continuously variable environmental conditions this is supported by relatively high contents of c lobatulus fig 4 the time interval 19001500 cal yr bp c cassidulina laevigata b remains the dominant species together with s fusiformis j and p osloensis g at the transition to this interval there is however decrease in the percentages of s fusiformis j hyalinea balthica c increases in frequency at the transition and has its maximum peak at 1800 cal yr bp after marked decrease there is slight general but variable increase in the percentages of the accessory species beccarii h and excavatum i during the later part of the interval these species are tolerant to variable environmental conditions but their distribution pattern appears to reveal two periods of temporary less variability globobulimina turgida d and the less common m barleeanus show considerable variation with relative frequency minima at about 1500 cal yr bp in general the environmental conditions are still highly variable but there is faunal indication of more stable conditions than during the previous interval this is for instance indicated by relatively high contribution of h balthica c and the decrease in s fusiformis j the decrease in percentages of s fusiformis to generally lower level may indicate reduced input of organic carbon whats about the increase in hbalthica what do the productivity indicators tell the time interval 15001200 cal yr bp d the species distribution is not very different from that in the previous interval the dominant species are the same though with slightly decreasing percentages of s fusiformis j after an increasing trend in c laevigata b and generally high percentages of h balthica c through this interval there is marked drop in the abundances of both species melonis barleeanus and b marginata gradually increase in frequency through the entire interval the amount of miliolids fig 5c has increased compared to the intervals before 1500 cal yr bp but the values are generally rather low in the core it is an indicator group for increased bottom water salinity murray 1991 1992 during interval d the environment may be slightly more stable as reflected by relatively high percentages of h balthica c and the decrease in s fusiformis j the miliolids point to an increased influence of north atlantic bottom waters in the area hydrographic shift to more unstable conditions is indicated close to the end of the interval this is displayed by drop in h balthica c and c laevigata b and subsequent increase in s fusiformis j any indications for corg the time interval 1200400 cal yr bp after 1200 cal yr bp there is an increase in s fusiformis j subsequent decrease between 1100 and 800 cal yr bp is again followed by gradually higher percentages cassidulina laevigata b and h balthica c decrease in frequency with especially low values at around 800 cal yr bp similar minima are seen for b marginata and g turgida d these latter species are associated with high organic carbon contents in the sediment and tolerate lowoxygen environments sen gupta 1999 elphidium excavatum i and beccarii h show significant rise in percentages between 1200 and 900 cal yr bp reaching maxima at around 800 cal yr bp the most pronounced change in p osloensis g also occurs at around 800 cal yr bp change which appears to have taken place within few decades after 700 cal yr bp g turgida d reaches its highest values for the entire record in addition m barleeanus becomes much more abundant reaching maximum percentages after about 600 cal yr bp the environmental conditions during the early part of this interval were more unstable than during the previous interval at 800 cal yr bp there is marked environmental change and since then the assemblages gradually show even higher instability this is for instance indicated by the decrease in p osloensis g and by the increase in s fusiformis j and excavatum i the relatively high percentages of s fusiformis j m barleeanus on page 8 m barleeanus is described to be related to well oxygenated bottom waters that is normally low organic matter contents g turgida d and b marginata point to an increased input of organic matter to the area after 800 cal yr bp this time shows the lowest benthic foraminifera flux rates which indicate low flux of organic matter the miliolids fig 5c continue to show periodical abundance peaks throughout interval indicating variations in the influence of north atlantic water masses to the area the increasing abundances of excavatum i and beccarii h clearly indicate gradually more unstable conditions and lower salinities in the area qvale and van weering 1985 an interpretation which is supported by the general changes in the assemblages eg increase in c lobatulus and by the change in grainsize distribution towards coarser sediments figs 2 and 4 the combined change in the fauna and in the sediment may however partly be result of an increased input of reworked material from shallower areas of the slope reworking of part of the assemblage is indicated by some apparently too old 14c datings within the depth range of this interval chapter 4see above the time interval 400 cal yr bppresent f this interval is characterised by an increase in the percentages of beccarii h excavatum i and s fusiformis j the latter species reaching particularly high values ammonia beccarii h and excavatum i fluctuate lot in frequency decrease in salinity as indicated by these two species is supported by low percentages of the miliolids fig 5c other characteristic features for this interval are continued low percentages of p osloensis g and marked gradual decrease in u mediterranea f m barleeanus g turgida i cant see that d and b marginata single distinct peak in the abundance of bolivina skagerrakensis is seen at one level around 150 years ago this species typically occurs in modern faunas of the deepest part of the skagerrak and it was suggested by qvale and van weering 1985 and conradsen et 1994 to be an indicator of stable bottom water conditions in contrast to this hass 1997 regarded b skagerrakensis as an opportunistic species signalling instability during periods of changing conditions this interpretation was based on the fact that the species always occurred during transitional intervals in his records for instance at the transition to the little ice age since we only find one peak of b skagerrakensis in our record it is not possible to resolve whether this represents short period of environmental change or if it is rather product of irregular occurrences of the species the assemblages in interval f indicate decrease in salinity and pronounced increase in the instability of the environment this is indicated by an increase in excavatum i and decrease in u mediterranea f m barleeanus and g turgida d again cant see that whats about b marginata additionally the high percentages of s fusiformis j point to an increase in the organic carbon contents in the more recent timesbut h balthica is low and m barleeanus g turgida and b marginata decrease however benthic foram flux rates increase 52 planktonic foraminifera globigerinita uvula totally dominates the planktonic assemblages with 80 while t quinqueloba is less common therefore the g uvula flux fig 5a is used in this study as measure for the total planktonic foraminiferal flux the variation in flux of g uvula ranges between 0 and 60 specimenscm2year with single peak reaching 130 specimenscm2year fig 5a the maximum values occur in the intervals b and c particularly between 24002100 cal yr bp minimum values are reached at around 1200 cal yr bp since then the g uvula flux has been close to zero with slight peak at about 500 cal yr bp within interval the flux of t quinqueloba fig 5b is usually below 1 specimencm2year with only two higher peaks between 18001700 cal yr bp within interval c these two major peaks as well as several other maxima in the t quinqueloba flux correlate with high values of the g uvula flux indicating periods of increased influx of north atlantic surface water masses to the area as seen for g uvula the t quinqueloba flux is very low after 1200 cal yr bp and it became almost zero only within the last 200 years studies of recent and subrecent foraminiferal distributions in the skagerrak seidenkrantz 1993 bergsten et 1996 showed that planktonic foraminifera are generally very sparse in this area however the two planktonic foraminiferal species g uvula and t quinqueloba have been observed rather frequently in the outer parts of norwegian fjords mikalsen 1999 husum and hald in press by regarding the skagerrak as fjordlike system one could argue that our results are in accordance with their observations the percentage distribution map of johannessen et 1994 also exhibits branch of slightly increased values for t quinqueloba off the norwegian west coast 6 environmental changes and historical epochs major changes both in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages and in the benthic flux are found to occur at around 2200 1900 1500 1200 and 400 cal yr bp in the skagerrak core the different intervals defined by the foraminiferal data correspond to wellknown historical epochs such as the subatlantic pessimum the temperate roman period and the cooler migration period the medieval warm period and the little ice age in general these epochs are distinguished by differences in climatic conditions mainly in temperature our results are also compared with surface temperature conditions reconstructed by mann and jones 2003 for the last 1700 years their combined proxy record is valid for the northern hemisphere fig 6 in particular the benthic foraminiferal flux appears to be highly sensitive to climatic variations therefore the benthic foraminiferal flux which varies between 0 and 90 specimenscm2year through the record will be discussed and linked to the late holocene climatic development below fig 6 the time interval 26902200 cal yr bp the subatlantic pessimum during interval benthic foraminiferal data of the skagerrak core indicate rather stable environmental conditions changing to higher variability at around 2500 cal yr bp the benthic foraminiferal flux is relatively high mean value 40 specimenscm2year fig 6 this is associated with faunal indication of high input of organic matter to the area see above increasing after 2500 cal yr bp the entire period is characterised by relatively strong influence of north atlantic water masses as reflected by maximum values of the planktonic foraminiferal flux g uvula fig 5a this period corresponds to the final part of the subatlantic pessimum in europe relatively cold period with high precipitation rates lamb 1977 fairbridge 1987 in general the subatlantic pessimum is reported to end at approximately 2200 bp lozán 1998 however placed the termination of this epoch at 2550 bp followed by transitional period this latter timing of climatic change corresponds to change in our faunal data the time interval b 22001900 cal yr bp early part of the roman period pronounced instability in the benthic environment prevailed during interval b increased bottom current velocities are indicated by maximum percentages of cibicides lobatulus fig 4 in particular this interval can be distinguished from the previous one by its significantly lower benthic foraminiferal flux mean value 33 specimenscm2year the planktonic flux still indicates relatively strong influence of north atlantic water to the skagerrak though less important than previously this interval is linked to the early part of the roman period which is characterised by several cooling spells and storm events lamb 1977 lozán 1998 in general the roman period 21501550 bp lozán 1998 is described as mild but unstable lamb 1977 the time interval c 19001500 cal yr bp later part of the roman period the benthic environmental conditions were still highly variable but with intervals of some stability the benthic foraminiferal flux is at its maximum pointing to high productivity mean value 57 specimenscm2year fig 6 this clearly distinguishes marks that interval c differs considerably from the previous one slightly increased influence of north atlantic waters is reflected in the planktonic foraminiferal fluxes particularly between 1850 and 1650 cal yr bp fig 5a b this interval corresponds to the later part of the roman period the temperature reconstruction from mann and jones 2003 shows cooling trend towards the end of this time period 17001500 cal yr bp fig 6 in addition the stable oxygen isotopes of plankticbenthic forams from core geob 60032 signal decreasing temperatures through the entire interval scheurle et in prep the time interval d 15001200 cal yr bp the migration period the benthic environment became slightly more stable in interval d than in the previous one moderate decrease in the benthic foraminiferal flux mean value 45 specimenscm2year fig 6 indicates slight change to lower productivity the planktonic g uvula flux fig 5a decreases to very low numbers and the t quinqueloba flux fig 5b remains low the group of miliolids fig 5c however points to small increase in the advection of saline bottom waters to the area shift to gradually higher variability in the environmental conditions towards the end of the interval is indicated by the benthic foraminifera from historical observations the migration period 15501250 bp lozán 1998 was characterised by decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation this climate deterioration is suggested as one of the main initiation factors for the germanic migration relatively cool conditions are also indicated in the temperature anomaly record of mann and jones 2003 as well as in stable oxygen isotope data of the skagerrak core scheurle et in prep both reflecting similar temperature conditions as during the previous interval c the time intervals and f 1200 cal yr bppresent the medieval warm period and the little ice age the benthic foraminiferal distribution points to increased instability in the environmental conditions during the early part of interval 1200 800 cal yr bp after marked change at 800 cal yr bp the assemblages show gradually higher instability during interval 1200400 cal yr bp the benthic foraminiferal flux is generally low mean value 27 specimenscm2year fig 6 with two distinct minima the planktonic foraminifera almost disappear fig 5a b this points to noteworthy decrease in the influence of north atlantic surface water masses fluctuations in the planktonic t quinqueloba flux fig 5b as well as in the percentages of benthic miliolids fig 5c however still show some variations in the influx of atlantic water masses the change in planktonic productivity in the area at about 1200 cal yr bp appears to be closely associated with general decrease in benthic productivity figs 5 and 6 decrease in the advection of atlantic water masses to the region was previously reported by klitgaardkristensen et 2001 and by mikalsen 1999 change in the hydrographical pattern through interval becomes also evident from the grainsize data figs 2 and 4 decreased sedimentation rate coincides with an increase in grainsize the coarsening upward trend in the skagerrak is most likely result of increased coastal and bottom erosion in the north sea together with an intensification of the erosion and transport capacity of the north jutland current jørgensen et 1981 nordberg 1991 fig1 since the onset of the medieval warm period mud transport belt has controlled the horizontal sediment flux which was transporting sediment from the west to the east hass 1996 this was connected by hass 1996 to periods with prevailing stormy atmospheric conditions according to rodhe 1987 the inflow of water into the skagerrak is highly winddriven interval corresponds to the socalled medieval warm period and the earliest part of the little ice age ia grove 2002 usually the beginning of the medieval warm period is associated with the viking period 1150950 bp and the nordic settlement of iceland and greenland furthermore winegrowing in northwestern europe is used as an indicator for an ameliorated climate during this time period eg schönwiese 1988 in addition to the historical evidence the proxybased temperature reconstruction presented by mann and jones 2003 shows the highest temperatures from 1200800 cal yr bp followed by cooling trend between 800500 cal yr bp the timing of that temperature change coincides with significant change in the benthic foraminiferal composition in the skagerrak at around 500 cal yr bp the foraminiferal assemblages in the skagerrak core changed markedly within period of 200 years decrease in salinity is shown by diminishing percentages of the group of miliolids fig 5c and by an increase in the percentages of beccarii and excavatum fig 3h i these latter species contribute significantly to the final rise in the benthic foraminiferal flux mean value 34 specimenscm2year fig 6 interval f the planktonic foraminiferal flux of g uvula remains very low and the flux of t quinqueloba becomes almost zero during the last 200 years fig 5a b this shows that the north atlantic surface water influence was even further reduced the environmental change around 500 cal yr bp can be linked to the climatic transition from the medieval warm period when climate altered flohn and fantechi 1984 lamb 1984 and deteriorated into the little ice age the little ice age is generally considered to have lasted from about 600 to 100 cal yr bp in central and northern europe due to changes in the atmospheric circulation system the weather conditions became unstable for example resulting in increased precipitation and storminess faunal indication of increased of organic carbon to the sediments during the last couple of centuries may reflect the anthropogenic influence in the area how 7 summary and conclusion this study contributes new knowledge about late holocene changes in the marine environment of the skagerrak which is part of the north atlantic realm by presenting benthic and planktonic foraminiferal analyses as well as grainsize distribution in core geob 60032 due to the fact that there is close connection between the atmospheric and the oceanic systems in the area the foraminiferal indication of changes in bottom and in surface water characteristics like eg stability and productivity can be used for environmental and climatic reconstruction during the last 2700 years major environmental shifts are recorded in the benthic faunal distribution as well as in the benthic foraminiferal fluxes at around 2200 1900 1500 1200 and 400 cal yr bp indicating climatic changes the defined intervals can be linked to historical epochs such as the subatlantic pessimum the roman period the migration period the medieval warm period and the little ice age changes in the environmental stability at the sea floor as indicated by benthic foraminiferal distributions and grainsizes are suggested to be at least partly controlled by changes in bottom current speeds unstable conditions may thus be related to periods of frequent storm events it can be concluded that the benthic foraminiferal flux which is measure of productivity in the area is highly sensitive to climatic variations during periods with relatively warm conditions the benthic foraminiferal flux is generally low while it is higher during cooler periods it is assumed that more nutrients were availabe in the marine environment during relatively cool phases this can be linked with historical evidence of increased precipitation and storminess pronounced advection of north atlantic surface waters to the skagerrak prevailed until about 1200 cal yr bp subsequently marked decrease in the planktonic foraminiferal flux which coincides with general decrease in the benthic foraminiferal flux shows that this inflow diminished most likely this shift can be linked to change in the largescale atmospheric oceanic circulation system acknowledgements we would like to thank dr
