government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197revenue measures in congress procedural considerations summary as with other types of budgetary legislation special guidelines and practices govern the consideration of measures for raising revenues these procedural restrictions can have significant impact on the timing and contents of revenue measures the oldest limitation on consideration of revenue measures is the origination clause of the us constitution article i section 7 requires that all measures for raising revenues originate in the house of representatives although the senate may amend revenue bill as it chooses the consideration of revenue measures is also influenced by processes stemming from the congressional budget act of 1974 the annual concurrent resolution on the budget establishes levels for revenues and surplus or deficit as well as expenditures these levels are enforced through points of order and revenue legislation must be consistent with them if the budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions these may include directives to the house and senate tax committees concerning changes in revenue laws to alter the projected level of revenues as result provisions in the budget act concerning the timing and consideration of the budget resolution or reconciliation can have an impact on revenues the payasyougo process paygo budgetary control mechanism established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 also has an impact on revenue legislation this mechanism requires that if the net level of changes in revenues and direct spending enacted results in positive balance on the paygo scorecard for fiscal year it must be offset by other changes in revenues and direct spending house and senate rules also affect revenue legislation jurisdiction over revenue matters is fixed in the rules of both chambers in addition house rules provide that 1 revenue measures be considered in committee of the whole 2 certain tax increases require threefifths vote 3 certain tax increases may not be retroactive and 4 supplemental information such as an analysis of the complexity of proposed tax changes or dynamic estimates of measures revenue effects may be provided in certain circumstances finally the congressional budget act provides that whenever committee of either house reports revenue measure the accompanying report should include projection by the congressional budget office cbo of any increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures projections made by cbo must in turn be based on estimates provided to it by the joint committee on taxation this report will be updated to reflect any additions to or changes in these procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197contents introduction 1 the origination clause 1

federal government provides for more than 2 trillion in revenues including over 500 billion in social security revenues these revenues accrue to the government primarily as result of new and previously enacted legislation that establishes the laws governing tariffs and taxation revenues less than expenditures are part of the budget process like other parts of the budget process revenue legislation is subject to special rules and requirements that set it apart from most other types of legislation the us constitution grants congress the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises1 revenue laws enacted pursuant to this provision typically grant longterm or permanent authority for the government to collect various taxes periodically congress repeals obsolete provisions extends expiring provisions and makes other adjustments these adjustments are made for variety of policy and political reasons but are all treated as an integral part of the budget process new revenue legislation and revisions of existing revenue laws may be considered by the house and senate as freestanding measures in recent years however such changes have frequently been considered as part of the budget reconciliation process in either case revenues are expected to conform to the level established by congress in the budget resolution and generally must be considered under the procedures found in the us constitution the congressional budget act of 19742 the budget enforcement act of 19903 and the rules of the house and senate this report describes how each of these components has an impact on the consideration of revenue legislation the origination clause article i section 7 clause 1 of the us constitution is known generally as the origination clause because it requires that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs2 4us congress senate riddicks senate procedure sdoc 10128 101st congress 2nd session by floyd m riddick and alan s frumin washington gpo 1992 pp 685 1215 5ibid pp 52 1215as generally understood in both the house and senate this clause carries two kinds of prohibitions first the senate may not originate any measure that includes provision for raising revenue and second the senate may not propose any amendment that would raise revenue to nonrevenue measure however the senate may generally amend houseoriginated revenue measure as it sees fit this prohibition does not apply to budget resolutions as described in the section below because budget resolution only establishes the level of revenues and does not itself raise revenues these prohibitions can be enforced in either the house or the senate and there are ample precedents for both according to riddicks senate procedure when question is raised in the senate regarding the constitutionality of measure such as whether the measure contravenes the origination clause it is submitted directly to the senate for its determination4 similarly an amendment proposing to raise revenues would be out of order on the same grounds if offered to nonrevenue measure point of order against such an amendment would also be submitted by the presiding officer directly to the senate5 such point of order generally would be debatable and decided by majority vote the house accomplishes enforcement primarily through process known as blueslipping blueslipping is the term applied to the act of returning to the senate measure that the house has determined violates the origination clause it is called blueslipping because the resolution returning the offending bill is printed on blue paper this process is provided for under house rule ix clause 2a1 which states resolution reported as question of the privileges of the house or offered from the floor by the majority leader or the minority leader as question of the privileges of the house or offered as privileged under clause 1 section 7 article i of the constitution emphasis added shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn any member of the house may offer such resolution but normally it is the chairman of the ways and means committee who would do so occasionally another member of the committee may be designated consideration of the resolution takes place in the house of representatives under the one hour rule clause 2a2 further provides that the time allotted for debate on resolution offered from the floor as question of the privileges of the house shall be equally divided between the proponent of the resolution and b the majority leader the minority leader or designee as determined by the speaker it should be noted that because enforcement of the origination clause in the house is based on question of the constitutional privilege of the house it is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs3 6such an accommodation was proposed by representative david obey then chairman of the appropriations committee for dealing with revenue provision inserted into the fy1995 agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations bill hr 4554 103rd congress during floor remarks concerning this proposed accommodation representative robert walker stated that such an accommodation had previously been made during consideration of the senate passed fy1995 commerce justice state appropriations bill hr 4603 103rd congress for details see the discussion during consideration of hres 518 103rd

precedents of the united states house of representatives including references to provisions of the constitutio n and laws and to decisions of the courts vol 3 chap 13 section 142 washington gpo 1977 p 295 8pl 97248 96 stat 324subject to restrictions based on timeliness the house can assert its privilege at any time it is in possession of the papers therefore the house is not limited to enforcing its prerogative through blueslipping measure upon its initial receipt from the senate the house may decide that it is not necessary to blueslip measure that will be considered by conference committee because an offending provision could be removed in conference without the formal step of blueslipping6 such an accommodation would not prevent the house from enforcing its prerogative after conference if the offending provision remained in the measure7 there are other options the house could exercise short of formally blueslipping measure for example the house could choose simply to ignore the offending bill either holding it at the desk or referring it to committee such an action could also be followed by house passage of an appropriate revenue raising measure that would then give the senate legitimate legislative vehicle for its revenue provisions the house could also move to take up the measure and disagree to the offending senate amendment giving the senate the option of deciding how to proceed the senate could then insist on its amendment and attempt to go to conference regardless of house concerns the senate could also recede from its amendment and concur with new amendment not violating house prerogatives such course of action however would require unanimous consent it would also be possible for the senate simply to recede to the housepassed version although politically this option would be less likely because the senate is free to propose amendments to houseoriginated revenue measures the senate may originate tax provisions even though it may not originate tax measures one extreme example is the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 19828 the senate took houseoriginated measure concerning tariffs that had passed the house in 1981 hr 4961 97th congress and amended it to include major revenue increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs4 9the budget for social security is separate from the rest of the federal budget and its totals must be presented separately in the budget resolution the exclusion of social security from the budget process generally stems from section 13301 of the budget enforcement act the budgetary treatment of social security in the senate including revenues to the oldage survivors and disability insurance program established under title ii of the social security act and the related provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 is specified in sections 301a7 301i 302f2 and 311a3 and 311b these sections establish firewall to restrict changes in the revenues or outlays of the social security trust funds by exempting the funds and their transactions from the congressional budget process generally as well as from budget enforcement procedures like sequestration for the house social security is protected under section 13302 of the budget enforcement act which establishes point of order against legislation that would reduce the balance of the trust funds or have negative impact on their actuarial balance over 5 or 75year period without an offsetting change for more on the treatment of social security specifically rather than on revenue generally see crs report 98785 budget enforcement procedures applicable to social security by robert keith and crs report 95206 social securitys treatment under the federal budget summary by david koitzrevenues and the budget resolution the congressional budget act of 1974 was designed in part as mechanism for coordinating both spending and revenue levels as result the budget resolution is required to include totals for revenues spending new spending surpluses or deficits and debt9 specifically section 301a2 of the congressional budget act requires that the budget resolution set forth appropriate levels for total federal revenues and the amount if any by which the aggregate level of federal revenues should be increased or decreased by bills and resolutions to be reported by the appropriate committees the budget resolution thus provides guideline for the amount of federal revenues but not for their composition the sources and composition of revenues are determined through the enactment of revenue laws that are reported as necessary from the house and senate committees of jurisdiction the budget resolution may also include reconciliat ion instructions directing the committees of jurisdiction to report legislation making appropriate changes in the level of revenues but not directing specific changes in revenue laws in addition the budget resolution is required to include such amounts for future years section 301a sets the requirement at the fiscal year beginning on october 1 of such year and planning levels for at least each of the 4 ensuing fiscal years however this is the minimum requirement and more than four outyears have been included in several recent budget resolutions the budget resolutions for fy1996 and fy1997 included levels for fiscal years extending to fy2002 the year when balanced budget would have been required under proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment the budget resolution for fy2000 included levels extending to fy2009 consideration of revenue legislation is also tied to the budget resolution by its timing congress must first consider budget resolution for particular year before it can consider measure that would affect the revenue level for that year sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs5 10for more on the reconciliation process and the budget process generally see crs report 98720 manual on the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schick crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget proc ess by robert keith and allen schick and crs report rs20095 the congressional budget process brief outline by james v saturno 11on this specific question see crs report rs20870 revenue reconciliation directives to the senate finance committees in budget resolutions for fy19762001 by robert keith 12an exception is that section 310g of the congressional budget act prohibits changes to the social security act from being included as part of any reconciliation measure303a of the congressional budget act provides that in general until budget resolution for fiscal year has been agreed to the first fiscal year covered by the resolution with respect to the house and any fiscal year covered by the resolution with respect to the senate it is not in order to consider any bill or joint resolution amendment or motion thereto or conference report thereon that provides for an increase or decrease in revenues that will first become effective during that fiscal year an exception is provided in section 303b1b which allows for the house to consider measures increasing or decreasing revenues which first become effective in fiscal year following the fiscal year to which the concurrent resolution applies revenues and reconciliation the reconciliation process is an optional part of the budget process that can be used to implement the overall budget plan established in the budget resolution10 it can be used to make changes in revenues or direct spending or both one impact of reconciliation process comes from the fact that the congressional budget act provides special procedures for the consideration of reconciliation measure including limits on the time for debate and contents of such bill for example limit of 20 hours for debate in the senate means that reconciliation measure cannot be subject to an extended debate or filibuster these procedures make the reconciliation process critical and sometimes controversial element in the budget process when it is used one such issue in 2001 involved whether use of the reconciliation process is appropriate for considering measure that provides only for revenue reductions11 another debate resulted in general understanding that the special reconciliation procedures could be applied only to single measure during congressional budget cycle in recent years changes in revenue laws have frequently been enacted as part of the reconciliation process rather than as freestanding legislation the procedural impact has been twofold first in some cases revenue legislation has been considered as part of an omnibus bill in order to better coordinate changes in both revenues and direct spending12 when multiple committees receive reconciliation instructions including instructions concerning changes in the level of revenues all such committees are expected to report their recommendations in the form of legislative language to the house and senate budget committees rather than directly to their respective chambers these recommendations are packaged by the budget committees and then reported as an omnibus bill in this circumstance ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs6 13for example the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee were the only committees in their respective chambers to receive reconciliation instructions in the fy2000 and fy2001 budget resolutions 14according to riddicks senate procedure pp 854862 although the precedents of the senate reflect various conclusions with regard to germaneness it is generally understood that germaneness is more restrictive than relevance thus even if an amendment is relevant additional considerat ions would be considered to determine if the amendment is germane including does it add new subject matter does it expand the powers authorities or constraints being proposed does it amend existing law or another measure as opposed to the measure before the senate does it involve another class of persons not otherwise covered by the measure does it involve additional administrative entities is it within the jurisdiction of the committee that reported the measure and is it foreseeable p 855 15for more on the interpretation and enforcement of the byrd rule see crs report rl30862 budget reconciliation procedures the senates byrd rule by robert keithreconciliation bill is treated as revenue bill for purposes of the origination clause even though it may include spending provisions and thus must originate in the house when single committee receives reconciliation instructions the instructions typically direct the committee to report legislation for consideration in its respective chamber13 second sections 310 and 313 of the congressional budget act place limits on the consideration of reconciliation measures and the amendments that can be offered to them amendments are prohibited in both the house and senate under sections 310d1 and 2 respectively that would have the effect of reducing revenues in the bill if other changes in revenues or direct spending programs do not offset them in the senate amendments to reconciliation bills are also restricted by two additional sections section 310e imposes germaneness requirement by reference to section 305b2 under this requirement the senate would be prohibited from considering amendments to reconciliation bill that would expand the scope of taxes already included in the measure14 section 313 the socalled byrd rule prohibits the senate from including extraneous provisions in or offering extraneous amendments to reconciliat ion bills extraneousness is distinct from nongermaneness because the focus of this test is primarily budgetary impact rather than subject matter under this rule an amendment is generally prohibited if it does not have budgetary impact or if it has budgetary impact beyond the period called for in reconciliation instructions15 one significant effect of the byrd rule has been that revenue provisions in reconciliation bills are frequently subject to sunset provisions in order to limit their budgetary impact to the fiscal years covered by reconciliation instructionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs7 16the budget enforcement act of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 1388573 through 630 amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to provide new budgetary control mechanisms including the paygo process originally enacted with sunset date of 1995 it has been extended twice in 1993 title xiv of pl 10366 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 107 stat 683685 and in 1997 budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 105 33 balanced budget act of 1997 111 stat 677712 the paygo provisions currently apply only to legislation enacted prior to october 1 2002 but the enforcement provisions are scheduled to remain in effect through fy2006 to capture the outyear effects of legislation enacted prior to the expiration 17see also crs report rl30009 tax cut legislation applicable budget enforcement procedures by robert keiththe payasyougo process paygo one of the budgetary limitations first established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 was the payasyougo requirement paygo16 the paygo process requires that legislation decreasing revenues or increasing direct spending may not cause an increase in the deficit or decrease in surplus the budgetary impact of all legislation changing direct spending or revenues is recorded on multiyear paygo scorecard by the office of management and budget omb both omb and the congressional budget office cbo track such legislation and issue reports throughout the year see table 1 below omb is the official scorer of budgetary legislation although congress typically uses estimates prepared by cbo during its consideration of legislation amounts on the paygo scorecard reflect spending and revenue changes for fiscal year based on legislation enacted in prior years as well as that enacted in the current year under the paygo process congress is not prohibited from enacting legislation increasing direct spending or decreasing revenues but all such changes must be offset so that positive balance either deficit increase or surplus decrease remains for any fiscal year if the scorecard shows positive balance at the end of the congressional session the president must issue sequester order to reduce spending in all nonexempt direct spending accounts revenue decreases or direct spending increases that occur under existing law do not require an offset for example decrease in personal income tax revenue due to decrease in the number of people working would not have to be offset while decrease due to legislation reducing the marginal tax rates would17 the control mechanism for this process is not based on achieving specific level of deficit or surplus but instead focuses on the net impact of legislation on the deficit or surplus in its current form any legislation that increases direct spending or decreases revenues needs to be fully offset regardless of whether the projected effect would result in budget deficit or surplushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs8 table 1 sequestration process timetable action to be completed deadline cbo sequestration

is also enforced through freestanding point of order under section 207b of the budget resolution for fy2000 hconres 68 106th congress this point of order prohibits consideration of any direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit for any of three periods 1 the first fiscal year covered by the most recently adopted budget resolution 2 the 5year period covered by the budget resolution or 3 the 5 years following the first 5 years covered by the budget resolution this point of order may be waived by threefifths vote although this point of order would not apply to legislation that used all or part of an onbudget surplus enforcement of the statutory requirements of the current paygo process would still apply revenue legislation in congressional rules house rules the rules of the house deal with four general issues concerning consideration of revenue measures revenue measures like other budgetary matters must be considered by the house in committee of the whole this practice is established under rule xiii clause 1 which requires that bills for raising revenue be placed on the calendar of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union union calendar in addition rule xviii clause 3 requires that all bills resolutions or senate amendments as provided in clause 3 of rule xxii involving tax or charge on the people or raising revenue shall be first considered in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union consideration of revenue legislation in committee of the whole is generally under the terms of resolution from the rules committee known as special rule typically special rule covering revenue measure either prohibits floor amendments or specifies those that may be offered jurisdiction of consideration of revenue measures generally and revenue measures relating to insular possessions is conferred under rule x clause 1s on the committee on ways and means this jurisdiction is reinforced by rule xxi clause 5a which provides thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs9 18this policy is articulated in the congressional record vol 137 january 3 1991 p 66 the speakers announcement at the beginning of the 107th congress stated that this policy would continue to govern but that it need not be reiterated as it is adequately documented as precedent congressional record daily edition vol 147 january 3 2001 p h21 19when originally adopted these provisions were designated as clause 5c and d respectively their designation was changed when the rules of the house were recodified at the beginning of the 106th congress 20see the discussion prior to the ruling in the congressional record vol 141 april 5 1995 pp 1061210615a bill or joint resolution carrying tax or tariff measure may not be reported by committee not having jurisdiction to report tax or tariff measures and an amendmen t in the house or proposed by the senate carrying tax or tariff measure shall not be in order during the consideration of bill or joint resolution reported by committee not having that jurisdiction this rule is further supplemented by house precedent as referenced in policies of the speaker announced at the beginning of each congress this policy has helped clarify guidelines for distinguishing between revenues and other types of receipts such as user fees these guidelines state that other committees may have jurisdiction to consider fees charges and assessments levied on class directly availing itself of or directly subject to governmental service program or activity however measures that include broadbased fees on the general public for financing the cost of government generally are referred to the committee on ways and means18 the third general area concerning revenues covered in house rules is restrictions on their consider ation in the 104th congress the house of representatives adopted two rules changes concerning the consideration of tax measures19 rule xxi clause 5b required that any federal income tax rate increase receive vote of threefifths in order to pass rule xxi clause 5c prohibited the consideration of any federal income tax rate increase that was to be effective before the enactment of the provision that is any retroactive tax increase these new rules were only rarely invoked in the 104th congress the provisions of clause 5c not at all and only once was major ruling made on their application on april 5 1995 during consideration of the contract with america tax relief act of 1995 it was ruled that the prohibition in rule xxi clause 5b did not apply to provision in the bill repealing ceiling on total tax liability attributable to net capital gain20 the rule was also applied march 24 1995 to an amendment offered by representative patsy t mink which would have increased the top corporate income tax rate from 35 to 3625 application was in the form of the chairman of the committee of the whole stating that threefifths of those present not having voted in the affirmative the amendment was rejected however because majority had not voted in the affirmative the application of the rule was moot limiting the precedential value of this instance although the rule was waived in special rules several times during the 104th congress these waivers did little to clarify its application in managing floorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs10 21see remarks of representative solomon in the congressional record vol 142 may 22 1996 p 12184consideration of hres 440 representative gerald b h solomon chairman of the rules committee stated that while chairman archer of the ways and means committee has stated that there is increase in income tax rates included in this bill waiver of the rule requiring threefifths vote to increase income tax rates has been included out of an abundance of caution different people have interpreted the threefifths vote requirement differently and this rule errs on the side of caution21 in order to clarify the rules application the 105th congress added additional language to both of these clauses specifying that the term federal income tax increase means any amendment to subsection b c d or of section 1 or to section 11b or 55b of the internal revenue code of 1986 that imposes new percentage as rate of tax and thereby increases the amount of tax imposed by any such section finally house rule xiii includes two provisions pertaining to information to be provided in connection with reported tax legislation clause h1 requires that tax complexity analysis be prepared for any measure reported by the ways and means committee amending the internal revenue code of 1986 clause h2 allows for dynamic estimate ie one that includes assumptions concerning the potential for macroeconomic feedback effects to be provided for informational purposes for any measure designated as major tax legislation by the majority leader senate rules the only specific language dealing with revenue legislation in senate rules pertains to the issue of jurisdiction rule xxv clause 1i confers jurisdiction over revenue measures generally except as provided in the congressional budget act of 1974 and revenue measures relating to the insular possessions on the committee on finance in addition rule xv clause 5 protects the jurisdiction of all senate committees generally by providing that it shall not be in order to consider any proposed committee amendment other than technical clerical or conforming amendment which contains any significant matter not within the jurisdiction of the committee proposing such amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31197crs11 22section 308a2 applies the same requirement to conference reportsrevenue estimates under section 308a1 of the congressional budget act whenever committee of either house reports measure providing an increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures for fiscal year or fiscal years the accompanying report shall contain statement or the committee shall make available such statement in the case of an approved committee amendmen t which is not reported to its house prepared after consultation with the director of the congressional budget office containing projection by the congressional budget office of how such measure will affect the levels of revenues or tax expenditures under existing law for such fiscal year or fiscal years and each of the four ensuing fiscal years if timely submitted before such report is filed22 for purposes of revenue legislation designated as income estate and gift excise and payroll taxes such as social security section 201f of the congressional budget act requires cbo to use exclusiv ely during that session of congress revenue estimates provided to it by the joint committee on taxation
