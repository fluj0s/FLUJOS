pollutants summary the clean air act amendments of 1990 cont ained four programs to ensure that the environmental protection agency epa would regulate haza rdous air pollutants haps more quickly than the agency d under the original act the first program directed epa to establish emission standa rds for stationary sources of haps based on maximum achievable control technolog mact the second program known as the residual risk program required epa to examine the risk remaining from these sources after implementation of mact standards if warranted epa must promulgate additional standards to protect public hea lth or the environment third congress instructed epa to regulate haps that are particular problem for urban areas fourth congress directed epa to ev aluate mobile sources such as cars to determine their hap emissions and to regulate these sources epa has made progress in regulating haps under some of these programs particularly in comparison to its pre1990 record when only 7 haps were regulated over 20year period but the pace of re gulation has fallen behind that envisioned in the 1990 amendments under the mact program for example the agency originally named 174 source categories subject to regulation for their hap emissions in the statute congress specified that mact standards for all of these categories were to be promulgate d by november 15 2000 by may 15 2002 epa still had not promulgated final standards for 56 source categories little less than onethird of those to be regulated covering co mbined total of 84000 major emitting sources under the 1990 amendments if epa s not promulgated standards by 18 months after the deadline states and industries must deve lop mact standards themselves rather than allow this hammer to strike however epa issued rule in april 2002 that w ill give these s ources until may 15 2004 to develop mact standards the sierra cl ub has filed suit challenging the deadline extension the residual risk program intended to examine whether risk remains after mact standards are implemented is also behind schedule the first residual risk standards for coke ovens were due in 2001 12 other cat egories are to be reviewed before the end of 2002 while epa has veloped methodology for determining residual risk the methodology and the ava ilability of the data for conducting the analyses have been questioned by the agencys science advisory board it is unlikely that epa will meet deadlines for residual risk standards both the urban air toxics and mobile s ource air toxics programs have also been delayed questions have been raised regard ing the adequacy of the mobile source air toxics standards most standards for urba n air toxics have yet to be promulgated issues for congress include the adequacy of agency resources for the haps programs the feasibility of the residual ri sk program given inadequacies of the available data and concerns over the risk assessment methodology and whether the agency is complying with congressional

ond caprolactum was removed by epa in 1996 us ing its authority under section 112b3air toxics what progress has epa made in regulating hazardous air pollutants hazardous air pollutants haps or air toxics are pollutants that are either known or suspected to cause cancer or other adverse health effects such as damage to reproductive functions or bi rth defects polychlorinate d biphenyls pcbs arsenic compounds formaldehyde asbestos methanol and chlorine are just some of the chemicals and chemical com pounds that are considered air toxics haps come from both mobile and stationary sources under the original clean air act caa epa was directed to take riskbased approach to regulating haps congress dissatisfied with the fact that only 7 haps were regulated from 1970 to 1990 using the riskbased approach amended the caa in 1990 to direct epa to use technology based approach to reduce hap emissions separate risk based progra m was also contained in these amendments rather than have epa determine what air toxics s hould be regulated as was done under the original caa congress included sp ecific list of 188 air toxics in the amendments1 some of the air toxics on this list are included in table 2 at the end of this report along with the main sources that produce them the 1990 amendments completely rewrot section 112 of the clean air act and established four diffe rent programs for the regulation of haps maximum achievable control technology residual ris k urban air toxics and mobile source air toxics this report describes these programs including the current status of each program and what significant issues still remain in their imple mentation while epa has made progress in regu lating haps many of the deadlines set by the 1990 amendments have not been met each of th four air toxics programs are behind the schedule envisioned by congress and appear likely to remain so for reasons outlined below maximum achievable control technology standards section 112 of the caa 42 usc 7412 is the main section regulating haps one method of regulation is known as maximum achievable control technology mact the purpose of mact standards is to achieve the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of haps 42 usc 7412d2 there are number of provisions relating to mact first epa was directed to determine major sources of the 188 haps listed in 112b by novemb er 15 1991 epa published the source list in the federal register on july 16 1992 it included 174 source categories 57 frhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs2 31576 sec ond the caa amendments directed epa to develop schedule of promulgation dates for source categor standards by november 15 1992 epa published the schedule december 3 1993 58 fr 63941 section 112e of the clean air act partially determined epa s schedule by requiring promulgation of emissions standards for 40 categories by november 15 1992 25 of categories by november 15 1994 an additional 25 of categ ories by november 15 1997 all categories by november 15 2000 based on epas original listing of 174 source categories the mandated percentage targets listed bove require standards for 40 source categories within 2 years of the enactment of the 1990 amendments total of 44 source categories w ithin 4 years an additional 4 an additional 43 source categories within 7 years all 174 within 10 year s an additional 77 aside from these specific deadlines epa had discretion in prioritizing promulgation of standards based on ad verse effects on public health and the environment the quantity and location of haps emissions and the efficiency of grouping source categories based on polluta nts rather than based on processes the standard to which sources will be held the mact standard is codified in section 112d2 as the maximum degree of reduction in em issions includi ng prohibition on such emissions where achievable th at the administrator taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction and any nonair quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements determines is achievable for new or existing sources the law requires that standards for new sources be less stringent than the emissions control achieved in practice by the bestcontrolled similar source existing sources may have less stringent standard than new sources but not less stringent than either the average control achieved by the bestperforming 12 of existing sources or the average control achieved by the bestperforming 5 sources if there are fewer than 30 sources of the hap thes minimum standards for new and existing sources are known as mact floors section 112 distinguishes between majo r sources and area sources major source is stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 10 tons or more per year of any single hap or 25 tons or more per year of any combination of haps an area source is stationary source that emits less than these threshold amounts although area sources do not emit as much pollution as major sources area sources may create local pollution problems partic ularly in densely populated urban areas in regulating area sources the administrator of the epa may decide to base emission standards on generally achievable cont rol technologyor gact rather than mact httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs3 congress also provided an assurance that air pollutants would be regulated even if epa failed to promulgate standards for source categories on time this is known as the mact hammer sec tion 112j states that if epa has not promulgated standards by 18 months after the deadline then owners and operators will be forced to apply to states for permits and states will have to create regulations for the remaining unregulated source categories the last hammer date was may 15 2002 for mact standards that were due november 15 2000 current status epa missed the may 15 deadline for 56 source categories final rules for 10 source categories were promulgated as of july 22 2002 meaning 46 source categories remain with final ma ct standards however some of these source categories are the subject of propos ed mact standards which might be of assistance to states and industries s hould they be required to develop mact standards themselves table 1 shows the evolution of epas ma ct schedule the first row gives the number of additional source categories due at each statutory deadline based on the percentage targets given in the 1990 amendm ents for instance the standards for 4 source categories due by november 15 1994 ar in addition to the standards for 40 source categories epa had to complete by november 15 1992 epas original schedule was published december 3 1993 the numbers in the second row are based on this schedule epa has updated its schedule several times since then the numbers in the third row reflect epas february 2002 schedule epa refers to source categories as being in bins source categories with standards due november 14 1992 are the 2 year bin and source categories with standards due november 15 1994 are the 4y ear bin the numbers in the last row reflect how many source categories in each of the bins have final standards for instance of the 6 source categories in the 2year bin epa has promulgated mact standards for all of them thus epa is finished with the 2year bin epa is also finished promulgating standard s for source categories in the 4year and 7year bins it should be noted that the numbers in th last row do not reflect how many source categories had standards prom ulgated by the deadlines rather the numbers reflect how many source categories scheduled for that deadline have been finalized number of the standards in the 2year 4year and 7year bins we re promulgated after their respective deadlines had passed the total column of table 1 reflects the total number of source categories epa has listed of the 196 source categorie s epa had identified by july 2002 epa is finished with 150 of them 87 sour ce categories have final standards and 63 source categories have been delisted indi cating epa has decided not to promulgate standard for that category or subsumed incorporated into broader category for which mact standard has been promul gated thus 46 source categories remain with final mact standards all of these source categories are in the 10year binhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515 crs4 table 1

2001under the clean air act owners and operators of facilities for which mact standards were not finalized were to submit complete permit applications by may 15 2002 but on april 5 2002 epa promulgated final rule to ease the requirements for these sources allowing them an additional two years to submit most of the information required in permit application state permit applications or title v pe rmits are sub mitted in two parts part 1 contains basic information about the facility while part 2 is much more detailed and requires identification of mact the mact floor and other information at minimum epa noted that part 1 would have to be submitted by the hammer date to comply with the statute therefore every facility that could reasonably be expected to be subject to mact standards had to submit part 1 application by may 15 2002 however epa extended the deadline to submit part 2 of the application to may 15 2004 epa anticipates promulgating all mact ru by this later date increasing the time to submit the part 2 application sures that the estimated 84000 facilities that were subject to the mact hammer provisions will not needlessly expend resources determining casebycase mact standards the sierra club filed suit against the epa challenging the april 5 rule extending the deadline in the sierra clubs view epas action was clearly illegal under the caa as of july 2002 this case was in settleme nt negotiations2 according to epas office of air quality planning and standards settlement with the sierra club may include decreasing the amount of time for permit submission from two years to 18 months or even one year3 another recent controvers ial mact matter involves new source category in december 2000 epa added coal and oilfired electric utility steam generating units to its list of source categories under s ection 112n1a c ongress directed epa to study hap emissions from these sources and regulate them if appropriate and necessary4 congress also directed epa to study mercury emissions from these sources5 in the 2000 notice epa remarked that it did not find regulation of hap emissions for naturalgasfire d electric utility steam generating units to be necessary however coal and oilfired units would be subject to mact standards for mercury emissions two utility groups filed suit shor tly after the ruling to challenge epas listing of the source category6 although the case was dismissed this rulemaking proposal for which is expected in 2003 may be one of the most controversial mact standards that epa will issue because so utilities do not belie ve they should be subject to mact for mercury emissions and are likely to file lawsuits once epa issues mact standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs6 7personal communication tom coda us

lawyers in the sierra club case have expressed concern that epa will not be able to prom ulgate all mact standards by 2004 if that is the case the amount of money the states would have to spend to determine site specific standards could be significant epa estimated in its april 5 rule that the cost to affected facilities to file part 1 of the per mit would be 9000000 67 fr 16593 businesses on the other hand have estimated that the co sts to determine caseby case mact part 2 of the permit app lication could be between 10000 and 50000 per affected facility with epas estimate of 84000 facilities that are subject to the mact hammer the costs could run fro m 840 million to 42 billion to determine casebycase standards by contrast epa spent only 17 milli on annually in fy2001 and 2002 on the mact program the agencys request for 2003 calls for cut in program spending to 12 million epas position is that spending can be cut because the regulation development program is winding down7 it is the case that standards remain to be issued for less than half of epas identified source categories however delays continue in the program and the outcome of the mact hammer extension is still unclear epa may not need as large budg et because proposed standards for many of the remaining source categories have already been developed however the decreased budget request may also reflect sense that some of the burden for developing mact standa rds may now fall to states and industries the residual risk program second program of the 1990 caa amendm ents is known as the residual risk program this program found in section 112f consists of two parts report to congress and the developmen t of additional hap emissi ons standards the report to congress due november 15 1996 was re quired to include number of items available methods of reducing residual risk and their costs public health significance of residual risk actual health effects to peopl living near emissions sources risks from background concentrations of haps negative health or environmental eff ects created by reducing residual risk available epidemiological and other health studies methods of calculating residual risk uncertainties in the risk assessment methodology recommendations regarding gislation on residual risk epa issued its residual risk report to congress in march 19998 because epa had not issued any residual risk standards at the time of the report many of the mandated items were answered generally rather than specifically epa did not provide concrete info rmation for any of the first si x items listed above for instancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs7 9the commission on risk assessment and risk management was temporary body established by section 303 of the 1990 caa amendments this commission consisted of 10 appointees and was to evaluate several aspects of risk assessment as well as the results of the national academy of sciences report 10epa residual risk report to congress p 113 11epa residual risk report to congress p 106epa addressed broad methods of reducing residual ri sk but did not address any specific technological or commercially available methods to reduce risks in the report epa did broadly outline its residual risk framework this framework is based on met hodology developed by the na tional research council of the national academy of sciences and the commission on risk assessment and risk management9 epa noted that uncertainties associated with this framework fall into four categories uncertainties surr ounding exposure uncertainty in models uncertainties in input values and inherent data variance the agency identified some questions that can be asked to reduce the uncertainty associated with residual risk calculation epa elected not to make any recommendations regarding legislation on residual risk as the agency felt the current legislation gave it sufficient authority and flexibility finally epa noted in the report that it plans to set priorities for assessing residual risk based on achieving the larg est most costeffective risk reductions first while still respecting statutory deadlines based on mact promulgation10 the second part of the residual risk pr ogram is the promulgation of additional standards congress in section 112f2 directed epa to develop more stringent standards for the source categories identifie d under the mact program if they would be necessary to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health or to prevent adverse environmental impacts when assessing whether adverse environmental impacts should be prevente d epa is to take into account costs energy safety and other rele vant factors if mact sta ndards have not reduced the lifetime cancer risk of the most exposed person to one in one million then epa should promulgate dditional standards residual risk standards are to be promulgated within 8 years 9 years for mact standards due november 15 1992 after the promulgation of mact standards the standards become effec tive immediately upon promulgation however existing sources have up to 90 days to meet the st andards and can apply for waiver of up to 2 years section 112f5 exempts epa from assessing residual risks of area sources subject to generally achievable control t echnology gact standards however epa has interpreted the legislation to mean that residual risk must still be assessed for area sources subject to mact standards11 current status the first mact standards we re promulgated september 22 1993 because these standards were due november 15 1992 epa has 9 years to issue the standards thus the latest date to promulgate residual risk standards for the first group of sources is september 22 2002 epa promulgated standards for coke ovens on november 27 1993 because these standards had st atutorily mandated promulgation date of december 31 1992 only 8 years are allowed for residual risk standard setting thus under this schedule epa was slat ed to issue residual riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs8 12sab executive committee commentar on residual risk program epasabeccom 00005 p 2 httpwwwepagov sabeccm005pdf june 11 2002 13sab executive committee

however epa has not yet issued residual risk standards for any source categories epa did release draft residual risk case study of secondary lead smelters in 2000 for review by its science advisory board the science advisory board sab is an advisory body of independent expert s who provide scientif ic advice and review to the agency and relevant congressiona l committees although the sab stated that epas document used assumptions consiste nt with current practice and consistent with the report to congress methodology the sab also expressed concerns about missing elements and data remaining issues not long after its review of the draft residual risk case study on secondary lead smelters the sab commented unfavorably on epas ability to carry out residual risk assessment in credible manner12 the sabs concern stems from the dearth of scientific and monitoring information available regarding haps emissions the sab is not certain that scientific analysis will be able to generate the type of info rmation envisioned in the c lean air act amendments13 this comment on the residual risk progra m and the sabs request in the comment that congress review the mandates of the caa amendments led to senate environment and public works committ ee hearing on october 3 2000 that was partially intended to examine issues with residual risk in their testimony witness from sciences international inc witness from the sab and witness representing the american chemistry council acc addressed the lack of resources available to epa to complete residual risk assessments14 the sab witness and the acc witness questioned the viability of the models used by epa on account of lack of peer review the acc witness and the sciences international witness noted that epas risk information database contains outdated information the witness from the acc indicated concern about the inability of epa to make residual risk determinations by the statutory deadlines the witness from the sab and the witness from sciences international criticized epa for using overly conservative estimates in its assessments the sciences international witness noted that such estimates could result in significant number of overestimated risks the witness representing the acc also criticized the residual risk program because of the mandate th at industry comply with residual risk standards within 90 days of their promulga tion this witness noted that meeting this timetable may be impossibl for many industries however witness from the national wildlife federation noted the importance of the residual risk program positive co mments from this witne ss about the residual risk program included its ability to be comprehensive in its approach to address harm from persistent bioaccumulative toxics and to incorporate cumulative risk epa alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs9 15robert brenner testimony of robert bre nner deputy assistant administrator office of air and radiation us

commentary p 1defended its residual risk approach stating that its residual risk estimates are plausible because they reflect the suggestions of the scientific community further epa stated that it does not use conservative assumptions for all the parameters that go into residual risk assessment in fact epa noted that where we lack adequate information to support quan titative assessment for pollu tant we implicitly assume that the risks from that pollutant are zero15 in july 2001 epa requested informa tion from the public on improvements to the integrated risk information system iris this database is the one that was criticized by certain witnesses at the senate hearing for being outdated and inaccurate epa indicated it would use the information provided to set the iris 20022005 agenda as well as determine the need for updating iris more frequently and for adding new chemicals to the data base summary of this needs assessment is to be posted on epas iris webpage when completed as of july 2002 this summary had not yet been posted it is unclear whether epas methodology will be successful in meeting the goals congress envisioned in setting up the residua l risk program while this methodology has been reviewed by the scientific community and the sab asserts that the agency has made good faith start16 in using the methodology it may be that the science and data available at this point in time are not adequate for such rigorous assessment epa has missed the deadline for coke oven residual risk standards decisions on 12 other standards are due by the end of 2002 it is unlikely that any of these standards will be promulgated by that deadline the urban air toxics program under section 112k3 of the clean ai r act epa is required to develop strategy to address air toxics in urban areas these air toxics are generally emitted from area sources area sources can be distinguished from major sources as discussed in the mact section area sour ces are defined as those sources emitting or having the potential to emit less than 10 tons of any single hap or less than 25 tons of any combination of haps per year congress ordered epa to identify at least 30 air toxics emitted from area sources that represent the greatest threat to urban public health and to identify the sources of these air toxics area sources th at represent 90 of emissions of each of the 30 air toxics must be subject to standards such as mact or gact section 112k3bii congress also directed that this strate gy shall achieve reduction in the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to haps emitted by stationary sources of not less than 75 percent sec tion 112k3c the strategy was to be submitted to congress by november 15 1995httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs10 epa released the final in tegrated urban air toxics strategy on july 19 1999 64 fed reg 3870638740 this strategy identified 33 urban haps with 30 of these having significant contributions from area sources the haps and their main sources can be found in table 2 at the nd of this report epa identified 29 area source categories of the 33 urban haps in releasing the strategy the agency also delineated its time line to implement the rest of the requirements under section 112k by 2004 epa expects to promulga standards for the new area source categories it identified in the strategy some area source categories were already regulated or were proposed for regulation under mact sta ndards or other authorities of the caa by 2006 epa expects to promul gate additional standards to meet the statutory requirement that sources repres enting 90 of the emissions of each urban hap be controlled epa expects to fini sh promulgating these standards in 2009 because compliance is required by later than 3 years from promulgation of the standard epa projects that all sources will be in compliance by 2012 however under the original deadlines outlined in the caa all sources were scheduled to have been in compliance with the strategy by november 15 1999 congress also directed epa to establish research program to study the health effects of haps section 112 k2 epas nationwide program is known as the nationalscale air toxics assessment nata nata gives an inventory of air toxics their ambient concentrations estimates of population exposures and characterization of the potential public health risk of these urban air toxics epa will use this information to develop baselin information determine the progress made in meeting reduction goals and prioritize the list of urban haps in the future nata is expected to evaluate all 188 haps and diesel particulate matter current status in may 2002 epa finished rel easing the first nata data the first set of nata data is based on 1996 emissions data for the 33 urban haps these data show that when risks from ll urban air toxics are combined 200 million people are estimated to have potential cancer risk greater than ten in one million for 20 million people the potential cancer risk is estimated to be greater than 100 in one million nata found benzene chromium and formaldehyde to pose the greatest potential risk of cancer across the entire united states while arsenic coke oven emissions 13butadiene and polycyclic organic matter pose the greatest potential risk of cancer regionally table 2 at the end of this report identifies the main sources of these urban haps epa also used nata to assess the cancer risk from background sources of urban haps epa estimates that the entir population of the united states exceeds cancer risk of ten in one million due to background concentrations of air toxics compounds this assessment partially answ ers one question epa left open in its 1999 residual risk report to congress epas integrated urban air toxics strategy noted that the agency would conduct research program at the urban level this urba n research program takes case study approach studying few cities that will serve as models for understanding urban haps risk the first city selected as pilot for this project is cleveland ohio the pilot project began in march 2001 the three goals for the project are to reduce air toxi cs in

bus transportation and toxics collection day section 112k5 also requi red epa to provide reports to congress in 1998 and 2002 in these reports congress directed ep to include information on the actions taken to reduce public health risks from area source hap emissions and to identify urban areas that have high risks to public health due to continuing emissions from area sources epa submitted its first urban air toxics report to congress in 200017 in this report epa did not identify the sp ecific urban areas with continuing health risks epa did outline the steps it will take to reduce public health risks from haps based on the final integrated urban air to xics strategy released in 1999 epa also identified thirteen subject areas in need of further research in the 2000 report remaining issues epa has not yet regulated at least 13 of the area source categories identified in its 1999 integrated urban air toxics strategy since issuing the strategy epa has added 19 area source categories bringing the total number of area source categories to 4818 of these additional area source categories 18 have yet to be regulated epas sche dule indicates that the area sources responsible for 90 of the emissions of each of the urban haps will not all be regulated until 2009 in addition epa still needs to identify the metropolita n areas with increased health risks due to continued emissions of haps the recently released nata data are most meaningful at the state or national level and therefore do not help epa identify metropolitan areas with increased health risks the mobile source air toxics program congress included in the caa amendments of 1990 program to evaluate and regulate air toxics from mobile sources under section 202l of the caa codified as 42 usc 7521 congress directed epa to complete study on the need for and feasibility of controlling mobile source air toxics msats the focus for the study was to be on those msats posing the greates t risk to human health or that have significant uncertainty associated with their risks to health in particular benzene formaldehyde and 13butadiene were to be included in the study the study was due may 15 1992 epa completed the st udy in 1993 and updated it in 1999 subsequent to the study epa was dir ected to promulgate rules containing reasonable requirements to control ms at emissions the regulations are to achieve the greatest degree of emission reduc tion through the application of available technology taking into consideration cost s noise energy safety lead time and standards previously set under section 202a 42 usc 7521l2 at minimum congress charged epa with promulgatin g rules applying to benzene andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs12 formaldehyde these regulations are to be promulgated under sections 202a1 and 211c1 section 202a1 requires epa to regu late msat emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines when there is danger to the public health and welfare section 211c1 allows epa to control or prohibit the manufacture introduction or sale of fuel or fuel additives that either 1 contribute to air pollution that endangers the public health or welfare or 2 impairs the performance of emission control devices that are either currently in use or are expected to be in use in reasonable time section 202a1 applies only to motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines while section 211c 1 applies to fuel being used in motor vehicles in motor vehicle engines in nonroad engines or in nonroad vehicles current status in march 2001 epa issued its final msat emission control rule 66 fed reg 1723019273 this rule identified 21 msats including 13 that are also considered urban air toxics twenty of these air toxics are listed in section 112b of the caa the last msat is dies particulate matter and diesel emission organic gases dpm deog which are part of diesel exhaust diesel exhaust is not included in the list of 188 air toxics developed by congress though many of its constituent chemicals are in its final rule epa noted that new vehicle standards section 202a1 were necessary at the time to reduce impacts on the public health and welfare several programs that were put in place to meet other requirements of the clean air act have reduced msat emissions including the national low emission vehicle program limits on gasoline volatility the reformulated gasoline program and the phase out of leaded gas epa did finalize fuelbas ed standard under section 211c1 authority in the march 2001 rule this fuelbased standard is known as the gasoline toxic emission performance requirement or tpr tpr requires that gasoline not exceed the average total toxic emissions emitted from 19982000 beginning january 1 2002 these emissions include benzene and formaldehy among others thus complying with congress desire that epa regulate these two msats this standard essentially codifies the fact that many refineries we re overcomplying with emissions standards during the 19982000 period thus the rule prevents future increases in msat emissions that might have occurred had refineries stopped making gasoline that overcomplied with the previous standards in the rule epa committed to future rulemaking by 2004 epas first nata assessment provided some information on the hazards of mobile sources according to the first t of nata data which again is based on 1996 emissions more than 100 million people f ace cancer risk of greater than ten in one million from mobile sources epas assessment also estimates that approximately 200 million people face noncancer risk respiratory irritation from emissions of acrolein that are above re ference concentrations however epa believes that by 2007 existing standards for new vehicles will have decreased risks of onroad exposures to 50 of 1996 leve ls risks of nonroad exposures are also expected to decrease remaining issues the march 2001 msat ru was not without controversy because epa d originally proposed to regulate only the benzenehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31515crs13 19sierra club v epa 011228 dc cir filed may 24 2001content of gasoline but then finalized the rule as one that regulates gasoline toxic emission performance many re fineries were surprised by the final rule some in the industry noted that the final rule c ould be very expensive for refiners epa however believed that the rule would not impose large costs on the industry because the rule did not ask industry to install an new technology environmental groups and others disagreed with industry and sued epa claiming that the rule did not go far enough in regulating mobile air toxics19 these groups consider epa to be in violation of the caa because the agency has not promulgated any rules to control msat emissions the case has not yet been adjudicated conclusions congress amended the caa in 1990 in part to ensure that epa would regulate haps more quickly than it had in the previous 20 years although epa has made much more progress under the programs created in 1990 than it had under the 1970 act all four of the air toxics prog rams are behind schedule while epa has promulgated mact standards for 87 sour ce categories as of july 22 2002 46 source categories remain without fi nal standards if epas ex tension of the mact hammer deadline is found to be unlawful states nd industries will have to determine their own mact standards on casebycase basis such an endeavor could be costly standards have been issued in th residual risk program decisions on 12 standards are statutorily mandated for the nd of 2002 but are unlikely to be finished according to epas own urban air toxics schedule released in 1999 the urban air toxics program is about 13 years behi nd the schedule established by congress finally the fuelbased standards for mobile source hap emissions have been challenged for not going far enough in regulating these sources in light of the deadlines that were missed and will continue to be missed by epa congress might decide to examine th factors that have contributed to the agencys difficulty in implementing the f our air toxics programs under the schedule congress established these factors might include lack of adequate resources limitations of the available data and analytical tools or management issues within epa among other
