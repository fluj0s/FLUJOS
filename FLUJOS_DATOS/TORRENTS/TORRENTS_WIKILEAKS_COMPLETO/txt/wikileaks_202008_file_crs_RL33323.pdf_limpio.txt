veterans2 disability compensation the focus of this report provides monthly cash benefit if the veteran is at least 10 disabled as consequence of hisher military service which is considered to be serviceconnected disability 3 veteran applying for service connected disability compensation does not need to be totally disabled have low income or wartime military service in contrast disability pension may be paid to wartime veteran with limited income who is longer able to work or is at least age 654 disability pension is not related to serviceconnected injury or medical condition and takes into account the material needs of the veteran it is needsbased pension5 g22g145g142g561g515g14g152g140g138g149g561g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g516g561 the v analyzes each

disability and makes determination of the percentage of the disability 1 see generally federal benefits for veterans and dependents published by the departments of veterans affairs 2008 edition

compensation is to assist currently disabled veterans whose injury is connected to military service and to that end veteran must meet three basic criteria to the v as satisfaction10 one recent medical diagnosis of current impairment disability or disease two medical or on occasion lay evidence of an inservice occurrence or aggravation of the disease or injury three medical proof of connection between the current disability and the in service occurrence or aggravation of an injury or illness each of these requirements is examined below

disability compensation is available only to veterans with current disabilities11 although veteran may have been ill or sustained an injury while in service the mere fact that this occurred is not compensable to provide evidence of the current medical problem the veteran may submit medical records of the current diagnosis andor treatment letters from physicians may be added to the record generally speaking lay evidence of medical condition is not sufficient the v has certain duties to assist veterans in the application process12 the v must assist by providing the veteran with the appropriate records13 usually the v is required to provide veterans with medical exam in order to diagnose current medical condition14 however in certain circumstances the v may not be required to provide such an examination or assistance to the veteran15 in addition 8 38 usc 1155 38 cfr 4 see discussion below 9 see barton f stichman et veterans benefits manual at 315 hereinafter cited as

that there is medical or under certain circumstances lay evidence of an inservice occu rrence or aggravation of disease or injury the inservice requirement is construed broadly disability incident or onset of disability is not required to be related to the veterans military responsibilities and is covered even if it occurred during leave18 further the evidence submitted on the record must only demonstrate that it is as likely as not that there was an inservice aggravation or occurrence of disease or injury when there is nearly equal positive and negative evidence regarding material issue the secretary of veterans affairs is required to give the benefit of the doubt to the veteran 19 the veteran must submit corroborating evidence of the incident and statement describing the occurrence disease or injury in detail along with the circumstances surrounding the event20 the type of evidence that the veteran must submit may depend upon the type of injury or disease which is being connected to the time of service for example veteran who sustained fall while inservice might produce evidence of medical treatment for the fall at the time of its occurrence and evidence from military personnel who witnessed the fall g15g142g141g146g140g138g149g561g18g155g152g152g143g561g152g143g561g138g561g5g152g151g151g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g4g142g157g160g142g142g151g561g561

requires link between the current injury or illness requirement 1 and that the disease injury or event happened during period of military service requirement 2 this requirement is sometimes known as serviceconnected the service connection or the nexus requirement statutes and regulations require proof of one of five types of connections one there is direct connection between the current disability and an incident that happened during the period of military service 21 two the current medical condition existed prior to service but was exacerbated during service22 three the current medical problem did not appear during military service but is 16 38 usc 5102b 17 38 usc 5103a 18 for example veteran may receive compensation for medical c ondition that resulted from sports injury

connection the claim must contain adequate medical evidence26 what this signifies is that for the inservice connection to be approved the veteran must have medical proof that the disease injury or

the v is required by law to use certain standards in reviewing veterans claims and the v has certain statutory obligations in the preparation of the veterans case in addition statute and regulations provide for certain presumptions of disability as result of certain occurrences these standards requirements and presumptions are summarized below

incident and current disability but in assessing evidence on these elements the veteran is to be given the benefit of the doubt 27 the statute provides that when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of matter the secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant 28 regulations provide that when reasonable doubt arises such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant29 hence in order to satisfy this element the submitted medical evidence generally needs to show that it is as likely as not that there is connection between the inservice injury occurrence or illness and the current disability continued service if the va determines that the exacerbation resulted from the natural progression of the disease 23 38 usc 1112 1116 1133 38 cfr 33073309 38 cfr 3313b if the disability claimed is disease which was not diagnosed or recorded on the veterans service record the va is required to ascertain

exacerbation the va will then decide whether the problem may be serviceconnected on secondary basis this reasoning is based on the theory that it was proximately caused by serviceconnected condition

other things the v is required to advise the veteran of the type of evidence that must be submitted to substantiate the claim30 the v also must make service and medical records available to veterans

if the medical impairment was noted at the time of entry into service the veteran may have to prove that the condition was exacerbated inservice if the v is able to prove by clear and unmistakable

rating system to categorize veterans degree of disability for inservice injuries38 this system is implemented by the v through series of complex regulations and procedures after the v determines that disability is serviceconnected the v regional office goes through review process the rating activity to determine the disability rating on percentage basis as used by the v the term disability is

congress the v set up the schedule for rating disabilities srdor v asrd which rates various disabilities on percentage basis 40 the statute provides for ten grades of disability and the higher the

injuries or diseases that impact particular body functionsparts including the musculoskeletal system eyes and other functions such as hearing infectious diseases respiratory system cardiovascular

diagnoses with numerical diagnostic code dc that breaks down percentages of disability based upon the severity of the disability45 each degree of disability under each dc has description of the

medical records to determine the medical diagnosis for the veterans serviceconnected disability the v then finds the applicable diagnostic code for the disability and finds the degree of disability that is appropriate to the symptoms and diagnosis of the veterans conditi on if rating falls between two ratings and the symptoms are closer to the higher rating then the higher rating will be selected47 in makings its determination the v examines all of the avai lable evidence including service records lay statements and medical records and other evidence48

the diagnostic codes to veterans claims number of variables come into play some of which may be quite complex and while every rating has unique circumstances v ratings in similar cases may not always seem consistent having to make fine distinctions within an intricate rating system based on reading of veterans symptoms inevitably leads to some claims that rating is wrong or underrated another potential complication in the rating process is that medical condition may be able to be rated under more than one diagnostic code sometimes to the detriment of the veteran in addition not all disabilities and their symptoms and complications are listed on the rating chart in which case an analogous condition may be used for the rating 49 further complication in the rating system occurs when veteran has two or more service connected disabilities in such circumstance the overall percentage of disability is determined by combining the individual ratings but not by adding them together to calculate the appropriate combined rating the v considers each impairment in the order of its severity direction on how to make these determinations is contained in the combined rating table in the v regulations 50 g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561g146g151g561g24g142g157g142g155g138g151g156g514g561g20g138g157g146g151g144g156g561 should the severity of the serviceconnected disability increase over time the veteran may apply for an increase in the rated percentage of disability 51 similarly should the condition improve the ratings percentage may be decreased and the monthly payments would
