government has pr ovided guarantees and subsidies to approved private lenders or certain state government entities that make student loans college graduates enhanced human capital is generally not viewed as collateral lenders without federal subs idies and guarantees would charge interest rates more in line with other unsecured loans such as credit card debt that could push the financial costs of higher education bey ond the reach of many students and their families although federal subsidies for student lenders have probably expanded access to higher education some observers have contended that subsidy rates were higher than necessary to ensure students access to educational loans the college cost reduction and access act pl 11084 enacted in september 2007 was motivated in part by the impression that lender subsidies within the federal family education loan ffel program had been higher than necessary the act cut interest rate subs idies to lenders and increased the proportion of default costs borne by lenders starting in february 2008 some student lenders encountered difficulties in the secondary loan market market in wh ich securities backed by bundles of student loans often

lenders are willing to make and the lender interest rate funding costs student lenders obtain capital in ways similar to other commercial lenders in traditional banki ng model banks use deposits to make student loans that they can hold on thei r own books lenders can also obtain funds by borrowing in the short and mediumt erm commercial paper market in the past two decades however securitization has b ecome an increasingly important source of funds for lenders many lenders in the student loan market as elsewhere use securitization procedures that allow them to sell pack ages of thousands of individual loans to outside investors most st udent lenders transform many of the loans they originate into student loan assetbacked securities slabs which can be sold to investors or financial institutions27 according to one market expe rt about 85 of student loans are typically securitized28 securitization allows lenders to concentrate on originating loans if they choose not to hold those loans in their own portfolios most financial analysts have viewed such securitization strategies as way to reduce the costs of lending although some lenders such as sallie mae the rgest issuer of

after october 8 1998 student loans cannot be discharged through bankruptcy unless narrowly defined undue hardship requirements are metportfolios29 many other firms warehouse some loans that are in the

movements and velopments in particular severe tightening of credit in international capital markets has had sign ificant effects on student lenders as interest rate spreads increased in late 2007 and early 2008 the cost of funds to commercial borrowers including student lenders has increased origination fees and administrative costs origination costs include not only fees paid to the federal governme nt for guaranteed loans but also the administrative costs of transactions with students and their schools student loan marketing costs have increased sharply as lenders have attempted to expand their market shares especially in the private loan market31 on the other hand new information and communication technologie s have sharply increased productivity in the banking industry

interest rates rounded up to the nearest oneeighth of 1 on the loans at the time of consolidation students that only hold fixedrate loans th erefore cannot obtain more advantageous interest rate through consolidation 36 many college students work at least part time nonetheless time spent working can reduce the quantity of time available for studying or the intensity of study or bothbacked assets bear the costs of private loan defaults according the most recent data defaults among students attending proprietary schools are higher than among students attending public or private institutions and default rates for students at fouryear institutions are lower than for students at twoyear programs34 prepayment risk lenders face prepayment risks when borrowers can consolidate or refinance loans at lower in terest rates which can reduce lender profit margins for example when students consolidate loans one or more existing loans are paid off using funds from new loan lenders who had held those existing loans receive early repayment and thus r eceive additional in terest payments prepayment trends are highly dependent on changes in inte rest rates when interest rates fall more borrowers with variablerate loans find it worthwhile to prepay35 in the past year benchmark in terest rates have fallen sh arply which may encourage some borrowers to prepay loans fede ral laws however rest rict consolidation options of students the introduction of fixed 68 borrower rate for stafford loans at the beginning of july 2006 as we ll as the scheduled reduction in borrower rates enacted in the college cost reduction and access act may reduce the value of consolidation options for many borrowers and thus may reduce prepayment risks to lenders demand demand for student loans largely depends on the costs of higher education the perceived value of obtaining higher edu cation and the value of alternatives to attending college such as working36 demand curve for student loans shows the relationship between the volume of loans borrowers are willing to take and the price of those loans that is the borrower interest rate change in any of the factors underlyi ng student loan demand will cause the demand curve to shift for example the college premium defined as the difference between average wages of college gradua tes and those who did not attend college has increased over the last quarter century giving students and their families greater incentive to invest in higher education an increase in the college premium other things equal causes the demand curve to sh ift so that larger volume of student loans is demanded at given borrower interest rate an appendix explains shifts in demand and supply curv in more detail other changes may have ambiguous ffects on the demand for student loans the cost of college attendance has increased in real terms over the past few decades which may discourage some students from enrolling but may increase demand forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34578crs12 37 this discussion ignores spillover benefits to society spillover benefits can be accommodated into the analysis by adding the value of those spillovers to society to the demand curve which reflects only benefits to student or family to obtain marginal social benefit msb schedule the socially efficient loan volume is then set by the intersection of the msb schedule and the supply curve 38 if the lender rate were below the intersection of supply and demand curves then the deadweight loss triangle would lie below the demand curve and above the supply curve to the left of their intersection reflecting the ss in social wellbeing due to an inefficiently low volume of student loans the size and shape of other components would also changeloans among those students who do enroll economic conditions might also have ambiguous effects on demand for student loans during economic downturns students ability to pay for higher edu cation may decrease although the opportunity cost of going to college may fall if ot her options such as working or nonacademic training programs become less attractive simple model of the ffel student loan market interest rates paid by borrowers and those received by lenders for federally guaranteed loans are set legislatively because interest rates which act as the price of loan are not set by market mechanism the student loan market will not clear either lenders will be willing to supply more loans at the legislatively set lender interest rate than borrowers are willing to accept at the borrower interest rate or more borrowers will want loans at their interest rate than lenders are willing to supply at their interest rate figure 3 illustrates two cases in the first diagram demand for student

intersection of demand and supply curves so that the social costs of some loans exceed the benefits gained by society the resulting reduction in economic well being is called deadweight loss37 an inefficiently low volume of student loans would also generate deadweight loss lenders earn economic rents rectangle because they receive price that exceeds their costs an economic rent is payment above the minimum needed to induce given amount of supply small re duction in the lender in terest rate shrinks rectangle hence squeezing lenders rents without reducing loan supply in the second case

as shown in case 1 in figure 3 some economists and political scientists have argued that other market participants or political actors would try to capture some portion of those rents40 in the guaranteed student loan market many lenders provide colleges and universities with logistical and administrative support the provision of such services to schools could stem from schools ability to

banking along with the student loan indus try has changed dramatically in the last decades mergers and acquisitions am ong banks and other fi nancial institutions claimed to have increased banking sector efficiency also helped consolidate student lending lenders in the student loan market like firms in any competitive market have different cost structures and some lenders may have competitive advantages in specific types of loans or in dealing with specific types of students as margins narrow either because legislative action s raised fees and cut subsidies or because of more difficult economic conditions lessefficient firms could face strong pressures to leave segments of the student loan market if other firms can serve those markets more efficiently those firms will gain market share at the expense of exiting firms if firm can earn profits however firms exit and loan supply shrinks if economic and legislative changes affect guaranteed student loan markets some market segments are more likely to be affected than others the average size of loans for students at fouryear colleges and universities are larger than for twoyear college students which reduces the ratio of

more co stly to the lender lenders may perceive that some types of students or some areas of study are more prone to default or require higher servicing costs also legislative changes may interact with financial market conditions to affect particular market segments for example salle mae announced in april 2008 that it would stop offering federal consolidation loans claiming that combination of lower federal subsidies and credit crunch made such loans unprofitable48 empirical evidence economic theory cannot predict exactly how student loan providers react to changes in financial markets andor legislation because some factors have ambiguous effects and because magnitudes of key parame ters can affect the size and direction of effects on market outcomes such issues can only be resolved by empirical research few studies have examined how lenders have reacted to past changes in sap subsidy levels and have found measurable effects on the supply of guaranteed student loans 1994 study found that the supply of student loans did not respond to changes in subsidy levels49 crs analysis conducted in 2007 also found that changes in sap subsidy leve ls from 1997 through 2006 had statistically significant effect on the supply of stude nt loans the analysis did find some statistically significant effects suggesting that lower interest rates for borrowers increased the demand for student loans50 analyses of historical data however may not reflect lender responses to recent subsid cuts or during what some have termed an unusually severe credit crunch student lending and the credit crunch developments in financial markets especially those associated with mortgage securities have led many investors to become more cautious and less willing to accept risk investors therefore have been demanding greater compensation for taking risks in the form of higher interest rate spreads figure 4 shows the spread difference between 3month aarated fi nancial commercial paper securities

auctionratesecurities0606pdfthe theory of finance implies that investors require higher interest rates to hold fixed rate securities that force them to bear more interestrate risks many borrowers such as municipalities and student loan originators therefore viewed auctionrate securities as cheaper way of raising funds compared to alternative borrowing strategies widespread auction failure s starting in midfebruary 2008 however left those markets with very little liquidity casting doubt on the future viability of auctionrate securities54 an issuer of auctionrate securities such as student lender typically engages brokerdealer usually major inves tment bank to underwr ite and distribute securities the brokerdealer and issuer choose an auction agent typically bank who oversees operation of the auction mech anism the period between auctions is not standard but is often 7 28 or 35 days before each au ction interested investors state how much of an issue they wish to hold and specify the lowest interest rate they are willing to accept the auction agent then compiles these bids and parcels out holdings to investors with the lowest interest rates until the entire issue is taken up the interest rate of the st bidder assigned portion rmed the clearing rate is then paid to holders until the next aucti on bidders who specified an interest rate above the clearing rate r eceive none of the issue55 if bidders requests are insufficient to take up the whole issue then the auction fails the interest rate is set by terms of the securitization contract and investors holding portion of the issue retain their stake for issuers failure of an auction often raises interest cost s well above prevailin g shortterm comme rcial paper rates for investors holding portions of auctionrate securities an auction failure often results in an attractive interest rate but with severely constrained liquidity many investors according to court documents to ld that auctionrate securities were cash equivalents were left with illiquid investments with maturities of 10 years or more56 on the other hand some financial institutions had warned investors in previous years of possible liquidity

underwriting clients auction failures before fall 2007 failures of interest auctions were considered unusual in august 2007 in terest rate spread s between government securities and money market ratessee figure 4 exploded as concerns emerged that mortgagebacked liabilities could threaten the survival of some financial institutions the scramble for liquidity put pressure on auctionrate securities in which investors lacked guaranteed option to sell holdings back to issuers or brokerdealers so that liquidity for those securities depended on ccessful interest auctions according to some sources many large i nvestment banks began to re duce holdings of auctionrate securities and began to market those securities more aggressively to small investors58 sales to small investors however provided an insufficient increase in demand to allow many auctions to run w ithout brokerdealer support when brokerdealers support auctions to avoid failures they absorb auctionrate securities onto their own balance sheets in late 2008 some brokerdealers had accumulated substantial inventories of auctio nrate securities as result of supporting auctions for example court documents indicated that ubs increased its holdings of auctionrate securities by bout 500 from june 2007 to january 200859 in the first half of 2007 ubs holdings of auction rate securities had fl uctuated between 1 billion and 2 billion by february 8 2008 ubs held nearly 10 billion in auction rate securities raising serious riskmanagement concerns at time of mounting mortgagebacked securities losses on february 13 2008 most major brokerdealers ceased their s upport of interest auctions leading to failures in the vast majority of auctions held that day as result the auctionrate secu rities market has largely ized up leaving investors with illiquid investments in long maturities when auctions fail interest rates are set by terms of the securization contract in some cases default interest rates revert to high levels that have caused some issuers financial stress while in other cases interest rates are more in line with normal shortterm rates while many investors earn interest rates higher than usual money market rates the lack of liquidity has decreased the value of many of those holdings60 small investors locked into auction rate securities who have had to borrow to meet shortterm obligations typically pay much higher rates than what those securities return auction failures have occurred for assetbacked securities that have little obvious relation to mortgage markets such as student loans

assetbacked securities c oncerns about the fina ncial condition of bond insurers therefore might trigger investor concerns about timely payment even if eventual repayment were federally guaranteed problems in the vast majority of auc tionrate markets however probably stem from how auctionrate securities are structured rather than from the quality of underlying assets in particular auctionrate securities provide investors with substantial liquidity so long as auctions function normally wh potential investors fear that auctions may fail however which would lock them into illiquid positions they may hesitate to bid especially when shortterm credit has become more difficult or costly to obtain fears of auction fa ilure may be selffulfilling concerns that auctions may fail will deter bidders thus increasing the chance of failure the collapse of the auctionrate securities market put substantial strains on investors who had thought they were investing in highly liquid cash equivalents that then became highly illiquid62 many investors and financ ial professionals claim that they were not alerted to possible liquidity risks due to auction failures furthermore many financial pr ofessionals claim that they were led to believe that dealers would play more active role in preventing auc tion failures one survey found that about two thirds of corporate treasurers in firms th at held auctionrate securities said that dealers had implied that support for auction securities to avoid auction failures and 17 of treasurers said that dealers had explicitly promised such support63 unwinding of the auctionrate securities market will probably be complex even when the quality of underlying assets such as federally guaranteed student loans is high some municipalities have restructured auctionrate securities debt and some other issuers have redeemed portions of security issues litigation initiated by state attorneys general and by classaction suits may play an important

bagehots rule which is explained below bagehots rule and market liquidity central banks for over century have accepted res ponsibility for providing liquidity to markets during credit contractions to avoid serious harm to solvent financial institutions that might affect the stability of financial markets as whole central bankers however typically do not wish to reward financial institutions for having taken unwise or overly risky decisions in the phrase of the english writer walter bagehot central banks should lend freely at penalty rate on good collateral76 in other words central banks according to bagehots law should stand w illing to exchange hi gh quality but illiquid assets for highly liquid securities such as treasury bonds but on such terms that provide incentives for prudent behavior in the future77 some proposals to inject liquidity into student loan markets reflect at least in part the logic of the bagehot rule while few believe that difficulties in the student loan market which comprises small part of world financial markets are threat to the stability of national or international capital markets disruption of the student loan market could inflict substantial hardship on students or their families as well as upon colleges and universities thus offeri ng loans or other forms of liquidity to student lenders during cr edit contraction can help avoid harming students and higher education institutions if such disruptions of the student loan market are due entirely to external forces then there is little need to impose penalty rate on lending to ensure prudent behavior in the future on the other hand if the availab ility of government liquidity on generous terms might encourag lender behavior that might lead to future financial disruptions then some

have become more efficient however lender yields that were once perceived to be adequate may have over time allowed student lenders to earn rents that is receive price above thei r costs from time to time congress has adjusted lender subsidy formulae with the aim of bringing lender yields more in line with lender costs thus reducing costs to taxpayers or making funds available for other priorities while avoidi ng supply disruptions because the true economic costs of lenders are not easily observed and becau costs in different segments of the student loan market differ achieving pr ecise alignment of nder yields and lender costs is difficult moreover lenders have different cost structures so that cut in lender interest rate subsidies that would allow highly efficient lowcost lender to earn profit might put consid erable pressure on another lender with higher costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34578crs27 87 us congress house committee on education and labor website college cost reduction and access act available at httpedlaborhousegovmicroccraashtml accessed july 2 2008the latest legislation to adjust lender yields for guaranteed student loan programs the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 according to its sponsors was intended to reduce excess subsidies to student lenders87 student lenders and industry associat have claimed that thos subsidy reductions would force many student lenders from the mark et potentially disrupting loan supply and complicating financial arrangements of many students and their families since early 2008 several dozen lenders ve announced plans to leav the student loan market in part or in full raising concerns that inadequate supply of student loans could disrupt financial aid arrangemen ts in the 20082009 academic year evaluating the effects of subsidy reduc tions and changes in lender insurance provisions however is difficult to separate from the effects of episodes of turmoil in global financial markets that emerged about the same time as the last stages of congressional consideration of the college cost reduc tion and access act of 2007 congress by passing the ensuring tinued access to student loans act of 2008 and through other initiatives has sought to put in place mechanisms that would avoid or at least mitigate any such disruption in the near term the need for other measures or for more thorough going changes in fede ral student loan policy in the longer term may depend on how the current economic slowdown develops and how financial markets react and evolve in the f ace of challenging economic conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34578crs28 appendix shifts in demand and supply of student loans this appendix explains how economic demographic and other factors can affect the demand for student loans and the supply of student loans using basic microeconomics demand curve shows relationship between price and the quantity of good or service that consumers want to buy at that price holding other factors constant in market for loans th interest rate is the price and the volume of loan originations is typical measure of quantity demand shifts demand for student loans is derived demand meaning that students and their families presumably value the be nefits of higher educati on which loans help finance rather than the loans themselves that is the willingness of students and their families to take student loans depends on the attractiveness of higher education when some factor that helps determine the demand curve changes the demand curve shifts for example when the number of graduating high school students increases the demand curve dd in figure 6 shifts to the right dn dn so that at any given price higher quantity of ans is demanded conversely decrease in the number of new high school graduates w ould shift the demand curve to the left changes that most economists believe w ould cause the demand for student loans to shift to the right include the following increases in the college premium the average difference between wages earned by college graduates and those earned by those who have not attended college increases in the size of traditi onal collegeage cohorts 1821 increases in the number of nontraditional students some factors could arguably increase or decrease demand for student loans for example an increase in the unemployment rate may reduce income which could reduce demand for higher education and st udent loans alternatively higher unemployment could reduce the amount of in come student would lose by attending school which could increase demand for higher education thus the effect of rising unemployment on demand for student loans is ambiguous the cost of higher education also may have an ambiguous effect on demand for student loans higher tuition costs coul d increase the demand for loans or could discourage some students from attending similarly family income could also have an ambiguous effect on the demand for stude nt loans at some income levels an increase in income could increase the probability of attending college while at higher income levels additional income might reduce the need for loans the effect of unemployment higher tuition and family income on demand for higher education therefore can only be resolved by empirical research httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34578 crs29 source crs figure 6 shifts in suppl and demand for student loanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34578crs30 88 more precisely the supply curve of firm in competitive market is its marginal cost curve so long as the price is high enough to allo w firm to recover its costs if the price is not high enough the firm shuts down at least in the short run 89 in particular the benefits of higher educa tion are unsuited as collateral as noted above judging the creditworthiness of college students most of whom are at the beginning of their adult lives would be difficult while tying the availability of loans to family credit scores could severely restrict access to higher educationsupply shifts similarly supply curve shows the rela tionship between price and the quantity of good or service that firms are willing to supply holding other factors constant the lender interest rate or the yield lenders receive acts as the price in loan markets competitive firms supply curve is its ma rginal or incremental cost schedule88 the supply curve shifts when something changes lenders costs for example if lenders cost of funds th profitmaximizing lenders w ill be willing to offer fewer loans at given price so that the supply curve shifts to the left from ss in figure 6 to sn sn for ffel lenders who receive yield based on increases relative to an index of commercial pape r rates the cost of funds rise s if market interest rates used to finance loans rise relative to commercial paper rates which may occur in periods of high financial volatility on the other hand if lenders find more efficient ways to service loans thus lowering their costs then the supply curve shifts to th right other factors that economists believe would shift the supply of student loans to the left include the following increased default rates higher loan servicing costs especially in comparison to loan size higher marketing costs student loan markets differ from other markets as noted in the introduction student an markets differ from other markets in important ways in many types of an markets lenders and borrowers have imperfect information about each other which may lead to problems of adverse selection and moral hazar d adverse selection occurs when lenders cannot distinguish between more and less risky borrowers which can prevent less risky borrowers from obtaining loans on terms that re flect their low risk of default moral hazard occurs when lenders cannot monito r borrowers so that some borrowers may take actions that increase risk to the lende r for example moral hazard would occur if students were less careful with borrowed funds than with their own earnings both adverse selection and moral hazard can cause loan markets to function inefficiently or to shut down completely while some loan markets mitigate such problems via collateral requirements or th use of credit score information those approaches are not easily app lied to student loan markets89 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34578crs31 the aim of federal student loan guarantee programs according to many economists is to support competitive an market by mitigating potential adverse selection and moral hazard problems by guaranteeing loans the federal government greatly reduces lenders risk exposure lessening adverse selection problems enforcing standards and procedures on lenders and institutions of higher education and requiring lenders to reta in small portion of default risk many analysts would argue reduces moral hazard problems
