recognized limits largely anchored in constitutional privacy interests of affected workers that circumscribe governmental authority to impose suspicionless random testing requirements in the public or private s ectors these decisions establish that compelling governmental interests may in appropriate circumstances override constitutional objections to testing procedures by employees whose privacy expectations are diminished by the nature of their duties or workplace scrutiny to which they are otherwise subject they fu rther suggest however that substantial constitutional difficulties probably confront any broadbased testing program that is not limited to specific occupational categories or to persons for whom the government is able to demonstr ate some special need to test it could be argued that professional players have diminished expectation of privacy as the consequence of league or association rules that already require routine physical examinations and testing for drug s in certain circumstances moreover separate argument could be made that safety and health concerns associated with steroid usage and the importance of profe ssional athletes as role models for the nations youth justify unannounced testing for anabolic steroids or other controlled substances testing of randomly selected athletes may also be the least intrusive route to an effective steroid detecti on program past major league baseball procedures it has been argued do not dete r steroid use moreover arguably the reasonable suspicion standard may be unworkable since mo st often there may be outward symptoms to signal the use of steroidshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32911contents constitutional background 2 p r f r m n c n h n c i n g d r u g s i n p r f s s i n l s p r t s

davis bills are virtually identical and all four bills would estab lish minimum drug standards including random testing for some professiona l sports leagues the mccaindavis proposal for example would require major professional sports leagues defined to include ma jor league baseball the national football league the national basketball associati on and the national hockey league and any successor leagues to implement independently administered drug testing programs mirroring the standard of the united states antidoping agency usada at minimum each professional at hlete would have to be tested without advance notice less than five times each cal endar year including at least two off season tests each test would have to cover all substances prohibited in usadas antidoping code and woul d have to be analyzed at usadaapproved lab athletes testing positive or refusing to test first time must be suspended minimum of two years and would be subj ect to permanent suspension from the

proposed legislation by nathan brooks congressionally mandated dr ug testing requirements for both public employees and workers in private industry subject to federal regulation have fairly long and wellestablished legal history nonetheless as described more fully below the federal courts have recognized limits largely anchored in constitutional privacy interests of affected workers that circ umscribe governmental authority to impose suspicionless random testing requirements in the public or private sectors this report examines relevant judicial precedents for their applicability to the issue of random testing for performanceenhancing substances in prof essional athletics constitutional background constitutional law on the subject of governmentally mandated drugtesting is primarily an outgrowth of the four th amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures2 judicial exception to trad itional requirements of warrant and individualized suspicion for administrative searches has been applied to random drug testing of government empl oyees and of private employees tested pursuant to government regulation in the employment setting such testing has been justified under special need s analysis which the courts have applied in relatively narrow circumstances directly implicat ing compelling public safety law enforcement or national security interests of the government more generalized governmental concerns for the integr ity or efficient operation of the public workplace have usually not been deemed sufficient to justify interference with the reasonable expectation of privacy of work ers or other individuals to be tested the supreme court in 1989 applied the s pecial needs doctrine to dispense with the normal warrant and probable cause requirements of the fourth amendment when the government demonstrates comp elling justification beyond ordinary law enforcement for an employee drug testing program in national treasuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32911crs3 3 489 us 656 1989 4 489 us 602 1989 5 515 us 646 1995 6 520 us 305 1997 7 619 f supp 1089 dnj 1985 affd 795 f2d 1136 3d cir 1986employees union v von raab 3 extraordinary safety and national security concerns justified urinalysis testing of custom s service employees seeking transfer or promotion to positions directly linked to drug interdiction handling classified information or the carriage of firearms similarly in skinner v railway labor executives assn 4 neither warrant nor particular ized suspicion was required for federal railway administration fra progra m of blood and urin tests for railroad employees involved in accidents or who violated certain safety standards in both cases the court emphasized that special needs analysis applied only where testing was not used as pros ecutorial tool in veronia school district v acton5 the supreme court first approved of random dr ug testing procedures for high school student athletes rather than public employees holding that it later extended to permit random drug testing of students participating in nonathletic extracurricular activities as well however the court distinguished earlier rulings when in chandler v miller 6 it voided georgia law requiring drug testing of candidates for state office because speci need substantial enough to warrant suspicionless searches was shown the supreme court in skinner discarded the reasonable suspicion standard for testing within industries that are pervasively regulated the rationale is that the existence of extensive federal or state regulation in and of itself diminishes the reasonable expectation of privacy of thos involved in the industry the primary issue before the lower courts in shoemaker v handel7 was whether statemandated drug and alcohol tests administere d without individualized suspicion to thoroughbred race horse jockeys by the ne w jersey racing commission violated the fourth amendment the district court upheld the progra m finding that the jockeys voluntarily participated in horse racing and that the state had shown compelling need for conducting the tests first the court recogn ized that horse racing was unique class of industry subject to heavy state regula tion second jockeys were licensed by the state and had received notice of the implement ation of the tests although notice and licensure did not serve as waiver of f ourth amendment rights they were factors to be considered in balancing the jockeys expectations of privacy against the needs of the state third the state had vital interest in ensuring that the horse racing industry was run honestly and sa fely and that the public per ceived it as such finally the jockeys tested were selected by ra ndom drawing not subject to the bias or discretion of test administrators the third circuit court of appeals affi rmed the district court decision in particular the appella opinion emphasized the pervas iveness of new jersey state regulation and the states strong interest in preserving the integrity of the horsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32911crs4 8 id at 1142 9 id 10 see eg dimeo v griffin 943 f2d 679 7th cir 1991en banc where the full appeals court upheld similar rule of the illinois raci ng board on behalf of jockeys and other horse racing participants required to submit to suspic ionless drug testing in striking balance between the intrusiveness of the rule and th boards reasons for it the court cited the states substantial interest in promoting the safety of participants as well as protecting financial revenue which it derive from the betting publics interest in clean sport the opinion also stressed that since jockeys and other participants were subject to frequent medical examinations they had diminished expectation of privacy which was outweighed by the states interests in this case 11 515 us 646 1995racing industry in assessing the r easonableness of the testing scheme the shoemaker court found that the integrity of sport from which large sums of revenue were collected out weighed the jockeys indi vidual privacy interests new jersey has strong interest in assuring the public of the integrity of persons engaged in the horse racing industry public confidence forms the foundation for the success of an industry based on wageri ng frequent alcohol and drug testing is an effective means of demonstrating that persons in the horse racing industry are not subject to certain outside influenc it is the publics perception not the known suspicion that triggers the st ates strong interest in conducting warrantless testing8 summing up the third circuit concluded th at to justify governmentally imposed random testing there must be strong state interest in the search and the pervasive regulation of the industry must have reduced the justifiable privacy expectation of the subject of the search9 other post shoemaker rulings are in agreement10 in veronia school district v acton 11 the supreme court sustained random drugtesting program for high school stude nts engaged in interscholastic athletic competition the student athlete drug policy required ma ndatory and random suspicionless urinalysis testing of all student athletes within the district the purpose of the policy was to protect the health and safety of the athletes and to rehabilitate drug users by enrolling them in drug assistance program all students wanting to participate in schoolsponsored sports t eam had to provide consent form signed both by the student and his or her parents ac quiescing in the tests each athlete was tested at the beginning of the athletic season and anytime during the season that such students name was randomly selected ten percent of the athletes were randomly drawn each week from pool for testing the supreme court found that the priv acy interest of high school student athletes is diminished by an element of communal undr ess inherent in athletic competition school sports are not for th bashful and by choosing to participate in athletics the students voluntarily subj ect themselves to degree of regulationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32911crs5 12 id at 650 13 id at 649 14 id at 657 15 id at 665 16 536 us 822 2002 17 id at 835even higher than that imposed on students generally12 moreover an immediate crisis caused by sharp increase in dr ug use in the school district triggered installation of the program district cour t findings established that student athletes were not only among the drug users th ey were leaders of the drug culture13 the opinion emphasized that students within the school environm ent have lesser expectation of privacy than mbers of the public generally14 balanced against this diminished expect ation the court determined that the states interest in protecting the physical and mental wellbeing of student athletes while in state custody was important indeed perhaps compelling in this regard the programs context was central to ju stice scalias majority opinion local government bears large responsibilities under public school system as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its care15 because of this custodial and tutelary relationship between the government and its students school officials regularly exercise degree of supervisory contro l that could not be exercised over free adults in board of education v earls 16 the court pressed the veronia school district rationale one step further finding that because of its unique relationship with students the states interest in preventing drug use outweighs the privacy interest of students participating in any competitive extracurricular activities in addition earls noted this court has not required pa rticularized or pervasive drug problem before allowing the government to conduct suspicionl ess drug testing17 and would not set threshold level of drug abuse sufficient to s upport drug testing program instead the court found that prevention of harm to school children tested sufficed to demonstrate the necessity for drug testing policy performance enhancing dr ugs in professional sports these decisions establish that compelling governmental interests may in appropriate circumstances override constitutional objections to testing procedures by employees whose privacy expectations are diminished by the nature of their duties or workplace scrutiny to which they are otherwise subject they further suggest however that substantial constitutional difficulties probably confront any broad based testing program that is not limited to specific occupational categories or to persons for whom the government is able to demonstrate some special need to test special need has generally been found wher there is history of drug abuse in an industry when the employment involves work in safetysensitive or high risk positions or where there is evidence that drug use has led to accidents or other dangers to the public welfare but as justice scalia suggests in veronia schoolhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32911crs6 18 id at 661 emphasis in original 19 national football league national football league policy on anabolic steroids and related substances 2003 as amended may 15 2003 p 1 similarly one of the purposes continueddistrict the concept may be sufficiently elastic to encompass any interest that appears important enough to justify the particular sear ch at hand in light of other factors that show the search to be rela tively intrusive upon genuine expectation of privacy18 as such the legality of any ma ndatory testing re gime may depend upon the range of governmental interests that the court ultimately declares to be compelling for fourth amendment purposes and how close the required nexus to such interests must be to justify random testing of specific individuals or groups the application of the shoemaker precedent would seem to require judicial recognition that professional sports like hor racing involved th ere is closely regulated industry while professional ba seball football and hockey may be subject to union collective bargaining agreements and other largely selfimposed owners association and league rules the hand of g overnment in day today team governance and control appears to be far less inst ead owners individually and in association remain largely free to set their own standa rds for player conduct and team management and even enjoy some limited exemptions from federal regulation antitrust for example that apply to other business sectors nor unlike the jockeys in shoemaker are professional baseball or football players li censed by state or federal authorities potentially relevant distincti on in short the position of the professional athlete may be readily distinguishable from the jockeys in shoemaker and railroad workers in skinner for similar reasons the custodial and tutelary relationship of the state to student athletes would appear to deprive veronia school district and its progeny of direct precedential though perhaps not persuasive value even apart from governmental regulati on however it could be countered that professional players have diminished expectation of privacy as the consequence of league or association rules that already require routine physical examinations and testing for drugs in certain circumstances moreover separate argument could be made that safety and health concerns associated with steroid usage and the importance of professional athletes as role models for the nations youth justify unannounced testing for anabolic steroids or other controlle d substances medical evidence could be mustered in the course of ongoing congressi onal hearings of the adverse health effects not only to the steroid users but to the safety of other play ers second it could be argued protecting the integrity of the game may be particularly important given the demonstrable influence of prof essional athletes on young players at all levels the nfl for example cites three reasons including th health of players for its concern about the use of prohibited substances they threaten the fairness and integrity of the athletic competition on the playing field the league is concerned with the adverse health effects of steroid use although research is continuing ster oid use has been linked to number of physiological psychological orthopedic reproductive and other serious health problems the use of prohibited subs tances by nfl players sends the wrong message to young people who may be tempted to use them19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32911crs7 19 continued of the world antidoping program and the wo rld antidoping code is to protect the athletes fundamental right to participate in dopingfree sport and

636thus both the nfl and world antidoping ag ency have acknowledged that steroid use can undermine the health of athletes and the fairness of athl etic competition finally testing of randomly selected athletes may be the least intrusive route to an effective steroid detection prog ram it seems to us sel fevident that drug problem largely fueled by the role model effect of athletes drug use and of particular danger to athletes is effectively addressed by ma king sure that athletes do not use drugs20 past major league baseball pr ocedures it appears do not ter steroid use moreover arguably the reasonable suspicion standard may be unworkable since most often there may be outward symptoms to signal the use of steroids thus the suspicionless administrative search exception might be the only means of effectively deterring athletes from using steroids in addition it may avoid possible problems of subjectivity and prejudice that arguably attend the application of reasonable cause or other suspicion based standards
