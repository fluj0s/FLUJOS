path followed through the mid1990s the focus was on peoples job prospects for at least year after the 19901991 and 2001 recessions ended as the unemployment rate kept rising and employment kept falling once the labor market rebounded attention switc hed to the kind of jobs being created were the new jobs good high paying or bad low paying data are not available on wages paid specifically for newly created jobs the quality of job creation was initially approached by examining the industries or occupations in which employment had grown after dividing them into low paying and high paying groups studies that took an industry approach found most new jobs added during the 1990s were low wage while those that took an occupation approach found most new jobs added we re high wage limitation of the approaches is the level of aggregation alt hough the serviceproducing sect or has been characterized as low paying for example it actually is comprised of industries that pay comparatively well and comparatively poorly similarl industries are staffed by workers in many different occupations offe ring wide range of earnings absent both industry and occupation tail it cannot be determined whether the jobs being created are relatively high paid eg physi cians relatively low paid eg nursing aides or acrosstheboard within an indus try eg hospitals to capture these outcomes the us bureau of labor sta tistics developed ma trix of occupation industry job categories eg managers in manufacturing which were then divided into high middle and low earnings empl oyment groups based on this approach new job growth occurred at opposite ends of the pay spectrum during the 1990s but the rate of job creation was greater in the highest compared to the lowest wage group the application of this approach to more recent data is problematic because there are large occupationindustry categorie s which account for large share of net job growth since 2000 lying near the earni ngs boundaries that separate lower from higher paying jobs nevertheless follo wing this approach factcheckorg found that employment rose in high paying jobs and fell in low paying jobs while businessweek found that employment rose in low paying j obs but rose almost twice as much in high paying jobs problem with these studies is that job that pays slightly more than the median wage is treated the same as job that pays significantly more one study that avoided this problem estimated that the wage in expanding industries was 13 lower than in contracting industries as sh are of employment most analyses of the new job quality issue looked at industry data only and fe w at occupation data only as mentioned above these categories are too broad to give very meaningful results attempts to answer the new job quality question with one overall result may oversimplify look at the fastest gr owing and declining occupationindustry categories reveals that there is job growth and decline across the earnings spectrum in any case new job quality affects only small subset of the labor market and may not offer much illumination on broader labor market issues such as compensation growth unemployment and

number of jobs and of people employed continued to fall until summer 2003 this pattern rarely occu rred following prior recessions1 now that the labor market has shown si gns of sustained revival concern has shifted to questions about th quality of the new jobs being created that is some assert that more of the net employment gr owth in recent times has been at the lower end than at the higher end of the pay spectrum while others have made the opposite claim2 just as offshore outsourcing was adva nced as contributing factor to the sluggishness of the labor market re bound immediately after

dropped from sight during the latter years of the nations longest postwar economic expansion march 1991march 2001 job quality has many dimensions among them wages benefits and working conditions the only one of these variables for which comprehensive data exists over long period of time is wages and salaries industry and occupation studies statistics are not collected on wages paid specifically for newly created jobs labor market observers initially approached the new job quality issue by examining the industries or occupations in which employment had grown after dividing them into low paying and high paying groups rela tive to an earnings standard eg average or median earnings those who took an industry approach utilized the current employment statistics ces survey which queries 160000 nonfarm businesses and government agencies about employment and earnings of wage and salary workers in production and nonsupervisory jobs7 those who took an occupational approach utilized the

the cps8 results by industry the us economy has long been characterized by changes in its industrial structure the fi rst sector to experien ce longterm decline in employment was agriculture people left or never entered fa rming in part due to plentiful job opportunities that emerge d after world war ii in manufacturing industries that were shiftin g from defense to consumer production eg refrigerators washing machines and televisions th number of jobs in the goodsproducing sector peaked in 1979 however overall employment in manufacturing industries took downward turn in the 1980s following the same path taken by mining industries some two decades earlier the serviceproducing sector eg wholesale and retail trade and finance insurance and real estate has for some time been the primary generator of jobs fueled partly by increased consumer demand for variety of laborintensive activities eg the provision of health care and of food away from home while the composition of employment s changed to reflect the reconfigured industrial structure of the economy relative wages by industry have remained largely the same for example the average wages paid by retailers and leisurehospitality enterprises eg clothing stores and hotelsmotels are below those paid by construction companies and manufacturers eg commercial builders and semiconductor producers which are below the wages paid by professional services concerns eg lawyers offices and management c onsultancies so changes in the distribution of employment across industr ies yield some information about the growth in good jobs9 of the 20 million payroll jobs created in the 19931999 period the services industry group eg education and health services accounted for one of every two net new jobs10 retail

been shifts across occupations the widening wage gap between less and more educated workers in the last few decades indicates that employers have increased their relative mand for persons in occupations typified by high educational requirement s eg bachelors degree11 although employment in these occupations generally has expande d more rapidly than in occupations with lesser educational re quirements the occupational co mposition of total employment has remained largely unchanged12 as with employment by industry and despite the increased earnings premium paid to occupations employing comparatively highly educated persons which occurred to the greatest extent during the 1980s the occupational wage hierarchy has remained much the same eg accountants and registered nurses typically earn more than electricians and truck mechanics who earn more than office clerks and retail salespersons who typically earn more than child care providers and food preparation

growth in th highest earnings group accelerated and was greater than that of the two wer earnings groups over the 19891999 period at 2714 almost all managerial and professional occupations were in the highest paying cluster of jobs and these highly paid managers and professionals accounted for disproportionate share of the clusters net job growth the services industry increased its employment of managers and pr ofessionals to such an extent that the two occupations in the industry made up twothirds of the net employment gain recorded in the highest paying group of jobs employment grew minimally 1 in the middle earnings cluster some notable employment change did occur in occupa tionindustry job categories within the group however bluecollar positions in construction and in transportationpublic utilities greatly expanded but the opposite wa s true for bluecollar factory jobs clerical staff at manufacturers fell substantially as well in contrast the ranks of managers in retail establishments grew considerably as did technicians in the services industry employment in the lowest paid cluster increased by 16 or at twofifths the rate of the highest paid group 27 employment of the lowest earnings group was relatively unaffected by the recession of the early 1990s indeed through 1993 the rate of employment growth among lowwage workers actually exceeded that for workers at the upper end of the earnings spectrum however by the mid1990s job growth in the high earnings group had outpaced grow th in the lowest earnings group15 the lowest earnings cluster was mostly comprised of bluecollar sales service and clerical workers in the retail trade and rvices industries the fastest growing of these occupationindustry categories which accounted for twothirds of the low paid groups employment gain were sales and service workers in retail trade and services industries job opportunities for low paid cl erical workers varied by industry with substantial employment gains in the serv ices industry but cutbacks at retailers when employment growth during the 1990s was analyzed simultaneously by occupation and industry the n both ends of the pay spectrum recorded the most new jobs however the rate of job creation was much greater in the highest compared to the lowest wage group application of this approach to more recent data unfortunately the occupationindustry matrix pproach cannot be successfully applied to more recenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32576crs7 16 this information was provided by bls in telephone conversations with crs in aug and sept 2004data because there are large job categor ies lying near the earnings boundaries that separate lower from higher paying jobs compounding the analytical problem is that these same job categories have accounted fo r substantial share of net employment growth since 2000 some illustra tions might clarify the matter16 employment in the ccupationindustry categor ies cannot be divided into approximately equa l thirds to correspond to low medium and high paying jobs because the median earnings of professionals in the education and health services indus try lie at the bottom of the high paying group but placement in the highest paid group of the entire large 137 million occupation industry category which accounted for 16 million of the 14 million net increase in persons employed between 2000 and 12m onth moving average ending in june 2004 would greatly influence the results the sensitivity of the results to large occupationindustry categories that lie near earnings boundaries is not obviated by switching from thirds to halves if occupationi ndustry categories are divided in half based upon those above and below the median earnings in 2003 of 541 to correspond to low paying and high paying jobs then there is problem with analysis of the construction and extractive occupations in the construction indus try the median earnings of the occupationindustry category which accounted for 850000 of the 2000june 2004 employment increase were 553 in 2003 if the entire large 63 million occupati onindustry category were placed among the high paying jobs it would greatly affect the results and cause half of base period empl oyment to longer lie below above the earnings boundary bls had been able in its occupation industry analyses covering the 1990s to produce robust results that is outcomes we re similar when employment was ranked in various base periods of employment the problem of large occupationindustry categories falling near earnings boundaries and those same categories accounting for much of total job growth were not factors then as they are today review of recent studies on new job quality like the analyses of data from the 1990s studies have looked

from the cp s that part of the study will be reviewed in the next sectionthus high paying industry groups accounted for most job growth both on an absolute basis and as share of employment howe ver different results were obtained when the data were disaggregated into 84 industrie s aboveaverage wage sectors added 41 of recent employment gains while constituting 51 of total employment19 the researchers found that much of the diffe rence was because job growth within the professional and busin ess services group occurred in industries with below average wages they found that over the past f our business cycles the quality of new jobs has been highly cyclical with new job quality deteriora ting in recessions wachovia compared job growth in the 10 industries with above average earnings to job growth in the four industr ies with below average earnings it found that employment in the high wage industries increased by 11 million while employment in the low wage industr ies increased by 03 million from may 2003 to may 2004 from these results one could conc lude that most job growth occurred in high wage industries but since low wa ge industries accounted for only about 30 of total employment it woul d be better to compare growth rates of the two to determine if industries w ith above average wages grew more rapidly than in industries with below average wages by this measure wachovia reported that high wage jobs expanded by 12 and low wage jobs expanded by 08 in the past year this was not the case in the recession or early stages of the recovery however when employment in below average wage industrie s fell more slowly than in above average wage industries20 morgan stanley characterized the jobs created from february to june 2004 as low quality it estimated that 25 of employment growth occurred in three industries at the low end of the job hierar chy restaurants temporary help and building services another 19 of job gains occurred in nine other low paying industries ie clothing stor couriers hotels grocery stores trucking hospitals social work busine ss support nd personal and laundry services thus morgan stanley estimated that 44 of job crea tion over

rate of job creation in high paying i ndustries accelerated eg natural resources construction and professional services wh ich cibc ascribed to normal cyclical behavior22 one shortcoming of all of these studies is that they do not draw any distinction among jobs within the high wage and low wage groups for example the studies do not make any distinction between employment growth concentrated in jobs that paid far above the average wage and growth concen trated in jobs that paid only one dollar more than the average wage the economic policy institute epi utilized unique met hodology that attempts to avoid this problem it assign ed each industry weighted share so that industries with greater contractions or ex pansions weigh more heavily in the overall results based on the weighted shares epi calculated composite wage for expanding categories and compared it to the composite wage in contracting categories the employment data were disaggregated into 20 privatesector industries and three month averages mar ch to may from march 2003 to may 2004 epi estimated that average wages in ex panding industries were 13 lower than in contracting industries23 the chicago federal re serve study described above applied methodology similar to that of epi and estimated that from december 2003 to june 2004 earnings in expanding industries were 7 below those in contracting industries24 these epi and chicago fed findings ar subject to misunderstanding because expanding and contracting indus tries were defined in relative rather than absolute terms when most people ask what type of jobs are being created it is likely that they are thinking of growth in absolu terms literally how many thousands of jobs in any given industry have been dded this is not how the two analyses defined expanding and cont racting industries inst ead expansion was measured relative to an industrys share of total em ployment thus if an industry experienced sizable increase in employment in absolute terms but not as fast as overall job growth it was counted as contracting there is nothing wrong with this methodology but it may not be wh at the lay reader expected disadvantage of analyses based on industry data is that the industry classifications utilized are too broad to provide very meaningful results each industry spans jobs from the unskilled to the highly skilled which can be seen by looking at an industrys median wage by occupation as shown in table 5 every industry contained an occupation that paid substantially above the industrys median wage and an occupation that paid subs tantially below its median wage onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32576crs12 25 standard deviation is common measure of va riance that tells how tightly the data points in sample are clustered around the

also analyzed industry data from the ces which is reviewed abovethe majority staff of the joint economic committee concluded that employment growth between june 2003 and june 2004 was mostly in well paid occupations based on their finding that 714 of the growth during that time occurred in the management business an d financial operations pr ofessional nd related construction and extraction and installation ma intenance and re pair occupations26 the result was reached by dividing the job gain in those four occupations by the net increase in total employment if the f our occupations employment growth were instead divided by the increase in employ ment in only growing occupations the ratio falls to about 50 morgan stanley characterized job creation from june 2003 to june 2004 as low quality the study found that 81 of employ ment growth in that period occurred in occupations which morgan stanley character ized as lowend transportation and material moving nonprofessional services sales and installati on maintenance and repair27 as shown in table 7 however the installation maintenance and repair group paid well above th median wage in 2003 unfortunately the occupation groups in these studies are too broad for their results to be very meaningful while ccupations might be expected to have less variance around the median wage than indus tries that is not the case median earnings in sales occupations for example span from the very low 215 for sales workers in the leisure and hospitality i ndustry group to the very high 1496 for sales workers in the mining industry group as can be seen in table 7 every occupation contained an industry that pa id substantially bove the occupations median wage and all but one managem ent contained an industry that paid substantially below the median wage one standard deviation change shifts five low paying occupations sales transpor tation production office and administration and farming fishing and forestry above

statistics based on the data on the 14 industries for each occupation occupationindustry studies because the 11 industry and 14 occupa tion groups utilized in the above described studies are so broad crossing the two can break the data into 154 categories with less wage variance unfortunately greater precision comes at the expense of statistical robustness sp litting the data into occupationindustry categories does not result in categories of uniform size category size varies from fewer than 1000 workers to more than 15 million workers28 while the average category contains 932000 workers less than 1 of total employment the standard deviation is more than twice the mean when one considers that category of 1000 workers is less than 0001 of total employ ment and the data come from survey of 60000 households it becomes clear that ther are very few observations for the smaller categories accordingly the many smaller categories with small increases or decreases cannot be considered statistica lly significant different than zero29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32576crs16 29 continued workers to not be statistically robust see ilg and haugen earnings and employment trends in the 1990s p 32another drawback to the occupationindustry studies is that they like the industry studies are sensitive to the startin g and ending dates chosen for example categories that added jobs in the past year may have lost them since the recession started these categories may have very different prospects for the future than categories that have conti nually added jobs since the recession as shown in table 8 in about onethird of all categories the employment change over the past year was in the opposite direction of the ch ange over the past four years in addition these studies usually ar based on the 154 occupationindustry matrix that bls developed and successfully applied to employment and earnings data from the 1990s but as discussed above in the application of this approach to more recent data section application of the 154 occ upationindustry categories to more recent data is problematic table 8 employment change by occupationindustry category june 2001june 2004 employment

2004 32 epi made this argument in rebuttal to the factcheckorg study epi also criticized the factcheckorg study for using overly broad i ndustry categories using the same data as factcheckorg and the same methodology as in epis industry study reviewed above it found that between june 2003 and june 2004 cont racting categories had median weekly wage 44 or 7 higher than expanding categories between june 2001 and june 2004 contracting categories had median weekly wage 59 or 10 higher than expanding categories based on these findings epi conc luded that expanding categories are of lower quality than contracting categories elise gould et assessing job quality epi issue brief 200 july 28 2004according to the analysis although employ ment in the high wage group represented 48 of total employment it accounted for more than half of net job growth over the last year businessweek reported that high quality employment growth came from variety of sources eg professionals in wholesale trade and production workers in mining30 although factcheckorg and businessweek concluded that most net jobs were high wage ones the difference in magnitude between their growth estimates primarily is due to their allocation of one occupationindustry category the job category composed of construction and ex traction occupations in the construction industry which gained 528000 jobs accord ing to factcheckorg was placed in the above median wage group by factchec korg and in the below median wage group by businessweek as previously explained in this report the nearness to the earnings boundary of large occupationindustry cat egories that have accounted for considerable amount of employment growth thus far during the current decade eg construction and extraction occupations in the construction industry makes application of the bls occupati onindustry methodology problematic the employment policy foundation epf calculates job quality index which is the ratio of the change in empl oyment of abovemedian wage jobs to the change in employment of belowmedi an wage jobs using 12month moving average in contrast with the us of 154 occupationindustry categories by factcheckorg and businessweek epf classifies 187 occ upationindustry categories as high wage or low wage based on 1993 ear nings data the index has been rising since 200231 as with the previously discussed appro aches one shortcoming of all of these studies is that distinction is made among jobs within the above median wage and below median wage groups for example the studies do not make any distinction between employment growth concentrated in jobs that paid far above the median wage and growth concentrated in jobs that paid only one dollar more than the median wage32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32576crs18 what can be said about new job quality there are many ways to conduct study on new job quality the study can be based on industry data occupa tion data or combination of the two study can compare the wages of expanding sectors to declining sectors or compare the employment change in high wage sectors to the change in low wage sectors sector can be considered to be rising or falling in absolute terms or as share of overall employment unsurprisingly this means th at the same data can yield very different results as is the case with the studies discussed in this report when aggregating the 154 occupation industry categorie s one can lose perspective of which categories are drivin g the results for example when results are divided into an above median wage category and below median wage category categories very close to the median wage are treated the same as categories very far from the median this suggests that the results would be extremely sensitive to changes in employment in jobs close to the median wage which bls reports is the reason that it has not completed an occ upationindustry study utilizing recent data this is drawback to nearly all the studies reviewed in this report the epi study is notable exception of the 80 categories with increasin g employment from june 2003june 2004 the same time periods used in the factcheckorg and epi studies 51 of the increase is accounted for by the 10 categorie s with the largest increases besides making the results more manageable fo cusing on the top 10 categories has the advantage of eliminating changes in smaller categories whose results may not be statistically significant and may be overly sensitive to the time period selected as seen in table 9 construction and extrac tion occupations in th construction industry an increase of 464000 and professional ccupations in the education and health services industry an increase of 447000 were by far the biggest job gainers accounting for 23 of the total increase between them the former paid median wage very close to the overall median and the latter paid median wage much higher than the overall median th professional occupations in the education and health services category illustrates that even when divided into 154 categories some categories still contain such broad array of jobs that it is difficult to be certain exactly what types of jobs were actually created of the remaining eight categories three were far below the median wage tw were far above the median wage and three were near the median wage six of the 10 largest increases occurred in the education and health services industry which has far more em ployment overall than any other industry group and the professi onal and business services industry group which contains industries payi ng wide range of wageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32576crs19 table 9 largest increases in employment by occupation industry category june 2003june 2004 occupationindustryincrease in

cps uses and limitations of the data job quality is concept that embodies many factors including wages benefits work environment physical safety job secu rity and so on earnings are the only one of these factors for which comprehensive data exist and so they are the usual indicator of quality there are data available that directly answer the question of what wages are paid to the newly created jobs in the economy the closest that researchers can get to answering that question is to find out what industry or occupation the new jobs are located in and what the averagemedian earnings are for that industry or occupation industry and occupation categories are too broad to give very meaningful information on job quality however combining them gives more precise information but at th cost of statistical robustn ess for some of the smaller categories different studies have r eached starkly opposite conclusions some of the differences can be attributed to the fact that the studies covered different time periods some are due to differences in methodology looking at the occupation industry categories that have contributed the largest portion of the increase or decrease in employment suggests that most of the studies have arguably drawn overly simplified conclusions on the question of new job quality both the large expanding and contracting categories fall throughout the pay spect rum based on the data in tables 9 and 10 there does not appear to be strong correlation between earnings levels and employme nt gains or losseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32576crs21 33 david r francis

earnings and employment trends in the 1990s and aaronson and christopher employment growth in higherpaying sectors while these data give us some indication of the state of one segment of the labor market they tell us little about the overall labor market that is information on the 14 million jobs created in the past year tells us little bout the overall 139 million jobs or the 82 million unemployed workers in the us economy the wages of 14 million new jobs tell us little about how much overall earnings are rising real wage growth has been low since the last expa nsion and they tell us little about other important factors such as fringe benefits and working conditions33 they also give indication if the distribution of earn ings has become more or less equal34 changes in the earnings of workers who re main in the same job or who move from one already existing job to another are likely to have much larger effect on the overall labor market than new jobs wage data on net new jobs also do not shed light on the subsequent labor market experience of people who lost jobs periodic supplement to the cps the displaced worker survey as ks longtenured workers tailed questions about their postdisplacement history workers with at least three years of job tenure are considered displaced if they lost job because their plant or company closed or moved there was insufficient work or thei r position or shift was abolished in the most recent survey which covers 2001 2003 53 million workers were displaced and 65 of the displaced workers were reemploy ed at the time of the survey of those who lost fulltime jobs nd subsequently found new j obs 10 were working part time 24 were working full time at wages that were at least 20 lower than their previous job and 30 were reemployed at higher wages35 the data utilized to assess the quality of new jobs do not address whether displaced workers were able to obtain new jobs that are high or w paying relative to their former jobs expanding and contracting occupationindustry groups mig ht be of interest if they accurately predicted which occupationi ndustry groups would expand or contract over the entire expansion but this may not be the case for example the rapid increase in construction employment may not continue once interest rates rise this example suggests that in the short run changes in product demand are an important determinant of where job creation occurs and these largely uncontrollable changes can affect workers at any wage level it may also be that lower wage jobs are the first to be created in an expansion and higher wage jobs come later as was the case in past expansions36 for example employment growth in temporary help agencies tends to lead overall employment for the bor market as whole the slow rate of employment and wage growth are more noteworthy to date in this economic expansion than the quality of jobs being created
