during darkness ambush tactics techniques and procedures during the sovietafghan war mujahedin ambushes were the most effective counter to sovietdemocratic republic of afghanistan army military activity us forces will encounter similar ambushes by acm organizations or factions ambushes are conducted for either harassment or resupply ºharassment ambushes are generally small scale as few as two to four personnel and brief followed by rapid withdrawal of troops ºambushes for spoils require more personnel and destroyed or abandoned vehicles are looted for weapons munitions food and anything else of value small ambush element consists of 2 to 15 personnel whereas large ambush element can include from 100 to 150 personnelfor official use only fouo for official use only fouo ambush teams include the following elements ºobservers three to four men possibly unarmed pretending to be shepherds farmers etc children are sometimes used as observers ºfiring element the ambushs firepower ºalert element positioned along the likely direction of the ambushed elements direction of retreat or maneuver to hinder his withdrawal ºreserve element reinforces the firing element or covers the ambushing elements withdrawal these ambushes have an established chain of command and radio communications if radios are available communication will be accomplished by visual signaling such as smoke grenades mirrors flares and waving the ambush deployment consists of three lines ºfirst line the firing element of the ambush ºsecond line communications element located 20 to 25 meters behind the first line in order to relay communications between the command element and the firing element ºthird line command element located 30 meters behind the second line ambush sites are carefully selected they are usually set up along the entrance and exit routes through canyons and other narrow passageways in builtup areas the ambushes are set up behind earthen walls or in houses or other structures ambushes usually occur in the early morning or in the evening additionally most convoy ambushes have been reported to occur on return trips typically because routes of travel are restricted once force leaves on mission enemy forces know that they will be returning soon and usually on the same route acm forces have also become adept at setting ambushes to intercept reaction forces responding to shelling attacks on bases compounds or other fixed installations lessons learned advance reconnaissance patrols are necessary but simply driving through the suspected area does not clear it of enemy forces or prevent an ambush on trailing convoy reconnaissance and security elements have to secure the entry and exit locations of suspected ambush sites in addition to clearing surrounding high ground helicopter support is crucial in preventing ambushes narrow time gap between reconnaissance flight and the point element of convoy will prevent or hinder the deployment of the ambushing force from concealed positions recent experience has shown that acm forces will go to ground and hide in order to avoid detection and possibly engagement by unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and armed aircraft it is important to avoid predictable and set patterns of movement for official use only fouofor official use only fouothe mujahedin continued to use similar tactics and the same ambush sites months later when the soviets failed to inform replacement units of the mistakes that compromised route security and likely ambush sites sniper operations us and coalition force experience with acm snipers has been minimal there is little evidence of welltrained and qualified snipers most engagements seem to feature high volume fires shoot and spray as opposed to disciplined wellaimed fires where snipers have been detected they have been quickly neutralized some afghan fighters have demonstrated an ability to fire accurately the zadran tribe is well known for producing excellent marksmen alqaida sharpshooters have also demonstrated excellent skills but average acm fighters appear to lack fire discipline in combat situations acm snipers use boulders and shadows for concealment in addition to blankets cloaks and other innovative means to avoid coalition detection systems snipers increase their maneuverability by using underground water canals to move from one firing position to another snipers are integrated into ambushes by taking position on the side opposite the initial fire assault when the ambushed soldiers take cover from automatic weapons fire snipers will fire at them from behind snipers are mostly used in coordination with other attackers they will be positioned to support an ambush raid defense or attack individual or smallteam operations will take place at night as well as daytime the primary goal for night operations is psychological impact any casualties will be an added bonus snipers with highpowered rifles machine guns fitted with telescopic sights or even air defense artillery will target helicopter crew members during the sovietafghan war the killing of soviet soldiers earned bounties greater amount for officers than enlisted personnel similar rewards have been offered for the killing or capture of coalition personnel soviet soldiers seldom encountered well trained snipers with specialized sniper weapons current acm tactics allow for very loose command and control therefore sniper incidents will likely consist of marksmen with varying degrees of competency sporadically sniping at coalition forces wide range of sniper rifles are available in afghanistan the svd is probably the most common sniper weapon available however the ak4774 is used as well as hunting and sporting riflesfor official use only fouo for official use only fouoraids raids against fixed installations usually conducted at night are common afghan tactic raiding groups attempt to gather forces covertly attack the objective seize needed supplies and retreat before the defensive forces can effectively react acm forces routinely use cover of darkness to conceal their approach to and departure from the target area several raids were documented during the afghansoviet war those that involved looting were usually against small isolated outposts the afghans would reconnoiter the area until they discovered the habits of the occupants once they found weakness to exploit such as mealtime routines or shift changes they would plan their attack to raid and loot the facility taliban or alqaida fighters will resort to raids or ambushes to resupply themselves with food ammunition and equipment nongovernment facilities are frequent targets since they have minimal guard force and provide sources of vehicles food and other items of importance such as batteries and radios acm forces will frequently bring their own cargo transportation but will also attempt to steal vehicles at target sites raid combines the actions of several large teams large team 20 to 50 men may consist of the following personnel commander with bodyguard of three to four men three to four scouts observers two to three combat groups of six to eight men each one to two mortars and crews two to three rocketpropelled grenade rpg teams one to two dshk or similar machine gun team minelaying group four to five men manpad surfacetoair missile and zu23 air defense to provide security for the attack the teams will attempt to coordinate their actions and attack the target along multiple axes the main attack may be preceded by day or two of probing attacks to determine disposition of the defense and reactions so that they can be accounted for in the primary attack the raid might be supported by shelling attack either on the installation or on target that draws reaction forces away from the focus of the raid individual and smallteam tactics individuals or small teams that contain as few as three or four fighters can infiltrate the area near an installation and use rpgs or sniper weapons to engage personnel or equipment harassment attacks are conducted by teams that fire at the installation from distance and rapidly leave the area once they have fired their munitions it is most likely that while firing teams depart the area another team or individuals are in place to assess damage to the target if any and to assess the response from any reaction force to the attack after patterns are established ie strength timing and procedures followon attacks with remote improvised explosive devices or ambushes may be attempted for official use only fouofor official use only fouoairfield raids talibanalqaida attack tactics on an airfield are heavily influenced by afghan combatant experience against the soviets the attack will be either an individual or smallteam effort such as sniper operation using small arms rpgs or even light mortars alternatively it may be shelling attack or raid which would combine the actions of several large teams airfield attacks against us and coalition forces appear to be harassing in nature causing limited damage and used to determine reactions and defensive capabilities of defending forces attacks in the future could include attacks against facilities or aircraft using guided munitions such as antitankguided munitions atgms and manportable surfacetoair missiles sams such attacks if succes sful could provide tremendous propaganda opportunity or morale boost shelling attacks during the soviet occupation the mujahedin used mortars rockets and recoilless rifles in shelling attacks on garrisons outposts airfields and cities number of rocket attacks on cities have taken place in recent times with 107mm rockets impacting seemingly at random causing civilian casualties as acm combatants establish an organized resistance it is likely these tactics will be featured more prominently the primary objective of shelling attack is to show the governments inability to ensure the safety of its citizens and demonstrate the power of acm forces and secondarily to harass the enemy and to destroy war materiel acm tactics mujahedin gunners construct multiple firing sites then fire and quickly displace before enemy artillery aviation or ground response forces can effectively respond when possible mujahedin will keep water near their firing sites to dampen the ground behind rockets or recoilless rifles this will limit dust raised by the back blast reducing the firing signature and making detection of firing positions more difficult current experience has been with individual rockets crudely aimed but as experience is gained and aiming devices are improved firing accuracy will improve rockets set up to fire with delays ranging from minutes to hours is also commonplace as it allows firing party to depart its firing location before the rockets fire timed firing devices range from crude mechanical devices to more sophisticated timers such as electronic watches or circuit boards that can initiate firing sequence of several individual rockets mortars and multiple rocket launchers were the favored weapons to bombard airfields during the soviet occupation attackers can establish concealed mortar positions rapidly fire several rounds into the airfield and then rapidly leave the area rockets can be fired using improvised launchers and timedelay firing devices this is especially true for 107mm rockets regular military rocket launching systems may also be employed providing greater range and accuracy the raid is likely to be hitandrun affair therefore withdrawal and survivability are important factors to deter ground pursuit the attackers may mine routes ahead of time evade through the safe lanes in existing minefields or scatter mines as they leave if favorable terrainfor official use only fouo for official use only fouoand weather exist the attackers may establish an ambush site from which to attack pursuers fleeing attackers will also attempt to blend into local populations dropping or hiding their weapons along the way and attempting to fit into local village or group cave and mountain defense and ambush techniques and procedures afghanistans caves and irrigation tunnels have served as protection and defense from foreign invaders since the time of genghis khan coalition forces should recruit reliable antitaliban afghan scouts to assist in locating caves defensive positions and likely ambush sites in the passes and trails prepared defenses caves trenches and spider holes are incorporated into prepared mountain defensive positions and the taliban will attempt to draw uscoalition forces into an attack on them they may be networked and interconnected particularly in large cave complexes allowing the taliban forces to move unseen or withdraw from the immediate area ambushes mountainous terrain is particularly suited to ambushes narrow passes and valleys are often the only means to travel between locations without using long circuitous routes acm forces are well aware of this fact and have ambushed coalition forces when they returned on the same routes this is not new the vast majority of ambushes against soviet forces in afghanistan were executed as they returned using the same route see also the earlier section on general ambush ttps superior air surveillance and reconnaissance available to coalition forces will reduce the enemys capability to successfully conduct large ambushes but the threat of smaller ambushes and snipers will be constant especially when support aircraft are not seen or heard by acm forces lessons learned at night noise and light discipline of acm forces is generally very good both in defensive positions and for movements recon by fire is often used to determine location of key weapons systems of coalition forces acm forces use cave shuttle system to move fighters and supplies to battle positions moving in or out of caves or from cave to cave to pick up ammunition and weapons in order to sustain the fight caves also provide cover from aerial observation and attack and shelter for wounded fighters urban ambush and bomb training for official use only fouofor official use only fouourban areas from small villages to large cities provide talibanalqaida and insurgent forces excellent opportunities to conduct both combat and noncombat activities they will use the multitude of people and buildings to conceal their activities in order to create fear and distrust of us and coalition forces individual homes businesses religious centers and even some government facilities may be used as cover for these operations one technique used in carbombings involves the detonation of two ieds several minutes apart small bomb is exploded with the intention of drawing security forces and an increased crowd of onlookers to the site at this point second larger ied is detonated either by time delay or remote control in order to inflict greater number of casualties coalition forces must expect second followon explosion to any ied attack hostile houseclearing and hostagetaking when taking group of hostages the talibanalqaida team will consist of 6 to 10 terrorists armed with ak47s and akms at least one terrorist will carry hand grenade the terrorists will move from room to room shooting guards and gathering hostages finally consolidating the hostages in single location an abduction is carried out using traditional kidnaping technique vehicle will pull in front of the targeted individual and stop second or third vehicle will box in the victims vehicle the kidnappers will exit the vehicle kill guardsdriver subdue the abductee place him in the escape vehicle and exit the scene armor the taliban had control of small number of armor assets talibanalqaida armored vehicles are used primarily as defensive weapons the primary tanks in the taliban inventory were t54s t55s and t62s these vehicles have not been used against coalition forces although they may still posses limited quantities of these vehicles talibanalqaida tanks and other armored vehicles will most likely be encountered in fortified stationary positions being used as direct and sometimes indirect firesupport weapons but rarely in mobile missions vehicles dug into defensive positions are difficult to spot because of their low silhouette the visual disruption caused by local terrain and the shape and thermal disruption caused by the dirtfilled sandbags this makes their use natural tactic in ambushes in defense of valley entrances or in areas that have only limited ground access the greatly altered signature makes dugin vehicles difficult to engage with sensorfused weapons or attack platforms that rely on thermal sights forwardlooking infrared devices or radar for targeting infantry antitank weapons acm forces have used infantry antitank weapons as multipurpose directfire weapons besides their normal role of being employed against armored fighting vehicles these infantry antitank weapons have been fired at aircraft used as crude mortar and used in an infantry assault role to destroy buildings and bunkers these weapons may also be set up as improvised offroute mines or to breach minefields by firing consecutive shots through minefield detonating the mines with the weapon infantry antitank weapons will be used in ambushes to engage light armored and softskinned vehicles once the vehicles enter kill zonefor official use only fouo for official use only fouorecoilless rifles acm tactics for recoilless riflesguns will be similar to those employed by talibanalqaida rocketpropelled grenade rpg gunners ammunition for various calibers of recoilless rifles has been found in caches throughout the country specifically large amounts of b10 rocket ammunition the following systems have been encountered in afghanistan 90mm recoilless rifle ºnot much information is available regarding acm tactics for use of the 90mm recoilless information contained here is based on the 67 recoilless rifle ºthe 90mm recoilless rifle weighs approximately 36 lbs has maximum effective range of approximately 450 meters and has maximum range of approximately 2100 meters b10 82mm recoilless rifle the b10 has maximum selfdestruction of the round range of 400 meters for highexplosive antitank rounds and 4500 meters for highexplosive rounds it weighs approximately 109 lbs the b10 has been called the talibans favorite infantry heavy weapon and although large amounts of ammunition have been recovered it has not been seen in engagements with us and coalition forces spg9 73mm recoilless rifle the spg9 has maximum effective range of 800 meters and maximum selfdestruction of the round range of 4500 meters the firing tube weighs 99 lbs often fired on the shoulder the trailer weighs 35 lbs and the tripod weighs 27 lbs ammunition for the spg9 is nearly identical to the bmp1 which has maximum effective range of 1300 meters when mounted on the bmp1 and an improved round with maximum range of 6500 meters is available rocketpropelled grenades even though rpgs are classified as an antiarmor weapon acm forces will use rpgs against slowmoving aircraft especially helicopters rpgs are not very accurate against aircraft so the enemy will use high volume of fire single rpg attempts against aircraft are rare but possible rpgs have achieved some success in downing coalition aircraft rpgs display backblast and flash signature at launch most rpgs have rocket motor that ignites approximately 20 meters after the round has been fired this rocket motor ignition leaves visible gray puff of smoke person looking in the general direction of the launch should notice these indicators nightvision devices including thermal imagers may help see the rpg launch and rocket while in flight unlike man portable shoulderlaunched surfacetoair missiles rpgs do not corkscrew in flight but have relatively straight flight path with very little smoke tactics rpg gunners have been observed wetting down the ground behind firing positions to reduce backblast signature for official use only fouofor official use only fouoacm rpg gunners will sometimes track flight patterns and use the information as basis for planning their attacks acm rpg gunners will position themselves to take advantage of higher elevations in mountainous terrain this enables gunners to engage their target from above the side or the rear to take advantage of blind spots this technique is also applicable in urban terrain where rpg gunners can fire from rooftops or highlevel windows some rpg gunners have taken advantage of the rockets selfdestruct feature to do this gunners lob rounds to the maximum range approximately 900 meters to achieve an air burst to engage aircraft in flight or to engage unprotected troops on the ground rpg teams normally consist of two personnel the gunner carries the rpg and two to four additional rounds the assistant helps reload after firing provides limited security with an ak type rifle and also carries two to four additional rounds larger groups may contain two or more rpg teams with additional rounds carried by other fighters within the group countermeasures understanding tactics employed by rpg gunners and capabilities of the weapon will enhance the value of countermeasures used countermeasures can be grouped into two categories physical and tactical physical countermeasures include actions taken to reduce or negate the damage of an rpg or other antitanktype round once it has been fired measures such as chain link fences berms sandbagging and building reinforced bunkers and other facilities can be used in fire base around vehicles and aircraft parked on the ground as well as prepared firing positions trees and other natural shrubbery can also provide some degree of physical protection but may also reduce fields of observation and fire tactical countermeasures are actions taken to reduce the ability of rpg gunners to fire or to lessen the value of target suppressive fires on known or suspected firing positions are perhaps the most effective technique direct or indirect fires small or large caliber systems can provide these fires and particularly effective is aerial fire support speed of movement is also helpful as is varying speed of movement in order to avoid setting identifiable patterns of movementfor official use only fouo for official use only fouofire support mortars when uscoalition forces make initial contact with acm prepared defensive positions the enemy typically responds with immediate mortar fire their primary fire support weapon when us close air support approaches acm fighters seek nearby cover frequently leaving mortars set up and remain under cover until the air support leaves then the fighters will return to their fighting positions if possible control of high elevations is key to acm defensive operations higher elevation provides greater fields of observation although poor weather conditions may reduce visibility the 82mm mortar is the primary indirectfire weapon used by acm fighters the 120mm mortar has been used but it is not the preferred system likewise 60mm mortars have been found in cache sites but have not yet been employed against us and coalition forces ammunition for both 120 and 60mm mortars is readily available in country the 82mm mortar acm forces use 82mm mortars in two different methods of firing indirect fire acm fighters will fire from the reverse slope of the terrain when possible this requires forward observer direct observation acm forces refer to this method as disturbance firing this method will be used when the mortar is within the line of sight of the target it does not require forward observer since the mortar crew can adjust fire visually acm forces have been observed displacing carrying only the tube and bipod and leaving the base plate in position for future use base plates have been found cemented in place allowing the mortar crew to quickly occupy and set up new firing positions achieving high accuracy with first shots mortars have been observed set up in the open as crews went to nearby caves to resupply ammunition the same practice has been noted when coalition aircraft were in the area ammunition for the 82mm mortar is readily available in afghanistan there are numerous caches in the country many of which contain 82mm mortar ammunition mortar ammunition can remain serviceable long after the expiration of its expected shelf life the 82mm mortar is used for the following purposes covering for withdrawal used to disrupt advancing forces and to allow for acm withdrawal defending fortified positions used to cover main avenues of approach to acm fortified defensive positions and key facilities such as cave complexes supporting the attack used to support the advancing acm forces in the attack in order to disrupt and create confusion in the defensive positions for official use only fouofor official use only fouoharassing fires frequently used against fire base and fixed installations primary purpose is psychological effect in creating sense of insecurity physical damage is secondary effect illumination rounds although typically used in defense to improve the visibility of the battlefield acm forces are trained not to use illumination rounds in defensive posture because the defensive positions will be compromised preplotted targets used when acm forces are aware of the location of opposing forces preplotted mortar targets include suspected and known opposing force helicopter landing zones hlzs the mortar is also used to interdict likely convoy routes raids mortars will be used during raids to shell installations airfields and outpostscheckpoints mortars are used both to shell the targeted facility to cause confusion and destruction and to shell nearby facilities to draw attention away from the actual target and to block or slow reaction and pursuit forces ambushes mortars will sometimes be used in the ambush to destroy vehicles and personnel within the kill zone they will be used more frequently to cover the withdrawal of the ambushing force from the attack site rockets acm forces do not have organized rocket units but they do use 107 and 122mm rockets key points are as follows rocket firing locations may be placed on high ground overlooking the target rockets are typically fired using crude expedient launching methods acm forces consider harassment of enemy forces as valuable as accurate fire the use of singlelaunch tubes and timedelayed firing devices targeted against installations is intended to disrupt operations with incidental damage to buildings enemy casualties are fortunate coincidence cities and military bases especially airfields are prime targets for rocketfire and rocketharassment missions 107mm rocket the 107mm rocket is available in truckmounted towed and portable variations it is easy to transport by vehicle manpack or pack animal and has maximum effective range of approximately 8400 meters the weapon needs only small area of level ground for firing the 107mm rocket ammunition is readily available from number of countries highexplosive fragmentation rounds are the only ammunition used the launcher uses simple mortar sights for target acquisition direct observation does not require the use of sights and eliminates the need for firedirection center however this method exposes the crew to detection and counter battery fire since itfor official use only fouo for official use only fouomay require multiple rocket firings to adjust onto the target time delay may be used to reduce risk to crews from counter battery fires acm crews will fire from the reverse slope of hill or mountain when possible as this gives the weapon crew additional protection from counterfire vehiclemounted 107mm rocket does not have to be dismounted from the vehicle in order to fire and can be set up and fired from the vehicle in approximately 1 minute if towed the set up and fire time increases to approximately 15 minutes standard towed launchers fire 12 rockets however small manportable singletube launchers are also used acm fighters have become adept at rigging launchers to fire using nothing more than piled rocks or crossed sticks to provide elevation although not always accurate this launch method can be used to conduct effective harassing fires against targets such as airfields fuel and ammunition depots and garrisons or fortified areas rockets fired in this method can be armed with simple timedelay firing mechanisms allowing the crew to set up the rocket for delayed launch after they leave the area 122mm rocket the 122mm rocket comes in two versions long rocket fired by the bm21 truckmounted launcher with four rows of 10 launch tubes with range of approximately 20380 meters and short rocket fired by smaller portable systems the manportable version of the 122mm rocket launcher fires shortrange rocket with range of approximately 14000 meters variations of the manportable launchers include the single double and the 12 tube manportable launchers for the 122mm rocket are ideal for use in unconventional warfare where fire direction is simple each of these launchers needs three to four men for transport and can be used in more restrictive firing positions than the truckmounted version expedient aiming methods and platforms may be used to fire rockets from the tubes when fired at higher altitudes the range of the weapon increases although its accuracy decreases artillery the acm forces will employ their artillery if available in an unconventional manner target acquisition will be mostly visual with manual fire direction and without the use of computers since the fall of the taliban artillery resources have come under the control of local warlords and have not been employed against coalition forces 122mm d30 howitzer m1963 of the numerous weapon systems the taliban had available prior to the initial air strikes in 2001 the d30 howitzer was the most plentiful and considered the most dangerous artillery system in their inventory for official use only fouofor official use only fouothere have been recent indications that acm forces are using the d30 or any other artillery pieces in afghanistan the d30 is towed closesupport howitzer it has conventional range of 15300 meters and range of 1000 meters when used in the directfire mode emplacement time is approximately 15 minutes and displacement takes approximately 3 minutes acm forces will place the weapon under trees in heavy brush or in cave entrances to avoid detection ammunition for the d30 is available in numerous caches spread throughout afghanistanfor official use only fouo for official use only fouoair defense air defense the three primary portions to the air defense threat in afghanistan are the manportable air defense systems manpads shoulderfired surfacetoair missiles smallarms and rocketpropelled grenades rpgs and light antiaircraft weapons generally 127 through 23 mm old military or available commercial night vision equipment may be possessed by acm forces and may be employed with air defense weapons manportable air defense systems manpads limited number of manpads still exist in theater the threat of manpads can come from anyplace in the theater including border areas and neighboring countries figure 4 shows manpads firing positions against an airfield figure 4 manpads firing positions against airfield common strategy is to have the manpads gunners work in pairs or small groups the first manpads operator engages the aircraft if the first missile fails to destroy the target the additional manpads operators opens fire acm manpads gunners will try to position themselves on high ground overlooking potential aircraft especially helicopter flight paths this allows manpads operators more time to locate and fire on the aircraft this tactic is more likely to be used in the warmer months since winter weather conditions limit the gunners ability to survive at high elevations common tactic used by acm soldiers is to attack aircraft at their most vulnerable moment taking off or landing when near airports the manpads operators will choose place along the takeoff or landing flight path waiting for an appropriate moment to engage the aircraft after firing gunners move to the nearest shelter or cache and conceal the launcher for official use only fouofor official use only fouo antiaircraft artillerymachine guns most largecaliber taliban antiaircraft artillery aaa was destroyed during initial air strikes against the taliban in 2001 the taliban had aaa ranging from 127 to 100 mm prior to that time currently the threat to coalition aircraft is from smallcaliber 23mm and smaller aaa serviceability of acm 37mm aa guns is currently questionable guns larger than 127 mm are normally mounted on or towed by trucks when possible acm forces will position themselves at higher elevations allowing them greater visibility and fields of fire the acm forces will use machine guns in both antiaircraft and antipersonnel roles dshk 127 mm machine gun one of the primary acm aaa weapons is the dshk127mm machine gun this weapon is deployed throughout afghanistan and difficult to detect or track the complete weapon system has been found cached in various places throughout the region as have spare parts and ammunition ºdshk requires crew of two to four people when ground mounted on tripod but only one gunner when vehicle mounted the dshk has tactical antiaircraft aa range of 1000 meters with maximum vertical range of 4200 meters in the groundsupport role it has maximum distance range of approximately 7800 meters ºthe dshk can be vehicle mounted or transported by manpack or pack animal it is used in both aa and antipersonnel roles as are other small and mediumcaliber aaa weapon systems the dshk has been one of the primary support weapons used by acm forces against coalition forces in afghanistan zgu 145mm machine gun the zgu is vehiclemounted or towed aaa machine gun it is possible to dismantle and transport the zgu via pack animal or manpack ammunition is readily available and has been found cached throughout afghanistan the zgu requires crew of 10 people to manpack it but only twoman crew for firing the weapon has tactical aa range of approximately 1400 meters against fast moving aircraft with maximum vertical range of 3700 meters in the groundsupport role it has maximum distance range of approximately 5900 meters zu 232 23mm machine gun the zu 232 is towed or vehiclemounted aaa machine gun the zu 232 normally has fiveman crew the gun commander or crew chief gunner assistant gunner and two ammunition bearers the zu 232 has tactical antiaircraft range of 2500 meters against fast moving aircraft with maximum vertical range of 5100 meters in the ground support role it has maximum distance range of approximately 7000 meters unexploded 23mm rounds present particularly dangerous hazard these rounds have been found throughout afghanistan in and around cities battle areas and caches caution in handling or disposing of these rounds must be exercised snipers snipers situated on mountainsides will target helicopters flying through mountain passes snipers will target the cockpits attempting to kill the crew snipers will also target aircraft during landing and take off the most effective weapons for this are highpowered rifles and machine guns fitted with optical sights even the venerable303 enfield can be effective against low slowflying aircraft for additional information on sniper operations see maneuver sectionfor official use only fouo for official use only fouocommand and control c2

websites including unclassified official us army field manuals easy to use and maintain in harsh environments such as afghanistan the afghanistan wireless communications company awcc is installing global system for mobile communication gsm infrastructure there is now gsm system in five of afghanistans major cities kabul kandahar mazare sharif herat and jalalabad konduz will be the sixth city to receive all of the necessary equipment for service awccs goal is to have gsm network installed in each provincial capital within the next 4 to 5 years each gsm base station is paired with verysmallapertureterminal vsat communications system this combination has brought limited national communications international and internet connectivity to those cities acm forces are communications parasites on host nations public switched telephone networks pstn cellular telephone satellite telephone and internet communications are used in afghanistan as afghanistan slowly restores its communications backbone acm forces will increase their use of these systems the primary satellite telephone systems that cover afghanistan are thuraya inmarsat and asiasat alqaida leadership is probably using communications officers for many of their communications including satellite telephones historically during operations against the russians in the 1980s mujahedin forces used nonvoice communications these included pigeons to carry messages flags mirrors and flashlights to flash prearranged brevity codes acm forces in afghanistan are aware of these means in fact mirrors are commonly carried by many people for signaling for official use only fouofor official use only fouocouriers are the most secure means of communication available to acm forces while secure couriers are not time sensitive the courier may not know the contents of message if it is on paper or some electronic media if the courier has memorized the message it may be in brevity code when operational information is passed between acm forces this is probably the method used couriers are taught ways of hiding information including ways to take advantage of cultural biases acm forces will use challenge and password system the challenge and password system may be in arabic if the force is all alqaida or mixed acm force if the force is made up of only local soldiers the challenge and password could be in dari or pushtu depending on the tribal affiliations of the forces challenges and passwords may be local sayings or proverbs portable generators are found throughout the country and besides providing electricity to homes they can also be used to power communications equipment intelligence and reconnaissance acm forces have very effective humanintelligence collection and dissemination capability most acm forces operate in their home areas and know the terrain and people there well this knowledge aids their moving in and out of areas with ease often using covered routes acm forces use this to their advantage such as moving close enough to coalition forces to note friendly positions and security operations since acm forces have family and friends in the area they can easily use these people to collect information on the surrounding area this provides them with early warning of coalition activities moreover it is very possible that afghan persons employed by coalition forces are either acm themselves or at least sympathizers take caution in providing missionessential information to afghan government forces until just prior to their need to know acm forces use many commercially bought offthe shelf radios that use hf uhf and vhf radio bands because radios can be used to listen as well as transmit any radio can be used to intercept radio signals that are not encrypted therefore if coalition radio is sending in the clear it is highly likely that acm forces will be listening while most acm members do not understand english enough do to make this viable threat acm forces are not known to possess the capability to monitor encrypted communications commercial radio scanners are available on the world market and acm forces are known to use these when they do they can quickly pick up nonsecure communications and identify the information as useful or not icom scanners are small enough to be hand held highly portable and used anywhere acm forces and particularly those operating in areas where they have lived most if not all their lives are well suited for tactical reconnaissance these personnel are known to be very patient and because they are familiar with the area the people and local events they are particularly adept at conducting reconnaissance missions acm forces will patiently watch coalition force installations in order to determine strength layout key locations daily routines and particularly reaction force capabilities acm forces may conduct an attack or even an ambush only to have observers assess responses of the attacked force it is not unreasonable to expect at least one observer on the inside of facility that can report not only on defenders reactions but also on the attack from the defenders perspectivefor official use only fouo for official use only fouoacm forces will use any means necessary to obtain information from the local population they may pay rewards exploit religious or tribal affiliations or threaten locals with various forms of punishment or death the same techniques may also be used to feed false information to coalition forces the local afghanistan population can be potent source of information tribal chiefs and village elders are typically the ones receiving the most information and can pass it to acm forces as easily as they can pass it to coalition forces consider the source of information and motivation of the source when acting on information obtained from the local population checkpoints the traditional fundraising function of the checkpoints declined under the taliban rule although it continued to use them for the same purpose the taliban checkpoints were more accepted since they were more systematic in nature than the ones operated by the warlords while leaders may attempt to keep

mine threat afghanistan remains one of the most heavily mined nations in the world with nearly 5 million mines still uncleared mines are found in all areas of the country in urban and rural areas near water wells and irrigation canals on roads around mountain strong points and in agricultural regions all these areas have seen frontline fighting additionally major military installations and strategic locations such as airfields and major cities were protected by extensive minefields border areas have been heavily mined in the past the afghanistan pakistan border was heavily mined with antipersonnel mines especially from the border north to kandahar the iranian border region was less heavily mined but has extensive surface laid antitank minefields to prevent supplies being trucked in across the open desert region south of herat rubble in many destroyed cities and villages has been mined sometimes in multiple layers acm forces and supporters can be expected to employ mines and other explosive devices in novel and ingenious ways against coalition forces well experienced acm forces have developed many successful and unconventional ttps for using explosive devices against personnel and vehicle targets particularly on trails city streets and roadways especially if coalition forces set patterns of movement figure 5 shows some other likely locations for mines figure 5

afghanistan improvised signs have been developed using readily available materials that will not burn wood is often stolen or cut for fires or are not worth stealing such as stones and rocks mines and uxo will be marked with piles of stones or rocks if paint is available stones will be painted the following should be seen as very reliable signs that mines are present rows of lightcoloredpainted white stones are used by the to mark safe lanes and cleared areas stones are usually in regular patterns and close together individual piles of lightcolored rocks unevenly spaced are used by the

where there is one mine there are usually more crossed sticks pieces of debris on routes footpaths are signs of mines pieces of material red attached to poles sticks and walls are signs of mines indicators acm forces will take great pains to emplace mines carefully and to camouflage them initial efforts to camouflage mine will be successful but after short time of natural weathering this effect will diminish or will be exposed by nature coalition forces must be trained to spot unusual groundvegetation conditions that might indicate unnatural activity such as mine laying depressions in

area where they dont go or an abandoned building that has not been salvaged it probably indicates an unsafe area with mines boobytraps or other ieds dead animals with missingdamaged limbs may also indicate mines are in the area note the animal may have walked some distance before dying reference has been made above to uxo which is generally categorized as follows dropped projected thrown and placed ordnance uxo may be found throughout afghanistan and should neither be disturbed nor approached acm forces may however attempt to reuse some of this ordnance in which case it should properly be considered as boobytrap or ied boobytraps bt and improvised explosive devices ieds over the last 20 years afghan fighters have become adept at producing bts and ieds much of this experience was gained during the soviet occupation but experience gained in bosnia and chechnya have also contributed to this knowledge bts and ieds will be sited to avoid detection to improve their effectiveness when activated although historically victim activated recent acm forces trends indicate an increasing use of remote or command detonation especially along roadways the use of ieds such as bts is limited only by the imagination of the enemy see figure 6 for some possible boobytrap and mine locations bts and ieds have the following characteristics usually explosive in nature usually actuated when an unsuspecting person disturbs an apparently harmless object designed to kill or incapacitate designed to cause random unexpected casualties and damage designed to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and suspicion may be initiated either physically trip wire pressure plate time fuze etc or remotely electronic device such as cell phone or other electronic timer or delay for official use only fouofor official use only fouofigure 6 possible boobytrap and mine locations the abundance of uxo and land mines has provided acm forces with ready supply of material for the construction of ieds and bts there are many different techniques for employing ieds coupling linking two ieds or mines to another usually with detonating cord daisy chaining linking mines commonly ap type with detonating cord detonation of one mine causes the other mines to detonate daisy chains of mines and detonation cord over 200 meters long involving several vacated buildings have been discovered in afghanistan boosting stacking buried mines on top of each other to increase the force of the blast sensitizing antitank mines cracking the pressure plate on some nonmetallic mines in order to reduce the pressure needed to initiate the mine common practice has been to emplace two explosive devices with either timed delay between explosions or remotely detonating each device to achieve maximum destruction or casualties one example would be car rigged with small initial explosive device and larger device which is detonated either by time delay or remotely to kill or injure onlookers eod police or military

fouologistics caravan and convoy movement acm forces will use the cover of convoys and caravans hereafter referred to as convoys in order to transport military supplies figure 7 shows toyota truck used in this role figure 7 toyota truck tactics are similar to those used by the mujahedin during the sovietafghan war convoys are used to bring weapons ammunition and other supplies into afghanistan from neighboring countries convoys use vehicles livestock camels donkeys or horses or combination of both for transportation convoys move almost exclusively at night to avoid detection by aircraft convoys traveling during daylight hours are usually decoys and rarely carry militaryrelated materials during the day convoys stop in wellconcealed places such as canyons caves dry riverbeds green zones vegetated areas near oases and rivers destroyed villages or any other available form of cover convoys usually have their own air defense including manpad surfacetoair missiles sams and vehiclemounted machine guns both vehicle and animal convoys depend on advance observation teams or patrols to determine the safety of the route vehicle convoy for official use only fouofor official use only fouo typical convoy deployment consists of three elements advance observation team decoy team and main element advance observation team personnel on horseback or motorcycle compose the advance team and precede the convoy by several miles they often fire their weapons in order to provoke return fire from suspected enemy or threat decoy team small portion of the convoy follows 15 to 45 minutes behind the observation team this group is loaded with foodstuffs clothing or other nonmilitary material and serves as decoy to draw out enemy troops main element the significant part of the convoy accompanied by armed mujahedin fighters follows as much as an hour or more behind the decoy team if either the observation team or the decoy team were interdicted the main element disperses and hides in available covered areas animal convoy advance observation team teenager an old man or couple of men with donkey will lead the convoy by 2 to 3 km as rule they do not carry weapons or radio and use small signal mirror to inform the next element about route security decoy team the decoy team follows the observation team at distance of 500 to 800 meters the distance is adjusted to maintain line of sight to observe the mirror signals from the advance team this element usually consists of 10 to 20 armed men equipped with radio to communicate with the main element they will often have two or three animals loaded with less valuable supplies to allay suspicion if stopped if they come under attack their mission is to offer sufficient resistance to allow the main element to turn back or take an alternate route main element the main element follows 1 to 2 km behind the decoy team and disperses if either forward unit encounters threat forces the most valuable items are usually carried in the middle of the convoy and are heavily guarded when fighting the soviets false deceptive convoys were often used in this case real convoy does not follow forward patrols instead the main element consisted of 5 to 15 animals with 20 to 40 handlers transporting nonmilitary items such as food or clothing this tactic prevented the soviets from blanket targeting similar convoys for ambush caches caches are used to supply acm forces throughout afghanistan acm forces typically travel with very light loads sometimes without weapons and ammunition as these forces arrive in their operational area they are supplied from nearby caches with arms ammunition and sometimes additional supplies such as food clothing and communication equipment needed to conduct specific operations or missions cache points also provide convenient hiding places for weapons unused ammunition and other supplies upon mission completion allowing acm forces to move about without incriminating materials in their possessionfor official use only fouo for official use only fouocache points are typically well concealed and range in size from small containing few rifles machine guns or rpg launchers and ammunition to large containing several hundred weapons of varying sizes ammunition communications equipment food clothing and in some cases shelter as well cache points include caves houses and possibly commercial or government facilities guards may be posted to protect cache points the number of guards is determined by the size and importance of the cache most individualshouseholds in rural areas have their own small cache of small arms and ammunition they are used for selfdefense purposes and are often embellished with personal decorations these caches should not be confused or mistaken for caches maintained by warlords or acm forces which include larger numbers of weapons and heavy or crewserved weapons for official use only fouofor official use only fouodenial and deception dd technical understanding and knowledge of signatures there are numerous potential scenarios where knowledge of target deception and signature management may be employed against coalition forces acm forces have demonstrated basic and sometimes effective knowledge of dd measures to counter coalition force capabilities some acm forces especially alqaida trained fighters understand the principles of thermal and radar imagers and nightvision equipment and have disseminated plans for countering these sensors the author of document found in afghanistan makes this distinction quite clear by saying nightvision devices see in the dark whereas thermal imager is heat detector countermeasures while few acm fighters have comprehensive knowledge of modern sensors most fighters have learned the importance of countermeasures to degrade or defeat these sensors some of the following countermeasures are quite simple but nonetheless effective spider holes acm fighters use various signaturecontrol techniques to avoid being targeted by thermal sights and sensors these techniques involve the use of spider hole fighting positions and vehicle coverings the spider hole consists of digging mansized hole or finding crack in rocks which can be covered for concealment once the hole is prepared it is covered by brush blankets andor tarps the coverings may also have layer of snow soil or ice on top or they may be wet vehicles may be concealed by covering them with tarp that supports snow or soil in manner similar to the spider hole sensor savvy acm soldiers used covering tarps to attempt to defeat infrared sensors and other means of detection they put tarps over vehicles and blankets over themselves when they noted an unarmed aerial vehicle overhead employed in combination with spider holes and placed beneath trees or bushes tarps and blankets proved quite effective they may be used due to lack of purposemade camouflage nets or coverings they are also readily available since many afghans use them as tents or sleeping bags reliable information indicates that acm forces understand the technical concept of reducing their signatures to blend with the ambient temperature of the terrain around them thermal decoys among the documents recovered from alqaida associated sites in afghanistan was document in arabic titled information to my afghani mujahideen brothers that outlined the basics of nightvision equipment and thermal imagers it described technique to counter thermal imagers that consists of creating thermal decoys with smoldering wood fires built in shallow pits to make the pilot launch his missiles at the pit it discussed how to build and place these decoys with the intention of creating false heatemitting targets ºsubtle differences will differentiate between this form of heatemitting false target and the heat signatures of real targets c42the decoy targets would appear somewhat brighter than clothed fighter for official use only fouofor official use only fouoc42the decoy signature would also differ from that of vehicle exhaust in that other parts of the vehicle that are normally present in the thermal image would be absent in the case of the deception however an observer unaware of possible deception may not recognize these clues ºamong the documents recovered from alqaidaassociated sites in afghanistan was document that provided insight into how one might deceive radar with decoy built from available materials c42the method described using pieces of metal including tin cans interspersed with pile of rocks approximating the size of the vehicle or other asset such as crew served weapon that the decoy depicts c42this decoy in combination with thermal decoys and signature management could prove effective in target denial and deception c42operationally these methods could be used to simulate the presence of acm troops in an area where they are not deception to conceal or to deceive coalition forces as to the disposition and composition of an actual acm presence tactical responses acm forces may use variety of tactical methods to counter coalition forces capabilities to include spider holes caves rocks etc to hide in or behind decoys for equipment and positions camouflage individual equipment and positions cloth coverings blankets tarps etc to cover weapons vehicles and fighting positions blending with civilian population dispersing into small unitsteams for movement traveling over hard or rocky surfaces to avoid leaving tracks moving under cover of darkness using commercial vehicles delivery trucks
