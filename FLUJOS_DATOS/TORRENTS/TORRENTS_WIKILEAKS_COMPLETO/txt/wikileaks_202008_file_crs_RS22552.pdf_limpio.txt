unfinished appropriations bills into either an omnibus spending bill or yearlong continuing resolution that likely would hold spending at close to fy2006 levels for most discretionary prog rams these funding decisions for fy2007 might intersect with congressional c onsideration of the fy2008 budget and appropriations which begins shortly after the release of the administrations budget request in early february 2007 of interest to agriculture is the fy2008 budget resolution whereby congress will establish blueprint for all federal spending over multiyear period which could set the fiscal parameters of the next omni bus farm bill to be debated in 2007 see crs report rl33412 agriculture and related agencies fy2007 appropriations and crs report rl33037 previewing 2007 farm bill httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22552crs2 farm disaster assistance the 109th congress debated extensively whether multibillion dollar emergency disaster assistance package should be enacted to compensate farmers for 2005 and 2006 production losses caused by na tural disasters in the final week of the 109th congress an amendment samdt 5205 that would have provided an timated 38 billion in supplemental disaster aid was defeated during debate on the fy2007 agriculture appropriations bill hr 5384 the ame ndment was supported by numerous farm groups primarily in response to vere drought in the plains states opposing the amendment were the administration and fiscal conservatives in congress who insisted that any assistance needed to be offset with other spending reductions in the 110th congress supporters have introduced package of assi stance s 284 that is similar to samdt 5205 series of severe winter storms in late 2006 and early 2007 could broaden the scope of proposed assistance to incl

bution of federal support to producers of farm commodities is traditiona lly the most contentious component of farm bill however other food and ag ricultural issues notably those surrounding conservation rural development trade domes tic food assistance nd biofuels also will be debated key question for the 110th congress will be whethe r to extend farm support programs as currently

agricultural trade the 110th congress will continue to monitor the administrations participation in the current doha round of multilate ral trade negotiations which has focused on agricultural trade liberalization negotia tions were indefinitely spended in july 2006 when compromise agreement on reducing subsidies or expanding market access for agricultural products could not be reached while ne w multilateral trade agr eement may not be in place before congress takes up the 2007 farm b ill new farm bill will nevertheless have to contend with existing wto commitments in agriculture and possible challenges to us subsidies in wto dispute settlements see crs report rl33144 wto doha round the agricultural negotiations meanwhile the 110th congress will consider bilateral free trade agreements

wto cotton case in march 2005 wto appellate panel ruled against the united states in dispute settlement case brought by brazil stating that elements of the us cotton program are not consistent with us trade commitments in response congress authorized the elimination of the step2 cotton program effective august 1 2006 following the indefinite suspension of the wto doha r ound of multilateral trade negotiations in july 2006 brazil has pressed for furt her reductions in us cotton support in response to the panel ruling consequently additional permanent modificati ons to us farm programs may still be needed to fully comply with the actionable subsidies portion of the wto ruling some policymakers are concerned that successful challenge of the cotton program in the wto could have implicati ons for the other farm commodity support programs for example on january 8 2007 ca requested cons ultations with the united states on us domestic corn subsidies as the first step in pursuing wto challenge any changes to farm commodity programs ultimately will be decided by congress most likely in the context of the 2007 farm bill see crs report rs22187 us agricultural policy response to wto cotton

industries agriculture is major consumer of energy directly as fuel or electricity and indirectly as fertilizers and chemicals by raising the overall price structure of producti on agriculture sustained high energy prices could result in significantly lower farm and rural incomes and are generating considerable concern about longerterm impacts on farm prof itability agriculture also is viewed as potentially important producer of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel although farmbased energy production remains small relative to total us energy needs current law requires that biofuels use gr ow from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 75 billion gallons in 2012 this standard along with ta x credit incentives is expected to encourage significant increases in us ethanol producti on although the increased use of corn for energy improves the prices and income of corn growers some policymakers are concerned that higher prices for corn will add to livestock grower feed costs see crs report rl32712 agriculturebased renewable energy production conservation programs spending for conservation programs wh ich help producers protect and improve natural resources on some farmed land nd retire other land fro m production has grown rapidly since the 2002 farm bill this grow th in spending reflects the expanded reach ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22552crs4 conservation programs which now involve many more landow ners and types of rural lands one topic that continues to attract congressional interest is implementation of the conservation security program enacted in 2002 some stakeholde rs have questioned why usda has implemented the program in only few watersheds and why congress has limited funding even though the program was enacted as tr ue entitlement the environmental conservation and agriculture communities have started to identify conservation policy options that might be considered in the next farm bill see crs report rl33556 soil and water conservation an overview agroterrorism the potential for terrorist attacks agains t agricultural targets agroterrorism is recognized as national security threat food defens protecting the food supply against possible attack has received incr eased attention since 2001 through increased appropriations laborat ory and response capacities are be ing upgraded national response plans now incorporate agroterrorism yet some in congress want additional laws or oversight to increase the level of food defe nse particularly re garding interagency coordination response and recovery leadership and ensuring adequate border inspections see crs report rl32521 agroterrorism thre ats and preparedness food safety approximately 76 million people get sick and 5000 die from food related illnesses in the united states each year it is estimate d congress frequently conducts oversight and periodically considers legisla tion on food safety and could do so again some members continue to be interested in such issues as whether appropriate resources and safeguards are in place to limit microbiological contamin ation of fresh meat poultry and produce the need if any for stronger enforcement or recall authority the regulation of bioengineered foods human antimicrobial resi stance which some link partly to misuse of antibiotics in animal feed and interest among some in reorganizing food safety authorities and responsibilities possibly under single agency see crs report rl32922 meat and poultry inspection background and selected issues avian influenza since 2003 highly pathogenic avian influe nza h5n1 has spread from asia into europe the middle east and africa however cases of h5n1 have been found yet in the united states because avian flu is high ly contagious in domestic poultry and can be carried by wild birds usda advocates stri ngent onfarm biosecurity controlling avian flu in poultry is seen as the best way to prevent human pandemic from developing congress has responded to the threat by pr oviding emergency and regular appropriations for surveillance both domestically and internationally and holding hearings covering the animal disease and food safety furthe r funding will be necessary for surve illance vaccine stockpiles and first responde r equipment see crs report rl33795 avian influenza in poultry and wild birds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22552crs5 food traceability and animal identification many believe that us agricultural pr oducers and food processors should improve their ability to identify and trace their produc ts including animals through the food chain whether to facilitate th removal of contaminated pr oducts quickly contain animal disease outbreaks enable consum ers to verify labeling claims andor for country of origin labeling cool one issue is whether more universal animal identification system should be mandated and who should pay nother is mandatory cool for fresh red meats produce and peanuts which congress required in the 2002 farm bill but has since delayed until september 30 2008 hr 357 would require mandatory cool implementation on september 30 2007 while some want cool to be implemented others would prefer voluntary beling see crs report rs22526 animal agriculture selected issues for congress cftc reauthorization the commodity futures trading commission cftc is an independent federal agency that regulates the futures trading industry the cftc is subject to periodic reauthorization current authority expired on septem ber 30 2005 congress traditionally uses the reauthorization process to consider amendments to the commodity exchange act cea which provides the basis for federal regulation of commodity futures trading among the issues in the debate are 1 regulation of energy derivatives markets where some see excessive price volatility and lack of effective regulation 2 the market in security futures or futures contracts ba sed on single stocks where cumbersome and duplicative regulation is blamed for low trading volumes 3 the regulatory status of foreign futures exchanges selling contracts in the united states and 4 the legality of futureslike contracts based on foreign currency prices offere d to retail investors see crs report rs22028 cftc reauthorization farm labor and immigration reform hired farmworkers are an important com ponent of agricultural production some of these laborers are under guest worker programs which are meant to assure employers eg fruit vegetable and hortic ulture growers of an adequa supply of labor when and where it is needed while not adding perman ent residents to the us population the connection between farm labor and immigration policies is longstanding one particularly with regard to us empl oyers use of workers from mexico the 109th congress considered the issue without resoluti on as part of larger debate over initiation of broadbased guest worker program increased border enforcement and employer sanctions to curb the flow of unauthorized workers into the
