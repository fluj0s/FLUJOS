the meaning of the word happen in the clause provides one example the clause states the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session article 2 section 2 cl 3 in part he stated the substantial purpose of the constitution was to keep these offices filled and the powers

the senate share the power to make appointments to the highestlevel politica lly appointed positions in the federal government1 the constitution also empowers the president unilaterally to make temporary appointment to such position if it is vacant and the senate is in recess2 such an appointment termed recess appointment expires at the end of the following session of the senate3 the records of debate at the constitutional convention and the federa list papers provide little evidence of the framers intentions in the recess appointment clau opinions by late r attorneys general however suggested that the purpose of the clause was to allow the president to maintain the continuity of administrativ government through the temporary filling of offices during periods when the sena was not in session at which time his nominees could not be c onsidered or confirmed4 this interpretation is bolstered by the fact that both houses of congress had relatively short sessions and long recesses during the early years of the republic in fact until the beginning of the 20th century the senate was on average in session less than half the year5 this report identifies rece ss appointments made by

frequently asked questions by henry b hogue in 17 of the 162 cases in which the president had previously submitted nomination to the senate the nominations had been under senate consideration for more than year at the time of the rece ss appointment in 25 cases the nominations had been under senate consid eration for less than month at the time of the recess appointment the elapsed times between

presented here the mean or average and the median the mean is the more familiar measure and it was calculated by adding together the elapsed times for all of the cases and di viding the resulting sum by the total number of cases 162 each appointment that had been pr eceded by nomination is case in this instance the median is the middle number in set of observations or in this case because of an even number of observations the average of the two middle numbers in data sets such as this one where the data are skewed because of limited number of extreme values the median is often considered to be th more accurate of the two measures of central tendency 16 us congress joint committee on printing 20072008 official congressional directory 110th congress s pub 11013 110th cong washingt on gpo

generally shorter than were the recesses of earlier times which occurred chiefly between sessions16 the recess appointment s clause does not specify the length of time that the senate must be in recess before the president may ma ke recess appointment over the last century as shorter recesses ve become more commonplace attorneys general and the office of legal counsel ve offered differing views on this issue in 1993 department of justice brief implie d that the president may make recess appointment during recess of more than three days17 it stated the constitution restricts the senates ability to adjourn its session for more than three days without obtaining the consent of the house of repres entatives it might be argued that this means that the framers did not consider one two and three day recesses to be constitutionally significant it has become commonplace for presidents to make recess appointments during recesses of less than 30 days between january 20 1981 the beginning of
