employee benefit plans governmental plans and church plans genera lly are not subject to the law erisa supersedes state laws relating to employee benefit plans except for certain matters such as state insurance banking and securities laws and divorce property settlement orders by state courts an employee benefit plan may be either pension plan which provides retirement benefits or welfare benefit plan2 which provides other kinds of employee benefits such as health and disability benefits most erisa provisions deal with pension plans erisa does not require employers to provide pensions or welfare benefit plans but those that do mu st comply with its requirements erisa sets standards that pension plans must meet in regard to who must be covere d participation how long person has to work to be entitled to pension vesting and how much must be set aside each year to pay future pensionsfunding erisa sets fiduciary standards that require employee benefit plan funds be handled prudently and in the best interest s of the participants it requires plans to inform participants of their rights under th plan and of the plans financial status and it gives plan participants the right to sue in federal court to recover benefits that they have earned under the plan erisa also established the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc to insure that plan participants receive promised benefits up to statutory limit s hould plan terminate with lack of sufficient assets to pay promised benef its in order to encourage em ployers to establish pension plans congress has granted certain tax ductions and deferrals to qualified plans to be qualified for tax preferences under the internal revenue code irc plans must meet requirements with respect to pension plan contributions benefits and distributions and there are special rules for plans that primarily benefit highly compensated employees or business owners httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34443crs2 3 when plan participant receives

insurance program historical development of pens ion plans in the unites states the first employersponsored pensi on plans in the united states were established in the late 19th century in the railroad industry at that time pensions were regarded as gifts in recognition of long service rather than as form of compensation protected by law pension benefits often were paid from employers annual revenues and so metimes were reduced or terminated if the company paying the pension became unprofitable or went out of business congress first gave pensi ons and profitsharing plans preferential income tax treatment in the 1920s at that time few hous eholds paid income taxes so these tax benefits did not immediately spur the growth of the private pension system the revenue acts of 1938 and 1942 outlined more specific requirements for taxqualified pension plans including the requirement that benefits and contributions not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees tax qualification means that the employer can deduct the amounts contributed to the plan the earnings on the pension trust fund are exempt from taxes until distributed and covered employees do not have to pay in come tax on the employers contributions to the plan3 employers also are allowed to int egrate their pensi on benefit formulas with social security benefits to partly offset the relatively more generous income replacement rates that social security pays to lowwage workers4 during the second worl d war 19411945 pensions and other deferred compensation arrangements were exempt from wartime wage controls employers who were unable to pay higher wages due to these controls could increase workers total compensation by offering new or incr eased pension benefits also in 1940s the federal courts declared that pensions were subject to collective bargaining and that employers had to include pensions among the benefits for which unions could negotiate5 in addition the expansion of the in come tax to include more households and the introduction of higher marginal inco tax rates made th tax advantages of pensions considerably more valuable to workers both of these developments led to more widespread adoption of employers ponsored pensions during the 1950s and 1960shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34443crs3 6 pl 85836 72 stat 997 aug 29 1958origins of erisa as the number and size of private pe nsion plans grew in the 1950s and 1960s so did the number of instances in which employers or unions attempted to use the assets of these plans for purposes other than paying benefits to retired workers and their surviving dependents in 1958 congress passed the welfare and pension plans disclosure act 6 which required public disclosure of pension plan finances advocates of the legislation expected that greater tran sparency of pension funding would ensure that the funds held in trust for workers pensions would not be misused by plan sponsors after the studeba ker automobile company terminated its underf unded pension plan in 1963 leaving several thousand workers and retirees without the pensions that they had b een promised congress began considering legislation to ensure the security of pension benefits in the private sector during the early 1970s both the house and senate labor committees drafted bills to regulate the private pension system the senate labor and public welfare committee reported pension bill in 1972 up to that point the legislation had been handled exclusively as labor issue but since most private pension plans benefitted from the favorable tax treatment accorded th em under the internal revenue code the senate finance committee also asserted its jurisdiction as passed by congress in 1974 erisa included elements produced by the house and senate labor committees the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee title i of the law which sets standards for pension plans of employers engaged in interstate commerce is unde r the jurisdiction of the house committee on education and labor and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions title ii which makes conforming

jurisdiction over the pbgc erisa was signed into law by presiden t gerald ford on labor day september 2 1974 congress has amended erisa over th years to provide greater protection to survivors and s pouses of pe nsion plan participants improve pension funding practices strengthen the finances of the pbgc alter the limits on taxdeductible pension plan contributions and to ensure that taxfavored plans are broadly based and do not unduly favor firms owners nd other highly compensated employees before erisa was enacted an employer could terminate an unfunded pension plan without being liable for any additiona l pension contributions if there were insufficient assets in the pension plan to pay all claims participants had legal recourse to demand that employers use comp any assets to continue funding the plan erisa protects the benefits of participants in most priv atesector pension plans by requiring companies with defi ned benefit pension plans to fully fund the benefits that participants have earned th law prohibits companies from using pension funds for purposes other than paying pensions and retiree health benefits it also limits the age and lengthofservice requireme

erisa also requires all privatesector sponsor s of defined benefit pension plans to purchase insurance from th pension benefit gu aranty corporation types of qualified retirement plans erisa and the irc classify employe rsponsored retirement plans as either defined benefit db plans or defined contribution dc plans7 defined benefit plan specifies either the benefit that will be paid to plan participant or the method of determining the benefit the plan spons ors contributions to the plan vary from year to year depending on the plans funding requirements bene fits often are based on average pay and years of service for example the benefit might be defined as 15 of the average of the employees high est five years of pay multiplied by his or her number of years of service this w ould result in benef it equal to 45 of participants highfive average pay after 30 years of service some db plans particularly plans covering workers who belong to unions pay flat benefit per year of service for example if the benefit is defined as 30 per month for each year of service the monthly pension benefit af ter 30 years of service would be 900 erisa requires db plans to be fully fu nded the assets held in the pension trust must be sufficient to pay the benefits that the plans participants have earned the employer bears the investme nt risk for the assets held by the plan if the assets decrease in value or if the plans liab ilities increase the plan sponsor must make additional contributions to the pension trus t fund the assets of qualified db plans are exempt from creditors claims if th sponsor is in bankruptcy and db plan benefits are insured up to certain limits by the pension benefit guaranty corporation defined contribution plan is one in which the contributions are specified but not the benefits defined contributi on plan also called an individual account plan is one that provides an individua l account for each participant that accrues benefits based solely on the amount cont ributed to the account and any income expenses and investment ga ins or losses to the account8 the employee bears the investment risk in dc plan and dc plans are not insured by the pbgc when erisa was enacted in 1974 most employersponsored retirement plans were defined benefit plans the number of defined bene fit plans continued to grow until the mid1980s the number of db plan s then began to fall while the number of dc plans increased analysts have ggested several possible reasons for these trends including rising global competition that put greater pressure on companies to reduce costs more mobile workforce th at preferred the portability of benefits earned in dc plans the higher costs of maintaining db plans after stronger funding requirements were put into place by erisa and the greater attractiveness of dc plans after section 401k of th tax code was added by the revenue act of 1978 9 although the standards established under er isa have made workers pensions more secure some employers especially small employers apparently decided that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34443crs5 10 see benefit accrual and age discrimination in section iii for add itional discussion of hybrid plansplan funding requirements of erisa made db plans too expensive to maintain the decline in the number of db plans since the 1980s has been the result mainly of terminations of

note includes active participants vested separated participants and retired participants hybrid plans in recent years many employers have converted their traditional db plans to hybrid plans that have characteristics of both defined benefit and defined c ontribution plans the most common of these hybrids is the cash balance plan cash balance plan looks like defined contribution plan in that the accrued benefit is defined in terms of an account balance the employer contributes an amount equal to fixed percentage of pay to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however cash balance plan is not an individual account owned by the participant assets are held in common trust and each participants account balance is merely record of his or her accrued benefit because plan sponsors are obligated to provide the participants with benefits that are less than the sum of contributions to the plan plus interest cash balance plans are considered to be fined benefit plans10 the revenue act of 1978 and 401k plans the most common defined contribution plans are 401k plans named for the section of the irc added by the revenue act of 1978 under which they were author ized in 1981 the irs published regulations for irc 401k soon after th first 401k plans were established ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34443crs6 11 irc 401k authorizes cash or deferred arrangements under which an

plans under irc 403b nd 457 predate 401k but these plans are available only to employees of taxexempt or ganizations and state and local governments 13 an exception to this rule is the money purchas plan which is dc plan but also is pension plan established under irc 401a and must offer plan participants an annuity 14 some firms automatically enro ll all eligible employees in their 401k plans so that the default condition is for the employee to be enrolled with the option to quit the plan 15 for more information see crs report rl33703 summary of the pens ion protection act of 2006 by patrick purcell 401k plan is an individual account plan11 its defining feature is that the employee as well as the employer can ma ke pretax contributions to the account taxes on these contributions and on investment earnings are deferred until the money is withdrawn before section 401k wa s enacted dc plans for privatesector employees were funded by em ployer contributions or by aftertax employee contributions12 typically participants in 401k plan can allocate their account balances among menu of investment options selected by the employer or by plan administrator appointed by the employer the participant s retirement benefit consists of the balance in the account whic h is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus intere st dividends and capital gains or losses minus fees and expenses upon separating from the employer the participant usually has the choice of receiving these funds through series of withdrawals or as lump sum some 401k plans allow participants to purch ase life annuity through an insurance company but defined contribution plans are not required to offer annuities13 in most 401k plans the employee must elect to have contributions to the plan deducted from his or her pay decide how much to have deducte d and direct these contributions among the pl ans investment options14 the employer often contributes either fixed dollar amount or percentage of pay to the account on behalf of each participant employer contributions are sometimes conditioned on the employee also making contributions in 401k plan the employer can reduce or suspend its contributions to the plan if business cond itions are unfavorable for the firm or for any other reason although 401k plans are the most numerous dc plans they are not the only kind of dc plan see box

valuation of plan assets prior to enactment of the ppa plan sponsor could determine the value of plans ssets using actuarial valuations which can differ from the current market value of those assets for example in an actuarial valuation the plans investment returns could be smoothed averaged over fiveyear period and the average asset va lue could range from 80 to 120 of the fair market value averaging asset values reduces volatility in the measurement of plan assets that can be caused by yeartoyear fluctuations in interest rates and the rate of return on investments averaging therefore reduces the yeartoyear volatility in the plan sponsors required minimum cont ributions to the pension plan the ppa narrowed the range for actuarial valuati ons to less than 90 and more than 110 of

discharge their duties solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing be nefits to participants and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan105 the duty of loyalty applies in situations where the fiduciary is confronted with potential conflict of interest for instance when pension plan trustee has responsibilities to both the plan and the entity such as the employ er or union sponsoring the plan106 however just because an erisa fiduciary engages in transaction that incidentally benefits the fiduc iary or third party does not necessarily mean that fiduciary breach has occurred107 one case to address this idea is donovan v bierwirth case under which pension plan tr ustees who were also corporate officers were responsible for deciding wh ether they should tender shares of company stock in order to thwart hostile takeover attempt108 the trustees not only decided against tendering the stock but also deci ded to purchase additional company stock for the pension plan in finding that the trustees had breached their fiduciary duties the court in donovan noted that it is not breach of fiduciary duty if trustee who after careful and impartial i nvestigation makes decision that while benefitting the plan also incidentally benefits the co rporation or the fiduc iaries themselves however fiduciary decisions must be made with an eye single to the interests of the participants and beneficiaries109 the court articulated that the trustees have duty to avoid placing themselves in position where their acts as officers and directors of the corporation will prevent their f unctioning with the complete loyalty to participants demanded of them as trustees of pension

liquidity and current return of the portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow requirements of the plan and the projected return of the portfolio relative to the plans funding objectives119 3 duty to diversify investments section 404a1c of erisa requires fiduciaries to diversify the investments of plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so120 in general it is believed that fiduciaries should not i nvest an unreasonably large proportion of plans portfolio in single s ecurity in single type of security or in various securities dependent upon the success of single enterprise or upon conditions in single locality121 courts have agreed that erisa section 404a1c does not create diversification obligation in terms of fixed criteria but instead requires determination based on the specific facts of each individual case122 in giw industries inc v trevor stewart 123 the court conclude d that the defendant investment manager breached its duty to diversify investments by investing too heavily in longterm government bonds by investing 70 percent of the plans assets in longterm bonds rather than shortte rm bonds the

circumstances and thus within the exception in section 404a1c the court identified four factors that supported th position that graham did not imprudently introduce risk of large loss by purchasing the property graham 112 f3d at 210 first there was requirement that the plan make payments to beneficiaries until age 65 death or disability and the average age of the plan participants was 37 when the property was purchased remaining plan assets were available to cove r projected payouts for the next twenty years second the purchase was better insulated from the possible return of high inflation when the plans holdings consisted solely of cash and short term instruments there was little hedge against inflation id at 211 third there was significant cushion between the purchase price and the propertys appraised valu finally the trustees expertise in the development of industrial property supported the conclusion that the investment was prudent after considering these factors the court was persuaded that the investment did not carry risk of large loss 128 29 usc 1104a1d 129 see employee benefits guide matthew bender company inc 2415 2007 130 see george norwood who is entitled

document or instrument that establishes plan or maintains plan but also to other writings that have substantive effect on the plan129 these writings have included investment management agreements collective bargaining agreements and even internal memoranda regarding the sale of plan assets130 under section 404a1d if plan provision conflicts with erisa fiduciary is obligated to ignore the plan provision131 courts have evaluated this requirement in the context of when comp liance with plan provision leads to breach of other fiduciary duties the depar tment of labor has argued that if obeying

participant or beneficiary in an erisa plan to bring an action against the plan to recover be nefits under the terms of the plan or to enforce or clarify the plainti ffs rights under the terms of the plan under this section if plaintiffs claim for benefits is imprope rly denied the plaintiff may sue to recover the unpaid benefit plaintiff may also seek declaration to preserve right to future benefits or an injunction to prevent future denial of benefits175 in terms of monetary remedies sec tion 502a1b provides that successful plaintiff may receive the bene fits the plaintiff would have been entitled to under the terms of the plan compensatory or punitive damages are not available in addition as section 502 of erisa is considered to contain exclusive federal remedies section 502a1b has been held to preem pt state or common law causes of action that may provide for more generous reme dies than what is available under erisa the preemption of these state law claims has been controversial as it can significantly impact plaintiffs relative to their opportunity to recover various types of damages under state law the question of which state law claims are preempted by erisa 502a1b has been controversia l and has received si gnificant attention from the courts the supreme court in pilot life v dedeaux176 evaluated whether state law claim for wrongful denial of benefits

the carriers violated the texas health care liability act when they failed to exercise ordinary care in denying benefit coverage180 the insurance carriers removed the cases to the fede ral district court and argu ed that section 502a1b of erisa completely preempted the respondents causes of action at issue for the supreme court was wh ether the individuals causes of action were preempted by section 502a of eris and thus removal to federal court was proper respondents argued among other th ings that their state law claim for violating the duty of ordinary care aris independently of any duty imposed under erisa however the court disagreed finding that respondents bring suit only to rectify wrongful denial of benefits promised under er isaregulated plans and do not attempt to remedy any violation of legal duty independent of erisa the court relying on its decision in pilot life among other cases ex plained that state cause of action that attempts to author ize larger remedy than erisa section 502a does not place it outside of an erisa claim181 3 claims to redress breaches of fiduciary duty section 502a2 of erisa authorizes the secretary of labor participant beneficiary or plan fiduciary to bring civil action caused by breach of fiduciary duty under section 409 of erisa that section makes pl an fiduciary personally liable for breaches against an erisa plan and breaching fiduc iary must make good to the plan any losses to the plan resulting from breach nd restore to the plan any profits made from using the assets of the plan in improper ways182 it also subjects such fiduciary to other relief as court may d eem appropriate including removal of the fiduciary one controversial issue with respect to breach of fiduciary duty claims under erisa has been that while an individual plaintiff eg plan participant may bring civil action under section 502a2 the supreme court has found that any recovery must inure to the benefit of plan as whole183 in massachusetts mutual life insurance co v russell 184 the supreme court evaluated whether plan beneficiary could bring civil action for monetary da mages against plan fiduciary who had been responsible for the improper

defined benefit plan the court applied the logic in russell to defined benefit plans see id at 1213court rejected the benefici arys claim explaining that erisa section 409 did not authorize beneficiary to bring claim against fiduciary for monetary damages185 based on the text of section 409 and the gislative history of erisa the court opined that relief for an individual bene ficiary was not ava ilable under section 409 plaintiff could only recover losses on behalf of the plan the supreme courts 2008 decision in larue v dewolff boberg associates addressed whether section 502a2 auth orizes participant in defined contribution plan to sue pl an fiduciary and recover losse s to the plan if the losses only affected an indi viduals plan account186 in larue participant in 401k plan requested that plan administrators change an investment in his individual account the plan administrators failed to make this change and the individuals account suffered losses of approx imately 150000 larue brought an action under section 502a2 alleging that the plan adminis trator breached his fiduciary duty by neglecting to properly follow the investment instructions the court held for the plan participant finding that althoug h 502a2 does not provide remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan inju ries that provision does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in participants individual account in the decision justice steven s writing for the majority distinguished larue from the russell case in two ways first the court explained that the type of fiduciary misconduct occurring in rue violated principal statutory duties imposed by erisa that relate to the pr oper plan management administration and investment of fund assets187 conversely in russell the fiduciarys breach ie delay in processing be nefit claim fell outside of these principal duties188 second the court found that in russell the emphasis placed on protecting the entire plan from fiduciary breach under section 409 applies to defined benefit plans which were the norm at the time of the case189 however as the supreme court noted in larue defined contribution plans are more popular today and the entire plan language in russell does not apply to these pl ans the court explained that for defined benefit pl ans fiduciary misconduct woul d not affect an individual entitlement to benefit unle ss the misconduct detr imentally affected the entire plan by contrast for defined c ontribution plans fiduciary misconduct need not threaten the solvency of the entire plan to reduce benefits below the am ount that participantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34443crs42 190 id at 12 191 id although all of the justices agreed on the outcome of the larue case they

historically the most common remedy in the courts of law was money id at 135 the most common remedy in the courts of equity was an order for an individual to do something or refrain from doing something such as with an injunction id the scope of remedies available at law and at equity have been the subject of debate while there is longer this divided court system courts may still ev aluate

had sought monetary relief for erisa section 502a3 violations the supreme court first evaluated the meaning of equitable relief in mertens v hewitt associates 196 in this case plan participants brought an action under section 502a3 seeking moneta ry relief after the plan act uary failed to make proper actuarial assumptions in calculating plan assets participants claimed that this error

relief under section 502a3 similar to the great west case in sereboff plan participants were in an automobile accident and their health plan paid medical expenses on the participants behalf later after the participants had received settlement amount arising from claim brought because continuedparticipants sought was nothing other than compensatory damages and held in 54 decision that erisa secti on 502a3 did not authorize suits for compensatory damages against nonfiduciary in ex plaining why these damages were not available the court articulated that equitable relief with respect to section 502a3 is relief that was typically av ailable in equity such as injunction mandamus or restitution wh ile it had been argued that the relief petitioner sought was considered equitable under the common law of trusts the court rejected this argument it explained that while legal remedies may have been available to plaintiffs in court of equity this idea did not define the reach of section 502a3 and that what was availabl under section 502a3 were the more traditional forms of equitable relief197 the supreme court applied the reasoning of mertens in another decision interpreting section 502a3 great west life annuity insurance co v knudson 198 in this case group health plan sought reimbursement from plan beneficiary for amounts the plan had paid after the benefi ciary was severely injured in an automobile accident after the accident the beneficiary brought an action against the automobile manufacturer and ot hers and she received settlement the plan claimed it was entitled to the settlement amount based on provision in the plan requiring plan participants to reimburse the plan for any am ounts the beneficiary receives from third party199 in another 54 decision the court found for the beneficiary holding that section 502a3 did not authorize the reimbursement sought by the plan the health plan claimed the relief sought was restitution200 which could be characterized as equitable relief the court refused to accept this r easoning explaining that while restitution could be found trad itionally in courts of equity what mattered for purposes of section 502a3 was whether the restitution sought was to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or propert in the defendants possessi on because the proceeds of the settlement were not in the identifiable defendants possession ie they had been paid to trust to the plaintiffs attorney etc the plaintiffs cl aim for equitable relief failed201 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34443crs44 201 continued of the accident the health plan sought reimbur sement from plan participants in finding that the relief sought by the administrators wa s equitable under section 502a3 the court distinguished the sereboff case from great

complex and controversial the provisions at issu in the preemption debate are 1 section 514 erisas express preemption section under which erisa may supercede state law and 2 section 502a which provide s for claims that may be brought and remedies plaintiff may recover under er isa and may preempt state law cause of action 1 section 514 erisas express preemp tion provision section 514 has three important parts214 first under section 514a erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan the supreme court has examined the scope of this provision on several occasions in one of the first ke cases to address erisa preemption shaw v delta airlines 215 the court interpreted the term relate to as applying to any state law that has connection with or reference to such plan216 the court has stated that under this broad common sense meaning state law may relate to benefit plan and thereby be preempted even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans or the effect is only indirect217 while the courts early decisions eg shaw suggested that the application of erisas explicit preemption clause was virtually limitless its decision in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans v travelers insurance co signaled change in the courts interpretation of section 514a218 in travelers several commercial insurers challenged state law that required them but not blue cross and blue shie ld to pay surcharges the commercial insurers argued that the law was preempted by erisa because it related to employersponsored health insurance plans in addressing the issue of erisas preemption clause the court first noted that there is presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law219 the court then turned to whether congress intended to preempt state law by looking to the structure and purpose of the act220 the court concluded that nothing in the language of the act or the context of its passage indicates that congress chose to displace general health care regulation which historically has been matter of local concern221 in other cases the court has similarly recognized the

from erisa preemption under section 514b examined among other things whether the state law in question regulated the business of insurance under the mccarranferguson act an act describing federal and state roles in insurance regulation see eg metropolitan life insurance v massachusetts 471 us 724 1985 pilot life v dedeaux 481 us 41 1987 under the mccarranferguson factors state w regulates the

erisa222 however despite the traveler s case arguably narrowing the scope of section 514a this section still is considered to broadly preempt state law223 the second important part is the sav ings clause under erisa section 514b which provides exemptions to erisa preemp tion the savings clause allows states to enforce any law which regulate s insurance banking or securities224 the issue of which state laws regulate in surance under section 514b has received considerable attention from the supreme court an important case interpreting the savings clause is kentucky association of health plans inc v miller225 where the supreme court found that kentuckys an willing provider awp laws which prohibited insurers from discriminating against health care provider willing to meet the insurers criteria for participation in the health plan was saved from erisa preemption in finding that the awp laws regulated insurance the court departed from reasoning it had used in earlier savings clause cases and articulated new two part test226 under this test state law falls within the ambit of the savings clause if it is specifically directed toward the in surance industry and substantially affects the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured227 in evaluating whether the law was specifically directed toward the practice of insurance the court explained that the savings clause regulates insurance not insurers and that insurers may only be regulated with respect to their insurance practices228 petitioner hmos argued among other things that the awp laws were not directed toward insurers as the laws regulated both the insurance industry and doctors who seek to form and maintain pr ovider networks the court rejected this argument and pointed out that the law did not impose any prohibitions orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34443crs48 229 miller 538 us at 338 in its explanation the cour t gave an example of law that would require insurance companies to pay their

selffunded or selfinsured health plan is an employee benefit plan under which an employer provides health benefits directly to plan participants as opposed to offering benefits through health insurance because selffunded plans do not provide benefits though insurance they cannot be regulated by the states under the exemption to preemption provided by the savings clauserequirements on health providers and that health care providers were still able to enter into exclusive health care networks outside the state in regard to the second part of the ne w test the court explained that it was necessary for law to affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured to be covered under the savings clause otherwise any law imposed upon an insurance company could be deemed to regulate insurance229 petitioners had argued that the awp laws do not alter or affect the terms of insurance policies but instead concern the relationship between insureds and thir dparty providers230 the court disagreed and pointed out that it had never held that state law must alter or control the terms of the insurance policies in order to regulate insurance231 the court found that awp laws affected th risk pooling arrangement because they altered the scope of permi ssible bargains between insurers and insureds and restricted insurers ability to offer lower premiums in exchange for acceptance of closed network of providers232 the third important part of erisa pr eemption known as the deemer clause generally provides that an employee benef it plan governed by erisa shall not
