1 national interoperability field operations guide us department of homeland security ofice of emergency communications version 13 may 2009 1 how to use the national interoperability field operations guide what is the national interoperability field operations guidethe national interoperability field operations guide nifog is pocketsized listing of land mobile radio lmr frequencies that are often used in disasters or other incidents where radio interoperability is required and other information useful to emergency communicators it is based on the national interoperability frequency guide terms used in this document fcc federal communications commission fcc rules contained in title 47 code of federal regulations 47 cfr federal used herein to differentiate between radio stations of the u nited states government and those of any state tribal local or regional governmental authority the ntia manual uses the terms government and nongovernment to avoid the possible confusion of state government oficials thinking they are go vernment rather than nongovernment the term federal is used ncc the public safety national coordination committee ncc fed eral advisory committee formed by the fcc to advise it on interoperability not to be fused with the national coordinating center for telecommunications also known as ncc 2 npstc the national public safety telecommunications council is federation of organizations whose mission is to improve public safety communications and interoperability through collaborative leadership after the charter for the ncc expired npstc continued nccs efforts to establish common channel nomenclature npstc channel ids used in the nifog are based on the npstc channel naming report dated 6132007 see httpwwwnpstcorgchannelnamingjsp ntia national telecommunications and information administra tion ntia manual the ntia manual of regulations and procedures for fed eral radio frequency management httpwwwntiadocgovosmhomeredbookredbookhtml how is the nifog usedthe nifog may be used by radio technicians when programming channels in radios we recommend having these channels programmed in radios at all times rather than waiting until disaster is imminent or occurring to do the programming the nifog may also be of use to emergency communications planners 3 dont i need license for these channels before programming them into radiosa license for nonfederal radio users or an authorization for federal users is required only to transmit on an lmr radio frequency license or authorization is required to program the frequencies into radios how can i use these frequencies if i dont have license for themthere are six ways you can legally use these radio frequencies 1 you or your employer may already have federal communications commission fcc license or national telecommunications and information administration ntia authorization for some of these frequencies or may be covered by higher authoritys license 2 the nonfederal national interoperability channels vcall10vtac14 ucall40ucall43d and 8call908tac94d are covered by blanket authorization from the fcc for mobile operation but base stations and control stations still require individual licenses see fcc 00348 released 10102000 paragraph 90 4 3 in extraordinary circumstances the fcc may issue special temporary authority sta for such use in particular area 4 in extraordinary circumstances the ntia may issue temporary assignment for such use in particular area 5 if you are an fcc licensee you may operate mobile station on the federal interoperability channels only when invited or approved to do so by federal government radio station authorized by the ntia to use those channels and only for the purpose of interoperability with federal government radio stations you may not use these channels for interoperability with other state tribal regional or local radio stations these are not substitute for your regular mutual aid channe ls your use of these federal channels is done under the auspices of your fcc license any misuse subjects you or your employer to fcc ines andor possible license revocation 6 when necessary for the immediate protection of life or property radio users may use prudent measures beyond the speciics of their license 5 fcc rules 90407 emergency communications the licensee of any station authorized under this part may during period of emergency in which the normal communication facilities are disrupted as result of hurricane lood earthquake or similar disaster utilize such stati on for emergency communications in manner other than that speciied in the station auth orization or in the rules and regulations governing the operation of such stations the commission may at any time order the discontinuance of such special use of the authorized facilities 49 fr 36376 sept 17 1984 90411 civil defense communications the licensee of any station authorized under this part may on voluntary basis transmit communications necessary for the implementation of civil defense activities assigned such station by local civil defense authorities during an actual or simulated emergency including drills and tests the commission may at any time order the discontinuance of such special use of the authorized facilities 49 fr 36376 sept 17 1984 6 ntia rules 731 emergency communications in an emergency it is permissible to operate temp orarily on regularly assigned frequencies in manner other than that speciied in the terms of an existing assignment or on other appropriate frequencies under the follo wing special circumstances an emergency must actually exist or imminently th reaten an emergency for the purpose of this provision means situation of temp orary duration resulting directly or indirectly from natural catastrophe or other ccurrence that seriously affects the welfare of community or of an area to the extent of endangering human life and property and in connection with which special commu nication facilities are required temporarily emergency operations shall be disconti nued as soon as substantially normal communication facilities are restored 734 emergency use of nongovernment frequencies in emergency situations government radio station may utilize an frequency authorized to nongovernment radio station under part 90 of the fcc rules and regulations when such use is necessary for communications with nongovernment stations and is directly related to the emergency at hand such use is subject to the following conditions 7 the nongovernment licensee has given verbal or written concurrenceb operations are conducted in accordance with the fcc rules and regulationsc use is restricted to the service area and station authorization of the licenseed all operations are under the direct control of the licensee and shall be immediately terminated when directed by the licensee operations do not exceed 60 daysf written report of each such use shall be provided through the agencys fas representative to the fcc as soon as practicable 752 frequencies authorized by the fcc for ship stations frequencies authorized by the federal communications commiss ion for ship stations may be used by government mobile stations to communicate with nongovernment stations in the maritime mobile service 753 frequencies for the safety of life and property the frequency 405 mhz is designated as the military joint common fr equency use of this channel is limited to communications necessary to establish contact when other channel information is not available and for emergency communications this frequency also may be used for search and rescue communications 8 the provisions of this manual do not prevent mobi stations or mobile earth stations in distress from using any frequency at its disposa l to attract attention make known its position and obtain help see itu radio regul ation ap 13 part a1 31 754 frequencies for coordinating search and rescue operations the frequency 1231 mhz using class a3e emission may be used b stations of the aeronautical mobile service and by other mobile and land stations engaged in coordinated search and rescue operations the frequency 1563 mhz may be used for communications between sh ip stations and aircraft stations using g3e emission engaged in coordinated search and rescue sar operations when control of the scene of sar incident is under coast guard coast station 1563 mhz may be used by ship stations to communicate with that coast station does the nifog authorize to use certain frequenciesno the nifog does not grant authority to operate on any radio frequencies such authority can come only from the fcc or the ntia is the nifog the national emergency communications planthe nifog is the national guide for possible use in situation where other radio 9 interoperability arrangement was promulgated by loc authorities or where emergency responders are unaware of such an arrangement the nifog does not supersede any federal state tribal local or regional emergency communications plan if you are dispatched to disaster or incident scene and have other information on how to make contact with other emergency responders the nifog provides useful suggestions for which frequencies to use to make initial contact are these frequencies clear for this use nationwidenot all frequencies are available nationwide for use as described in the nifog in particular the nonfederal vhf inland interoperability channels may only be used in certain inland parts of the country away from coastal areas and major waterways see the map titled interoperability frequencies in vpcs 10 42 in the nonfederal vhf inland mutual aid channels section for further details other channels in this plan may not be usable due to the potential for adjacent channel interference in some areas or due to authorized onchannel uses that are different than the common uses described in the nifog for detailed list of which counties are in which vhf public coast vpc area see httpwwwfccgovoetinfomapsareascnty1990vpccnty1990txt 10 who do i contact to use these channels these channels can be used where licensedauthorized by fccntia or where authorized under an sta as part of any coordinated disaster or incident response there should be frequency manager assigning functions to radio channels and coordinating with the fcc and ntia for authorization to use additional channels if needed at federallydeclared disaster where joint field ofice jfo is established in the operations section esf 2 will have personnel illing the rol of spectrum manager esf 2 works on communications issues affecting the victims and the telecommunications industry the jfo communications unit handles the communications requirements for the emergency responders working through the jfo because there will be signiicant overlap esf 2 and the jfo communications unit will wo rk together very closely check with esf 2 or the jfo communications unit once they are established before then try the calling channels speciied in the nifog at or near the incident scene for all command and control questions 11 does the nifog specify exactly how to program channelssince not all radios are the same its impossible to come up with on esizeitsall solution the nifog relies to large part on the npstc channel naming report dated 6132007 for most of the channels the npstc nomenclature speciies d irect talkaround channel for repeaters which takes up an additional memory slot some radios have switch which permits talkaround on repeater channel using this feature would save memory slots similarly some radios may have switch or button to enable or disable receive ctcss for those radios that dont another channel could be programmed so both modes would be available some of the common mutual aid channels used are wideband in some jurisdictions but narrowband in others the npstc nomenclature does not always address how to label the same frequencies with different bandwidths for the legacy police ems and ire mutual ai d channels 155475 155340 154265 154280 and 154295 we suggest vlaw31w vmed28w vfire22w vfire21w and vfire23w as the wideband channel names corresponding to the npstc narrowband channels vlaw31 vmed28 vfire22 vfire21 and vfire23 on the same frequencies for the sar common channel at 155160 mhz we suggest sar wfm for wideband and sar nfm for narrowband also we recommend programming additional vhf marine channels as possible interoperability channels for use when properly authorized based on local or regional use in particular channels used by drawbridge tenders may be appropriate see 12 httpwirelessfccgovmarinevhfchanlhtml or httpwirelessfccgovmarinevhfchanlpdf for authorized channel uses and httpwwwnavcenuscggovmarcommsvhfhtm for frequencies recommended modes for using federal interoperability channels use analog for all incident response channels ctcss 1679 hz and law enforcement channels 1 b 10 and 16 ctcss 1679 hz use p25 digital for the remaining channels nac 68f ctcss should always be transmitted on the analog channels but carrier squelch csq ctcss should be used on receive consider allowing the user to enable or disable ctcss on receive by switch or button otherwise use csq on receive should fireems radios have the law enforcement interoperability channels programmed and vice versaall radios should have as many of these interoperab ility channels programmed as possible interoperability means crossing over line s not only jurisdictional but functional as well on the federal interoperability channels incident response ir means everybody fire rescue ems public works transp ortation law enforcement etc the law enforcement channels will be used prima rily for law enforcement activities but could be designated for other incident support operations if that would not hamper law enforcement activities and if assigned by the agency in control of the incident 13 how do emergency responders use the calling channelsas you approach the incident scene attempt to make contact on one of the designated calling channels if it is repeater channel and you get response try the direct or talkaround mode if your radio has that capability in some cases the talkaround channel exists as distinct channel on the radio for example the vhf incident response federal interoperability channel is known as nc 1 calling or nc 1call the talkaround for this repeater channel is known as ir 5 try the nonfederal national interoperability calling channels vcall10 ucall40 and 8call90 and the federal ir and calling channels nc 1 calling direct ir 5 nc 2 calling direct ir 15 and b if you are unable to make contact on these channels consider the wideband interoperability channel s if you are authorized to use them or if your situation qualiies as immediate protection of life r property you may be able to learn what you need without transmitting by just listening to radio trafic on one of these channels how do search and rescue personnel on land on watercraft and on aircraft coordinate by radiocertain vhf marine channels are designated in this plan for search and rescue sar interoperability searchers on land in boats and in aircraft need to be able to communicate with each other to coordinate rescues there is vhf channel authorized 14 and readily available to all three communities some aircraft involved in sar have vhf marine radios as do most boaters the vhf radios that many ground sar groups use are capable of covering the vhf marine frequencies we recommend that all sar participants have the channels in this plan preprogrammed in their radios vhf marine channels shall not be used for conventional terrestrial search an d rescue operations they are in this plan due to the likelihood of boats being involved in sar in coastal areas also 15516 mhz is licensed to many sar organizations we encourage public safety entities to obtain licenses for this frequency to facilitate interoperability likewise we encourage sar organizations with vhf radios to program the appropriate vhf marine channels in their radios and to exercise great restraint in using these channels only when authorized how can i get answers to questions about the national interoperability field operations guide or how can i ofer suggestions to improve itplease send your questions or comments to the us department of homeland security ofice of emergency communications at oechqdhsgov and include ur name agency or organization afiliation and your email address 15 recommendations for programming the federal interoperability channels 1 if
