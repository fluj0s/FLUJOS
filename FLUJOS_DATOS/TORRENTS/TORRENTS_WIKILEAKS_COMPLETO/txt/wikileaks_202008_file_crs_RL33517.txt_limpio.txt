item veto act of 2006 background and comparison of versions summary under current law the president may propose to rescind funding provided in an appropriations act by transmitting special message to congress if congress ignores the presidential rescission request or if either house rejects the request the funds must be released after 45 days of continuous session instead of allowing congress to ignore such requests expedited rescission requires at least one house to vote on presidential proposals expedited rescission bills have attracted supporters over the years because the approach is generally regarded as transferring less power from congress to the president than most other ways of altering the rescission framework for three consecutive years in the early 1990s the house passed an expedited rescission bill president george w bush has repeatedly called for granting line item veto authority to the president and an administration draft bill incorporating the expedited rescission approach was sent to congress on march 6 2006 that bill the legislative line item veto act lliva of 2006 was introduced the following day as s 2381 and hr 4890 other expedited rescission measures pending in the 109th congress contain similar provisions including hr 2290 section 311 hr 4699 hr 5667 title i s 2372 and s 3521 title i on june 14 2006 the house budget committee voted 249 to report hr 4890 as amended favorably the next day the rules committee voted 84 to report an amended version in effectively the same form as that approved by the budget committee on june 22 2006 the house approved hr 4890 by vote of 247172 meanwhile on june 14 2006 senator judd gregg the chair of the senate budget committee and others held press conference to unveil the stop over spending act which contained modified version of the lliva in title i as well as other budget process reforms on june 15 2006 the bill was introduced as s 3521 and on june 20 the senate budget committee voted 1210 to report the bill as amended favorably this report provides comparative overview of some major features in three versions of the lliva hr 4890s 2381 as introduced hr 4890 as passed by the house and

provisions in three versions of the legislative line item veto act of 2006 and the line item veto act of 1996 10 legislative line item veto act of 2006 background and comparison of versions background under the framework established by the impoundment control act ica of 1974 pl 93344 88 stat 297 the president may propose to rescind funding provided in an appropriations act by transmitting special message to congress and obtaining the support of both houses within 45 days of continuous session if denied congressional approval during this time period either by congress ignoring the presidential rescission request or because one or both houses rejected the proposed rescission the president has to make the funding available to executive agencies for obligation and expenditure president george w bush had access to the item veto as governor of texas and has called repeatedly for similar authority for the president for example in his state of the union address on january 31 2006 he said we can tackle this problem of too many special interest earmark projects together if you pass the lineitem veto1 an administration draft bill titled the legislative line item veto act of 2006 lliva was transmitted to congress on march 6 2006 instead of allowing congress to ignore presidential recommendations for rescissions expedited rescission requires at least one house to vote on the proposals if either house disapproves the request the other house need take action because approval by both houses is necessary to make the rescission permanent in contrast enhanced rescission briefly available under the line item veto act of 1996 pl 104130 110 stat 1200 altered the rescission framework to create presumption favoring the president2 under enhanced rescission spending reductions identified in special presidential messages remain permanently cancelled unless congress enacts disapproval bill should the president veto that disapproval bill twothirds majority in both chambers would be needed to override the veto 1 constitutions in 43 states provide an item veto to allow the governor to eliminate discrete items in bill before signing the measure into law but constitutional amendment would be necessary to give the president such true line item veto authority various statutory alternatives such as expedited rescission are sometimes referred to as giving the president line item veto this is not entirely accurate but calls attention to some functional similarities 2 the supreme court struck down this previous statutory effort to create itemvetolike authority for the president via enhanced rescission in clinton v city of new york 524 us 417 1998 crs2 expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in congress and typically contain detailed schedule to ensure immediate introduction of measure to approve the presidentss rescission request prompt reporting by committee or automatic discharge special limits on floor amendments and debate and so on under expedited rescission congressional approval is still necessary to rescind the funding but the fasttrack procedures help to encourage an upordown vote on the presidents proposal expedited rescission bills in the 1990s the expedited rescission approach has attracted support over the years because it is generally regarded as transferring less power from congress to the president than most other approaches that would modify the ica framework in 1992 1993 and 1994 the house passed an expedited rescission bill each year3 in the 102nd congress hr 2164 passed by the house in 1992 would have allowed the president to transmit special rescission messages within three days of signing an appropriations act each message could have proposed rescissions from one act proposed rescission could not have reduced program below the budget level of the previous year or by more than 25 for new program the bill included expedited procedures to encourage floor vote within 10 days of introduction with amendments allowed in the 103rd congress hr 1578 as passed by the house in 1993 had limit on the amount that could be rescinded allowing the president to request rescission of 100 of programs funding thereby effectively eliminating it hr 1578 also contained provisions for expedited judicial review in significant departure from previous expedited rescission measures hr 1578 as approved by the house detailed fasttrack procedures for expedited consideration of rescissions substitute as reported by the appropriations committee to provide an alternative to the presidents package in the second session of the 103rd congress hr 4600 came to the floor and passed the house in 1994 with substitute amendment characterized by its supporters as strengthened expedited rescission hr 4600 as approved by the house would have allowed submission of special rescission message at any time but retained the requirement to prepare separate special message and accompanying draft bill for each appropriations subcommittee having jurisdiction over accounts in given appropriations act from which rescissions were requested further hr 4600 would have authorized special messages from the president proposing the repeal of any targeted tax benefit within 20 days following enactment during floor consideration under the expedited procedures motion to strike any proposed 3 for further discussion of efforts to grant the president expanded impoundment authority and of related floor votes see crs issue brief ib89148 item veto and expanded impoundment proposals hereafter cited as crs issue brief ib89148 and crs report rl30223 presidential rescission authority efforts to modify the 1974 framework both by virginia mcmurtry as described therein the senate voted on bills using other approaches such as enhanced rescission crs3 rescission or repeal of targeted tax benefit would have been in order if supported by 50 members in the house or by 15 in the senate overview of provisions in the administrations proposal on march 7 2006 draft expedited rescission bill from the white house titled the legislative line item veto act of 2006 was introduced as hr 4890 and s 2381 in addition to the existing rescission authority accorded the president under the 1974 ica framework the administration bill proposed to amend the ica by inserting new part c legislative line item veto the provisions would authorize the president in special message to congress to propose 1 rescission of any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority in an appropriations act 2 rescission of any item in whole or part of direct spending or 3 repeal of targeted tax benefits the contents of the special message were specified including draft bill to approve the presidents request the lliva would grant the president considerable flexibility in the submission and packaging of the special messages there are time constraints and single message may include any number of rescissions further the lliva does not stipulate that special message be confined to single public law therefore one message may encompass budget authority or items of direct spending from several laws any amounts rescinded must be used for deficit reduction within five days of enactment of rescission approval bill the chairmen of the budget committees would be required to adjust committee allocations accordingly and the office of management and budget would be required to adjust spending caps under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act pl 99177 99 stat 10374 under the bill rescission requests from the president would be considered under fasttrack procedures the presidents proposed bill could be introduced by the house and senate leadership within two days following receipt of the special message after which any member could introduce the presidents proposal the committee to which the bill is referred would have five days to report the bill without substantive revision and with or without recommendation if the reporting deadline were not met the committee would be automatically discharged from consideration of the bill and the bill would be placed on the calendar vote on final passage would have to occur by the 10th day of session following introduction of the approval bill debate would be limited to four hours in the house and 10 hours in the senate amendments to the approval bill would be in order in either chamber additional expedited procedural rules are detailed for consideration of the approval bill the lliva as introduced would allow the president to withhold any budget authority proposed for rescission for up to 180 days following transmittal of the special message likewise the president could suspend the execution of any item of direct spending contained in special message for 180 days the legislation 4 currently spending caps exist for conservation spending for fiscal year 2006 and for highway and mass transit spending through fiscal year 2009 the mechanisms to enforce such caps however expired at the end of fiscal year 2002 crs4 would allow but not require the president to release the funds before the expiration of the 180 days the provisions allowing the president to withhold funds proposed for rescission or to suspend the execution of an item of direct spending for 180 days have not been previously seen in expedited rescission bills supporters of these provisions contend that they would provide for temporary withholding or suspension until congress has chance to consider presidents request and that such mechanism is necessary so that congress would have the opportunity to act on presidents rescission proposal received just before an extended recess or period of adjournment others see these provisions as subject to abuse and unnecessary with the expedited procedures in lliva usually ensuring final vote on the presidents request within month therefore in their view period considerably shorter than 180 days would suffice to give congress the opportunity to act on special message they also point out that there is nothing in the bill that would prohibit the president from initiating multiple 180day withholding periods critics of the 180day withholding mechanism view the provisions as arguably sanctioning the return of policy deferrals originally provided for in the ica subject to onehouse veto but invalidated by the ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 and city of new haven v united states 809 f2d 900 dc cir 1987 decisions as well as the statutory provisions in pl 1001195 supporters of the 180day provision stress that this is the maximum period that the funding could be deferred and the bill language would allow the president to release the funds earlier if the president determines that continuation of the deferral would not further the purposes of this act the language however would not require early release of funds even if one chamber voted to reject the approval bill language in the lliva states that its provisions are severable for purposes of judicial review this means that if court found portion of the measure to be unconstitutional the remainder of its provisions would remain in force the act would become effective upon signing and would apply only to spending or tax provisions contained in bills enacted after its passage other expedited rescission bills in the 109th congress in addition to the administrations proposal the lliva hr 4890 s 2381 several other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th congress an omnibus budget reform measure hr 2290 introduced by representative jeb hensarling and others on may 11 2005 contains provisions for expedited rescission in section 311 enhanced consideration of certain proposed rescissions the provisions would authorize the president to propose rescission of any budget authority in an appropriations act that he identifies as wasteful 5 for further discussion of policy deferrals see crs issue brief ib89148 for further discussion of possible constitutional issues see crs report rl33365 line item veto constitutional analysis of recent proposals by morton rosenberg crs5 along with the proposed rescission the president could also propose to reduce the appropriate discretionary spending limits for new budget authority and outlays under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 by an amount not exceeding the proposed rescission provisions for the special message and accompanying draft approval bill are similar to those in the lliva however hr 2290 would limit the president to just one message for each appropriations act unless the act included accounts falling within the jurisdiction of more than one appropriations subcommittee in which case the president would send separate special message and accompanying draft bill for accounts within the jurisdiction of each subcommittee6 representative mark udall has introduced three expedited rescission measures in the 109th congress7 the most recent of which hr 4699 was introduced on february 1 2006 the stated purpose of the bill the stimulating leadership in cutting expenditures act or slice act of 2006 is to enable the president to require congress to debate and vote on certain presidential proposals for reducing spending the provisions for special messages and expedited procedures in hr 4699 would apply to any budget authority provided in an appropriations act or in pl 10959 119 stat 1144 the omnibus transportation authorization act as seen in previous measures the president could submit more than one special message and approval bill if the appropriations act contained accounts under the jurisdiction of more than one appropriations subcommittee for messages proposing rescission of funds provided in the transportation act the draft bill would be broken down into sections corresponding to specific projects senator john kerry introduced s 2372 the expedited budget item veto review act of 2006 on march 6 2006 this bill is similar in coverage to the line item veto act of 1996 s 2372 would allow the president to suspend and propose for cancellation 1 any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority 2 any item of new direct spending and 3 any limited tax benefit not later than three calendar days after the date of enactment of the applicable law the president could submit special message proposing such cancellations and draft bill for each item to be cancelled provisions for identifying limited tax benefits also reflect those in the 1996 law expedited procedures would seek to ensure vote on final passage of an approval bill by the close of the 10th legislative day following its introduction items proposed for cancellation in special message would be made available for obligation or take effect on the date upon which the draft bill accompanying the special message were to be defeated in either the house or the senate 6 floor amendment containing similar provisions for expedited rescission was considered by the house in the 108th congress and rejected by vote of 174237 see crs issue brief ib89148 7 the other expedited rescission bills introduced by mr udall are less comprehensive than hr 4699 the first measure hr 982 the expedited rescissions act of 2005 introduced on feb 17 2005 provides for rescission of budget authority only in appropriations acts hr 3966 also titled the slice act and introduced on sept 29 2005 provides for rescission of budget authority both in appropriations acts enacted before jan 1 2006 and in pl 10959 119 stat 1144 in order to offset spending for natural disasters occurring during 2005 crs6 representative john spratt ranking minority member on the house budget committee introduced hr 5667 on june 21 2006 title i of this omnibus reform bill provides for legislative line item veto with features similar to the expedited rescission bills receiving floor consideration in the house in the 1990s hr 5667 would allow the president to propose cancellation of discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions but direct mandatory spending would not be covered there would be one special message allowed per bill and expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the presidents proposals like earlier bills hr 5667 would allow 100 members in the house and 16 members in the senate to seek separate vote on spending item or tax provision in the cancellation package but other amendments would be in order comparison of expedited rescission bills on june 14 2006 the house budget committee held markup of hr 4890 the administrations expedited rescission proposal as introduced in the house and voted 249 to report the bill favorably as amended8 the next day the rules committee held markup and voted 84 to report an amended version in effectively the same form as that approved by the budget committee9 on june 22 the house approved hr 4890 as amended by vote of 24717210 meanwhile on june 14 2006 senator judd gregg the chair of the senate budget committee and others held press conference to unveil the stop over spending act which contains modified version of the legislative line item veto act in title i as well as other budget process reforms on june 15 2006 senator gregg and others introduced the bill as s 3521 on june 20 the senate budget committee marked up s 3521 and voted 1210 to report the bill as amended favorably table 1 at the end of this report provides comparative overview of some major features in three expedited rescission bills 1 hr 4890s 2381 as introduced 2 hr 4890 as passed by the house house approved and 3 title i of s 3521 as amended and ordered to be reported by the senate budget committee senate reported the table also includes relevant provisions in the line item veto act of 1996 pl 104130 which was overturned by the supreme court in 1998 as indicated in the table there are some noteworthy differences among the versions some features in hr 4890s 2381 as

line item veto act of 2006 debate and vote in the house congressional record daily edition vol152 june 22 2006 pp h443341 h446793 crs7 the houseapproved and senate budget committee bills to lessen the presidents flexibility for example the original bills had deadline for submission of special rescission messages and limit on the number of special messages the house passed version of hr 4890 would require submission of special messages within 45 calendar days of enactment of the law that contained the amountsprovisions proposed for cancellation s 3521 as ordered to be reported would allow the submission of special message up to one year following enactment further the senate budget committee version would limit the president to four special messages per calendar year whereas the housepassed version would set limit of five special messages per act or 10 for omnibus measures with respect to these features the housepassed version would be more permissive in terms of the total number of special messages whereas the senate bill would be more lenient in the timing of their submissions the period for withholding of funds after submission of special message is another feature on which the bills differ as introduced the lliva would allow the president to withhold funds for up to 180 calendar days despite any congressional action s 3521 would limit withholding to 45 calendar days as would the house passed version however the housepassed version would allow the president 45 day extension for total withholding period of up to 90 days in addition the lliva as introduced included sunset termination date whereas the house passed version provides that the expedited rescission authority would expire after six years october 1 2012 and s 3521 as ordered to be reported stipulates termination after four years december 31 2010 some changes in hr 4890 as passed by the house and in s 3521 as ordered to be reported may generate new concerns both versions appear to narrow the range of possible targeted tax benefits that may be proposed for cancellation when compared to the administrations proposal hr 4890s 2381 as introduced along with provisions in pl 104130 would have covered revenuelosing measures affecting 100 or fewer beneficiaries the housepassed version of hr 4890 would apply only to revenuelosing provision affecting single beneficiary11 whereas s 3521 as ordered to be reported defines targeted tax benefits as affecting particular or limited group of taxpayers thereby placing its scope somewhere between the administrations proposal and the housepassed version also the senate budget committee version and the 1996 act would require the joint committee on taxation to identify the targeted tax benefits the housepassed version would require the chairmen of the ways and means and finance committees to identify such provisions the president could only propose rescission of such identified tax benefits hr 4890s 2381 as introduced would allow the president to propose any targeted tax benefit that he identified another change in the housepassed version of interest is its relationship to the impoundment control act of 1974 known as ica title x of pl 93344 the version approved by the house would repeal the ica except for section 1013 deferral authority for the president and section 1016 suits by the comptroller 11 although the bill uses the term single beneficiary it defines the term in such way that it could be broader than single taxpayer crs8 general hr 4890s 2381 as introduced and s 3521 as ordered to be reported would amend title x of the ica by striking part c line item veto act of 1996 and inserting the text of the bill at issue is whether the framework for expedited rescissions in the current bills would augment or replace rescission authority accorded the president under the ica to propose rescissions at any time but with the release of funds after 45 legislative days absent congressional approval there were further substantive changes to hr 4890 as amended during floor consideration managers amendment offered by representative paul ryan was adopted as part of the special rule for consideration however in response to apparent concerns raised by the house transportation and infrastructure committee the amendment added clarifying language that any amount cancelled that came from trust fund or special fund would be returned to the fund from which it originally derived rather than revert to the general fund for deficit reduction12 with this exception all of the changes in hr 4890 as approved by the house occurred during committee markups with respect to s 3521 as ordered to be reported managers amendment offered by senator gregg at markup and approved by voice vote made changes in title i regarding the legislative line item veto among other things13 in its current form the bill would prohibit the president from resubmitting items of direct spending or targeted tax benefits previously rejected by congress but would allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if congress fails to complete action on them due to adjournment the amendment also proposes to reduce the period during which the president may suspend new direct spending or targeted tax benefits if the cancellation proposal is submitted after the effective date of the provisions otherwise features included in table 1 under s 3521 as ordered to be reported were unchanged from those in the bill as introduced some concluding thoughts the provisions for expedited consideration of special messages from the president proposing rescissions of funds have remained quite similar over the years various versions of expedited rescission bills pending in the 109th congress all seek to ensure vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days after its introduction in the chamber in the early 1990s there were bills with provisions to allow for consideration of substitute package of rescissions reported by the appropriations committee as an alternative to the presidents package or to allow motion to strike particular rescission from the approval bill with sufficient 12 us congress house committee on rules

provisions expedited rescission bills have differed in scope of coverage over the years some earlier bills confined the special messages to proposed rescissions of discretionary budget authority appropriations subsequently items of direct spending entitlements and limited or targeted tax benefits were added in the 109th congress hr 4699 would add certain transportation projects to the universe of possible cancellations available to the president the lliva in all three versions considered here would grant the president among the most expansive scopes of coverage seen in an expedited rescission bill by encompassing rescission of any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority or of any new item of direct spending the line item veto act of 1996 with its enhanced rescission framework was considered even by some of its supporters to have possible constitutional flaws and the measure contained provisions for expedited judicial review in contrast observers tend to view the expedited rescission approach at least as applied to items of discretionary spending as passing muster on constitutional grounds the severability provision in the lliva creates further statutory insulation if one provision were to be found unconstitutional the remainder of the act would not be affected for example if one type of cancellation such as targeted tax benefits were to be overturned the presidents authority to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration covering items of discretionary budget authority or direct spending might continue to be available in considering prospects for further action on expedited rescission bills one might wish to keep in mind the continuing involvement of the bush administration in seeking enactment of some version of the lliva in the 109th congress on june 27 2006 after meeting with group of senators at the white house to discuss line item veto legislation the president called upon the senate to join the house and quickly pass the line item veto so he could sign it into law according to white house press release the president wants the item veto to target pork in large spending bills it is an essential part of the presidents strategy to reform the budget process and enhance fiscal discipline 14 14 white house office of the press secretary fact sheet the legislative lineitem veto constitutional effective and
