profiles now for the period 19791999 raobcore versions show much more upper tropospheric heating for this period rich shows slightly more heating note also stronger cooling of unadjusted radiosondes in stratospheric layers compared to 19992004 just for information i have included also zonal mean trend plots for the unadjusted radiosondes tm raobcore v14 tmcorr and rich rgmra i do not suggest that these plots should be included but some of you maybe want to know about the spatial coherence of the zonal mean trends it is interesting to see the lower tropospheric warming minimum in the tropics in all three plots which i cannot explain i believe it is spurious but it is remarkably robust against my adjustment efforts meridional resolution is 10 degrees as you can imagine the tropical upper tropospheric heating maximum at 5s and the cooling in the unadjusted radiosondes at 5n are based on very few long records in these belts 23 in 5s about 5 in 5n best regards and i wish you all happy new year leo ben santer wrote dear leo the figure that you sent is extremely informative and would be great to include in response to douglass et the figure clearly illustrates that the structural uncertainties inherent in radiosondebased estimates of tropospheric temperature change are much larger than douglass et have claimed this is an important point to make would it be possible to produce version of this figure showing results for the period 1979 to 1999 the period that ive used for testing the significance of modelversusobserved trend differences instead of 1979 to 2004 with best regards and frohes neues jahr ben leopold haimberger wrote dear all i have attached plot which summarizes the recent developments concerning tropical radiosonde temperature datasets and which could be candidate to be included in reply to douglass et it contains trend profiles from unadjusted radiosondes hadat2adjusted radiosondes raobcore versions 1214 adjusted radiosondes and from radiosondes adjusted with neighbor composite method rich that uses the break dates detected with raobcore v14 as metadata raobcore v12v13 are documented in haimberger 2007 raobcore v14 and rich are discussed in the manuscript i mentioned in my previous email latitude range is 20s20n only time series with less than 24 months of missing data are included spatial sampling of all curves is the same except hadat which contains less stations that meet the 24month criterion sampling uncertainty of the trend curves is ca 01kdecade 95 percentiles estimated with bootstrap method raobcore v1314 and rich are results from ongoing research and warming trends from radiosondes may still be underestimated the upper tropospheric warming maxima from rich are even larger up to 035kdecade not shown if only radiosondes within the tropics 20n20s are allowed as reference for adjustment of tropical radiosonde temperatures the pinkblue curves in the attached plot should therefore not be regarded as upper bound of what may be achieved with plausible choices of reference series for homogenization please let know your comments i wish you merry christmas with best regards leo john lanzante wrote ben perhaps resampling test would be appropriate the tests you have performed consist of pairing an observed time series uah or rss msu with each one of 49 gcm times series from your ensemble of opportunity significance of the difference between each pair of obsgcm trends yields certain number of hits to determine baseline for judging how likely it would be to obtain the given number of hits one could perform set of resampling trials by treating one of the ensemble members as surrogate observation for each trial select at random one of the 49 gcm members to be the observation from the remaining 48 members draw bootstrap sample of 49 and perform 49 tests yielding certain number of hits repeat this many times to generate distribution of hits the actual number of hits based on the real observations could then be referenced to the monte carlo distribution to yield probability that this could have occurred by chance the basic idea is to see if the observed trend is inconsistent with the gcm ensemble of trends there are couple of additional tweaks that could be applied to your method you are currently computing trends for each of the two time series in the pair and assessing the significance of their differences why not first create difference time series and assess the significance of its trend the advantage of this is that you would reduce somewhat the autocorrelation in the time series and hence the effect of the degrees of freedom adjustment since the gcm runs are based on coupled model runs this differencing would help remove the common externally forced variability but not internally forced variability so the adjustment would still be needed another tweak would be to alter the significance level used to assess differences in trends currently you are using the 5 level which yields only small number of hits if you made this less stringent you would get potentially more weaker hits but it would all come out in the wash so to speak since the number of hits in the monte carlo simulations would increase as well i suspect that increasing the number of expected hits would make the whole procedure more powerfulefficient in statistical sense since you would longer be dealing with rare event in the current scheme using 5 level with 49 pairings you have an expected hit rate of 005 x 49 245 for example if instead you used 20 significance level you would have an expected hit rate of 020 x 49 98 i hope this helps on an unrelated matter im wondering bit about the different versions of leos new radiosonde dataset raobcore i was surprised to see that the latest version has considerably more tropospheric warming than i recalled from an earlier version that was written up in jcli in 2007 i have couple of questions that id like to ask leo one concern is that if we use the latest version of raobcore is there paper that we can reference if this is not in peerreviewed journal is there paper in submission the other question is could you briefly comment on the differences in methodology used to generate the latest version of raobcore as compared to the version used in jcli 2007 and whatwhenwhere did changes occur to yield stronger warming trend best regards ______john

196 tests at the 05 sig level you found 3 with appropriately corrected leopold i suspect you will find there is indeed stat sig similar trends incl amplification setting up the statistical testing should be interesting with this many combinations regards tom ao univ prof dr leopold haimberger institut für meteorologie und geophysik universität wien althanstraße 14 1090 wien tel 43 1 4277 53712
