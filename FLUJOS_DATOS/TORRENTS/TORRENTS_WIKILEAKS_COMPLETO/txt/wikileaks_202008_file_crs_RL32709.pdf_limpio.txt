political reasons amtraks supporters reject this notion and assert that the federal government should invest in this mode of travel because divers ification is central element of any wise investment policy political stalemate over amtrak has continued for over 30 years partly because of discrepancy that exists between the economic geography that supports compe titive passenger rail service and the political geography necessary to support its high cost structure population growth affluence and hous ing policies as well as government highway and aviation system development po licies tended to fa vor highway and air travel over passenger rail despite thes trends which have been detriment to passenger rail there are also social needs arguments including the need to serve people who do not own cars have fear of flying or believe they cannot afford airfare and decline to use bus service some also argue that communities view rail service as part of their history and sense of themselves the defense of amtrak as linchpin of the local social fabric and practical politics has at some times and some places been surprisingly effective in forest alling service reductions or garnering state subsidies to continue service both advocates and opponents of fede ralaid for amtrak have suggested variety of options for passenger rail in the united states the options range from accepting the status quo changing amtraks organizational struct ure privatization to liquidating amtrak entirely funding options include maintaining the current system using highway and aviation trust fund revenues or creating separate rail trust fund shifting the subsidy burden to the states bonding imposing taxes on amtraks competitors and relying on privat sector funding only after political consensus is reached among policymakers however on what kind of passenger rail service if any is needed can choice be made as to which organizational or financing options are best suited to reaching the chosen

passenger rail in the united states raises arguments of energy efficien cy clean air mobility especi ally for the poor traffic and air congestion mitigation jobs the place of trains in society and culture as well as politics1 inherent in these arguments are fu rther stakeholder issues of whom if anyone will be served by intercity rail and who will bear the burdens of its expansion reorganization or demise hist orically supporters of intercity rail have argued that amtrak matters because it has or has the potential to relieve airport and highway congestion in congested corridors provide more energy efficient and less environmentally damaging tr ansportation mode than shor t haul air or automobiles and more recently that it provides transportation alternative in the case of terrorist attack2 all of these rationales have been challenged critics point to amtraks minuscule market share less than 1 of all intercity passenger trips and its limited capacity to cast doubt on the congestion relie f and security alternative arguments they also argue that for trips of 75 miles or more automobiles usually have second passenger auto and ra ils intercity trip energy efficiency

arguments are im portant the case can be made that it is the political and social aspects of th debate that will likely determine amtraks ultimate outcome this report examines the political and social aspects of the debate on federal aid to intercity passenger service primarily amtr ak it begins with discussion of the political aspects of the debate examining amtrak issues before the congress the executive branch and at the state level the report then discusses the differing views and needs of freight rail relative to the passenger service that often rides on track owned by the freight railroads the social changes and influences on the decline in rail passenger ridership as well as social arguments for amtraks continuation are examined next finally number of polic options are discussed the report does not enter into discussion of economic externalities such as the possible indirect environmental or energy sa vings benefits of interc ity rail passenger service4 political aspects of the amtrak debate amtrak and congress some amtrak critics argue there is economic justification for sustaining nationwide intercity passenger rail service in the united states and believe therefore that amtrak survives primarily for political reasons the notion of national intercity rail network in country the size of the united states according to them does not make economic sense it perpetua tes an umbrella over the past when the notion of transcontinental railroad only ma sense because there were airways5 in the modern era they contend rail tec hnology is best suited to solving regional transportation problems or hau ling freight long distances those who view the amtrak debate as mo stly about politics ge nerally cite three political forces as sustaining amtraks nationwide network one political force is distributive politics6 this view holds that amtrak is primarily mechanism that serves legislators district specific interests it pr ovides legislators the opportunity to claim credit for providing amtrak service in their district or state second political force cited is the protection of an entrenched interest group this view holds that because amtraks benefits accrue to small group namely amtrak employees and suppliers with each individual in the group having much at stake personally their livelihood there is more natural cohesion among them and they have greater incentive to mobilize and have their voices heard in washington according to thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs3 7 robert j dilger american transportation policy westport ct praeger 2003 p 155 8 for different view see anthony downs still stuck in traffic coping with peakhour traffic congestion washington brookings institution 2004 455 pview while the general population bears the cost of amtrak it s far less at stake individually and its political influence is therefore much more diluted thus critics see political bias in favor of amtrak st emming from the fact that amtraks benefits are visible and highly concentrated while its costs are somewhat invisible and widely dispersed third political force cited as sustaining amtrak is the path of least political resistance while the public at large is not an intense amtrak supporter they do generally have favorable view of passenger trains being blamed for shutting down amtrak could i nvite bad publicity because pa ssenger trains are viewed with certain amount of nostalgia nd respectability by the general public those who view the amtrak debate as mostly about politics often blame congress for amtraks woes they contend that amtrak is system built to be politically rather than economica lly sustainable they asse rt that routes were chosen in order to cement political support in cong ress not drawn on the basis of where rail can be most competitive amtraks service decisions are vulnerable to political pressure they say because amtrak depends on congress for f unding especially since funding is from the discretionary portion of the budget they argue that congress hinders intercity passenger rails market potential by not allowing amtrak to fully pursue business model based on economies of density that is focusing all of its resources on select number of high nsity corridors while abandoning low density ones if congress devolved power to the states they argue members would not be able to claim credit for maintaining amtrak service in their district or state7 on the other side of the debate amtr aks supporters reject the notion that amtrak only matters for political reasons it makes sense for the federal government to invest in this mode of travel they argue because diversification is central element of any wise investment policy amtrak offers less oil dependent mode of travel particularly in the northeast corridor nec where the line is electrified amtrak could further reduce its dependence on oil if lines outside the nec were also electrified it is also more reliable form of transportation than air or automobile in poor weather particularly during the winter rail supporters main tain that after all americas loveaffair with the car has limits8 it does not extend to traffic jams traffic accidents air polluti on or highways in ones backyard for instance they also argue that the additional time that passengers need to be at airports before departure to allow for security processing has reduced the time competitiveness of shorterhaul flights compared to rail to them passenger rail should not be viewed as business and judged merely on the basi s of profit and loss but rather should be viewed as an alternative mode of trans portation and judged on the basis of providing valuable public service mismatch between political and economic geography while amtraks severest critics might prefer that the railroad fade away and its most assertive supporters want to see massive increases in funding there are many whose views fall somewhere in between these two poles they support passenger rail subsidies but only if it can be shown to be costeffective use of federal dollars railhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs4 transportation can be costeffective but only in specific circumstances passenger rails market niche is typically defined by trips between large cities densely populated and with well devel oped transit systems and in the range of 100 to 400 miles apart generally in trips of this distance trains can be time competitive with air travel this is especially true if the tr avel time to the train station is less than that to the airport and because the linehaul di stance between the cities is not sufficiently far enough to allow air even with its speed advantage to makeup the time difference of course in order to be competitive trains must also run as frequently as airplanes and to be costeffective trains must not only run frequently but run near full there has to be enough of population base in corridor to fill trains running repetitively the nec and handful of other city pairs in the midwest and along the west coast have been identified by transportation experts as compelling markets for intercity rail in these mark ets railway technology deserves careful consideration as means of expanding transportation capacity these experts suggest because it might be cheaper in some cases than expanding the highway or airway networks transportation analysts generally cont end that freight railroads have an economic incentive to consolidate thei r operations around limited network because of the relatively high cost of their fixed infrastructure the major freight railroads have pursued high density strategy fo cusing all of their resources around select number of high volume corridors while ab andoning low density ones the major freight railroads are mainta ining less miles of track runni ng more trains on their remaining track and carrying more cargo per train by utilizing larger cars and longer trains by doing so they have become ar guably the most financially selfsufficient railroad system in the world proponents of amtrak reform argue that if amtrak pursued similar business model limiting its service to only those routes worth serving it could become more costeffective that is to say if its service criterion was strictly marketdriven mtrak could carry more peopl per dollar of subsidy and perhaps eliminate its reliance on at least operating subsidies in the long term while railroads have an economic incentive to concentrate their operations around limited network observers note that legislative bodies generally have broader perspective when allocatin g transportation resources for instance members of congress may weig h equity and income distribution issues equally or more important than economic efficiency concerns this contrast between market versus political forces according to some observers is fundamental flaw in amtraks original design they contend it cannot operate as business or at least achieve operational selfsufficiency while at the same time providing social service by running trains with thin ridership leve ls over long distances to ensure enough legislative support for its capital needs mtrak must extend service to areas where rail lacks competitive advantage in other words discrepancy exists between the economic geography that supports intercity passenger rail and the political geography necessary to support its funding amtrak and the executive branch what amtrak may need most from th executive branch is political capital however administration since amtraks creation has been willing to expend much of its political capital on amtrak whether in favor or against ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs5 9 john ullmann rail passenger woes policy as policy journal

2002administrations seem to have adopted the view that amtrak is just not worth serious political battle some have argued that for rail to achieve significant role in the nations transportation system it is less important which policy direction is taken and more important that direction be chosen with the political will and financial commitment necessary to sustain the effort over the longterm some say that without strong leadership from the executive branch amtrak will likely continue to limp along the executive branch traditionally has been the body that would lead such an effort for passenger rail to become si gnificant player the issue probably would need to become one of priority for an administration perhaps approaching the eisenhower administrations championing of the interstate highway system for example like the highway program the effort probably would also have to outlive successive political cycles however as of yet administration seems to be willing to break the political impasse over amtrak in the words of one observer what has filled the vacuum instead is essentially policy as policy9 the long timeframe required to carry out ma jor rail program may be one political impediment understandably an administration may be reluctant to bear the costs of project whose benefits largely w ould accrue under successi ve administrations one observer sums up the executive branchs view of amtrak as follows since its inception the company amtrak has endured frequent hostility from the executive branch of the federal government along with recurring financial crises10 the nixon ford reagan and first bush ad ministrations would have preferred that amtrak fade away or at least end its drain on federal resources the carter administration sought drastic cuts in service while the clinton administration supported amtrak but did not see it as very high priority amtrak was created during the nixon administration whic h was divided over its creation the office of management and budget omb opposed its creation believing that it would never turn profit the departme nt of transportation dot however had more positive view believing that at least on the highvolume routes amtrak would become selfsufficient in few years11 in the end president nixon reluctantly supported amtraks creation but the motive was more to improve the financial condition of the freight railroads than to preserve passenger rail service in 1979 the carter administration in respons to increasing annual amtrak deficits exceeding 500 million proposed reducing mtraks route network from about 27000 miles to about 15700 miles it reco mmended eliminating 16 longdistance routes which would have reduced or eliminated amtrak service in 40 states however many members of congress opposed the carter plan citing lost airline service due to airline deregulation and the energy crises as reasons not to curtailhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs6 12 see statement of the hon norman

administration proposed eliminating amtraks operating subsidies and sellin g amtrak to the highest bidder the first bush administrati on 19891993 followed similar agenda with respect to amtrak in the 1990s unde r the clinton administration amtraks survival was longer in doubt but the clinton administration did support the amtrak reform and accountability act of 1997 pl 105134 this act eliminated some statutory restrictions which had prevented amtrak from pursuing some cost cutting initiatives but it also required amtrak to become operationally selfsufficient by december 2002 the current bush admin istrations policy obj ectives concerning amtrak are to eliminate federal operating subsidies to establish separate ownership for train operations and track maintenance on the nec to introduce competition on some routes and for state governments to finance some of amtraks capital expenses12 amtrak and state governments those who view intercity passenger ra il as best suited to solving regional transportation problems generally favor ving state and local governments take greater responsibility for funding amtrak or some other inte rcity passenger rail provider it raises the issue however of the political and ec onomic climate at the state level state financial support for amtrak s been far less than federal support compared with about 1 billion per year in federal financing in fiscal year 2002 for example states only provide d about 168 million in funding13 recent gao survey of officials at 17 state departments of tr ansportation found that they were willing to provide funds for intercity passenger rail but only if federal funding were also provided14 in this survey state officials also expressed concern about how they could fairly allocate costs among themselves for capital improvements on an interstate rail line some state officials noted that if benefits and costs were difficult to properly assign some states might perceive that they were subsidizing rail service improvements in another state15 at the federal level amtrak has been embroiled in an ideological struggle between those who believe th railroad should operate as business and those who believe it should operate as public agency because neith er side has been able to muster an overwhelming majority amtrak just manages to survive rather than potentially gain more market share amtrak has

ompressed20030225000htm 17 for further information on the freight railr oads viewpoint see ssociation of american railroads httpwwwaarorgdilemma by juggling two types of service corridor and longdistance amtraks dual service strategy raises the question if amtrak were devolved to the states would the railroad be caught in the same kind of political conflict at the state level one could imagine situation similar to the present situation at the federal level some state legislators or the governor exp ecting the railroad to select routes based on market criteria ie service only to major metropolitan areas and other state legislators or governors exp ecting it to select routes based on public service criteria ie including stops through many small to wns moreover even if there were consensus with regard to rail policy within state there is the likely possibility that in the case of interstate routes neighborin g states would lack such consensus or their consensus would lean the other way thus if state budgets were the primary funding source rail carrier could be pressured to juggle different service requirements as its interstate trains crossed state lines amtrak and the freight railroads any discussion about the politics of mtrak must necessarily include discussion of the freight railroads point of view this is because in much of the country amtrak and the freight railroads share the same track about 97 of amtraks route miles use track that is owned and maintained by the freight railroads moreover just as freight rail infrastruct ure underlies much of amtraks operations one could argue that freight rail economic s underlies much of amtrak policymaking for example it was the weak financial c ondition of the freight railroads and hence their desire to rid themselves of unprofita ble passenger service that was the impetus for creating amtrak in the first place history may repeat itself according to some industry experts including amtraks current president and ceo16 they assert that the current state of freight rail economics may once again provide the catalyst for major shift in rail policy direction one reason why freight rather than passenger rail ma be more likely to sway congress toward change in directi on is that freight railroads carry roughly 40 of the nations commerce while amtr ak carries less than 1 of intercity passengers renegotiating the owner nd tenant re lationship significantly the freight railroads are opposed to transfe rring the terms and conditions under which amtrak now operates on their track to any other passenger rail entity if amtrak were to be restructured more specifically they would oppose transferring amtraks right of access to freight railroad track the rates amtrak pays to the freight railroads for track access and amtraks operating priority over freight trains the freight railroads also believe they are currently subsidizing amtrak service because amtrak in their view does not pay them the full cost they incur in hosting amtrak trains17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs8 18 transportation research board freight capacity for the 21st century special report 271 national

reinventing amtrak the politics of survival journal of policy nalysis and management v 16 4 1997rail rightofways are more crowded today than they were when amtrak was created because of increases in track u tilization rates the original arrangement between the freight railroads and amtrak is far less attractive to the freight railroads today than it was in 1970 at that time th freight railroads had excess capacity but today there are signs that the freight rail system is in places nearing maximum capacity track utilization rates are rising because the freight railroads are carrying more freight on fewer miles of track from 1970 to 1999 the number of tonmiles of freight carried by cla ss i railroads increased by 87 percent while the number of miles of rail roadway operated by class i railroads declined by 43 percent18 another measure of traffic density is revenue tonmiles per owned mile of roadway which calculates the amount of paying cargo that the railroads carry over their rightof ways this measure of traffic density increased from 389 million in 1970 to 1442 million in 199919 freight rail congestion can spill over to cause delays for amtrak trains for instance in june 2004 69 of all amtrak train delays were caused by freight operations20 on an annual basis about 62 to 65 of amtraks to tal hours of delay are caused by host railroads21 dot inspector general report notes that while amtrak offers economic incentives to the freight railroads for aiding its ontime performance the freight railroads find the costs incurred to themselves for altering their train schedules exceed the amount of amtraks incentive payments22 the inspector general report also finds that d espite the freight railroads investments certain parts of the railroad system ve become severely congested and cannot accommodate the conflicting demands of both increasing freight movement and increasing commuter and intercity passenger rail traffic23 amtrak on freight track amtraks reliance on the freight railroad network for much of its infrastructure helps to explain its relative isolation from the institutional arrangements that have been established for funding other transportation modes24 in modern times the federal government has had relatively handsoff policy with respect to financing freight ra il infrastructure there is trust fund nor cost share arrangement between the federa l and state governments for financing rail infrastructure as there is for highways airways and waterways for example the rationale for limited government funding of freight rail in

at substantially less cost than if it were furnished by the government amtrak pays the freight railroads about 100 milli on annually for the use of their track which is about as much as it spends on advertising and marketing on the other hand the freight railroads design build and maintain their track to meet their needs which is heavy rollingstock at slower speeds amtraks needs are ontime performance competitive passenger trains require the highest quality track to increase train speed and to maintain precise sche dules in contrast the freig ht railroads since abandoning passenger service have economized on track maintenance costs by single tracking and lowering track speed standards25 time to change course some observers believe that reminiscent of the policy shift that occurred in 1970 economic ci rcumstances in the freight rail industry could once again provoke policy respons by congress and maybe force resolution of the amtrak debate as well many rail analysts are concerned whether the freight railroads are earning enough re venues to adequately invest in their infrastructure to meet antic ipated cargo demand amtraks president contends that amtrak is analogous to canary in coal mine with respect to the freight railroad industry26 he contends that the thin profit margins the freight railroads continue to earn will eventually put them in the same place amtrak is today the surface transportation board the federal agency that regulates railroads has repeatedly found that the freight railroads are reve nue inadequate alt hough the criterion used to measure revenue adequacy is set by st atute and is controversial since 1980 rail tonnage has increased by 64 and the dot ig reports that tonnage is expected to increase by well over 50 between now and 202027 some railway analysts warn that the freight railroads could be overwhelmed by the traffic growth and point to recent problems in meeting peak season capacity requirements as early warning signs of pending capacity crunch some policymakers believe the current economic situation with the freight railroads demands more activist federal rail policy they contend that the focus of federal rail policy should be more than ju st amtrak they nvision national rail plan that integrates both freight and passeng er rail infrastructure needs as policy solution these lawmakers propose creatin g rail trust fund to accelerate public investment in rail infrastructure they suggest that just as highways are shared between private forprofit trucking companies and the general traveling public with each paying user fees to finance highway maintenance and constr uction so too couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs10 user fee scheme be created for rail infrastru cture shared by the freight railroads and the general public traveling on passenger trains according to this view the efficiencies that railway technology can produce are not being fully realized because the nation is relying on the limited resources of the private sector to supply most rail capacity hence in this view the rail network is operating at less than optimal efficiency due to an infrastructure deficit if the private sector is unable to keep pace with strong demand they belie ve the government should f ill the capital shortfall bringing the supply of rail capacity in balance with demand thus some rail supporters argue that establishing dedicated public funding mechanism for expanding rail capacity is justified on the grounds of both passenger and freight mobility concerns however while some lawmakers incorporate the freight railroads infrastructure needs into arguments for more federal investment in rail infrastructure the freight railroads do not subscribe to their policy prescription as practical matter the freight railroads question whether freight nd highspeed passenger trains are actually compatible on the same rightsofway but their concerns run deeper than this significant difference between railways on the one hand and highways and airways on the other is that rail carriers do not share their rightofway with competitors this is the railroads concern with the analog ous treatment of railways as highways or airways they fear that the price of federal aid program for improving rail infrastructure will be open access to their rightsofway social aspects of the debate ninety years ago railroads were symbol s of the power speed and efficiency of the industrial era they were also the ties that bound rural america to the nation as whole for intercity travel railroads were more than the centerpiece of multimodal transportation system they were the only choice for relatively speedy and reliable passenger transpor tation in broader sense rail service was seminal in the pattern of development of the nations cities and towns in rural areas route choices made by railroads to serve or bypass towns were seen as determining factors for which communities would prosper and which would not in rails heyday rail stations often fulfilled soci role beyond their transpor tation uses serving as civic landmarks and community gathering places given this history some cities and towns associate rail service with their sense of identity as community and often react to loss of passenger rail service matter how limited as they would to the loss of dominant employer or plant shutdown the decline of passenger rail ridership is not recent and is traced back by most observers to the early 1920s probably reflecting the increasing popularity of the automobile and concomitant increase

passenger rail it was often much cheaper for family to travel together in their automobile to another city destination than to buy train tickets for everyone in addition the automobile provided mobility at the destination that train destin ations with good transit c onnections could not match in terms of convenience the building of th interstate highway system which began in earnest in 1956 supported by dedicated fuel tax and other highway use taxes was mostly completed by the early 1980s and solidified the automobile as the centerpiece of american mobility the completion of the in terstate network increased the attractiveness of the automob ile for intercity trips and reinforced the automobile culture it also made automobile travel even more attractive relative to rail travel for intercity trips32 postwar affluence had another major in fluence on passenger rails dwindling market share in that it made air travel affo rdable to an increasing segment of the us population this

despite these socioeconomic trends that over time have been advantageous to highway and air transportation to the detriment of intercity rail arguments based on social needs are made to support

communities particularly in rural areas rail passenger service is an integral part of the communitys social fabric and sense of self according to this view the loss of amtrak service would tear the

for maintaining or expanding amtraks service is that there are peopl who cannot or will not use automobiles or aircraft for intercity travel including thos who have fear of flying do not own car or cannot afford air fare and prefer not to use intercity bus service proponents of maintaining amtraks long distance service contend that an estimated 25 million people in the united states suffer from fear of flying and some of them depend on train service for long distance travel38 there is dearth of reliable information on what the impact of fear of flying has on intercity transportation choice

less densely populated cities that are common in much of the united states rather than national characteristic finally amtrak is seen by some as being an important intercity travel alternative for the

to rural destinations would actually be bereft of public intercity transportation service recent study of scheduled intercity transportation service in rural areas of the united states indicates that of just less than 35 million rural residents in the area served by intercity rail only 304000 were exclusively served by rail42 most of these residents have access to personal vehicle if amtrak service were eliminated in the nec the substitution of intercity bus and air service to former amtrak users could take enough time to cause so disruption of service to travelers43 for cities in other

the 1950s as the number of personal ve hicles grew rapidly and the building of the interstate highway system made intercity driving more attractive to the growing numbers of drivers the bus regulatory reform act of 1982 reduced the regulation of motor carriers and gave bus companies more freedom to di scontinue unprofitable service locations served by schedul ed intercity bus companies dropped from 11820 locations to fewer than 6000 in 199146 and to roughly 4000 today of the nearly 75 million rural residents served by bus nearly 15 million are exclusively served by bus continuing bus service is not certa inty greyhound lines recently eliminated service to 260 rural locations in 13 states47 the issue remains however especially for service to rural areas whether subsid izing bus service would make more sense than maintaining amtraks nationwide network supporting nostalgia or sustaining communities so cial fabric in recent years some amtrak critics have characterized federal subsidies for intercity passenger rail service especially for the long distance routes that serve rural communities as subsidy for railroad nostalgia48 according to this view suburbanization the building of the intersta highway system and jet travel have made passenger trains ec onomically unviable inte rcity passenger rail cannot compete with air carriers on time and cost or with automobiles on cost and convenience given this absence of an economic justificati on for passenger rail excepting perhaps in few urban corridors they argue that the continued support for amtrak is the result of nostalgia romantic attachment to passenger trains communities facing loss of amtrak rvice would take issue with this characterization and argue that it understate s the importance of rail service to the social fabric of many communities49 they would deny that their views are wistful yearning for an unrecoverable past as ntioned earlier some would argue that rail service and their rail station are real part of their hi story and valid component of their sense of community in additi on in recent years both large and small communities have invested in their train stations as part of urban and small town

served may be small rela tive to national totals these communities tend to lobby aggressively to maintain service both with state officials and their congressional delegations the link between local defens of amtrak as linchpin of the social fabric and practical politics has been in some places nd at some times quite effective in forestalling service reductions or garnering state aid to continue service52 subsidy issues in the amtrak debate few aspects of the amtrak debate are argued as vehemently as discussions of federalaid to amtrak relative to federalaid to highways and aviation53 supporters of federal aid to passenger ra il argue that amtrak does not get fair share of federal transportation funding critic s respond that on per passe nger or per passenger mile basis amtraks federalaid is higher than for the other modes and is unjustified given passenger rails 08 share of long distance trips nationwide54 semantic trap for policymakers case can be made that these comparisons are of limited value in the debate because the transportation mode comparisons are of modes that are very different from each other in both what they do how they are financed and how they are structured in addition proponents of aid to amtrak define subsidies broadly including all government spending on highways and aviation and in some cases so assign dollar values for hidden costs ie the costs to the public of smog noi congestion accidents energy security etc while opponents of increased federal sp ending on intercity ra il define subsidies narrowly often only counting federal spending of treas ury general fund revenues as true subsidies amtrak is funded entirely from general f und revenues as discussed below this creates semantic trap in the subsidy debate the two sides are using the same word but with very different meanings this in turn creates statistical disconnect that decision makers in the amtrak debate either have to contend with or ignore the subsidy

factor in amtraks operating costs are employment costs testimony before the house subcommittee on railroads included an examination of amtraks intercity rail core operations employment costs55 the findings presented to the subcommittee by the federal railroad administration fra included the following employment costs salaries wages overtime employee benefits and other employee related costs accounted for threefifths of amtraks intercity rail operating expenses core expenses less depreciation the threefifths proportion had remained steady since the mid1990s indicating that productivity gain s had occurred during this time frame in the aggregate core employment expenses grew during this period on trainmile basis employment costs remained constant about 3637 per trainmile again indi cating an absence of major productivity advances the combination of constant train mile costs and the addition ofmore train miles on the network had led to higher total costs since each train had been carrying fewer passengers coreemployment expenses had been increasing on passengermile basis this had eroded the benefit of the higher fares that amtrak had imposed thereby making it more difficult to compete against the declining prices of air travel these trends in employment costs at amtrak compared unfavorably with total operating cost trends in the airline industry 56 from 1994 to 2000 amtraks

would have been about 186 billion the federal government would have had 171 b illion in stock and accumulated dividends of the 44 billion in unsecured claims about 32 billion would have been for payments owed to terminated employees the gao found that it is unlikely that secured and unsecured creditors claims would have been fully satisfied because other than the northeast corridor amtraks assets available to satisfy these claims and interests such as equipment and materials and supplies are old have little value or appear unlikely to have value equal to the claims against them the market value of amtraks most valuable asset the northeast corridor has not been tested while the corridor has substantial value it is subject to easements and has billions of dollars of deferred

retirees amtraks roughly 20000 employees make up nearly 10 of railroad workers if all amtrak employees had lost their jobs and were not reemployed in the rail industry the retirement system would have

this casts doubt on the extent to which reorganization under ba nkruptcy would lead to lower labor costs and increased workforce flexibility in addition there may be some cons traints upon congress under the bankruptcy clause of the constitution with respect to the liquidation of amtrak the bankruptcy clause requires that bankruptcy laws be uniform the supreme court has interpreted this to mean

organization that would maintain as much rail service as possible because of the statutory prominence given to the public interest in the preservation of debtors rail service it is likely that business liquidation of amtrak and distribution of its assets to its creditors would be the last alternative considered by the cour t rather than the first in addition it appears that legislation requiring an mtrak liquidation coul d be challenged on constitutional grounds congress could howev er force amtrak into bankruptcy by simply eliminating federal payments to amtrak complete elimination of federal support could make it difficult for bankr uptcy court and trustee to craft reorganization that would fall short of liquidation congress passed the amtrak reform nd accountability act which set goal of operational selfsufficiency by 2002 the amtrak reform councils finding in november 2001 that the selfsufficiency goal would not be met in 2002 should have triggered provisions of the law that re quire the council to submit to congress restructuring plan submitted by the arc on february 7 2002 and for amtrak to submit an action plan for complete liqui dation however the political support in congress for amtrak has been strong enoug h to forestall impleme ntation of the arc restructuring plan and preparation of liquidation action plan by amtrak the 2002 department of defense emergency suppl emental appropriati ons act pl 107117 prohibited amtrak from spending either appropriated funds or its own revenues to prepare the liquidation action plan this made it clear that for the time being congress is more concerned with the ramifications of an amtrak shutdown than with the cost of ongoing support funding options all the options for the future of intercity passenger rail in the united states will require some form of government funding even options designed to liquidate amtrak or eliminate any fede ral role could leave the fe deral government shouldering residual and transitional costs most observers believe that other options will require some governmental financ ial involvement matter how passenger rails business model or its industrial structure is chan ged the following funding options either individually or in combination of two or more are seen as funding solutions by participants in the passenger rail debate trust fund proposals amtrak supporters have long advocated the provision of dependable sour ce of federal aid to passeng er rail through some sort of trust fund mechanism the proposals eith er call for providing amtrak with sharehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs24 70 although amtrak supporters see both the htf and atf as being valid sources for aid to amtrak their arguments focus on the htf which is by far the larger of the trust funds and perhaps also because the htf is more dependent on fuel taxes while the atf is more dependent on direct taxation of ticketed passengers 71 steven morrison and clifford winston an econometric analysis of the demand for intercity transportation research in transportation economics v 2 1985 213237 p 72 don phillips amtrak proposes trust fund rail president says government help is continuedof an existing trust funds resources such as those of the htf or aatf or propose separate rail trust fund usually to be supported by an increase in highway fuel user taxes amtrak supporters argue that the existing trust fund revenues should be treated as general transportation trust funds and therefore be available to amtrak they also argue that this aid to rail w ould benefit highway nd airline passengers by providing them with mobility option that would relieve congestion on crowded highways and at airports70 highway and aviation interests reject this view and argue that the benefits to the taxpaying highway and air travelers of providing aid to amtrak are minuscule compared to amount of aid amtrak would need in addition for the near term there are uncommitted balances in the htf that could be made available for amtrak and the aatf may s oon be in similar condition to provide additional trust fund monies either federal aid to high ways and aviation would have to be cut to make room for amtrak spe nding or congress would have to enact tax increases to provide aid to amtrak mo re likely potential means of providing htf funds for amtrak although limite d would be change in the rules for transferring funds between highway and transit formula pr ograms that would allow states to use some of their highway formula program apportionments to support passenger rail projects to date proposals to create separate rail trust fund supported by highway user fuel taxes have garnered little support beyond amtrak supporters themselves proposals to support rail trust fund by imposing ticket ta x on rail passengers similar to the airline passeng er ticket tax have garner ed little support to date primarily because demand for amtr ak tickets is pricesensitive71 amtrak might have to lower its ticket price to compensate fo r the amount of the tax to prevent loss of ridership this situation could in effect amount to the government giving back to amtrak what it would have generated fro m ticket revenues anyway drawback that could have an impact on any trust f und arrangement that provided amtrak with highway user fuel tax revenues could l ead to states and their congressional delegations demanding amtrak service equal to their amtrak related fuel tax payments to the treasury the politics of this distribution could complicate any attempt by amtrak to improve its perform ance by restructuring its route system more reliance on state and local aid another possibility is to shift more of the financial responsibility for mtrak to the state and local governments whose citizens may benefit from the service one way of doing this could be to require larger state or local match fo r federal spending on rail infrastructure projects in the state amtrak

historically the willingness to support amtr ak varies from state to state and over time74 research indicates that affluent states with large populations and large metropolitan areas are more likely to be fa vorable to state suppor t of passenger rail75 requiring state support for amtrak by states across its entire network of routes could lead to regional and interstate controvers ies over the distribution of the aid burden across states and regions for example some states may ague that their aid burden should be low or zero for service through th eir territory if the mobility benefits are seen as going disproportionately to travel ers from adjoining states there could also be friction between corridor and non corridor states over the dist ribution of the aid burden in addition most states unlike the federal government have annually balanced budget provisions to which they mu st adhere this c ould put pressure on state legislatures to redu ce or eliminate their support to passenger rail in times of constrained state revenue because of this it is doubtful that state support would be more stable than federal spe nding on amtrak in addition thirty states restrict the use of their gas tax revenues to highway purposes only these restrictions could limit states ability to pay for rail76 bonding for highspeed rail some supporters of federally assisted funding for highspeed rail infrastructure propose that amtrak be allowed to sell bonds for this purpose the federal gove rnment would pay interest on these bonds by providing bondholders with income tax credits second approach would be to fund capital investment on rail projects through state financ ing of taxexempt debt this approach would be under the contro l of the states and might or might not involve amtrak the state would pay the principal and the interest on the bonds but because the bonds would be exempt from income taxes the federal government would bear costs in terms of revenue lost as result of forgone tax revenues proponents of bonding argue that at the st ate and local level using bonds is the customary way to fund transportation infrastruct ure as an investment that justifies

process and shift so current costs beyond the 10 year budget window thereby reducing budget transparency78 make competing modes pay their socalled true costs n argument derivative of the hidden costs argument mentioned earlier raised by some amtrak advocates is that if highway and aviation system travelers paid the so called true costsof their intercity travel including hidden costs such as costs of pollution accidents national energy secur ity congestion noise free parking etc then passenger rail would be more competitive79 adherents to this argument generally support the imposition of fuel nd other transportati on or emission taxes as well as other user fees to level the playing field within the context of the intercity travel policy community few ot her than amtrak advocates accept the true costs argument however critics of this policy proposal generally reject the exis tence of true costs that can or should be charged to highway and av iation system users and also critique the policy on other grounds they argue that it would not be politically feasible or fair to raise taxes and fees on over 99 of intercity travelers to benefit the less than 1 that ride passenger rail they also state that passenger rail has noise pollution energy congestion and safety costs of its own amtrak advocates do not address the costs that travelers would pay in terms of lost time mobility and convenience should they have to travel by rail rather than car or aircraft another criticism is that the pricing of true costs by passenger ra il advocates often app ears to be based on subjectively determined values ie placing value on the life or health impacts of highway or aviation pollution and noise designating of pa rt of the us defensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs27 80 much of the hidden costs argument is based on popularized use of the concepts of external and internal costs and benefits initially developed by economists for reasonably balanced discussion of these concepts within the context of transport see kenneth button overview of internalising the social costs of transport in internalising the social costs of transport paris organisation for ec onomic cooperation and development 1994p 1 20 includes useful discussion of number of caveats concerning the monetary evaluation of externalities budget that secures us energy sources as highway and aviation system cost placing high value on time lost in traffic jam etc80 the pragmatic problem however with policy imposing socalled true costs of highway and aviation systems use on thei r users to improve amtraks prospects is that it probably would not work as men tioned earlier in this report travel by car bus rail and air are not like goods for example the airlines dominate the travel market for trips over 300 miles it is the time savings not hidden subsidies that attract consumers to air travel for these distances also in the deregulated environment for air travel the overall ticket price including taxes is determined by demand capacity and competition not by taxation finally even if the united states developed robust intercity rail netw ork many doubt this change would resolve the hidden subsidies issue or that americans in large numbers would give up the mobility that their cars and access to the aviation system provide them private sector participation policymakers have debate d to what extent the private sector might be willing to participate in financing passenger rail service the potential benefits of private sector participation are freei ng up public capital for other purposes and increasing railroa d productivity frequently the experiences of other countries with rail privatiza tion are cited in the debate foreign experiences have been mixed the experiences of great brita in and japan with rail privatization are illustrative because they each pur sued different approaches great britain began privatizing britis h rail in 1994 dividing the national railroad into over 70 companies includi ng 25 privately owned train operating companies tocs to run the trains thr ee rolling stock companies roscos to own and maintain passenger ra il cars and locomotives about dozen companies to perform track renewal and maintenance and rolling stock heavy maintenance and one company railtrack to own and manage the entire railway infrastructure including track signaling equipment sta tions rail depots and rail shops thus great britain went step further than most foreign countries in privatizing the passenger rail sector because it not only privatized train operations but the infrastructure component as well in may 1996 railtracks stoc k shares were sold to the public however in november 2001 the government put railtrack under administrative supervision after series of fatal train accidents that were tied to deficient infrastructure new entity called network rail replaced railtrack in october 2002 network rail is government controlled nonprofit public trust to some observers the railtrack experience suggests that passenger track infrastructure is best kept in the public sector but othe r observers argue that it was the execution of the concept not privatization itself that went awry in the case of railtrack with respect to the tocs during the initial years of privatization subs idy levels to the tocs increased while they have since fallen off subsidies paid to the tocs havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs28 81 for an explanation of vertically integr ated railroad see the section entitled vertical integration or horizontal separationbeen higher than the subsidy level proposed by the tocs in their original franchise agreements japans experience with privatization is informative because it pursued vertically integrated model81 in 1987 the government dissolved japan national railways jnr into three geographically separated but vertically integrated railroads on the main island of honshu over the succeeding decade and half the majority of the stock of these three railroads was sold to private investors as of 2004 jr west and jr east have been fully privatized while the government still owns minority stake in jr central these three railroads are able to cover their operating costs from operating revenues and do not receive operating subsidies from the government however these railroads so generate signif icant revenues from non rail businesses they operate ongside their track such as offices department stores housing and recreational f acilities on the three sm aller islands of hokkaido shikoku and kyushu jnr was split into three railroads one railroad on each island these railroads have not been privatized and due to lower traffic densities than on honshu they receive operating subs idies in addition to capital subsidies japans experience is illustrative because it divided its former national railroad into segments that it believed could be commercially viable from those that it believed would not be the key question is how mu ch of japans competitive rail industry is due to segmentation and priva tization and how much of it is do to factors outside of rail policy such as economic geography privatization necessa rily involves tradeoff betw een financial and efficiency objectives on the one hand and social or equ ity objectives on the other in order to attract private capital and provide sufficient economic returns privatized railroad may need to abandon money losing routes railroad kept under government control can subsidize money losing routes so there is less risk of losing service key issue with privatization is reconciling business objectives with the social objectives of government options in organizational structure restructure passenger rail service to its critics amtrak is dysfunctional institution it is railroad created by committee and as such it is impeding the progress of rail transportation in the united states particularly its development in highvolume corridors as result of compromise between those who would have preferred to shut it down and those who wanted to preserve and possibly expand passenger rail service the railroad was gi ven contradictory objectives become profitable but at the same time maintain nationwide service that necessarily includes unpr ofitable routes in their view put simply political compromise is way to run railroad they argue the only solution is to start over with better organizational design massive increase in subsidies to amtrak as opposed to subsidies to some other form of passenger rail service they say would simply throw good money after bad and do little to improve the competitiveness of intercity passenger rail in the united states what is needed in this view arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs29 measures that will improve the internal efficiency of the railroad and affect management and staff behavior which can only be achieved by transforming the institutional organization of the sector itself railway restructuring options gene rally involve breaking up monolithic railroad along several dimensions either geographica lly by type of service by business function or some hybr id combination of these proponents of restructuring suggest several reasons for breaking up monolithic railroad into number of separate companies or entitie s one reason is to bring about greater clarity of responsibility and accountability on the part of the railroad and in its relationship with government national railroad may try to crosssubsidize different areas of operation making it difficult for policymakers to determine if resources are being managed effectively amtrak has been accu sed of obscuring its allocation of funds hiding costs or delaying needed cap ital investments to save money some policymakers have been frustrated in tr ying to disentangle spending on track infrastructure versus spending on train opera tions for instance if public funds were instead provided to separate independent entities each w ith more narrowly defined mission it would be easier for policymaker s to track how funds were being spent another reason cited to break up railroad into separate entities is to create model that could support competition in the rail ma rket competition is generally credited as driver of higher service levels and lower costs two of the principal goals of amtrak reformers it is also easier to privatize railroad if it is divided into smaller business units final rationale for restructuring railroad is to better insulate it from politically directed decisionmaking opponents of amtrak restructuring ar gue that creating too many separate entities complicates interrelationships among rail entities making it more difficult to hold the entities res ponsible they also do not view crosssubsidization as negative consequence of amtr aks current structure geographic segmentation if amtrak were split up geographically it could be divided into several i ndependent railroad ca rriers based on typical passenger use patterns in other words it could be divi ded up so that most passenger trips begin and end within the service territory of single railroad for example the nec and the angeles to san diego route segments could each be run by separate railroads on amtraks longdistance routes most customers travel between two intermediate points within these routes therefore these routes could also be broken up and operated by different railroa ds based on the most popular origins and destinations traveled one rationale for breaking up mtrak into regional carriers would be to better focus managements attention on rail customer needs which are typically regional rather than national in nature breaking up amtrak into separate regional carriers could also make the income distri butional effects of ra ilroad subsidies more clear and conspicuous segmentation by service type the same rationale for breaking up amtrak geographically could apply to breaking it up along business sector dimensions for example three separate companies could be fo rmed one to operate corridor trains one to operate longdista nce trains and one to operate commuter trains again management focus would be the primary rationale this approach could improve rail managements performance by allowing each railroadshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs30 82 anthony perl improving us passenger train performance transportation research news v 222 sept oct 2002 p22management team to specialize in one type of service different types of train service require different management strategies part of amtraks problem according to many of its critics is that it lacks market focus one supporter of reform opines other transportation carrier in the united states is expected to provide market and nonmarket services under the sa managerial umbrella82 also by dividing the railroad up the government c ould clarify its relationship with each railroad on the corridor routes the operationa l selfsufficiency test could be used as the primary performance indicator the longdistance provider could be dealt with as non profit social service agency or perhaps as some type of forprofit land cruise service for tourists much of the commu ter railroads oversight and funding could be devolved to state or local governments breaking up railroad in this manner arguably could make it easier for decisionmakers to weigh the merits of railroad subsidies on casebycase basis it could also clarify the geopolitical motives for supporting particular rail operator vertical integration or horizontal separation much of the debate over amtrak restructuring centers on the choice between vertically integrated versus vertically separated railroad amtrak currently operates as both on the nec amtrak operates as vertically integrated railroad it owns and maintains the track and operates the trains over the track in most of the rest of the country amtrak operates as vertically separated railroad it operates the trains but the rail track is owned and maintained by separate companies namely the freight railroads vertically separated railway is akin to an owner and tenant relationship some amtrak reform proposals call for transformin g amtrak into ve rtically separated railroad on the nec however some rail analysts believe the interrelationship between track and train operations is too complex to separate these functions into separate companies they argue that tradeoff exists between the design and maintenance of track and the speed at whic h trains can run over the track and since this tradeoff affects the economics of th entire operation it is most advisable to keep these functions under the control of one tity the downside of vertically integrated railway is that it is barrier to competition because of the large infrastructure costs new entrants must overcome to compete with the existing carrier due to lack of competition integr ated railways may exhibit monopolistic tendencies such as lack of market responsiveness lack of incentives to reduce costs and lack of innovativeness in an attempt to addre ss some of the monopolistic tendencies of vertically integrated railroads some c ountries like sweden and gland have separated the responsibilities of track from tr ain operations vertically separated railways puts rail on more equal footing with its intermodal rivals highways and airways the government can provide rail infrastructure in the same way that it provides highway and airway infrastructure like airlines and buses train operator therefore can concentrate on running trains rather than also having to devote resources and expertise to the infrastructure component httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs31 theoretically the separati on of train operations from track infrastructure could lead to competition on the track rail carriers could compete for passengers headto head over the same track in much the same manner as airlines or bus and trucking companies compete with one another over their respective infrastructures in practice there is little experience with this form of rail competition it may be too difficult to coordinate train schedules and allocate slots among multiple rail carriers instead some countries have pursued re gulatory arrangement where train operating companies compete with one another for the exclusive right to operate on the track in other words train operators compete for the track not on the track this is done through franchising arrangement where inte rested train operators bid for the right to be the single provider of rail service over the track they bid based on the level of service and the amount of government financial support if any they would require thus competitive pressures among train operating companies are brought to bear during bidding process the government can award the franchise giving the carrier the exclusive right to operate trains for specified number of years to the company that promises the highest service level at the lowest subsidy for example the train operator awarded the contract w ill have monopoly status as the only train provider but the terms of the contract ar supposed to keep monopolistic propensities in check also the train operator should have incentive to develop good reputation in order to qualify for bidding on successive contracts or for franchises in other service territories drawback of vertically separated railway is that it creates complexity separating track from train operations means that regulators must determine how the infrastructure entity is going to charge the train operating companies for track access regulators would need to estimate the appropriate infrastructure price past experience with transportation pricing regulation suggests that regulators often have to rely on incomplete or unreliable information and that mispricing often creates unintended disincentives for the regula ted parties while the introduction of competition may bring about ma nagement efficiencies on th part of the rail operator more complex regulatory environment may create its own inefficiencies contracts between the infrastructure provider and the train operator are necessarily complex and lawsuits may raise transaction costs substantially primary purpose for separating track fro m train operations is in preparation for privatization it is thought that the pr ivate sector will be more attracted to rail franchises if it is not burdened with the heavy cost of also maintaining the infrastructure many rail analysts even some who support priv atization stress that policymakers should not expect privatiza tion to completely wean railroad from public funding while the private sector might reduce the financial burden on the public sector it probably can not replace it to attract private investors rail analysts also argue that the railroad must be structured in such way that it is insulated as much as possible from political intervention restructuring in perspective while much of the policy debate has focused on the best way to organize amtra k how it is organized is only one of many factors that can determine passenger railroa ds success or failure in fact many rail analysts contend that the structural or ganization of the railroad can only affect success or failure at the margin they contend that the most critical issue facing congress is the high level of public spending viable intercity passenger rail systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32709crs32 requires according to some the fundame ntal problem with amtrak is too much service with too little resources not how it is organized the mismatch between service and resources is not likely to be re solved as long as amtrak supporters resist cutting service or amtrak critics resist increasing funding even if the united states were to choose the right model and undergo massive rail investment program such as building highspeed rail lines this in and of itself would not ensure that rail would gain significant share of the intercity travel market even state oftheart rail infrastructure will not succeed in vacuum other factors such as land use planning population density dist ances between cities relative prices of alternative modes and culture are few of the other variables that may be equally or more significant in determining the competitiveness of intercity passenger trains the status quo as political equilibrium despite the prevalence in the amtrak bate of the funding options discussed above perhaps the most likely policy outco for amtrak is one that approximates the status quo amtraks geographic scope and level of service may be reflection of political equilibrium state of adjus tment between opposing forces its network of corridor and longdistance routes may be the result of balance between widely divergent ideological forces as well as balance in the bases of power between the houses of congress and the branches of government for the last three decades amtrak has had enough political social and ridership support to keep it alive in its present condition but not enough support to expand it into more robust national passenger railroad networ k or opposition to kill it although this condition displeases both amtrak advocates and critics it does allow policymakers to avoid making the seemingly irrevocable decision to shut down amtrak or alternatively committing to major financing program to enhance rail infrastructure it also averts one of the most politically difficult decisions the elimination of amtraks long distance routes the status quo has some advantages fo r amtrak and its supporters in that it keeps amtrak alive as national networ k so that s hould the political or economic fundamentals shift in passenger rails fa vor policymakers would have an existing base to work from should amtrak surv ive long enough there could be changes in population densities cost competitiveness w ith other modes and other economic or social developments that c ould raise passenger rails pros pects on the other hand the status quo at least in the near term does nothing to improve amtraks financial or operational performance it is also doubt ful that the passage of time and the hoped for changes in demographic and economic conditions will favor passenger rail system that has been stagnant amtrak w ill have to be suffici ently funded to upgrade its track and rolling stock and be proficiently managed to encourage market changes in addition even if maintaining the st atus quo only means maintaining amtraks current routes and service levels it does not follow that the costs

history of mana gement turnover and questionable decision making amtrak supporters however argue th at this adds an element of uncertainty to its future federal fina ncial support and thereby

suggest that even if there ar legitimate economic reasons for breaking up amtrak splinte red amtrak will not survive politically any passenger rail provider even if stat or local government funding were to increase would still likely require substan tial funding from the federal government thus unless the railroad provides service on national scale it will not generate the support of majority in congress to ensure adequate funding thus these observers argue political rea lities dictate that amtrak be national network or network at all87
