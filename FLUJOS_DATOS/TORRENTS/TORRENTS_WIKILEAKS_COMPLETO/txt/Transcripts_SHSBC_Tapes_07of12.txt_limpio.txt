has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc7 renum 7 5 jun 61 routine 1 2 and 3 routine 1 2 and 3 lecture given on 5 june 1961 based on clearsound only thank you if this were formal lecture i would be wearing jacket and bow tie but i find im not able to talk well with bow tie on keep restimulating all the people ive hanged in france well now there are few questions before the house i am very very sure so give question here quick yes male voice you talked about what it means when preclear comes in different tone arm reading than he went out at well what happens if the pc comes in at about the same tone arm reading but his sensitivity has changed sharply in the meanwhile thats an interesting point to notice if the pc comes in with his tone arm out you would of course at once be suspicious you always check pcs tone arm when he leaves session its on your reports and you always glance at the last reading so that your next reading when he comes back into session again you can check against that and that is about the first thing you do between sessions you look at that difference of tone arm reading and if you find vast difference of tone arm you of course want to know what happened between sessions practically even before you start one you got the idea its of that order of emergency now the things i have found on pcs happening between sessions are quite interesting what do we mean between sessions we dont mean overnight we mean solely strictly completely and utterly if they get out of the auditors sight at any time during break i have known pcs to instantly go to the phone call south africa or something and tell the husband i have just decided you are louse and we are through clang you see and having expended fortyfive quid or something like this to deliver themselves of these sentiments come back into session again feeling very selfrighteous but wont run you got the idea it didnt take them very long but that was it man they got brandnew overt and every time pc is having trouble with case this is subject of overts and withholds so now the question comes up what if the sensitivity knob goes out well this would be very strange and peculiar indeed because it would mean the whole emeter had turned dial or two you know it might have gone all the way around the dial it would be an accident almost that it would come up with the same reading but you had better check both sensitivity and tone arm that should be added in so thank you for the datum youve got considerable importance now just speaking and carrying with that right along with that goes your rudiments in definition of rudiments what it takes to get session running and the pc insession definition of insession willing to talk to the auditor and interested in own case are rudiments process to get the case on the road they are not you run rudiments with thirdofadial drop why because youve got joburg security check these days and you dont have to be too sniffish for those withholds and if its big withhold youll get it on thirdofadial drop if its going to stop the session the rule is that if the needle does not drop third of dial on the squeeze test and at that setting rudiment clanks the pc you will find rather consistently is perfectly capable of being audited got it so you dont use rudiments to waste auditing because the processes today in the rudiments are so much weaker than any other process weve got that you are wasting time got it however as youre going through with thirdofadial drop setting the needle does twitch kerbango when you say do you have present time problem and it goes twitchthirdofadialdrop youve got to handle it now how do you handle it you say now what was that and what was what well i had little drop here when i asked you about present time problem oh well i suppose thats my ive got to phone uh ive got to phone new siberia the american medical association address ive got to phone new siberia at three oclock and report or something of this sort and you say well is that present time problem to you now mm and it doesnt twitch you dont run it also that is the extent of twoway comm twoway comm that goes four questions turns into process you understand and there are processes much neater for all twoway comm situations than youre going to twoway comm the american auditor has this frailty more than the auditors in other parts of the world theyll run twoway comm for two hours dont do it because theres just too many processes now and prehav is too hot and even the rudiments processes are hotter you see than twoway comm but twoway comm does give it an opportunity to blow and thats all you do is give the pc an opportunity to asis the situation he doesnt asis it process it dont twoway comm it out of him see give him chance to asis it by saying what it is and the fall disappears and youre all set you can ask him as many times as you want to the same question or some variation of the question you know are you withholding anything are you keeping something from are you embarrassed because you are being audited today have you had some nasty cottonpicking little unkind thought about the director of processing have you suddenly decided ron ought to be hanged if anybody is going to do anything to they better not try to shoot the only overts ive got that im tender on are hanging theyll have to hang anyhow whats the extent then of handling these rudiments to get pc insession thirdofadial drop and right down the list of model session asking them twice six or eight times i dont care how many times you ask them to find out what it is thats one thing now twoway comm would be method of getting the pc to asis this situation oh your withhold is that last night you made love to an ape all right now how is that now well i guess its all right and man if that needle doesnt move take it man thats all right just because you have peculiar ideas about relationships with apes is reason to follow this up at all its all going to come out in the wash furthermore if the pc is still dramatizing something now wave your ears on this one if pc is still dramatizing something it is too deepseated to be reached in rudiments or by twoway comm you got that so pt problems arc breaks that sort of thing ask about them if you see twitch find out what that twitch was thats the first thing see well thats not twoway comm thats just interrogation to find out what the devil the auditorpc relationship is here all right now youve found out what the twitch is and its still there ask him exactly what it was he tells you dont follow that up with another question and another one and another one you understand put your brakes on smoking right there you say well you had relationships last night with an ape all right good now how does that seem to you clang well youre going to do something about this in the first place its some kind of weird overtwithhold sort of situation but its certainly longer withhold from the auditor is it he told you he might not have told you all its all right for him to tell you all of this withhold you got the idea but it didnt go away now is the time to run process got it this came up on present time problem see where im heading you see you asked him present time problem you got this kind of an oddball answer what are you going to do about this you better find out if its problem to him well what it is get rid of it get rid of it one way or the other on the rudiments thats the best rule dont let it go off into the processes but youre not going to handle the situation as neurosis or psychosis or something of the sort in the rudiments you understand youre trying to get it out of the road for auditing so you say what part of that situation could you be responsible for or something like this because its present time problem and he tells you answers few questions you say hows it seem to you now you dont get fall on to the next one man quick see if it doesnt asis with twoway you can ask him all the ways you want to its misdemeanor on your part arrestable in the court of high council for you not to ask him something in several ways to find exactly what its falling on you understand thats misdemeanor not to do that but now to go on nattering on twoway comm trying to get this thing asised as twoway comm is lousy waste of time on your part thats all because process would do it lot better so you found out what it was and it didnt asis now you run rudiments process all right youve got rudiments process it knocks it out you carry on now this interesting problem comes up supposing the person has big withhold from george big withhold see so you run ow on george well in the first place youve done something little adventurous its all right go ahead and do it but you get tone arm motion on ow on george aw thats too bad youre running ow on george you better run it you better flatten it but there are dozens of better ways to handle george dont you see this is kind of unfortunate the tone arm starts moving from 30 to 60 on ow on george well now youve got process thats biting youve got pc thats running and youve had it what do you do with it the rule is the tone arm has got to be quarter of division or less for twenty minutes of auditing before you can leave process this applies unfortunately to the rudiments thats why youre always hopeful for null needle on the rudiments because you dont want to audit the case with the rudiments but at the same time if you ignore drop on the rudiments with thirdofadial drop sensitivity set youve had it you wont do anything in that session now you could crank up the sensitivity to 16 and ask the rudiments now what are you doing youre running the case arent you are you withholding anything ladies and gentlemen fellow students of homo sap takes seven hours on some people to do joburg and youve asked it in one lump question now what are you going to do sensitivity 16 is your mistake it wasnt rudiment that fell on thirdofadial drop by definition now what is meant by rudiment out one of the rudiments are out and the case is being run with rudiment out now what is meant by this it means there is reaction with the meter set at thirdofadial drop visible reaction on the needle when the meter is set at thirdofadial drop if there is visible reaction on the meter with it set for thirdofadial drop on the cansqueeze test that rudiment is out and youve got to do something about it you got it now what about these cases what about these cases that keep trying to go clear on us and i suddenly realized the other night although ive given you advice that youd better get your sensitivity knobs fixed you know youre never going to get them fixed there is sensitivity knob that will turn off far enough when person starts going into floating tone arm state when theyre up about release itll just float further and further and more and more and youd have to turn the sensitivity off further and further and at some point the meter is going to become nonfunctional so you would be going toward the same situation as simply turning your sensitivity knob off well if pc insists on dropping three dials on thirdofadial drop can squeeze with your sensitivity all the way off against the off switch see im afraid theres only one other sensitivity cutdown that you could do and thats just turn the meter off so what happens to this rule as the person goes clear well the rule is not very important as the person gets loosened up to that degree how do you like that it is not very important because what is the behavior of needle as the individual gets more and more up toward clear the needle swings less and less on heavier and heavier charges thats interesting i had d of p ask fairly recently well i dont think this is correct about this thirdofadial squeeze and the sensitivity and that sort of thing because people that are coming in here with loose needles are obviously in very bad condition because they dont get much needle reaction when you ask them about arc breaks and things of that sort naturally its not charged question to them but on somebody whos plowed in down on the borderline of the nether regions you ask him if hes got an arc break and you get wham wham wham wham wham wham and you say well what was that and he says you lighted cigarette while you were lecturing free floating needle as the cases advance on up the line well this is about threedials can squeeze see youve got it sensitivity as low as you can get it threedials can squeeze thats all you can do about it and you say you got an arc break and you get one dialdivision drop see theres very loose needle and you get one little dial division one of those little tiny things thats about quarter of an inch long you see and you ask him that and you say what was that and he says well actually i was withholding it from you that i just wrecked your car last night only this same person would be also in this category youd say what you know and explode all over the place and youd say well yes i also took it into the garage and its now been repaired and is sitting in your garage you get entirely different action of course he probably wouldnt have wrecked the car but look you get some kind of reaction like this you lighted match while i was thinking you see threedial drop now you see twitch on that see you just see twitch of course you can only really read him in twitches on such case and you say what was that say well i wrecked your car last night its still lying out on m1 police are looking for you as hit and run driver but i didnt do anything it wasnt my fault actually you left the keys in the ignition and you generally will get smug smile following it you get an entirely different set of reactions for the same existing situation is that clear im covering over rudiments with you and what rudiments amounts to and what meter reactions amount to and so forth we go over these things quite often but they are the most important thing because if your pc is not insession youre not getting any auditing done but we have to define what is meant by rudiment being out it means the rudiment is out you have to correct it well you can always find rudiment out how do you like that just by turning your sensitivity knob up to 16 and say are you withholding anything or do you have an arc break with anybody in the whole world anyplace is there anybody anywhere in the world that you have an arc break with and of course youre going to get needle reaction so your auditing is totally reduced down to doing nothing but rudiments nothing but rudiments nothing but rudiments nothing but rudiments nothing and theyre not very good processes so of the two hours and half that you have for an auditing session you spend two hours and fifteen minutes running the beginning and end rudiments and you spend fifteen minutes on the process see and that isnt whats getting the case there the rule is the case cannot be audited with the rudiments out what is meant by rudiments out visible reaction on the needle with thirdofadial squeeze setting on the sensitivity knob does that mean that person who has very loose tone arm then could have allowances made for him so if he gets drop on present time problem and you know hes got very he drops about dial and you cant set it down any further than dial does that mean you ignore his twitches hes in for it but this is okay because hell blow them on twoway comm youll say what is this arc break and hell say well the cook sneered at this morning he put sneer on my shredded wheat biscuits you know and you say how do you feel about that now therell be further reaction you see the looseness of needle at minimum setting is direct index of state of case the most direct stateofcase index there is this is your diagnostic switch right here this sensitivity and if you to get thirdofadial drop have the guy sitting here at sensitivity 16 and even then dont make it youre dealing with cch case brother and dont think you arent weve broken our hearts on enough of them cchs they get you understand now that doesnt mean that all cases that are run on cchs are instantly in this horrible condition but it does mean that the case has not been showing adequate gain in processing processing over long period of time we have record of this processing they havent been showing enough gain there must be something haywire someplace we check them over we cant find present time problems arc breaks withholds they just dont seem to have anything here anyplace well youve got the cchs so you return the case to it got it just like you can turn an sop goals case back into routine 2 now youre going to get that bulletin in very short order if you dont have it right this minute i imagine were pretty stacked up in the bulletin department were getting out the secondary scales but you got three routines these days routine 1 is cchs and joburg security checks and cchs and joburg security checks and cchs and joburg security checks on oneforone ratio experimental at this moment that its oneforone why the cchs boost up the individuals responsibility for his environment and then he blows his head off because hes now all of sudden got withholds that hes now feels responsible for so you have to pull the withholds off to keep from killing the case you got it you raise case level he runs into his withholds begins to be more responsible for the world around him and all of sudden crash hes had it he actually feels like somebody is running over him like god juggernaut is letting him have it you know complete with the stone wheels he feels terrible youve increased his responsibility he realizes hes guilty of many things on all dynamics and you give him opportunity to get rid of them and that is the only thing that has ever been stalling cases in dianetics and scientology over the last eleven years thats the thing that stalls them thats why they hit ceiling and halt they halt because itd kill them if they got any better because if they got any better theyd be more responsible for what theyve been up to on the whole track you got it all of sudden they realize they have overts and withholds and it damn near kills them and this would work out with almost any case so you run the cchs to increase their responsibility and you pull off their withholds with joburg and thats the routine now i dont know quite what the optimum ratio between the cchs and joburg is i dont know if its one for one one for two one for three who knows hour for hour im talking about what do you do security check them for three hours and cch them for one or cch them for three and security check them for one well were just taking it out at even level and say well were going to start in at one for one so thats what it is right now one for one one hour joburg one hour cchs all right that means that you dont suddenly stop cch process that is terribly unflat and give the joburg after one hour you understand but if youve been five hours flattening this you can be totally prepared to spend five hours on security checking got it its however long theyve been running the cchs up to temporary flat point one more mention of this cchs are run in strict accordance with clause 13 of the auditors code process must be run only so long as it produces change this is not direct quote this is an interpretation of it its breach of the auditors code to run process that is not producing change it is breach of the auditors code to stop process that is producing change got that whats change in the cchs well you run cch 1 cch 2 cch 3 cch 4 let us say that all during the running of 1 the test is twenty minutes the person whatever theyre doing must be change of reaction in twenty minutes got it twenty minutes change in the pc now whats that mean well the pc is meter what would the pc be reading on meter if the pc were trying to leave come on what would it be audience theta bop thats right the pc is the meter you dont have the pc on meter you can look at the pc see got the idea all right now lets get another one youre trying to run cch 2 and there they go and youre getting them all set and so forth and all during the time theyre just running like woundup doll see theres change of reaction theres change comm lag nothing for twenty minutes man thats flat as far as youre concerned it isnt biting or its flat or we dont care what you go on to the next one you got the idea all right supposing on one of these cchs the pc is simply 15ing the entire time just madder than hell you see the idea of running such process on you realize this process is only reserved for psychotics actually it used to be it isnt now process is only reserved for psychotics and you think im psychotic and who do you think i am and they keep this up for twenty minutes process is flat new look huh supposing the pc lies down in the middle of the floor and cant be made to rise for twenty minutes process flat you got it so the process is run in strict accordance with clause 13 of the auditors code run process only so long as it produces change and longer and dont stop process that is producing change you got that well that means doesnt mean by the way that you have to audit him all night but that means in the next session youre running the same process see that process has got to come up to flat point and the flat point is twenty minutes without change whatever the pc is doing pc insists every time he walks up to the wall that he turn around and with one foot kick it and hes been doing it for twenty minutes hes had it you are longer critical of what the pc is doing and longer trying to force the pc to do the process you just carry out your upper indoctype cchs and carry on as much as you can but youre not trying to force something on the pc particularly you understand youre trying to do what he can do obviously hes incapable of giving you his hand during that period of time now you say well normally he would get over that sooner or later yes hell get over it sooner or later go on to the next process and when you finish up 4 you come back to 1 and youll find out hes incapable for while of giving you his hand in the first place youre auditing valence out and the pc up and the only thing you get reaction from is the valence so if the case is progressing why this valence is acting up because valence fights for survival you got it theres comm lags theres various things occurring all the time all the time all the time well for heavens sakes its not flat so you carry it on you got how to run them now that by the way is the original cchs taught in london in 1957 weve gone right back to base on it it is not for psycho they were originated ordinarily just for cases that werent getting results on various processes case wouldnt get results on higher processes so we just kicked an awful lot of pcs over into this particular category and london has had great deal of success with cchs up through the years at the same time i didnt have much of chance to straighten out the hgc as to how you ran cchs and they werent running them very good and they were you know i dont know be perfectly happy to sit there and ask somebody to give you their hand and they give you their hand and do it just for twenty minutes six hours twentyfive hours the individual is simply giving you his hand they just run it for twentyfive hours its breach of the auditors code if he gives you his hand for twenty minutes on stretch thats it furthermore the cchs are not run in model session you say here we go thats it and thats the beginning and end of session im going to audit you now this is the first process im going to say give your hand you can tell him anything you want to you can even say well it isnt going to hurt you anything you want i dont care what you say but its not run in model session you dont pick up the arc breaks you dont pick up any of these things why not because obviously if youre running that the person doesnt easily blow these things so you can just become completely involved with the case see completely involved id say the criteria would be this if you did long assessment and finally the goal of the pc is to get even with the janitor who is momentary present time terminal and this is the only goal you can find on the pc id say you were probably assessing somebody youd have got along faster with with the cchs see the terminal has backed all the way up to pt got the idea now listen it is not that you couldnt win with the other routines on the same case because we are longer doing routines because of case levels thats new surprise for you see weve always had low cases get routine 1 and the next cases get routine 2 and the next cases get routine 3 or something like this have you got the idea it was always graduated that way well it isnt now its what is the fastest case gain you can obtain for the least amount of auditing got it and it is all in the interests of saving auditing time because all of these work by the way all three routines that we have work on the same level of case you could take roddy green and find his goal and find his terminal and assess it on the prehav scale and run him youd get there but your auditing ratio may be something on the order of about two to three per one takes you seventyfive hours to get there whereas you could have gotten there in the same period of time in twentyfive hours you got the idea so its just in the interests of saving auditors time that you do these things furthermore the auditor doesnt get bogged down or upset because his case isnt winning because hes being yakked at you understand makes smoother look all around so all three routines work on all cases which is riches indeed and you could expect sooner or later when we hit the jackpot and pull that old onearm bandits hand and the gold sovereigns started pouring out of it all around the floor on technology that this is what would have happened you would have had at least couple of routines that would have worked on all cases now weve got three routines thatd work on all cases there isnt person here by the way who wouldnt pick up on some the cchs run in this fashion cch 1 2 3 4 you see 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 just run as long as theyre flat its very rapid running and we looked on the cchs as being very slow grind well i point out to you that in 1957 they were not slow grind and they were being run in the exact style which im telling you about now see we got it lost because i couldnt quite grasp what was going wrong we put it mainly down to the fact the auditors intention wasnt getting across to the pc thats not true that has something to do with it but thats not the answer the answer is much more cleancut answer than that the auditor was disobeying the auditors code clause 13 okay he was not running processes as long as they produced change pc fighting you know and say well im not going to run this damn process minute longer im not going to run it and the pc would keep fighting him for three hours four hours five hours six hours whole intensive hed say well i got to get someplace with this pc i got to get someplace because the pcs fighting you see the pcs fighting is change change by reason of the process but you can say well look the process wasnt being administered oh youre looking physically at what happens to about 75 percent of the cases you have trouble with is they never do the mental process that you give them except now youve got it physically hes not doing cch 2 only you can see he isnt doing it ive had pc come up to and say well you thought that auditor was pretty good that you had there but huhuhuhuuhuhhuh huhhuh i i just had twentyfive hour intensive from him tuhhumhuhu didnt do single command he said and i thought why you dumb bastard to myself you know you dumb sap you mean to say that you wasted twentyfive hours of auditing time and gave the fellow something on the order of fifty quid or something of the sort just so that you could have the wonderful opportunity of never answering single one of the auditing questions but fooling him for twentyfive hours oddly enough to the pc that would be eminently logical well youve got it out in plain broad air that the pc is not about to do your auditing commands havent you well so if what if you had him on mental process on the meter what if you had him on mental process on the meter and he wasnt doing the auditing command but appeared to be you know saying mmhm mmhm mmhm you ask him what are you thinking about oh im thinking about the process mmhm mmhm mmhm got machine got machine set up like clockwork toy and every time you say the question he goes mm hmhm hasnt anything to do with anything youve said see you say do fish swim he says the auditor is trying to probe my secrets mmhm got the idea now its just an extremity of alteris now how much alteris is there on the case determines what process runs him the fastest so lets run cchs and get any alteris out into the clear or anything of that sort but anybody could gain on any of these routines now ill go over these other routines with you very rapidly ill just tell you what they are routine 2 is general run on the prehav scale joburg security check and the havingness and confront processes all run in model session i think thats the extent of it isnt it is there anything else in there mm pt problems of long duration are assessed for terminal on that routine you find present time problem of long duration you know keeps banging present time problem or something of the sort and you run that you assess that on the prehav scale you find the terminal and you find terminal about the problem that drops the most and you assess it on the prehav scale and you run it flat and you assess it again and you run it flat and you assess it again and you run it flat and you assess it again and run it flat thats pt problem of long duration fastest way to run one for auditors at large actually you can get someplace just running engrams on them presession 38 but this other one is very very easy to do and reaches all cases without any difficulty so why not do it all right thats the extent of routine 2 whats routine 3 sop goals assessment assessment for goal assessment for terminal and this is run flat level by level on the prehav scale with what second step joburg security check all three routines have joburg security check in common what are you trying to do with this case youre trying to unbale this case and get this case up to point where it is willing to make an advance what do you mean unwilling to make an advance all right the case is unwilling to make an advance so long as and continually when the case finds he is turning on powerful and fantastic resistances and somatics and things like this he doesnt dare get any better because if he gets more responsible hes had it have you ever noticed that there are some very pretty girls around in the world who have high level of irresponsibility have you noticed that well actually if you ran them into the middle ground their beauty would be less in other words youd audit them for little while and increase their responsibility and they wouldnt look so good have you got that isnt that odd theyd be better but they wouldnt look so good you got the idea well that would only obtain so long as they were stacking up withholds that you werent getting rid of so you could take person who was quite irresponsible but goodlooking nothing theyve ever done has any influence on the body now you audit them it has some influence on the body theyve got to theyve got to shoot the rapids sort of up the niagara river you know theyve got to go up niagara falls backwards and its rather battering experience well it becomes very unbattering experience the moment that you keep cleaning up withholds and youre going to see this phenomenon continually you make little case advance and all of sudden youre on long grind whats happened well the pc doesnt dare get any better thats all see case advanced rapidly and then something stopped it you know and then you grind grind grind grind grind youve all seen this well what was that point of the curve i had to find out well its the withholds they suddenly get responsible for their overts and then they havent any chance to tell you about them or unload them or unburden them in any way and they just start kicking their heads off thats all youll find somebody whos had case improvement who has improved just little bit too much for their tolerance suddenly standing back of chimney sobbing bitterly you got the idea im good and weve had some casualties with that that is to say somebody has blown or something like that you know hes been improved bit but it was too much for him you got the idea because improvement means an increase of responsibility for his past present and future which of course includes all the dirty mean nasty caviling little twobit tricks hes played on everybody and how did he get those things how did he get those things excused he lessened the overt the old bulletin on lessening the overt which by the way should be part of your bulletins and they lessen the overt and now you audit them and they suddenly realize that that person they were so nasty to wasnt probably quite that bad see and this overt starts to swell up on them now youre doing it with processing and this is now tenthousandhorsepower operation see and the pc puts his two horsepower up against this thing you see and just tries like mad to stop the juggernaut only this overt keeps unlessening joe was not so bad god whats going to happen to them now you see so their whole effort now is to keep the overt from unlessening and they longer have their attention on the process got it thats the exact mechanism so the case improves you get fast improvement curve get the withholds and you all of sudden you get another fast improvement curve get the withholds get another fast improvement curve get the withholds thats the system youve got three routines with which to do it and cases which are having difficulty answering auditing commands or having difficulty in auditing or who would only run on sop goals in some kind of present time situation probably will audit faster on the cchs as general rule than they would audit otherwise theyll make more progress you got the idea you can get this person back up over niagara falls without so many chain hoists its easier instead of standing in there boxing with the alteris which theyre not about to take responsibility for or run out see dont go on the basis that everybody just because you alter the alteris you might not be able to find it exactly see the alteris might have something to do with have and would be you know any kind of hobsonjobson situation where theyre fitting one substitute with another substitute and you might not hit it exactly and youd have to keep hitting it exactly and its very expert requires lot of expertness to do that thing you get their mind going off like firecracker almost continuously and you can do it it can be done you understand but its probably slower certainly for the average auditor slower all right so the combination there is that this is the best thing to do for case that might hang up otherwise now your next general run your next general routine is actually basically there all cases would benefit from it and it would be faster than routine 3 in lot of cases but i i have found out that auditors who are specifically being coached at long distance from us which is very difficult actually are able to do what is now routine 2 they can do it they can kind of dub around and make it work you understand but boy you get them on goals and theyre over the hills and far away like bunch of whitetailed antelope and you just see these little spots of white in the distance man they dont grab that one ive got it on my comm lines and from hgcs and from every place ad infinitum and theyre just latch they can do general runs on prehav scales read one bulletin do general run on the prehav scale thats it do joburg security check miss 50 percent of the questions but its still functioning see you get the idea its still functional in their hands do you see that but this doesnt say that you couldnt take the person youre going to do cch on and find his goal and it doesnt say that the person that youre going to do the general runs and joburgs on it doesnt say you couldnt grind in and find his goal you can actually find the goal and terminal and so forth on anybody that you try its just little arduous thats all little more arduous it takes more time so in the interests of swift clearing is what these three routines are all about and thats the basis on which were operating today and of course youre here to learn about this so i probably wont see you doing as many routine 2s youll probably get more routine 1s and routine 3s than you get 2s but in some hgc someplace or out in the bush of back of north wallaby why youll see an awful lot of routine 2 and you meet somebody back of north wallaby and hed say oh were having so much luck on sop goals esther spun last night and youd say what are you running oh we did long assessment on her twenty minutes and we finally decided her husband was what was her trouble so terminal was husband and it was by elimination we talked it over in the rest of the conference and we decided that was the only possible terminal so we ran husband on her and so forth and the next time we did an assessment for some reason or other the whole scale was live so we just started at the top and tried to run each one flat on the husband and you didnt give us all the data you know for sop goals and it doesnt work very good either but you give them this routine 2 and they go off like bunch of canary birds and they get wonderful results okay female voice yes sir male voice question on routine 2 yeah male voice the general assessment is that done purely on primary scale or do you carry carry it over to the secondary as well you can carry that on right on through to the deepest depths of the secondary all assessments can be done primary and secondary or just primary the worse off case is or the more clear they are the two extremes both have to have secondary runs on assessments second male voice do you ever switch from one routine to the other yes you sure do case isnt running very well on his goals terminal or his assessment or something shift into 2 be upsetting though to shift from 2 back to 1 because its invalidating make up your mind at the beginning if in doubt always run cchs if youre in doubt whether he should be running cchs or 2 run cchs that answer your question second male voice yes it does all right the more you shift changing your mind why the less sure you look and the less control youve got on the pc second male voice precise running of the cchs left right or right and left both hands then do you yeah and on your head and then theres cch 1x theres cch 1x thats good one thats good one pc gives you both of his socks i dont mean to make nothing out of your question but it brings up this humorous point ken it brings up this very humorous point that the more cchs i put out for various variations the less cch was run on the basics and actually the variations practically killed the cchs the variations did its just right hand man its always right hand youre not trying to clean this fellows life with the cch youre trying to improve his case so that he can get off his withholds you got it when youve got all his withholds off and hes totally responsible and hes clean as wolfs tooth hes going to be floating almost floating here on the needle anyhow when you finish this up you understand and hes going to be so free on the needle that you start doing an assessment and he starts blowing clear on the assessment you got the idea you wait till you see this youll realize why youre running it i apologize for making mock of your question yes female voice would scs still come in the cchs through the cchs there are scss in the cchs cch 1 2 3 4 there are only four of them that are valid now the scs does have high cch number but youve got to read your i see right now youve got to read your cchs from beginning to the end because there are only four of them and what was known as the cch routine is exactly precise routine consisting of four processes and thats the only cch routine we mean we mean other variations okay female voice yes thank you right all right okay any more questions all right thank you very much and thats it for tonight good night now end of lecture
