issues for congress updated september 23 2008 gary guenther analyst in business taxation and finance government and finance division the internal revenue services private tax debt collection initiative current status legislative proposals and issues for congress summary provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 gave the internal revenue service irs the authority to use private debt collection agencies pcas to assist in the collection of overdue individual taxes the irs has since launched private tax debt collection pdc initiative which could collect between 15 billion and 22 billion in gross revenue from 2007 through 2016 this report examines the design of the initiative and the policy issues it raises more specifically the report describes the scope of the irss authority to use pcas under the ajca reviews the steps the irs has taken to implement private collection initiative derived from this authority outlines the arguments that have been made for and against such an initiative and concludes with discussion of legislation in the 110th congress to modify the initiative the report will be updated to reflect significant new developments legislative or otherwise under section 6306 of the internal revenue code irc the irs may enter into contracts with pcas to assist in the collection of prescribed portion of individual tax debt under set of rules intended to protect the rights of taxpayers and the confidentiality of taxpayer information and to prevent abusive collection practices the irs may use pcas only to locate and contact taxpayers with an overdue tax liability who are not contesting it and to arrange for the payment of those taxes the pdc initiative has been source of controversy from the outset proponents say it is needed to help shrink large and growing inventory of delinquent individual tax debt that is eroding public trust in the fairness of the tax system and to free the irs to devote its collection resources to problems with larger potential payoffs although critics of the initiative agree that the current backlog of individual tax debt should be reduced they argue that the task of retiring the debt should be handled by properly trained irs agents not pca employees in their view the use of pcas is flawed approach for three reasons 1 the collection of taxes is an inherently governmental function 2 it would be more costeffective to hire and train additional irs agents to collect the overdue taxes and 3 pcas cannot be trusted to protect taxpayer rights and eschew abusive collection practices since the irs began to implement the pdc initiative congressional opponents have made repeated efforts to eliminate it in the 110th congress five bills that would repeal the irss authority to enter into contracts with pcas have been introduced hr 695 s 335 hr 3056 hr 3996 and hr 5719 while the house has passed three of them hr 3056 hr 3996 and hr 5719 the senate has not acted on two of them hr 3056 and hr 5719 and the enacted version of hr 3996 lacked provision terminating the pdc initiative in addition each of the bills providing funding for the irs in fy2009 approved by the house number yet assigned and

congress for many americans the collection of taxes is an inherent function of government1 according to this view collecting federal taxes owed by individuals and private firms should be the exclusive responsibility of federal agency like the internal revenue service irs this view appears rooted in federal law section 6301 of the internal revenue code irc states that the secretary of the treasury shall collect the taxes imposed by the internal revenue laws under the debt collection improvement act of 1996 dcia pl 10434 federal agencies may enter into contracts with private firms to collect all debts owed to the federal government except tax debts and the federal activities inventory reform act of 1998 fair pl 105270 prohibits federal agencies from contracting out functions deemed inherently governmental the act defines an inherently governmental activity as one that is so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government employees and that requires the exercise of discretion in the use of authority or the making of value judgments relating to monetary transactions and entitlements2 nonetheless at the urging of the bush administration congress granted the irs the authority to hire private debt collection agencies pcas to assist in the collection of individual tax debt through provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca pl 1083573 this grant of authority marked both the second time the 1 according to the results of national poll conducted by the global strategy group in october 2003 66 of respondents opposed plan unveiled earlier that year by the bush administration to use private debt collection companies to assist the irs in the collection of some delinquent individual tax debt the margin of error was plus or minus four percentage points see amy hamilton the fight over the irs hiring private debt collectors tax notes oct 20 2003 p 321 2 see 31 usc 501 3 the first documented case of the federal government outsourcing the collection of taxes occurred in 1872 when congress granted the irss predecessor the bureau of internal revenue the authority to hire more than three individuals to assist in discovering and collecting any money belonging to the united states the effort lasted until 1874 when it was terminated in response to the findings of an investigation conducted by the house ways and means committee the committee concluded that private tax collection contracts served useful purpose and undermined the existing apparatus of federal tax continued crs2 agency was permitted to hire pcas and the culmination of contentious debate in congress over the best way to reduce large and growing inventory of potentially collectible individual tax debt fueling the debate was proposal by the bush administration in its budget requests for fy2004 and fy2005 to allow the irs to use pcas to collect certain overdue individual taxes although the proposal attracted enough support in the 108th congress to be adopted it continues to serve as lightning rod for criticism congressional opponents have not ceased their efforts to curtail or repeal the irss authority to hire pcas the irss initial experience with pcas came in the form of pilot project known as the contracting out collection activities project authorized by the treasury postal service and general government appropriations act 1996 pl 10452 the project was supposed to last two years but the irs ended it after one year in response to mounting opposition from some members of congress and senior officials in the clinton administration this report examines irss current program for using pcas to collect delinquent individual taxes and the policy issues it raises more specifically it describes the scope of irss statutory authority to use pcas under the ajca summarizes the steps the irs has taken so far to implement this authority reviews the main arguments that have been raised for and against the irss private tax debt collection initiative and discusses legislation in the 110th congress that would modify the initiative the report concludes with brief discussion of possible policy issues for congress as it exercises its power to oversee the private debt collection initiative it will be updated to reflect new legislative activity and other significant developments irss statutory authority to use private debt collection agencies current law among other things the ajca added section 6306 to the internal revenue code irc as result the irs is permitted to hire pcas for the purpose of assisting with the collection of delinquent individual tax debt in manner that protects basic taxpayer rights avoids the use of abusive collection practices and takes into account federal laws governing the outsourcing of activities deemed inherently governmental current federal tax law considers an individual taxpayer delinquent if he or she fails to pay his or her taxes by the due date despite receiving notice from the irs about the amount owed irc section 6306 also lays down set of detailed guidelines for the use of pcas by the irs first and foremost the irs may use pcas for two narrowly specified 3 continued administration for more details on this effort see joseph j thorndike the unhappy history of private tax collection tax notes sept 20 2004 pp 13461349 crs3 purposes only 1 to locate and contact taxpayers with overdue tax liabilities who have unresolved disputes with the irs over the amount of taxes owed and 2 to arrange for payment of those taxes most of these taxpayers fit into one of two categories 1 those who have filed return indicating an amount due but have failed to pay the balance in full and 2 those who have been assessed an additional tax by the irs in its review of their returns and made several payments but have failed to pay the entire amount owed cases whose resolution requires the exercise of discretion by the irs mainly disputes over the interpretation of the tax code or the amount of tax assessed by the irs are to be handled by pcas the exercise of such judgment is considered an inherent function of government under federal law so any activity involving the exercise of discretion may not be outsourced second pcas awarded tax collection contracts must follow carefully prescribed procedure when contacting delinquent taxpayer their initial contact has to be in the form of letter reminding the individual of an overdue tax liability if his or her last known address is incorrect the pca is authorized to track down the correct address if the letter does not lead to prompt payment of the tax debt pca then may try to reach the taxpayer by telephone and request that he or she pay the balance immediately if taxpayer says that he or she cannot do so the pca can offer the taxpayer the option of paying off the tax debt through installment payments made over period of up to five years if the taxpayer does not agree to such payment plan the pca then may obtain certain financial information about the taxpayer and turn it over to the irs for further action once pca gathers this information it may have further contact with the taxpayer third employees of pcas are obliged to adhere to the same statutory code of ethics for collection that applies to irs employees but if taxpayer contacted by pca accuses it of acting unlawfully or abusively and sues for civil damages the irs cannot be held legally liable for the actions of the pca and if the irs determines that the actions of pca violate section 1203 of the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 rra98 which specifies the circumstances under which an irs employee can be fired for misconduct the agency may impose several penalties including revoking the firms tax collection contract and barring it from bidding on future contracts fourth pcas awarded tax collection contracts must also adhere to existing statutory protections of the rights of individual taxpayers with tax debts specifically the employees of pcas assigned to work on the contracts must understand and abide by the provisions of the fair debt collection practices act of 1996 fdcpa which prohibits the use of collection practices deemed unreasonably intrusive or abusive to debtors4 those same employees are also obligated to uphold the legal protections of taxpayer rights and privacy in the same manner as irs employees this requirement means that pca employees are as subject to civil and criminal penalties for the unlawful disclosure of taxpayer information under irc section 6103 as irs employees are it also means that pcas must inform the taxpayers they contact of 4 for example pcas would not be allowed to communicate with taxpayers at unusual or inconvenient times or places and would be barred from harassing or threatening taxpayers crs4 their right to seek assistance from the irs national taxpayer advocate whose rulings under irc section 7811 apply with equal force to pca and irs employees fifth pca may not hire subcontractors to contact taxpayers provide quality assurance services or write debt collection notices if pca wishes to hire subcontractor for another purpose connected to its obligations under tax debt collection contract it must first obtain the approval of the irs sixth all revenue collected through the efforts of pcas has to go into revolving fund pcas are not allowed to receive or process any of this money only the irs can do so the irs may use up to 25 of the money in the fund to compensate pcas for their services though irc section 6306 offers guidance on the factors the irs should consider in compensating pca for its services in addition the irs may transfer up to 25 of the revenue in the revolving fund to its budget for tax law enforcement irss current authority to use pcas comes with at least one notable string attached periodic congressional review of the results of the private tax debt collection initiative under the ajca the irs must submit report every other year beginning in 2005 to the house ways and means and senate finance committees assessing various aspects of the initiative including its overall costs and benefits its impact on irs enforcement staffing levels its impact on the inventory of overdue tax assessments the amount of revenue collected the performance of contractors and the effectiveness of the collection techniques used by pcas5 previous law before the enactment of the ajca the irs lacked the authority to hire private companies to assist in the collection of overdue taxes with one notable but short lived exception see below since 1954 the federal tax code has made it clear that only the irs is authorized to collect taxes under irc section 6301 only officers employees and agencies of the treasury department may collect taxes imposed by the internal revenue laws this restriction on tax collection authority was included in the debt collection improvement act of 1996 dcia pl 104134 which permitted all federal agencies except the irs to enter into contracts with pcas to collect overdue debts owed to the federal government reinforcing the prohibition on the outsourcing of federal tax collection were several provisions of the federal activities inventory reform act of 1998 fair act the act barred federal agencies from hiring the private sector to conduct activities regarded as inherently governmental according to section 5 of the act an activity is considered inherently governmental if it is so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government employees and if it entails the exercise of discretion in applying 5 according to an email message received from june mchenry of irs on nov 21 2007 the initial report is likely to be submitted to the committees by december 31 2007 crs5 governmental authority or the making of value judgments relating to monetary transactions and entitlements6 the shortlived exception occurred in 1996 and 1997 when congress gave the irs the authority to establish and manage pilot project involving the use of pcas in the appropriations bills for the treasury department enacted for both fy1996 and fy1997 congress authorized the irs to spend up to 13 million each year to experiment with the use of pcas in the collection of delinquent individual taxes in response to the mandate the irs set up program under which the pcas it hired assisted irs collection staff by locating and contacting individual taxpayers to remind them of their overdue tax liabilities and inform them of payment options taxpayers who agreed to payment plan were referred to someone in irss collection division to arrange payment schedule only irs employees could collect funds to settle delinquent accounts pcas received fixed fee for their services regardless of the amount of overdue taxes collected dissatisfaction with the results of the program among some in congress and within the clinton administration led the irs to cancel it in 1997 these results and the main factors behind them were examined in report issued by the general accounting office gao in july 19977 according to the gao through the end of january 1997 pcas had contacted 14000 out of 153000 targeted taxpayers and collected 31 million in overdue taxes but the total cost of the program exceeded the total amount collected through january 1997 expenditures for the design start up and administration of the program came to 31 million about 10 million had been paid to pcas for their services and the estimated opportunity cost of using irs collection staff to assist with the pilot program instead of using them to collect taxes was 17 million gao blamed the failure of the program to live up to initial expectations on the limitations imposed on the work pcas were allowed to undertake the number and types of cases referred to pcas and repeated problems in using irss computer system to identify select and transmit collection cases to pcas legislative history of irss current authority irss current authority to outsource tax debt collection has its origins in the bush administrations budget requests for the irs in both fy2004 and fy2005 each request included proposal to allow the irs to hire pcas to help reduce swelling inventory of overdue but potentially collectible individual taxes8 under the proposal the use of pcas was to be limited to locating individual taxpayers with overdue tax liabilities who were not contesting their tax assessments 6 31 usc 501 7 us general accounting office issues affecting irs collection pilot ggd97129r washington july 18 1997 8 for summary of the administrations proposal see amy hamilton bush proposes private agencies collect known tax delinquencies tax notes feb 10 2003 pp 885 887 crs6 contacting them to request full and immediate payment of these debts offering the option of paying in installments over three years if full payment could not be made immediately and obtaining needed financial information about the taxpayer and transmitting it to the irs if such agreement could be reached pcas were to be assigned cases that were likely to be resolved with one or two phone calls and required exercise of discretion by the irs most of these cases were to focus on taxpayers who had filed tax returns showing that taxes were owed but had not been paid or who made three or more payments against an added tax assessment by the irs but had stopped the payments without paying the full amount all revenue collected through the activities of pcas was to be funneled into revolving fund from which they were to be compensated for their services compensation was to be based mainly on the quality of service provided taxpayer satisfaction and case resolution employees of pcas were to be subject to the same rules protecting basic taxpayer rights and the confidentiality of taxpayer information that applied to irs employees taxpayers who believed their rights had been violated by the actions of pca could sue the company for civil damages but the irs could not be held liable for any illegal act committed by pca employee in asking congress to give the irs the authority to use pcas for tax debt collection the bush administration was addressing at least two key policy issues one was the rising amount of delinquent individual income tax debt and the concern that it would erode public confidence in the basic fairness of the federal income tax system and the ability of the irs to ensure that each taxpayer pays the tax he or she owes in timely manner in testimony at hearing held by the house ways and means subcommittee on oversight on may 13 2003 irs commissioner mark w everson stated that the amount of individual income tax debt deemed uncollectible by the irs because of shifting enforcement priorities increased from about 7 billion in early 2000 to over 13 billion in early 2003 these uncollected taxes represent small part of the estimated gross federal tax gap which is the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid voluntarily in timely manner before enforcement activity by the irs9 second policy issue was the declining capacity of the irs to address the growing inventory of delinquent individual tax debt from fy1996 through fy2003 the number of irs revenue officers responsible for handling delinquent accounts fell from about 5500 to about 3500 decrease of 36 irs officials attributed the decline to an increase in the workload in other essential operations eg processing returns issuing refunds and responding to mail from taxpayers dramatic shift in the strategic focus of the irs away from enforcement and toward taxpayer service and support increases in operating costs eg rent mail and wages not covered by appropriated funds and congressional opposition to the bush administrations repeated requests for larger budgets for tax collection10 the decline in collection 9 the most recent irs estimate of the gross tax gap is 345 billion in fy2001 irs enforcement actions and late tax payments recovered about 55 billion of that amount leaving net tax gap of 290 billion for more information on the federal tax gap see crs report rl33882 tax gap and tax enforcement by james m bickley 10 us general accounting office tax debt collection irs is addressing critical success continued crs7 staff widened the gap between the number of cases assigned for collection and the number of cases closed each year so that by may 2003 the irs was deferring action on one of every three collection cases11 in bid to address both issues at once the bush administration proposed that more resources be channeled into tax law enforcement but congress did not provide the requested funding for instance the administration asked congress to appropriate 3881 billion for tax compliance services in fy2003 so that the irs could expand its fulltime compliance workforce to 45959 persons congress ended up approving budget for tax compliance services of 3623 billion which meant that the irs was able to hire 1569 fewer compliance services agents than it had requested faced with the prospect of continued growth in the inventory of potentially collectible tax debt senior irs officials led by irs commissioner mark everson elected to gain congressional assent for plan to outsource some of the collection work to the private sector several legislative initiatives in the 108th congress sought to implement the main elements of the administrations proposal specifically hr 1169 hr 2896 s 2 and s 1637 contained provisions that would have given the irs the authority to hire pcas to assist with the collection of individual tax debt under the guidelines laid down in the proposal the ajca emerged from the conference report hrept 108755 on hr 4520 approved by the house and senate on the issue of whether the irs should be allowed to enter into tax collection contracts with private firms the report combined elements from the housepassed version of the bill which included the provision on pcas from hr 2896 and the senatepassed version which included the provision on pcas from s 1637 steps taken by the irs to implement private tax debt collection initiative 2004 and earlier the irs began to lay the foundation for its current private tax debt collection initiative late in 2001 about three years before it gained the authority to undertake such an initiative central objective of the planning effort was to agree on an approach that would collect substantial amount of overdue individual taxes without repeating the main mistakes that led to the demise of the 1996 pilot project pca project team was formed within the irs in october 2001 one of its first activities was to meet with representatives from the revenue agencies of five 10 continued factors for contracting out but will need to study the best use of resources gao04492 washington may 2004 p 5 11 ibid p 5 crs8 state governments and two federal agencies with extensive experience in administering private debt collection programs12 among the issues explored by the team were the structure and management of contracts for the private collection of public debts data security compensation arrangements and the protection of taxpayer rights the team also met with representatives from three pcas five times between may and october 2002 to discuss variety of issues related to collection case management including case screening criteria electronic data sharing capabilities data security requirements and potential compensation schemes in clear signal the irs was ready to move forward with plan for tax debt collection involving the use of pcas the agency issued in february 2003 request for quotation rfq for its emerging plan to hire pcas13 the rfqs primary purpose was to promote awareness among prospective contractors of the irss intention to enter into contracts with pcas for tax debt collection and to solicit feedback from pcas on the requirements that should be included in those contracts in may 2004 the gao issued report assessing the irss readiness to implement plan for using pcas like the one proposed by the bush administration gao made the assessment largely on the basis of what it called the five broad factors that are critical to the success of proposed program for contracting with pcas to collect tax debt14 one factor concerned the goals for the program second addressed the resources needed by the irs to achieve those goals third focused on the nature of the work to be assigned to pcas fourth dealt with the protection of taxpayer rights and privacy and the fifth stressed the importance of monitoring the performance of pcas and periodically comparing the results and costs of the program with its main goals the report concluded that though the irs had taken some steps to address each of the factors more work needed to be done before the agency could be deemed prepared to begin assigning collection cases to pcas 2005 with the passage of the ajca in late 2004 the irs shifted its focus from devising plan to outsource the collection of certain individual tax debt to implementing the guidelines for such plan set forth in the act 12 department of the treasury treasury inspector general for tax administration efforts to develop successful collection contract support program could be enhanced audit report 200330075 washington march 2003 p 2 13 generally request for quotation rfq is method used by federal agencies to describe to prospective contractors the products and services that may be purchased and the terms and conditions that would apply rfqs serve the useful purpose of informing the private sector about the procurement needs of federal agencies and informing federal agencies about the depth of interest in the private sector in bidding on specific contracts response by prospective contractor to rfq is not considered an offer and thus cannot be accepted by federal agency as binding contract each rfq has unique identifying number the rfq issued by the irs in february 2003 was tirno03h0001 14 us general accounting office report gao04492 p 9 crs9 initial request for quotes rfq on april 27 2005 the agency issued an rfq tirno05q00050 to solicit bids for contracts to assist with the collection of specified delinquent tax debt in the document the irs announced it would implement such an undertaking in two stages limited implementation in fy2005 followed by full implementation in fy2007 in the first stage the irs would enter into contracts with approximately three pcas to be eligible to bid on contract firm had to be registered as debt collection agency with the general services administration gsa and current supplier of debt collection services to federal agency under gsa schedule 5204 only 23 of the 87 pcas authorized by the gsa to perform debt collection for federal agencies as of early 2005 met these criteria in addition all employees of contractors and subcontractors had to be us citizens or permanent resident aliens each of the contracts would last 12 months and could be extended up to six months as many as three times firms interested in bidding for the three initial contracts had to provide the irs with details on their past performance pricing licenses and bonding applications were due by 1230 pm on june 1 2005 in late may 2005 irs changed the application deadline to june 7 2005 and said it would award the three contracts by the end of july 2005 and start the initial phase of the collection work in january 2006 the rfq covered many issues including the rules governing the collection work to be done by pcas and the compensation of contractors basically pcas with contracts would be assigned collection cases involving individual taxpayers who filed tax forms 1040 1040a or 1040ez owed 25000 or less in assessed taxes and were not contesting their tax liabilities only tax debt that was overdue minimum of 30 days but more than four years before the expiration of the 10year statute of limitations on the collection of federal tax debt could be assigned to pca according to the rfq as of december 2004 the irs had classified 77 billion in delinquent tax debt as potentially available for the limited implementation of private debt collection nearly 55 billion of this amount was considered lowpriority work load that would likely be eligible for placement with pcas the irs anticipated assigning about 100000 delinquent accounts to pcas in the first year of the initiative all collection work would be performed in the united states and none of the taxpayer information could be transmitted outside the united states through the contractors computer systems pcas were required to comply with all laws protecting basic taxpayer rights and the confidentiality of taxpayer information for each collection case assigned to it pca would be given the following information the taxpayers name telephone number home address the tax year in question and the amount due pca employees working on assigned cases had to be us citizens or permanent resident aliens and to pass background investigation conducted by the irs in addition these employees would have to undergo training on irs security collection and privacy policies and the penalties under irc sections 7213 7213a and 7431 for the unauthorized disclosure or use of tax return information and they would have to certify in writing that they received such instruction crs10 the irs would take several steps to ensure that pcas were complying with the terms of their collection contracts all letters sent by contractors to delinquent taxpayers had to be approved in advance by the irs and the irs reserved the right to monitor telephone conversations between contractors and taxpayers in addition pcas were required to grant the irs full free and uninhibited access to all facilities owned by the contractors so the agency could verify that contractors were taking all necessary and appropriate measures to protect the rights of taxpayers and the confidentiality of taxpayer information pcas would be paid share of the delinquent tax debt they collect compensation would range from 24 of collections totaling less than 1500 to 21 for collections exceeding 10000 in addition the compensation would cover only payments received from delinquent taxpayers 11 or more days after an account is transferred to pca and later than 10 days after the account is returned to the irs contractors that were the target of repeated complaints from taxpayers could lose some or all of the compensation they are owed legal challenge to initial rfq the solicitation of bids under the april rfq came to an abrupt halt on june 6 2005 when pca based in houston texas universal fidelity lp filed lawsuit in the us court of federal claims challenging the legality and fairness of the procedure used by the irs to award the three contracts for the initial phase of the private tax debt collection initiative15 universal fidelity was one of the 87 contractors approved by the gsa for debt collection under schedule 5204 but it was not allowed to bid for contract with the irs because the company was not performing debt collection for federal agency under current work order the lawsuit universal fidelity lp v united states fed cl 05602c charged that the irss solicitation of bids violated the competition in contracting act of 1984 in two ways 1 by setting conditions that were arbitrary capricious and unduly restrictive and 2 by unfairly excluding firms that could meet the agencys minimum requirements it asked the court to issue temporary and permanent injunctions preventing the irs from awarding contracts under the rfq in its response to the lawsuit the irs argued that hiring only contractors with active federal work orders had several key advantages such an approach would shorten the time required to begin the first phase of the debt collection initiative it would also avoid many of the problems that could arise from unfamiliarity with the laws and regulations governing the use of pcas in the public sector and lack of compatibility between information systems used by the contractors and the systems used by the irs finally limiting the field of potential contractors to those with active work orders would increase the irss chances of achieving its shortterm objective of collecting minimum of 4 million in revenue in fy2006 through the use of pcas 25 of which would be transferred to the irss budget for enforcement activities 15 alison bennett universal fidelity sues irs over debt collection initiative daily report for executives bureau of national affairs july 18 2005 p g10 crs11 the judge presiding over the case issued temporary ruling on july 25 2005 barring the irs from proceeding with its original bid solicitation and requiring the agency to open the bidding to all 87 contractors approved by the gsa for debt collection work16 in his ruling the judge noted that excluding contractors without current work orders irrespective of their experience or ability is arbitrary and capricious in the circumstances presented he also noted that the irs could achieve its aims more fairly and efficiently by other means including other mandatory minimum requirements the ruling was not final as the judge wanted to give the irs an opportunity to make alternative plans and to take appropriate actions in prompt and efficient manner on july 29 the irs announced that it would abide by the judges ruling in report it filed with the court and on august 4 it cancelled the contested rfq in midaugust 2005 the irs asked the judge to dismiss universal fidelitys lawsuit on the grounds that the agencys decision to change its bid solicitation to bring it into compliance with the judges ruling rendered the suit invalid the judge concurred with the irs in ruling issued on september 28 and dismissed the case in his view the underlying controversy had been resolved17 at the same time he allowed universal fidelity to file motion to reopen the case if it were to find that the irss revised bid solicitation raised the same concerns as the earlier one revised rfq following up on its agreement to abide by the judges ruling in the universal fidelity lawsuit the irs issued new rfq for the first phase of its tax debt collection initiative on october 14 2005 the document reiterated the agencys intention to hire three pcas to assist in the collection of certain delinquent individual tax debt starting in early 2006 it also stated that the irs would award the contracts in february 2006 and launch the first phase of the collection program the following june assuming significant problems arose all firms approved by the gsa to undertake debt collection work for federal agencies under federal supply schedule 5204 were eligible to submit bids which meant that firms eligibility would longer depend on whether it had current work order with federal agency for debt collection the contracts were to cover one year with an option to extend them another year an important consideration in awarding the contracts would be bidders relevant experience in performing debt collection work to quote from the rfq vendors experience should demonstrate wide variety of collection experience on nationwide basis and should also demonstrate level of accomplishment in competitive environment18 most of the remaining terms of the rfq were identical to the terms of the one issued in april 2005 including the compensation of contractors if there 16 diane freda federal judge says he will stop debt collection initiative as planned daily report for executives bureau of national affairs july 28

government agencies cbe and pioneer both had received satisfactory ratings from the better business bureau and then had current contracts with the us department of education to collect delinquent student loan debt19 linebarger goggan had gsa contract to offer collection services to federal agencies under the terms of their contracts the three firms could be assigned collection cases totaling 750 million in delinquent individual tax debt during the first year of the contract legal challenge to initial contract awards in midmarch two of the unsuccessful bidders diversified collection services and gc services filed separate formal protests with the gao over the method used by the irs to evaluate the bids according to news reports the two firms accused the agency of evaluating the 33 bids it received on the basis of criteria that were inconsistent with the rfq issued in october 200520 by law the gao had up to 100 days or until june 26 to issue ruling in the case in deciding whether to deny or uphold protests involving bids on federal procurement contracts the agency normally considers the relevant parts of the competition in contracting act and federal regulations on procurement under federal law the irs had to suspend implementation of the contracts while the protests were being adjudicated the cbe group became party to one of the protests in late march giving it access to all documents filed in the case in assessing the merits of the protests the gao decided to combine the two cases into one on june 14 it denied the protest filed by gc services because it found evidence to support the charge that the irs evaluated the bids unfairly in the view of some analysts the agencys ruling reaffirmed the belief that protesters disagreement with an agencys judgment or evaluation does not mean that such judgment or evaluation is unreasonable or unfair21 as result of the ruling the irs was free to resume implementation of the first phase of the tax debt

of those 158000 accounts was expected to total between 616 million and 1 billion during the first phase of the initiative which is to extend from september 2006 through december 2007 the irs estimated that the three contractors could collect from 56 million and 92 million in delinquent tax revenue at cost of 61 million including the salaries of irs staff and the cost of new information systems22 to mark the start of the first phase of the private tax debt collection initiative the irs issued two publications offering detailed information on how the initiative was supposed to operate in its first year and the steps being taken by the irs to safeguard taxpayer rights and the confidentiality of taxpayer information one publication was brochure intended to answer basic questions about the initiative for taxpayers contacted by pca23 the second publication announcement 200663 appeared in internal revenue bulletin 200637 which was released on september 11 200624 basically it summarized the functions served by pcas the limits on their activities and the steps the irs was taking to monitor their compliance with the terms of their tax debt collection contracts more specifically the publication offered the following information about the initiative irc section 6303 limits the role of pcas to locating and contacting taxpayers identified by the irs about tax debts specified by the irs requesting payment of the overdue taxes either in lump sum or in installments over period of not more than five years and obtaining financial information specified by the irs pcas must get the approval of the irs for any installment agreement covering total payment of over 25000 and period of more than 36 months in trying to obtain financial information about taxpayer pcas may access nonirs computer databases or websites but pca employees may not call or write to third party such as the taxpayers employer bank or neighbors to inquire about the taxpayers finances 22 us government

the irs only for the limited time period specified in their contract with the irs pcas and their employees may not use any information obtained about taxpayer in the course of working on the contract with the irs for any purpose other than working on the contract pcas and their employees must adhere to all protections of taxpayer rights in the collection of taxes to the same extent that irs employees do pcas may be sued by the taxpayer under irc section 7433a if they fail to observe any of these protections pcas must comply with the provisions of the fdcpa and they have special immunity from prosecution for violations of these provisions while working for the irs pcas are as subject to taxpayer assistance orders issued by the national taxpayer advocate as the irs pca employees may not contact taxpayer at any unusual time or place without taxpayers prior consent contacts can be made earlier than 800 am or later than 900 pm at the taxpayers location pcas may not undertake enforcement action eg filing lien issuing levy seizing property or commencing legal action against taxpayer the irs has created special unit to monitor and oversee all pca operations related to contracts with the irs it also has trained key personnel in each pca about taxpayer rights and irs procedures and provided each pca with videos instructional materials and operational handbooks pcas must keep records of all incoming and outgoing calls with taxpayers and make them available to the irs which will randomly crs15 monitor pca calls to assure that taxpayers are treated fairly and professionally taxpayers may contact pca or the irs to complain about the conduct of any pca employee if the irs receives such complaint it will direct the pca to suspend collection activity on the account until the pca and irs have evaluated the complaint 2007 the irs announced on february 16 that it would extend the collection contracts awarded pioneer credit recovery and the cbe group for another year through march 2008 but that it would not renew the contract of linebarger goggan blair sampson llp all three firms received oneyear collection contracts on march 9 2006 for the next phase of the program which may begin sometime in 2008 the irs hopes to rebid all contracts and add as many as 12 contractors25 in late march the treasury departments inspector general for tax administration tigta issued report evaluating the irss implementation of the private tax debt collection initiative it concluded that the irs effectively developed and implemented several aspects of the program thus providing better assurance that taxpayer rights are protected and federal tax information is secure26 at the same time the report criticized the agencys handling of certain computer security issues and its failure to update procedure guides and the application used to calculate projected revenue about one month later the irs briefed the irs oversight board about the steps the agency had taken to implement the initiative in document distributed at the briefing the irs noted that the return on investment roi for the initiative in fy2007 was likely to fall somewhere between 32 and 36 for each dollar collected the estimate was derived from comparison of projected gross revenue with the operating costs for the initiative27 by contrast roi resulting from irs enforcement programs ranges from 3 to 14 for every additional 1 invested tigta released another report on the private tax debt collection initiative in late december this one focused on the fees paid to contractors from april 2006

after tigta released its report the national taxpayer advocate nina olson issued her annual report to congress29 in it she identified the irs private tax debt collection program as one of the most serious problems encountered by taxpayers in olsons view the program is failing in most respects specifically according to olson it is not meeting revenue projections it is not more successful than irs employees in finding delinquent taxpayers and it is less successful than irs employees in resolving delinquent accounts perhaps the biggest concern cited by olson was that the irs has placed the interests of the pcas above the interests of taxpayers and tax administration by failing to require the pcas to disclose training materials scripts letters and operational plans relating to taxpayer contact she charged that such lack of transparency is formula for compromising taxpayers rights these concerns about the program prompted olson to again call for its repeal30 2008 in its budget documents for fy2008 the irs noted that it expected to spend 765 million to administer the private tax debt collection initiative that year it also predicted that the initiative would lead to the collection of 23 million in gross revenue in the same year and that net revenue could total 11 million after allowing for commissions paid to pcas and the direct costs of operating the program on march 3 the irs renewed the contracts for another year of the two contractors that have been involved in the collection effort since the beginning pioneer credit recovery inc and cbe group inc it is unclear if the irs will expand the program later in 2008 as it said it would at the outset of the program from the start of the collection effort through august 23 2008 156730 delinquent taxpayer accounts had been placed with the three original contractors31 these accounts involved 278314 separate collection cases total payments on these accounts since the start of the initiative amounted to 499 million as of august 14 2008 from these funds the irs had paid 109 million in compensation to the three contractors leaving net revenue of 39 million 28 treasury inspector general for tax

crs17 main arguments for and against the initiative although the irs now has the authority to hire pcas to assist in the collection of selected delinquent taxes and says it is midway through the first phase of implementing its private tax debt collection initiative recent developments affecting the initiative indicate that the debate over the use of pcas to collect federal tax debt continues unabated congressional opponents of the initiative seem as determined as ever to shut it down proponents and opponents of the irss private tax debt collection initiative agree that the expanding inventory of potentially collectible taxes is serious policy problem that needs to be remedied as of september 2005 135 billion in individual income tax debt including accrued interest and penalties was considered uncollectible because the irs lacked sufficient resources to work on the delinquent accounts five years earlier that debt totaled about 90 billion32 key factor behind this growth was significant rise in the workload of the average irs enforcement agent from 1996 to 2003 the number of irs agents engaged in enforcement activities decreased by 26 while the volume of individual tax returns increased by 12 both sides in the debate worry that unchecked expansion of this inventory will erode taxpayer compliance leading to increases in the federal tax gap where the two sides have differed is on the question of how best to solve this problem proponents have favored outsourcing the collection of significant portion of that inventory whereas opponents have insisted on hiring more fulltime irs collection agents to do the job four issues have come to dominate the debate over whether the irs should be allowed to continue with its initiative to outsource the collection of certain delinquent individual income taxes 1 the legality of irss private tax debt collection initiative 2 the protection of taxpayer rights and the confidentiality of taxpayer information 3 the prevention of abusive treatment of taxpayers by pcas and 4 the costeffectiveness of hiring pcas to collect the overdue taxes relative to the alternative of hiring more irs collection agents do so not surprisingly proponents and opponents hold differing views on each of them legality of outsourcing federal tax collection one key issue in the debate over whether to allow the irs to continue outsourcing some of the collection of overdue taxes has been the legality of such step of particular concern has been the question of whether the collection of taxes is an activity that should be considered inherently governmental as noted earlier the fair act bars federal agencies from outsourcing activities deemed inherently governmental under the act an inherently governmental activity is defined as one that is so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government employees the act established two tests for determining if an activity meets this standard one involved the exercise of discretion in using 32 based on data obtained in an email message from floyd williams of the irs on dec 14 2005 crs18 governmental power and the other the making of value judgments relating to monetary transactions and entitlements opponents of the irss private tax debt collection initiative led by the national treasury employees union the national taxpayer advocate the tax executives institute and some consumer advocacy groups contend that the collection of taxes is an inherent function of government and thus should not be delegated to the private sector under any circumstances in their view such stance is both reasonable and defensible because it rests on solid foundation of legal precedent of particular relevance say opponents are irc section 6301 and certain of the provisions of dcia and fair all of which limit the exercise of the power to collect taxes to the irs they maintain that it is hard to conceive of an activity that is more intimately related to the public interest than the collection of taxes to underscore that point some opponents claim that because taxpayer views his or her tax collection case as easy irs employees not pca employees should be the ones to interact with the taxpayer33 proponents of the initiative seem to take more nuanced view of the issue they claim that the initiative has been crafted to avoid running afoul of any of the federal statutes prohibiting the collection of taxes on the grounds that it is an inherently governmental activity under current tax collection contracts pcas are assigned only those cases where the taxpayer is not contesting the tax liability in the view of proponents such cases involve exercise of discretion over the enforcement of tax law and therefore do not violate any statutory ban on the outsourcing of inherently governmental activities by contrast say proponents cases involving disputes between taxpayers and the irs over the interpretation of the tax code or the amount of tax owed do require the exercise of discretion and thus should be handled only by qualified irs employees under the initiative such cases are handled by the irs protection of taxpayer rights second key issue in the debate over the desirability of the irs initiative has been the protection of taxpayer rights including the confidentiality of taxpayer information under current federal law taxpayers have many statutory rights including the right to be adequately informed of their obligations options and rights the right to enlist the services of the taxpayer advocate in resolving disputes with the irs the right to be treated fairly and courteously by irs employees the right to appeal irs judgments and the right to privacy and confidentiality in all dealings with the irs irs employees who interact with taxpayers undergo special training to ensure they understand these rights and uphold them in their dealings with taxpayers employees who violate any taxpayer rights are subject to variety of punishments including loss of job opponents of the irss initiative say that the statutory rights of taxpayers and the confidentiality of taxpayer information are at risk of being violated egregiously 33 see prepared statement of nina olson the national taxpayer advocate for hearing by the ways and means committee on may 22 2007 crs19 under the initiative for them this is risk not worth taking some of this concern springs from an expectation that pca employees involved in contacting taxpayers will not receive the same training in taxpayer rights as irs employees opponents also think the irs cannot be counted on to provide the degree of oversight needed to ensure that pcas are taking all required steps under their collection contracts to safeguard these rights such skepticism is warranted in their view because of certain welldocumented episodes of lax irs oversight of contractors in recent years specifically opponents cite numerous alleged violations of the fdcpa by some of the pcas participating in the pilot tax debt collection initiative launched by the irs in 1996 and terminated in 1997 and the failure of the irs to cancel the contracts of the firms found in violation of the act even though it had the authority to do so34 they also point to one of the main findings of 2004 report on irss oversight of its contractors by the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta tigta found there was an elevated risk of unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer information and the spread of computer viruses in the irss information systems in 2003 because the agency allowed four contractors to have unsupervised access to its computer systems35 in addition opponents argue the initiative carries an unacceptably high risk of the wrongful disclosure of taxpayer information the statute granting the irs the authority to hire pcas irc section 6306 places restrictions on the taxpayer information that may be released to pcas if proper restrictions and strict enforcement mechanism are not put in place opponents worry that pca employees assigned to collect tax debt for the irs could share confidential taxpayer information with individuals who could use it for criminal purposes such as identity theft proponents agree that protection of taxpayer rights should be central concern of any effort to use pcas to collect overdue individual taxes but they maintain the safeguards built into the collection contracts signed by pcas and the steps being taken by the irs to monitor their adherence to these safeguards should be sufficient to prevent serious violations of these rights and the confidentiality of taxpayer information for example all pca employees assigned to work on an irs collection contract must pass background investigation and undergo training on taxpayer rights conducted by the irs before they receive confidential taxpayer information contractors must also provide secure facilities and equipment that can be used by authorized irs and pcs employees only and contractors are allowed to receive 34 according to colleen m kelley of the nteu contractors for the 1996 pilot project in using pcas managed by the irs violated the fdcpa and did not protect the security of sensitive taxpayer information she also has said that an irs internal audit report found that contractors made hundreds of calls to taxpayers outside of the time restrictions of the fdcpa and calls were placed as early as 419 am see house ways and means subcommittee on oversight use of private collection agencies to improve irs debt collection p 30 35 allen kenney irs needs tighter control of contractors tigta finds tax notes june 28 2004 p 1579 crs20 only limited information about the delinquent accounts they handle they are not given copies of actual tax returns36 in addition proponents note that the irs is devoting considerable resources to enforcing compliance with the collection contracts among the steps the agency is taking to oversee the collection actions of pcas are live monitoring of telephone conversations between pca employees and the taxpayers they contact review of recorded conversations surveys of taxpayers contacted by pca employees audits of the financial records of contractors and periodic reviews of their performance37 prevention of abusive and illegal collection practices another prominent issue in the debate over whether the irss authority to outsource tax collection under the terms of irc section 6306 should be revoked is the prevention of abusive and illegal collection practices by pcas these practices are concern largely because many americans with debts have had unpleasant experiences with thirdparty debt collectors in 2006 the federal trade commission ftc received 69204 complaints from consumers alleging that pcas were engaging in activities forbidden by the fdcpa or 199 of all complaints related to the act in 2005 pcas were the target of 191 of all consumer complaints received by the ftc38 in general the fdcpa prohibits deceptive unfair and abusive practices by thirdparty debt collectors the leading complaints about such collectors in 2006 were that they demanded larger payment than was permitted by law 403 of complaints filed with the ftc against debt collectors harassed the debtor or others 212 of complaints threatened dire consequences for failing to pay the outstanding debt 84 of complaints and made impermissible calls to consumers place of employment 58 of complaints39 opponents of the irss initiative argue that it paves the way for illegal and abusive collection practices by pcas in their view major cause for concern is the method for compensating pcas paying pcas with collection contracts by giving them 21 to 24 of the revenues collected through their contacts with delinquent taxpayers say opponents is likely to encourage them to resort to harassment and other unreasonable or unlawful collection practices in bid to maximize their earnings from the contracts they also contend that the pca compensation plan is blatantly inconsistent with section 1204 of the rra98 which effectively bars irs management from basing the compensation paid to enforcement agents in whole or 36 jeffrey b tate debt and taxes look at the irs private debt collection program tax notes aug 13 2007 p 590 37 see the testimony of kevin m brown former irs acting commissioner before the

annual report 2007 fair debt collection practices act washington 2007 pp 45 crs21 in part on the amount of unpaid taxes they collect from delinquent taxpayers40 this provision of the act is intended to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers opponents maintain that the method of compensating pcas increases the chances they will treat taxpayers unfairly if not abusively proponents counter that these concerns are exaggerated and without merit they contend the initiative contains adequate safeguards against abusive and illegal collection practices of particular importance in their view is the provision in each collection contract stipulating that pca employees are as subject to the provisions of the fdcpa as are irs employees as result the contracts specify that pca employees may not contact taxpayer at an unusual time or place or at time and place that would be inconvenient for the taxpayer may not contact taxpayer at work unless he or she explicitly authorizes such an action in advance may not contact taxpayer if the irs or the taxpayer has told the pca that the taxpayer has an authorized representative may not engage in conduct that is harassing oppressive or abusive and may not visit taxpayer41 furthermore say proponents the irs is devoting considerable resources to ensuring that contractors do not violate any of these restrictions of their interaction with taxpayers in fy2007 45 fulltime equivalent irs employees were involved in overseeing the performance of the three pcas with contracts including their adherence to the terms of their contracts proponents claim this level of oversight should be sufficient to prevent contractors from engaging in abusive and illegal collection practices costeffectiveness of the private tax debt collection initiative another key issue in the ongoing debate over the desirability of the irss initiative is its costeffectiveness the focus of concern here is the comparative costs and benefits of the initiative and the principal alternative favored by opponents hiring additional irs enforcement agents to collect the targeted individual tax debt spending on tax collection is akin to an investment in that it generates return in the form of added revenue so one could say that the most costeffective approach to collecting overdue taxes would be the one that produces the greatest return on investment as measured by the revenue collected per dollar of spending on collection few would deny that it is in the interest of the federal government and us taxpayers for the irs to take the most costeffective approach yet it can be difficult to determine which approach is most costeffective because of the complex considerations that enter into estimating the costs and benefits of all possible approaches case in point is the revenue collected by pcas under existing collection contracts up to 25 of the revenue can be used to pay pcas for their services and another 25 goes to the irs to bolster its spending on tax law 40 section 1204a of rra98 states that the internal revenue service shall not use records of tax enforcement results 1 to evaluate employees or 2 to impose or suggest production quotas or goals with respect to such employees 41 see testimony of kevin m brown before the ways and means committee on may 23 2007 crs22 enforcement should that 50 or so of the revenue be considered cost or benefit from the initiative or both opponents contend the initiative should be jettisoned because it is not as cost effective as the alternative of giving the irs the needed resources to collect the same delinquent individual tax debt they cite several studies to substantiate their claim in testimony given at hearing held by the house ways and means subcommittee on oversight in may 2003 colleen kelley the national president of the nteu noted that hiring pcas to collect this debt within the guidelines of the bush administrations proposal could be expected to collect 3 in revenue for each 1 paid to pcas for their services but that hiring additional irs enforcement agents for the same purpose would eventually collect as much as 31 in revenue for each 1 spent on wages and benefits for the new staff42 more recent analysis of the cost effectiveness of both options by analysts at the taxpayer advocate service estimated that the irs could have collected 14 billion in delinquent individual tax debt instead of the 195 million in gross revenue collected through the initiative as of april 28 2007 if the agency had spent the 71 million it expected to incur in startup and operating costs for the initiative in fy2007 on the agencys automated collection system43 opponents also point out that the irs has admitted it would be more costeffective to scrap the initiative and instead hire additional agents to collect the overdue taxes replying to question from representative steven rothman during congressional hearing in march 2006 thenirs commissioner mark everson affirmed that it would cost more to use pcas to collect delinquent individual tax debt than to hire additional irs employees for the same purpose44 proponents while conceding the initiative may be less costeffective than using irs employees argue that it should be continued for several reasons related to its expected costs and benefits first they note that congress has been unwilling to give the irs the funds it would need to hire and train additional employees to collect the tax debt targeted by the initiative so if the initiative were terminated today say proponents the tax debt would probably go uncollected because the funds the irs is investing in the initiative would be transferred to irs employees pursuing collection cases with higher priorities 42 us congress house ways and means committee subcommittee on oversight use of private collection agencies to improve irs debt collection 108th congress 1st sess may 13 2003 washington gpo 2004 p 29 her calculations were based on estimates contained in 2002 proposal by thenirs commissioner charles rossotti and the administrations fy2004 budget request under the most optimistic scenario the administrations plan to use pcas was expected to collect 13 billion in delinquent individual tax debt at cost of 325 billion assuming pcas hired for this purpose receive 25 of the total amount collected as compensation for their services by contrast rossotti estimated that the irs would eventually collect 947 billion in collectible tax debt at cost of 2964 million by adding 5450 fulltime employees to its enforcement staff 43 see testimony of nina olson before hearing held by the ways and means committee on may 23 2007 44 dustin stamper everson admits private collectors cost more than irs employees tax notes april 3 2006 p 11 crs23 second proponents claim there is critical need to act now to reduce the federal tax gap mainly to prevent further erosion in public trust in the fairness of the federal income tax system in their view hiring additional irs employees and training them to collect the delinquent tax debt targeted by the initiative would only serve to delay process that should be completed as soon as possible third proponents point out that once the initiative is operating at its intended scale it should come close to matching the overall return on investment roi of spending on irs operations in testimony given at hearing held by the ways and means committee on may 23 2007 thenacting irs commissioner kevin m brown stated that the overall roi for the irs is about 4 in revenue collected for each 1 of total spending on operations in contrast according to brown the initiative was expected to generate an roi of between 4 to 1 and 43 to 1 once it reached steady state in fy200845 finally proponents say the initiative ends up boosting the irss roi for enforcement activities by enabling the agency to concentrate its collection and enforcement resources on relatively difficult cases with higher payoffs legislative initiatives in the 109th and 110th congresses to modify the irss authority to hire pcas congressional opponents of the irss private tax debt collection initiative continue to look for ways to delay or defeat it even as the irs says it is midway through the first phase of implementing the initiative this section describes the proposals to modify the irss authority to use pcas to collect overdue taxes that have been considered by the house or senate since the irs gained the authority with the enactment of the ajca 109th congress in april 2005 two bills to repeal the irss authority to enter into contracts with pcas were introduced in the house hr 1583 sponsored by representative chris van hollen and hr 1621 sponsored by representative rob simmons the latter attracted 81 cosponsors from both parties lacking support from the republican leadership neither measure was incorporated into broader legislation considered by the house similar bills did not emerge in the senate in addition during the floor debate in the house on hr 3058 measure to provide appropriations in fy2006 for the treasury department and certain other federal agencies representatives simmons and van hollen introduced an amendment hamdt 418 to bar the irs from using any appropriated funds to enter 45 the estimate assumed that in fy2008 contractors would collect gross revenue of 86 to 127 million operating costs for the initiative would total 58 million and compensation of contractors would average 185 of revenue collected crs24 into

did not surface during the senates consideration of its version of hr 3058 provision in tax reconciliation bill s 2020 passed by the senate on november 18 2005 would have reserved at least 10 of the tax debt collection contracts awarded by the irs after april 1 2006 for firms that employ disabled persons the provision began as an amendment samdt 2625 introduced by senator benjamin nelson on november 17 the senate agreed to it by unanimous consent eligible firms not only had to meet the general eligibility requirements for bidding on the contracts but their domestic workforces had to satisfy one of three disability requirements eg the firms domestic workforce included at least 50 persons who were considered severely disabled when the contracts were awarded the provision defined severely disabled person as war veteran with disability of 50 or greater or someone considered disabled beneficiary under section 1148k2 of the social security act similar provision was not included in the version of the tax reconciliation bill hr 4297 passed by the house on december 8 the final version of hr 4297 hrept 109455 approved by the house and senate in may 2006 did not include the provision in april 2006 representative john dingell introduced measure hr 5084 to repeal the irss authority to hire pcas to collect delinquent tax debt but action was taken on it in june 2006 the house passed fy2007 appropriations bill hr 5576 for treasury and certain other agencies that included provision barring the irs from using any appropriated funds to implement the private tax debt collection initiative the provision was not enacted however as the version of the bill passed by the senate appropriations committee lacked similar provision and the full senate never voted on the version of hr 5576 marked up by the committee in september 2006 senators byron dorgan and patty murray introduced bill s 3887 that would have required the irs to suspend indefinitely its private tax debt collection initiative and would have barred the use of appropriated funds to implement it the measure attracted 18 cosponsors and the endorsement of eight interest groups including the national treasury employees union and the consumer federation of america46 action was taken on it 110th congress in january 2007 two bills that would end the irss private tax debt collection initiative were

includes provision that would limit the funds available to the irs to administer the initiative to 1 million or 254 million less than the amount requested by the bush administration if such limit were enacted the irs would have little choice but to suspend the initiative under the provision the irs could use funds collected through the initiative to cover the initiatives operating costs in fy2008 but the agency would be required to spend an equal amount on retraining employees in its processing centers in addition the irs would have to retrain as many employees as the pcas use in the collection of delinquent tax debt47 the version of hr 2829 passed by the house lacks similar provision in october 2007 the house passed bill hr 3056 that would repeal the irss authority to outsource the collection of delinquent taxes as of july 18 2007 the joint tax committee has estimated that such provision would lead to revenue loss of 105 billion from fy2008 through fy2017 hr 3056 would also

raise the penalties on failures to submit tax form 1099 and repeal the suspension of interest and penalties on certain unpaid tax liabilities in cases where the irs fails to notify taxpayer of an

possible policy issues for congress two and half years after pdcs began to collect delinquent individual federal tax debt under contracts issued by the irs the agencys private tax debt collection initiative continues to raise variety of policy concerns the limits placed on the collection activities of contractors while serving several important policy aims may keep the initiative from demonstrating its potential usefulness as policy tool for reducing the federal tax gap there is some evidence that the initiative is generating lower return on investment than the alternative of giving the irs the funds needed to hire additional employees to collect the delinquent tax debt the formula for compensating the contractors gives rise to two concerns namely that it may encourage them to engage in abusive collection practices and that contractors are being paid too much for handling what are relatively simple tax collection cases additionally critics doubt the contractors will respect the privacy and other rights of taxpayers they contact in using its oversight powers to ascertain whether the irss initiative is operating as intended congress may address the following questions is the private tax debt collection initiative generating greater returns at lower total cost than the alternative of giving the irs the resources it says it would need to collect the same tax debt what is the cost to the irs of processing cases that the pcas cannot handle because of the restrictions placed on their collection activities are taxpayers being adequately informed of their rights and protections under the initiative do the collection contracts contain enough sanctions against the use of unlawful or abusive collection practices by pcas crs27 are pcas and their employees adequately informed of their rights and responsibilities under the contracts and the penalties they face for failing to uphold them does the irs have adequate resources to monitor the performance of pcas does the compensation package offered to pcas promote the lawful and fair treatment of taxpayers while providing reasonable incentive to pursue the collection cases assigned to them are the pcas engaging in activities deemed inherently governmental what factors should the irs consider in compensating pcas and evaluating the results of the private debt collection initiative under what circumstances should the initiative be terminated for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33231
