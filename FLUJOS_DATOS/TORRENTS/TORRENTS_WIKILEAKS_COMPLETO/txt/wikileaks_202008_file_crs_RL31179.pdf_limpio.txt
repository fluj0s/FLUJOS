report 2 section 201b of public law 10742 wh ich is not part of the september 11th victim compensation fund of 2001 confers liability limitation on air carriers for future terrorist attacks it provides that for acts of terro rism committed on or to an air carrier during the 180day period following the date of enactment of this act the secretary of transportation may certify that the air carrier was victim of an act of terrorism and shall not be responsible for losses suffered by third partie s as referred to in section 2055b1 of title 14 code of federal regulations that exce ed 100000000 in the aggreg ate for all claims by such parties arising out of such act if the secretary so certifies making the air carrier not liable for an amount that exceeds 100000000 then the government shall be responsible for any liability above such amount punitive damages may be awarded against an air carrier or the government ta king responsibility for an air carrier under this paragraph under cause of action arising out of such act the section in the code of federal regulations that 201b mentions refers to persons including nonemployee cargo attendants other than passengers these are apparently the third parties to whom 201b refers for whose losses above 100 m illion the government but not an air carrier would be responsible public law 10742 was enacted on septembe r 22 2001 and 201b th erefore sunset on march 21 2002 it was extended through 2003 however by the homeland security act of 2002 public law 107296 1201 which transferred authority for certifying acts of terrorism to the secretary of homeland securitythe september 11th victim compensation fund of 2001 the air transportation safety and syst em stabilization act 49 usc 40101 note pl 10742 2001 which is designed to aid the airline industry after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 wa s signed into law on september 22 2001 this report discusses title iv of the act which is titled the september 11th victim compensation fund of 2001 title iv cr eated federal compensation program which took effect december 21 2001 for the victims of the september 11 attacks victim or if he is deceased his per sonal representative may seek nofault compensation from the program or may bring tort action against an airline or any other party but may not do both except that victim or his may recover under the program and sue any person who is knowing participant in any conspiracy to hijack an aircraft or commit any terrorist act1 this exception was added by the aviation and transportation secu rity act pl 10771 201a section 408a of pl 10742 capped air ca rriers liability to the limits of their liability insurance coverage2 and pl 10771 amended s ection 408a to do the same for any aircraft manufacturer airport sponsor the owner or operator of an airport as defined in section 40102 of title 49 ited states code or person with property interest in the world trade ce nter on september 11 2001 or theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs2 3 pl 10771 provides explicitly that the cap does not apply to the liability of any person who is engaged in the business of providing air transportation security and who is not an airline or airport sponsor or di rector officer or employee of an airline or airport sponsor pl 107296 890 however repealed this prov ision and amended the definition of air carrier to include persons providing air tran sportation security and their affiliates see also note 11 infra 4 as discussed in the text accompanying foot note 15 of this report it is conceivable that some victims who were injured or killed while in the world trade center or the pentagon or on the ground near them might not have to prove negligence to recover from the airlines this report in several places uses the word negligence or negligent for convenience without meaning to exclude this possibility 5 on november 26 2001 attorney general john ashcroft appointed kenneth r feinberg special master directors officers employees or agents3 therefore if any of these parties on september 11 had perincid ent ceiling on its coverage and victims can prove it to have been negligent then the victims who wish to sue rather than to receive compensation under the program may have to participate in race to the courthouse to recover damages be fore the policy limit is reached4 pl 10771 also capped the liability of new york city at the greater of the citys insurance coverage or 350000000 section 409 of pl 10742 gives the unite d states right of subrogation with respect to any claim it pays under the compensation program this means that the united states can recover amounts it pays under the compensation program from any party whom the victim could sue ie terrorist or would have been able to sue had he not filed claim under the program the united states subrogation rights however are limited to the caps prescribed by section 408 in other words party whose liability to victims is capped by section 408 to the limits of its insurance coverage has the same prot ection against subrogation actions by the government compensation fund section 404 provides that the attorney general shall appoint special master who shall administer the compensation program promulgate all procedural and substantive rules for its administration and employ and supervise hearing officers and other administrative personnel5 the special master pursuant to section 407 shall promulgate regulations with respect to forms to be used to submit claims hearing procedures and other matters the statute of limitation for filing claims with the special master is two years after the date on which the regulations are promulgated under section 407 and the stat ute requires that the regulations be promulgated within 90 days after enactment of the statute the regulations an interim final rule were published on schedule on d ecember 21 2001 the final day for filing claims therefore is decem ber 21 2003 the interim final rule was replaced by final rule on march 7 2002 it is discussed in the final section of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs3 section 405c2 provides that pers ons who may file claims under the compensation program are those who were present at the world trade center the pentagon or the site of the crash in pennsyl vania at the time of the crashes or in the immediate aftermath and who suffered physical harm or death as result of crash persons who were members of the flight crew or passenger s on any of the four flights that crashed on september 11 ma also file claims unless they are identified by the attorney general to have been participant or conspirator in the crashes in the case of deceased individual t he personal representative of the decedent may file claim on behalf of the decedent but n ot more than one cl aim may be submitted on behalf of deceased individual under 10452 of the special masters final rule discussed below the personal representative shall distribute the award in manner consistent with the law of the decedents domicile or any applicable rulings made by court of competent jurisdiction in other words state law shall deter mine which individuals receive share of the award however in the event that the special master concludes that the personal representative s plan does not appr opriately compensate the victims spouse children or other rela tives the special master may direct the personal representative to dist ribute all or part of the award to such spouse children or other relatives notw ithstanding state law there is provision in the statute for family members of victims to file claims with the special master on their own behalf for damages that they as opposed to the deceased have suffered or will suffer as result of the death of victim of the terrorist attacks of september 11 section 405c3bi provides that to be eligible to recover under the compensation program claimant will have to waive his right to sue anyone for damages caused by the terrorist attacks except to recover collateral source obligations which means money due from s ources such as life insurance pension funds death benefit programs and payments by federal state or local government related to the terroristrelated aircraft crashes of september 11 2001 section 201a of the aviation and transportation security ac t pl 10771 which was enacted on november 19 2001 provides that claimant need not waive his right to sue any person who is knowing participant in any conspiracy to hijack any aircraft or commit any terrorist act section 408 a3 as added by pl 10771 201b repeats that person who files claim under the compensation program waives the right to file civil action for damages sustained as result of the september 11 crashes it also repeats the exception w ith regard to collateral source obligations but does not repeat the excepti on with regard to terrorists an individual who is party to civil action in connection with the september 11 hijackings may not submit claim to the fund unless he withdraws from the civil action within 90 days after the date on which the special master promulgates regulations the special master did so on december 21 2001 90 days from then is march 21 2002 neither the stat ute nor the special masters final rule explicitly addresses whether an individua l who files lawsu it after march 21 2002 and loses it or withdraws from it may thereafter before the statute of limitations ends on december 21 2003 submit claim to the fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs4 section 405b3 provides that the speci masters determination of claims shall be final and not subj ect to judicial review amount of compensation section 405b provides that recovery under the compensation program will be nofault ie the claimant will not have to prove negligence or any other theory of liability and the special master will determine i the extent of the harm to the cl aimant including any economic and noneconomic losses and ii the amount of compensati on to which the claima nt is entitled based on the harm to the claimant the facts of the claim and the individual circumstances of the claimant economic losses incl udes the loss of earni ngs or other benefits related to employment medical expense loss replacement services loss loss due to death burial costs and loss of business or employment opportunities to the extent recovery for such loss is allowed under pplicable state law noneconomic losses means losses for physical and emotional pa in and all other nonpecuniary losses of any kind or nature the statute does not limit these to those allowed under applicable state law some states ve statutory caps on noneconomic damages the fact that the special master will determine both i the harm to the claimant and ii the amount of compensation due the claimant implies that these are not necessarily the same amounts this is so implied by the fact that the amount of recovery will be based only in part on the harm to the claimant it will also be based on the facts of the claim and the individual circumstances of the claimant the statute does not specify what sort of facts or circumstances the special master should consider but presumably these f acts and circumstances would guide him in reducing the recovery to an amount belo w the total economic and noneconomic losses it does not appear that the special master could award an amount greater than the total economic and noneconomic damages as the statute prohibits him from awarding punitive damages and they are the only other type of damages generally awarded in personal injury cases though the statute does not explicitly prohibit the special master from awarding damages above the total ec onomic and noneconomic damages any amount above them would eff ectively amount to gift rather than to compensation and the statute au thorizes only compensation section 405b6 provides that the speci master shall reduce the amount of compensation by the amount of the collateral source comp ensation the claimant has received or is entitled to receive collateral source compensation as noted above includes life insurance pension f unds death benefit pr ograms and payments by federal state or local governments related to the terroristrelated aircraft crashes of september 11 2001 section 405b3 provides that the special master must make determination and provide written notice to th claimant within 120 days after claim is filed and must authorize payment within 20 days after he makes determination determinations are fina l and not subject to judicial review the new york times reported lawmakers said today that th ey had idea how much the provision the compensation program could ultimately cost but with the death toll presumed to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs5 6 n times sept 22 2001 at a1 7 n times dec 21 2001 at a1 8 wash post mar 8 2002 at a1 9 section 408b2 provides that the state w to be applied includes its choice of law principles that means for example that in suit arising out of the crash in pennsylvania if pennsylvania law provides that new jers ey law should apply because the plane that crashed in pennsylvania originated in new jersey then the federal court in applying pennsylvania law would actually apply new jersey law 10 see in re tmi litigation cases consol ii 940 f2d 832 848851 3d cir 1991in the thousands insurance experts said claims could easily rise to 18 billion6 on december 21 2001 after the department of jus tice issued its interim final rule the new york times reported that the cost of the f und after collatera l source deductions could be roughly 48 billion7 on march 8 2002 after th department issued its final rule the washington post reported that the cost of the fund has been estimated at 6 billion8 section 406b provides t his title constitutes budget authority in advance of appropriations acts and represents the obligation of the federal government to provide for the payment of amounts for compensation under this title section 406c authorizes the attorney general to accept private contributions to help meet this obligation lawsuits against the airlines or others victim who does not file claim unde r the compensation program may sue an air carrier or any other third party and may sue terrorist even if he does file claim under the compensation program an air carrier or other business would generally be liable only if one or more of its employees had been negligent but see below section 408 would create fede ral cause of action which would be the exclusive remedy for damages arising out of the september 11 hijackings the law of the state in which the crash occurred w ould govern and all its would have to be brought in the us district court fo r the southern district of new york9 the fact that state law would govern means that these lawsuits would be different from lawsuits that could have been brought in the absence of this statute except for the fact that they now must be tried in particular federal court the reason that pl 10742 created federal cause of action rath er than simply requiring state causes of action to be brought in the us district c ourt for the southern di strict of new york appears to be that it might have been unconstitutional to allow state causes of action between plaintiffs and defendants from the sa state to be broug ht in federal court10 although family members of victims ar not eligible to recover under the compensation program for losses on their own behalf nothing in the statute prohibits them from bringing wrongful death or othe r tort actions to recover such losses section 408 as noted provides that liability for all claims whether for compensatory or punitive damages arising from the terroristrelated aircraft crasheshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs6 11 the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107296 890 redefined air carrier to include persons engaged in the business of pr oviding air transportation security and their affiliates if they are employees or agents of citizen of the united states undertaking to provide air transportation and if agents have contracted directly with the federal aviation administration on or after and commenced services later than february 17 2002 to provide such security and have not b een or are not debarred for any period within 6 months from that date it is not apparent the circumstances in which an air transportation security company would both be an agent of citizen of the united states who provides air transportation and have contracted directly w ith the faa it is also not apparent why companies who provided air transportation security on september 11 2001 are required to have contracted with the faa by february 17 2002 in order to benefit from the liab ility limitation 12 lee s kreindler viation accident law 2001 206 13 id

the air carrier and the other pa rties listed in pl 1077111 therefore the airlines and other parties will pay damages on firstcomefirstserved basis negligence or absolute liability for the most part airline accident law is airline negligence law12 negligence law may impose varying standards of care the traditional view followed by most states is that common carrier airline is held to the highest degree of care in 1986 however the new york court of appeals held that common carrier is held to the same standard of care as any other alleged tortfeasor it must exercise ordinary care commensurate with the existing circumstances13 in applying negligence law in airline accident cases states usually apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur this doctrine provides that if an instrumentality in this case an airplane involved in an accide nt is within the exclusive control of the defendant the airline and if the accident is one which would ordinarily not have happened in the absence of negligence then the jury may infer from the mere happening of the accident that the defendant was negligent14 the defendant however may rebut this inference and in the case of the september 11 crashes the airlines can obviously show that the planes were not within their exclusive control but were in the control of hijackers the victims then would have to show that the airlines were negligent in some respect othe r than in causing the crashes such as in allowing the hijackers on the plane at one time about half the states in th united states had statutes imposing absolute liability on the part of an owner or lessee of aircraft for injuries or damages caused to persons or property on the ground since 1943 the number of states imposing such absolute liability has steadily decreased presently only delaware hawaii minnesota new jersey sout h carolina and vermont impose it15 the september 11 deaths occurred in new yor k pennsylvania and virginia which arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs7 16

security was lax the federal government if it failed to enforce safety regu lations and boeing c if sturdier cockpit doors in the planes it manufactured could have prevented the hijackers from taking control of the airliners n ational law journal oct 1 2001 at a13 17 the title is an acronym for uniting and stre ngthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorismnot among these states and so apparently require proof of negligence as noted in footnote 9 however the law of the state in which crash occurred may in some cases require the application of anot her states law therefore in some suits brought under pl 10742 the federal court in applying the law of the state in which crash occurred may have to pply another states law the washington post reports that some lawyers representing families of people killed in the sept 11 terrorist attacks are balking at the compensation program and plan to file their own laws uits against airlines and other defendants perhaps in matter of weeks lee kreindler new york lawyer who has represented victims of the twa flight 800 and the pan am flight 103 air disasters and is the author of the treatise cited in footnote 12 said airline passengers who died on sept 11 may be able to recover more money in court from such defendants as security companies training schools air carriers and terrorist groups than through victims fund but kreindler said those who were hurt while in side the pentagon or the world trade center might be better off applying to the compensation fund because it could be more difficult to win case on grounds that an airline could have foreseen and prevented hijackers from crashing into building16 interaction with the usa patriot act of 2001 on october 26 2001 president bush signed the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 1075617 sections 621624 of this statute amended the victims of crime act of 1984 42 usc 1060110608 the victims of crime act of 1984 established in the treasury the crime victims fund which distributes money to state crime victim compensation programs section 622c and of pl 10756 refers to pl 10742 section 622c provides that notwithst anding any other law other than title iv of pl 10742 if federal state or local program that provides medical or other assistance using fede ral funds has maximum llowed income resource or asset eligibility requirement then any crime victim compensation that an applicant receives shall not count to ward his eligibility under the program that provides medical or other assistance using federal f unds the parenthetical phrase other than title iv of pl 10742 indicates that compensation r eceived under that law is an exception ie it will count in determining one s eligibility under program that receives medical or other ssistance using federal fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs8 18 section 622c has an exception crime victim compensation shall reduce the amount available if the total amount of assistance that the applicant receives from all such programs is sufficient to fully compensate the applicant for losses suffe red as result of the crime 19 the statute the interim final rule the fi

part 104 the request for comments is formally called notice of inquiry and ad vance notice of rulemaking the six topics on which comments were sought were the forms to be used in submitting claims under this program and the information to be included on the claims form procedures for hearing and the presentation of evidence proce dures to assist an individual in filing and pursuing claims under this title claimant eligibility and nature and amount of compensation 21 wash post nov 5 2001 at a10section 622c also provides that crime victim compensation shall not reduce the amount of assistance available to an applicant under program that provides medical or other assistance18 again however compensation under title iv of pl 10742 is an exception this is consistent with the provision of pl 10742 that provides that the special master shall reduce the amount of compensation by the amount of collateral source compensation th at the claimant is entitled to receive section 622e1 amended section 1403e of the victims of crime act of 1984 42 usc 10602e which now provide s that if compensation paid by an eligible crime victim compensation program would cover costs that federal program including the program establis hed under title iv of pl 10742 or federally financed state or local progra m would otherwise pay then the crime victim compensation program shall not pay and the federal or federally financed program shall the amendment added the reference to the prog ram established under title iv of pl 10742 section 622e2 consistently with s ection 622e1s providing that crime victim compensation program sh all not cover costs that pl 10742 covers provides that crime victim compensation program that does not pay in such circumstances shall not become ineligible for future gr ants under the victims of crime act of 1984 department of justice final rule19 on november 5 2001 the department of justice published request for comments on six topics it was considering in connection with the regulations that pl 10742 407 required it to issue by december 21 200120 one of the most hotly debated issues it would address according to the washington post was whether life insurance payments pensio ns and retirement savings accounts and gifts from charities should be deducted from the awards families receive from the government fund21 in fact however life insurance and pensions are explicitly named in the statute 405b6 as collate ral sources that the special master must deduct from the amount of compensation ot herwise available under the compensationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs9 22 ny times nov 6 2001 at a1 b7 23 66 fed reg 6627366291 dec 21 2001 28 cfr part 104 program the statute does not however explicitly mention gifts from charities and the special master finding ambiguity in th statute as to this question decided that they will not be deducted from compensation awards an article in the new york times provided some pros and cons on this question22 some say that awards should be reduced by the amount of charity victims family accepts because the point of th federal fund is to make victims families financially whole not to enrich them at the expense of american taxpayers millions of whom have already made donations those who disagree say that these taxpayers pledged donations to help victims not the governments balance sheet and if fund awards are reduced by the amount of charity that is accepted what incentive will americans have to provide charity to future victims of terrorism the present uncertainty on this question raises concerns as to whether victims families should keep painstaking records of every charitable penny they receive and whether charitable organizations s hould direct their funds toward those not eligible under the compensation program those who lost their jobs or homes or suffered severe ntal trauma whether awards from the fund are reduced to reflect the charitable gifts familie s receive will be an important factor in its ultimate cost to american ta xpayers budget analysts said on december 21 2001 the department of ju stice released an interim final rule with request for comments23 the rule states that it will have the force and effect of law immediately upon publication but is designated interim because the department is also seeking further comment for period of 30 days as part of its further review and may expand or adjust asp ects of the rule after receiving additional comments on march 7 2002 the depar tment after reviewing the comments it received released final rule the final rule authorizes persons who are eligible to recover under the fund to apply for immediate advance benefits in the amount of 50000 for personal representatives of people who died as re sult of the september 11 hijackings to be distributed among their survivors and 25000 for people who suffered physical injury that required hospitalization for one week or more the amount of any advance benefits received will be deducted from the fi nal award under the program section 405c of pl 10742 authorizes compensation to persons who suffered physical harm or the survivors of persons who died as result of the hijackings the final rule 1042c defines physical harm as physical injury that was treated by medical professional within 24 hours of the injury having been sustained or within 24 hours of the rescue or within 72 hours of injury or rescue for those victims who were unable to realize immediat ely the extent of their injuries or for whom treatment by medical professi onal was not available on september 11 or within such time as the special master may determine for resc ue personnel who did not or could not obtain treatment by medical professional within 72 hours and i required hospitalization as an inpatient for at least 24 hours or ii caused eitherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs10 24 the italicized language was not in the in terim final rule but is in the final rule unitalicized the special master states in the final rule that the language was added because some individuals were severely injure d in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks yet would not be eligible for the fund because they were not treated by medical professional within 24 hours of the injury having been sustainedtemporarily or permanently partial or total physical disability incapacity or disfigurement24 the final rule 1044 defines personal representative as an individual appointed by court of competent jurisdic tion as the personal representative of the decedent or as the executor or administrator of the decedents will or estate or if court has made such an appointment then the sp ecial master may name as personal representative the person named by the decedent in the decedents will as the executor or administrator of the deceden ts estate if will exists the special master may determine that the personal representative is the first person in the line of succession established by the laws of the decedents domicile governing intestacy in other words the first pers on entitled under state law to inherit in the absence of will this will usually be the spouse though if there is spouse but there are parents grandparents siblings or offspring then there could be more than one person in the same spot in the lin of succession and the final rule does not address how this would be handled as noted above the pe rsonal representative shall distribute the award in manner consistent with the law of the decedents domicile or any applicable rulings made by court of competent jurisdiction in other word s state law shall determine which individuals receive share of the award however in the event that the special master concludes that the personal representa tives plan does not appropriately compensate th victims spouse children or other relatives the special master may direct the personal representativ to distribute all or part of the award to such spouse children or other relativ notwithstanding state law 10452 the final rule does not address the eligibility of unmarried partners of victims to be personal representatives or beneficiaries of awards therefore they may be appointed or named personal representative in the manne r described above or may be eligible for an award in the manner described above however when person dies without will the line of successi on under state law generally includes only relatives therefore if the personal representative in particular case is the first person in the line of succession then an unmarried partner may be precluded from being that person and if the victim died without will then an unmarried partner may be ineligible to receive an award amount of compensation the final rule 10441 provides in event shall an award before collateral source compensation has been deducted be less than 500000 in any case brought on behalf of deceased victim with spouse or dependent or 300000 in any case brought on behalf of deceased victim who was single with dependentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31179crs11 25 the interim final rule had 250000 plus an additional 50000 for the spouse and each dependent 26 the final sentence would apply for exampl where the beneficiary of victims life insurance policy was not beneficiary of an award under the fund b ecause he was not named in the victims will or was not in the lin of succession if the victim died intestatethe final rule describes how the speci master will dete rmine economic and noneconomic loss for victims who died and for victims who suffered physical harm but did not die in determining economic loss for either category of victim the special master in accordance with pl 10742 4025 will not compensate claimants for those categories or type s of economic losses that would not be compensable under the law of the state that would be applicable to any tort claims brought by or on behalf of
