reorganization potential effects on dod intelligence agencies by richard best this report will be updated as events warrant the commissions recommendation would affect an estimated onehalf to twothirds of the intelligence budget the portion devoted to the national foreign intelligence program nfip the other parts of the intelligence budget finance intelligence activities of the department of defense that s upport tactical military operations though the distinction between tactical and national intelligence is often blurry major issue in congress is how greater centralized aut hority over the nfip budget would affect operations of four large defens department agencies funded in large part from nfip the national reconnaissance office the national security agen cy the national geospatial intelligence agency and the defense intelligence agency these agencies provide intelligence that supports both national decisionmaking nd military operations the three major components of the intelligence budget since 1995 the us intelligence budget has been divided into three elements the national foreign intelligence program nfip which in principle funds all foreign inte lligence and counterintelligence activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21945crs2 1 cia press release statement by the director of central intelligence regarding the disclosure of the aggregate intelligence budget for

to the needs of particular military service and tactical intelligence and re lated activities tiara which is an aggregation of funding for tac tical military intelligence programs managed by the individual services some agencies may receive money from di fferent accounts both nfip and jmip for example provide funding for cryptologi c activities of the national security agency nsa by all estimates the bulk of nsas funding is provided through nfip but some programs that are of interest to military consumers may be f unded through jmip organizationally the nfip budget finances intelligence activities both of agencies within the department of defense and of agencies outside dod while jmip and tiara finance only activities of the partment of defense nondefe nse agencies or activities funded from nfip include the central intelligence agency fbi foreign counterintelligen ce and intelligence activities the state department bureau of intelligence and research the department of energy office of intelligence and the department of treasury office of intelligence support agencies within the defense department funded at least in part from nfip include the national

breakdown of the intelligence budget by agency or activity some information about the composition of the intelligence budget was however provided in 1996 by the commission on th roles and capabilities of the us intelligence community2 the commission did not reveal the total amount spent on intelligence but it did provide substan tial amount of information on trends in intelligence funding and on the share of the budget for nfip and other areas the commission reported that about twothirds of the intelligence budget at the time was for nfip that almost all of the nfip budget wa s for the cia and dod and that about three fourths of the nfip budget was for dod programs3 the commission also printed graphic that showed relative amount s for major intelligence agencies4 breaking out their rulers and assuming that the overall in telligence budget was about 30 billion non government analysts were then able to ma ke rough estimates of the budgets of the cia nro nsa and other agencies currently it is widely estimated in the press that the total intelligence budget has grown to about 40 billion5 the composition of the intelligence budget has likely shifted to some degree since the commissions 1996 report but official overview of the budget has been produced in the interim some press accounts s till estimate that nfip is about twothirds of the total while ot hers guess that the nfip is abut half6 so reasonable range would put nfip at betw een 20 and 27 billion jmip at 57 billion and tiara at 1215 billion within the nfip account if threefourths of the total is still for dod then the defense share would range from 1520 billion divided among the nro nsa nga and dia with the bulk for nro and nsa th remaining 57 billion of the nfip budget would be for the cia fbi and other agencies with the bulk for the cia so the proposal to give greater budget authority over nfip to the new national intelligence director has largely to do with control over 1520 billion for these large department of defense agencies the 911 commission did not discu ss how to handle jmip funding for these agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21945crs4 7 the relevant provisions are title 50 us code sections 4034 and 4035formal authority over the nfip budget under current law the director of central intelligence dci already has considerable statutory authority over the fo rmulation and execution of the nfip budget though this authority is shared with the secr etary of defense and ot her department heads proponents of giving greater authority to national intelligence director however argue that the dcis formal statutory authority is not reflected in practice the relative authority of the dci and the secretary of defense over the intelligence budget was not defined in the original ve rsion of the national security act of 1947 white house directives in later years laid out the agencies respective authorities and in 1992 with some refinements in 1997 cong ress approved legisla tion amending the national security act of 1947 to mo re clearly define responsibilities under the terms of the national secu rity act as amended in 1992 and 19977 the dci is responsible 1 for developing and presen ting to the president an annual budget for the national foreign intelligence program and 2 for participating in the development by the secretary of defense of the annual budgets fo r the joint military intelligence program and the tactical intelligence and related activities program the dci also has the authority to provide guidance to elements of the intelligence community for preparation of their annual budgets and must approve their budgets before they are incorporated into the nfip the amended statute also requires th at the dci approve any transfers of nfip funds after they are appropriated see belo w for further discussion and that the secretary of defense consult with the dci on any transfers of jmip funds and the statute gives the dci authority to transfer both funds nd pers onnel within the nfip except for funds and personnel of the fbi s ubject to the approval of the head of the agency that controls the funds ie in most cases the s ecretary of defense the amended statute also gi ves the secretary of defens specific responsibilities and authorities most significantly the law make s the secretary of defense responsible for ensuring that the nro nsa nga dia and other defense inte lligence ac tivities 1 produce intelligence adequate to meet defense department requirements and 2 produce intelligence to meet national requirements including requirements established by the director of central intelligence on its face this gives the dci consider able authority over nfip budgets the statutory language however gives the secret ary of defense operati onal control over the major defense intelligence agencies even thoug h tasking of the agencies may be issued by the dci so as practical matter it is the secretary of defense who has the main authority to establish priorities the nfip budget process although the national secur ity act makes the dci responsible for preparing the nfip budget annual budget re quests for the defense agencies have in practice been formulated through the normal department of defense planning programming and budgeting system augmented to include input from the intelligence community at

formal programming and budgeting guidance to the agencies financed in the nfip the head of each agency is then res ponsible for preparing detailed budget plan for dod agenci that plan is then reviewed

board drb for intelligence programs the drb is expanded to include representatives of the dci the augmented boa rd appropriately is referred to as the expanded drb final decisions on funding for intelligence programs are formally made by the expanded drb this formal budgeting process interacts with the process by which the defense department makes cisions on major acquisition programs though the acquisition process is both formally and in practice quite distinct from programming and budgeting the role of the dci in the acquisition process is not specifically addressed in statute the dcis guidance to the defense agencies in formulating their budgets may however include directions to the agency heads to address certain national requirements in developing new systems moreover proce dures are in place to include input from the overall intelligence community in devel oping requirements for new dod intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems in 1998 the dci established mission requirements board within the intelligence community staff to identify technical issues of concern to the cia and other elements of the intelligence community as well as to dod in acquiring new systems transferreprogrammi ng of inte lligence funding key aspect of control over budgets is th authority to review budget execution and to transfer or reprogram funds from one use to another after money is appropriated appropriations laws typically allow agencies to transfer funds from one appropriations account to another subject to specific conditions and up to cer tain annual to tals under procedures worked out between agencies and the relevant congressional committees agencies my also reprogram funds within appropriations accounts subject to certain additional restrictions thoug h transfers and reprogrammin g are technically distinct the defense department refers to both as reprogramming and some reprogramming actions including all that involve transfe r between accounts require advance approval of the congressional defense committees8 the 911 commission recommended giving th nid authority to reprogram nfip funds under current law the dci has author ity to reprogram funds subject to approval from the office of management and budget nd subject to the concurrence of the head of the department to which the funds are appropriated ie fo r defense intelligence programs the secretary of defense the law also permits the secretary of defense to transfer or reprogram nfip funds but it requires that any transfers be approved by the dci or be carried out under procedures

director nid the same responsibility to prepare the nfip budget form erly given to the director of central intelligence along with some added author ity and responsibility the added measures provide that the nid shall manage and be responsible for appropriations for the nfip and shall allot or allocate those funds to the agencies and organizations within the intelligence community for programs and activities that are part of the nfip the measure also provides that the allotment or allocation of funds sha ll be executed through existing agency comptrollers or other ppropriate budget execution officers the administration proposal also gives the nid au thority to transfer nfip funds subject to omb approval and in consultation with partment heads s 2845 as proposed by senators susan collins and joseph lieb erman and reported by the senate government affairs committee similarly gives new nid the budget authority formerly granted to the dci along with some added authority the collins lieberman proposal gives the nid responsib ility to manage and oversee the national intelligence program including execution repr ogramming and transfer of funds see 112 2 additionally the collinslieb erman proposal would give the nid responsibility to oversee plans for acquiring major new intelligence systems with proviso that this authority shall not apply until the nid in consultation with the secretary of defense determines th at the intelligence community has the personnel and capability to carry out this task see 162 hr 10 the house leadershipsponsored in telligence reform bill would also give the new nid the budget authority previously granted to the dci and it would make the nid responsible to ensure the effective execution of the annual budget for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities and to facilitate the management and execution of funds appropriated for the national intelligence program the nid would need approval of other agency or department
