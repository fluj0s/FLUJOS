other assistance from the uae mbr said the uae understands that the siniora government needs regional support us burns urged continued assistance noting the us will soon offer the siniora government 1 billion for security and reconstruction efforts 4c iran sanctions us burns highlighted the significance of the june 2006 international offer to negotiate with iran to resolve the nuclear issuethe first official us offer to negotiate with tehran in 27 years tehran had rejected this broadlysupported reasonable proposal which offered economic incentives such as sanctions relief and the sale of civilian airliners in addition to negotiations us burns said that the unscr 1737s limited sanctions were first step to pressure iran to compromise but that absent iranian movement another more restrictive sanctions resolution is likely in february the us was also taking bilateral action through treasury designations against iranian banks that were funding terrorism 5c mbr expressed willingness to cooperate in financial restrictions against iran but urged that the cooperation be conducted quietly he offered to set up joint committee to do so he did not offer details he later repeated this offer with regard to military transfers see 8 he voiced concern regarding the potential negative impact of economic sanctions on dubai and against the good iranians including dubais estimated 350000 iranians residents us burns and ambassador sison expressed readiness to engage with dubai on financial cooperation against iran note the number of resident iranians was supplied by qemzi and is higher that the 200300 thousand usual cited by the dubai officials 6c iran and gulf security us burns stated that the us will protect its interests and support its allies like the uae in the face of iranian attempts to dominate the gulf this is why we have stationed second carrier battle group there and have detained iranian agents in iraq who were providing arms and bomb components used to kill us troops mbr stated that the uae does not want iran to have nuclear weapons and urged continued international pressure on iran but expressed deep concern about the destabilizing consequences to the uae and to region of military strike he urged that the us find way to stop or disarm iran without using military force us burns reiterated dubai 00000059 0022 of 002 that the us

prostate cancer gergawi opined that the merchant class in iran has been pressuring ahmadinejad over his failing economic policy he asserted that the growing sectarian conflict in iraq as well as the hanging of saddam hussein which he implied was inspired by iranian pressure have now undermined the possibility of regional alliance between extremist sunnis and shia regional sunnis now blame iran for instability in lebanon and iraq note gergawis family is of iranian origin and he acts as one of mbrs principal advisors on iran 8c security cooperation us burns called the gulf cooperation council good forum for quiet security cooperation and reiterated that the us seeks close productive dialogue with the uae on gulf security the us opposes arms sales to iran and will urge its partners in the european union russia and the middle east to cooperate on this front mbr reiterated his offer to set up committee to cooperate on these issues 9c israelpalestinians us burns stressed that the us believes progress between israel and the palestinians toward peace is central to regional stability and supports the creation of palestinian state this would be the best thing mbr replied peace deal would make radical groups like hamas everyones enemy palestinian president mahmoud abbas should be supported particularly since hamas is funded by iran mbr noted uae assistance was again flowing to the palestinians although it had been suspended for time because of corruption concerns us burns said the us is careful to ensure its assistance is going to the palestinian people rather than the hamas government and is confident in the assistance mechanisms now in place 10c valapour case us burns raised the case of amcit vafa valapour who has been under criminal investigation in dubai for nearly 16 months us burns said the us sought return of valapours passport which has been held by the dubai police he underscored that while he was taking substantive position on the merits of the case the us believes the case should move forward with due process as quickly as possible mbr was unfamiliar with the case and turned to gergawi for background gergawi outlined the dubai government view of the case saying the bottom line is that valapour and his nonusc partners had profited from insider information in deal on the dubai metro project with corrupt dubai official we dont tolerate corruption gergawi concluded the consul general noted that he had recently met with the dubai attorney general reftel on the case the ag had agreed to meet with valapours us and emirati representatives to help to resolve the issue mbr asked his aides to ensure the case moved forward as quickly and transparently as possible and promised valapour would receive fair treatment 11c afghanistan us burns expressed appreciation for uae assistance in afghanistan and urged support for the karzai government mbr asserted the uae and us are partners against drugs money laundering and terrorism and in afghanistan he said the best weapon against the taliban was economic investment us burns outlined ongoing reconstruction efforts and noted the difficulty of creating economically viable substitutes for drug crops mbr said karzai is reluctant to tackle the drug issue because he fears decreased support in the provinces 12c comment mbr offered little new other than his somewhat vague offer to create bilateral committee to address financial and armstechnology flows to iran he is clearly concerned regarding the prospect of more comprehensive economic sanctions given that iran is dubais largest trading partner an assertion often cited by dubai officials although good dubaiiran trade numbers are hard to come by we will follow up to try to get better read on the scope of mbrs offer sutphin
