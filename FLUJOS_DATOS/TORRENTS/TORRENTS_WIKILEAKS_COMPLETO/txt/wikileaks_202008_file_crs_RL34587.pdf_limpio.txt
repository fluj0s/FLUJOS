persecution when can it constitute basis for asylum and withholding of removal summary female genital mutilation fgm encompasses wide range of procedures which involve the removal or alteration of womans and gi rls genitalia the federal courts and the board of immigration appeals bia have classified fgm as form of persecution showing of which can act as basis for successful asylum or withholding of removal cla im however there was sp lit between the federal courts and the bia over the treatment of applican ts who have already been subjected to fgm the federal courts that have addressed this issue have held that past infliction of fgm creates presumption of well founded fear of future persecution which is prerequisite for refugee status and also clear probability of future harm requirement for obtaining withholding of removal the bia on the other hand has rejected this position in in re at arguing that fgm can be inflicted only once which means that an applicant cannot ve wellfounded fear or present clear probability of fgm happening again in the future thus under the bia interpretation the past inf liction of fgm form of past persecution rather than creating presumption of wellfounded fear of future persecution rebuts the presumption the bia has stated however that while past infliction of fgm cannot act as basis for wellfounded fear of future persecution past infliction of fgm if sufficiently severe can act as basis for an asylum claim on humanitarian grounds although the bia has ruled that past in fliction of fgm cannot act as the basis for wellfounded fear of pe rsecution federal court of appeals has rejected this holding the federal court of appeals for the second circuit has ruled that the bia misapplied the regulatory framework gove rning past persecution holding that the bia was in error when it determined that past infliction of fgm rebutted the presumption of wellfounded fear of future persecution the second circuits holding while it does not grant per refu gee status to women who have suffered past infliction of fgm does allow that past infliction to act as basis for an asylum or withholding of removal claim the attorney general has since vacated the bia decision in in re at holding that past infliction of fgm can be th basis for wellfounded fear of future persecution the bias holding in in re at longer controls

western nations3 this viewpoint is reflected in american law which classifies fgm as form of persecu tion which can act as basis for refugee status4 before exploring how fgm affects an applicants asylum application this report shall explore the basic statutory and regula tory framework that governs asylum law this entails an outline of the requirements an applicant must meet in order to obtain relief under asylum law and discussion bout the differences between the two main forms of relief for aliens facing rem oval from the united states asylum and withholding of removal it will then

their native lands some aliens arrive at us port of entry seeking admission into the country while ot hers manage to effect entry illegally both groups are subject to removal b ack to their countries of origin6 immigration law however provides these liens recourse to three ways in which to stay removal asylum withholding of removal and the united nations convention against torture cat7 this report will focus primarily on asylum and withholding of removal these two mechanisms are substantively similar in many ways but they do differ in some important respects asylum asylum is means for aliens who have suffered persecution in their countries of origin to enter or remain within the united states potential asylees apply for asylum either upon arrival at us port of entry or as defense during removal proceeding in order to obtain asylum the burden of proof is on the applicant to demonstrate that she meets the eligibility requirements for asylum namely that he or she is refugee8 the applicant must also show by clear and convincing evidence that she filed her application within one year of arriving in the united states9 even if an applicant satisfies the necessary eligibility requirements asylum is discretionary and may still be denied usually becau of the aliens criminal background individuals who obtain asylum are allowed to remain within the united states and may adjust their status to permanent residence at later date10 through derivative asylum an asylee may have her spouse nd minor children accompany her into the country or follow and join her after she has effected entry11 the term refugee has two distinct sens refugees usually refer to large number of displaced individuals located outside the united states who receive leavehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34587crs3 12 see ina 207 8 usc 1157 authorizing the president to allow refugees into the united states for period not exceeding 12 m onths when the admission of the refugees is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest 13 ina 208 8 usc 1158 authorizing the gr ant of asylum to those who qualify under the statutory definition of refugee 14 although the statute refers to this mechanism as restriction on removal it is more commonly called withholding of removal in case law regulations and legal scholarship in international law and treaties withholding of removal is often referred to as nonrefoulement 15 ina 241b3 8 usc 1231b3 16 although there appears to be difference be tween the types of harm that persecution and threat to life or freedom signify ther is difference between the two standards with regard to the likelihood of future harm an app licant must demonstrate in order to obtain the sought after relief more on the difference be tween wellfounded fear of persecution and threat to life or freedom with regards to the evidentiary burden will be discussed below 17 ina 241b3a 8 usc 1231 b3a the ttorney general may not remove an alien to country if the attorney general decides that the aliens life or freedom would be threatened in that country emphasis added 18 id the statute states that the attorney general may not remove not that the alien has right to stay within the countryfrom the president to enter into the country as group12 although asylum refers to the statutory definition of refugee in order to determine who may obtain relief asylum in contrast to the refugee admissi on process is geared toward individuals already in or at the border of the united states and is typically adjudicated before immigration judges on casebycase basis13 thus the way in which group of refugees obtains admission into the united states from overseas and the process by which an individual refugee is permitted to stay within the united states once reaching its shores are distinct this repor t will focus on the latter sense of refugee namely refugees who undergo the asylum process withholding of removal withholding of removal14 allows an applicant to stay deportation if the applicant demonstrates that her life or freedom woul d be threatened if returned to her country of origin15 although asylum requires the applican t to be threatened by persecution while withholding of removal requires th reat to her life or freedom the federal courts appear to view these two concepts interchangeably at least with regards to the type of harm the two concepts signify16 on the other hand withholding of removal does differ from asylum in veral important respects fo r example unlike asylum withholding of removal can only be used as defense during removal proceeding it is also mandatory form of relief if the alien qualifies for w ithholding of removal it must be granted17 however withholding of remova l merely grants the applicant the right not to be removed to her country of origin rather than an affirmative right to stay within the united states18 thus someone who remains within the united states because of withholding of rem oval cannot adjust status to permanenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34587crs4 19 ins v cardozafonseca 480 us 421 429 n 6 1987 20 but see 8 cfr 20816e 8 cfr 120816e

furthermore obtaining withholding of removal instead of asylum would preclude the applicants spouse or minor ch ildren from entering the country through derivative asylum20 although asylum provides more rights an applicant can be barred from obtaining asylum on procedural or discretionary grounds if an applicant is barred from applying for asylum she woul d have to pursue withholding of removal in order to stay removal21 the statutory requirements for asylum or withholding of removal in order for an individual alien to cl aim either asylum or withholding of removal the alien must satisfy certain statutory requirements while the statutory requirements for asylum and withholding of removal are similar in many ways they do differ with regards to the burden of proof that an applicant must bear when trying to establish the likelihood of being subject ed to future persecution an applicant petitioning for asylum must establish that she is refugee which requires well founded fear of persecution22 someone seeking withholding of removal on the other hand must show clear probability of future persecution23 when applying for asylum an applicant is also automatically deemed by regulations to be seeking withholding of removal24 because the statutory requirements for refugee status and withholding of removal are substantively similar this report will proceed by first outlining the statutory and regulatory framework of refugee status and will then discuss the ways in which it diffe rs from withholding of removal the definition of refugee refugee is statutorily defined in ina 101a42 which states that the term refugee means any person who is outside any country of such persons nationality or in the case of person having nationality is outside any country in

well founded fear of persecution persecution persecution is not defined by statute and is determined on casebycase basis by the courts the venth circuit for example defined persecution as punishment or the infliction of harm for political religious or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate26 however not all bad acts necessarily rise to the level of persecution as the venth circuit later stated the conduct in question need not neces sarily threaten the petitioners life or freedom however it must rise above the level of mere hara ssment to constitute persecution27 persecution is rather an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our soci ety regards as offensive28 it is therefore difficult to establish bright line between conduct that clearly rises to the level of persecution and conduct that falls short single incident of imp risonment or violence coupled with death threat may constitute persecution29 multiple beatings that

four things41 the applicant possesses characteristic or belief which motivates the persecutor to inflict harm on the applicant though the persecutor need not be motivated by punitive or malignant intent42 the persecutor is aware or could become aware that the applicantpossesses this belief or characteristic 43 the persecutor has the capability to inflict harm on the applicant and the persecutor has the inclination to harm the applicant44 although an applicant may establish th objective component of wellfounded fear by demonstrating that she has been specifically targeted for persecution or has already suffered harm such an individua lized showing is unnecessary showing of persecution inflicted on individuals similarly situated to the applicant is sufficient to establish the objective component45 regulations have adopt ed this approach by allowing the objective component of well founded fear to be met if the applicant establishes that 1 there is pattern or practice in the applicants country of origin to persecute groups of persons similarly s ituated to the applicant on account of race religion nationality membersh ip in particular social group or political opinion and 2 the applicant is included in and iden tifies with such groups so that his or her fear is reasonable46 withholding of removal requires clear probability of persecution if asylum is not available to an applicant she may alternatively pursue withholding of removal although th statutory and regulatory requirements for establishing persecution are similar to those underlying asylum an applicant who chooses this course must shoulder heav ier evidentiary burden instead of showing wellfounded fear of persecution an applicant must demonstrate clear probability of persecution47 the supreme court

courts treat it as less manding evidentiary standard than more likely than not49 past persecution persecution wellfounde d fear of persecution and clear probability of persecution are pr ospective standards this means that asylum and withholding of removal are prima rily forward looking measures that are better understood as mechanisms to protect individuals from future harm rather than as remedies to cure past harm despite the prospective nature of asylum and withholding of removal past persecution s till serves role in this framework first past persecution plays regulatory rather than statutory role in the asylum and withholding of removal frame work which means its role in the federal scheme was prescribed by agencies rather than c ongress second and mo re importantly past persecution in many instances serves as ev idence that the applicant may suffer future persecution and does not in itself warrant asylum or withholding of removal50 in other words asylum or withholding of rem oval is usually granted because of the risk of perspective harm not because the applicant is victim of past harm the department of homeland security and the department of justice have promulgated regulations in which show ing of past persecution can serve as substitute for showing of wellfounded f ear or clear probability of persecution so long as the persecution was committed on account of protected ground and the applicant is unable or unwilling to avail he rself of the protection of her country of origin owing to the persecution51 this demonstration of past persecution creates presumption of both well founded fear of persecution52 and clear probability of persecution53 at this point the burden shifts to the government to prove by preponderance of the evidence54

may still be granted through the exercise of the adjudicators discretion if the applicant demonstrates compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to her country of origin due to the verity of her past persecution59 or the applicant establishes that there is reasonable possibility that she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country60 on the other hand in

persecution and the protected ground or in other words nexus the fe deral courts have also agreed that the protected ground need not be the sole reas on for the persecution but rather under the mixed motive doctrine it has to be only part of the motive for the persecution66 third element belonging to protected ground in order to obtain either asylum or w ithholding of removal an applicant must show not only that she has suffered pers ecution but that it wa s inflicted on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion67 thus in order to obtain either as ylum or withholding of removal an applicant must show that she bel ongs to one of the protected grounds68 applicants who seek to obtain asylum or withholdi ng of removal through an fgm claim generally must show they belong to particular social group thus this report focuses on the law governing th particular social group ground membership in particular social group congress inserted the

generis in construing membership in particular social group by comparing it with the other numerated grounds in the statute72 the common trait the bia elucidated among the enumerated protected grounds was immutability in other words all persons who belonged to protected ground shared common immutable characteristic73 the bia elaborated on this notion by stating that in order to obtain asylum under the particul ar social group ground the persecution must be aimed at common immutable characteristic that is shared by all members of the particular social group74 the immutable characteristic may be an innate one such as sex color or kinship ties or in so circumstances it might be shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership but whatever the common characteristic that defines the group it must be one that the members of the group either cannot charge or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their indivi dual identities or consciences75 most of the federal appellate courts have adopted th is construction76 gender as particular social group while acosta contained language that appeared to recognize gender as an immutable characteristic courts have been disinclined in practice to recognize so cial groups defined solely by gender77 the closest court has come to acknowledging gender as sufficient in itself to constitute social group was when the third circuit in fatin v ins stated in dicta that while gender could be used as the sole character istic to link the members of particular social group to do so would require the app licant to also show that sex was the sole reason for the persecution78 although using gender as the sole characteristic of social group has proved unsu ccessful courts have been far more

other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat is an international treaty that specifically targets torture81 although the senate ratified cat in 1990 it was not until 1998 that congress passed the necessary implementing legislation82 the treaty is relevant for most asylum applicants because the department of homeland security promulgated regulations which allow applicants to obtain withholding of removal under the auspices of cat83 claim under cat differs from traditional withholding of removal in that it only requires more likely than not probability ie clear probability that the applicant would be tortur ed if returned to her country of origin84 thus while cat arguably covers narro wer category of conduct than traditional withholding of removal the applicant need not show that the torture was conducted on account of protected ground in the context of fgm ca t has limited salience because most applicants have little trouble establishing particular social group if they

also classifies fgm as form of persecution that can act as basis for refugee status91 ever since the bia declared fgm to be form of persecution in in re kasinga 92 there has been growing corpus of

she has wellfounded fear of fgm or in th case of withholding of removal clear probability of fgm and is ble to avail herself of the protection of her country of origin the applicant must also blish

particular social group as mentioned above gender alone as practical matter is almost never sufficient to act as protect ed ground for an asylum claim93 although gender satisfies the immutability criterion of acosta genderbased claims rarely prevail in courts because the applicant must show that she suffered persecution solely because she was female94 courts have been more willing to recognize social groups defined by gender in conjunction with other characteristics for example in in re kasinga the court upheld the applican ts fgmbased asylum claim by defining her particular social group as one constituting young wo men of the tchambakunsuntu tribe who have not had fgm as practiced by th at tribe and who opposed the practice95 thus at the time of this case it appeared that the bia considered this particular social group to be defined by this co mbination of traits 1 women 2 who personally opposed fgm 3 did not undergo fgm and 4 who belonged to particular tribe that 5 practiced fgm however most federal appellate courts do not appear to require showing that the social group include personal opposition to fgm or that group consist of women who had not undergone fgm they

returning to her country of origin thus while kasinga does categorize fgm as persecution it does not necessarily entail that someone who has already suffered fmg in the past is entitled to asylum the bia would later emphasize this distinction by ruling in subsequent case that past infliction of fgm could not serve as basis for asylum fgm categorically defined as persecution while kasingas holding is of limited scope it did clarify many questions about fgm when it served as basis for prospective asylum application as di scussed earlier the ty pes of harm which rise to the level of persecution are not fined by statute and are usually determined on casebycase basis in kasinga the bia categorically held that fgm as practiced by the applicants tribe was form of persecution97 the type of fgm at issue in kasinga was described as an extreme type involving cutting the genitalia with knives extensive bleeding and 40day recovery period98 other forms of fmg which involve the cutting away of portions of the female genita lia and the practice of suturing the vagina partially closed were also discussed99 after describing the particulars of these procedures the bia he ld that the level of harm these forms of fgm inflict on women can constitute per secution within the meaning of ina 101a42a100 it then characterized fgm as form of sexual oppression to ensure male dominance and exploitation practiced in order to overcome sexual characteristics of young women who ve not been and do not wish to be subjected to fgm101 prior to kasinga there were some questions as to whether fgm

the applicant was endangering he r daughter by asserting that she would bring her daughter with her if removed to her country of originas practical matter in order to raise successful fgmbased asylum claim an applicant only has to establish the like lihood of the harm eg whether there is wellfounded fear or clear probability the fgm will occur without having to argue whether the gravity of harm that the fg m poses is severe nough to merit either asylum or withholding of re moval relief thus it would ppear that all forms of fgm will qualify as persecution so long as the applicant is genuinely threatened with it if she returns to her country of origin103 daughters threatened with fgm some asylum applicants have successfully argued that they can claim asylum in their own right because they have wellfounded fear of persecu tion based on the fear that minor daughter currently within the united states with the appl icant will suffer fgm upon arrival at the applicants country of origin104 several federal circuits seem to at least implicitly accept this proposition105 however the sixth circuit s asserted that asylum will not be granted to an applicant whose da ughter is already located inside the applicants country of origin and threaten ed with fgm at the time the asylum claim was filed106 furthermore the seventh circuit has held that if an applicants daughter can avoid constructive deporta tion by remaining in the united states with her other parent the applicant cannot use the threat of fgm against her daughter as basis for her asylum claim107 the bia has also

past persecution when an applicant petitions for asylum status she usually must show that she has wellfounded fear of persecution an asylum applicant can create rebuttable presumption of wellfounded fear of persecution if she can show 1 past incident that rises to the level of persecu tion 2 that is on account of race religion nationality membership in social group or political opinion and 3 is committed by the government or by forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control109 similar test exists for those seeking to establish clear probability of persecution when applying for withholding of removal110 this presumption may be rebutted if the government can show that there has been fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant longer has either wellfounded fear asylum context or clear probability of persecution wit hholding of removal context in her country of origin111 continuing harm theory the leading federal appellate case on the treatment of fgm as past persecution is mohammed v gonzales 112 in this case the asylum applicant was woman from somalia who had already been subject to fgm113 the applicant claimed that the fgm constituted past persecution which warranted the presumption that she had wellfounded fear of future persecution114 the government contended that the past infliction of fgm was fundamental change in circumstances which should have re butted the presumption because having already suffered fgm the applicant would not be faced with the procedure in the future115 the ninth circuit rejected this argument the court instead analogized fgm to forced sterilization which had been classified in previous case as continuing harm that renders petitione r eligible for asyl um without more116 therefore like forced steriliz ation past infliction of fgm was judged to constitute continuing harm thus creating presumption of wellfounded fear of persecution that the government could not rebut although the eighth circuit agreed that showing of fgm is sufficient to create presumption of wellfounded fearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34587crs18 117 hassan v gonzales 484 f3d 513 518 8th cir 2007 118 mohammed 400 f3d at

presumption rebuttable117 rebuttable presumption theory alternatively the ninth circuit stated that even if fgm only created rebuttabl presumption of wellfounded fear the presumption would be difficult to rebut because of the risk of violence and gender persecution as evidenced by the applicant s fgm if the applicant was removed to her home country118 this alternative theory has been endorsed by the eighth circuit in hassan v gonzales which held that showing of past fgm would be sufficient to create presumption of wellfounded fear of future persecution because even though the risk of future fgm would be negligible the applicant could still suffer from forms of future persecution other than fgm119 thus this theory maintains that the past infliction of fgm does not constitute fundamental change in circumstances and the presum ption of wellfounded fear of future persecution is left preserved the bia argument agai nst continuing harm the bia has rejected both the continuing harm theory and the rebuttable presumption theory in in re at the bia ruled that if the government shows that the asylum applicant has already suffered fgm the presumption of well founded fear of persecution is rebutted120 the bia argued that fgm is onetime procedure limited to permanently removing parts of the female genitalia therefore once completed the procedure cannot be inflicted upon the applicant in the future b ecause the relevant parts of the female genitalia the fgm aims to remove have already been excised121 furthermore the bia rejected the theory that fgm constitutes continuing harm which creates an irrebuttable presumption of future persecution122 the bia claimed that the only reason forced sterilization is given continuing harm status is b ecause of statutory provision that expressly states that forced sterilization provides basis for asylum123 absent such statutory endorsement fro m congress the bia concluded that fgm should not be treated the sa as forced sterilization124 therefore the bia determined that the ninth circuit was incorrect in holding that fgm merited continuing harm status the ninth circuit anticipating the bi as objection had written in its analysis that the continuing harm concept arose out of case law and not from the statute according to that court the statutory provision regarding forced sterilization is unrelated to the persecution element of an asylum claim rather the statute onlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34587crs19 125 see mohammed 400 f3d at 800 fn 22 126 at 24 i n dec at 304 127 id 128 id at 299 see also 8 cfr

between past forced sterilization and the political opinion ground thereby automatically satisfying the on account of element in an asylum claim once showing of past forced sterilization is made125 therefore the ninth circuit reasoned if continuing harm originated from case law rather than statute courts are not constrained by statute nd could extend continuing harm status to fgm the bia argument against the rebuttable presumption the bia also rejected the notion that showing of fgm can create rebuttable presumption of wellfounded fear of future persecution126 this approach suggested by the ninth circuit in mohammed and adopted by the eighth circuit in hassan was dismissed by the bia as deviation from regulatory procedures127 specifically the bia held that although fgm is persecution regulations mandate that past infliction of fgm be deemed fundamental change in ci rcumstances this f undamental change in circumstances would negate the presumption of well founded fear of persecution that an act of persecution normally creates128 furthermore the bia cited regulation which states that if the applicants fear of future persecution is unrelated to past persecution the applicant bears the burden of establishing that the fear is well founded129 the bia in essence appears to require that showing of past persecution must create wellfounded f ear of identical future persecution130 if the past persecution renders an identical form of persecution in the future impossible then the past persecution will not create rebuttable presumption of wellfounded fear131 therefore according to the bia because fgm involves the permanent alteration or removal of female genitalia it can only be performed once and thus the very act of persecution itsel f effects fundamental chan ge in circumstances that negates the possibility of future persecution second circuit response to in re at the second circuit has been the only appellate cour t to date that has addressed in re at in bah v mukasey the second circuit held that the bia committed s ignificant error in its application of its own regulatory framework when reviewin g the fgmbased withholding of removal claims of the petitioners132 principally the second circuit found the reasoning the bia applied in at with regard to the rebuttable presumption theory was flawed

held that the bia mischaracterized fgm as onetime act133 it stated that there are many types of fgm which can be repeated notably the sewing shut of womans vagina which is only opened for purposes of sexual intercourse with her husband and then subsequen tly resewn ie infibulation134 furthermore the second circuit stated that the bia rred when it assumed that fgm was the only form of possible future harm relevant in the analysis135 the court stated nothing in the regulation suggests that the future threats to life or freedom must come in the same form or be the same act as the past persecution136 in order to demonstrate changed circumstances which would rebut the petitioners presumption of suffering future harm the government cannot rely so lely on showing that particular act of persecution suffered by the victim will not recur137 the court noted that other types of harm could befall the petiti oners once arriving at their countries of origin notably domestic abuse rape and sex trafficking138 in concurring opini on judge st raub wrote that he would also uphold the petitioners continuing harm theory139 although the majority opinion declined to address the continuing harm issue the straub concurrence concluded that the similarities between fgm and forced sterilization were too similar to ignore that is the reason why both forms of persecution were only inflicted once was because they only need to be inflicted once in order to cause lasting form of persecution he rejected the argument that forced sterilization was only given continuing harm status because congress statutorily defined it as form of persecution ra ther he concluded that the only reason congress enacted the statute was to reverse an earlier bia decision that had rejected forced sterilization as fo rm of persecution in other words all congress did was establish for forced sterilization what the bia did for fgm in kasinga which was to establish their ba sic qualifications for asylum and withholding of removal claims without ltering the larger regulatory framework governing such claims140 therefore since the continuing harm status of forced sterilization was not product of the statut ory enactment the s imilarities between the types of harm that forced sterilizati on and fgm inflict on their victims should militate conclusion that both inflicted forms of continuing harm141 however it is also important to stress that the majority opinion specifically declined to reach the merits of this theory and that judge sotomayor in separate concurrence emphasized that it would be imprudent for th court to address this issue when the administrative agency had yet to determin whether there were other grounds besides the petitioners past infliction of fgm which could rebut the presumption

general has the regulatory authority to review the decisions of the bia143 in re at has undergone review under this authority and s been vacated and remanded to the bia for further proceedings144 this means that the bias holding in in re at that past infliction of fgm constitutes changed circumstance rebutting the presumption of wellfounded fear or clear probability of future persecution longer controls in future bia deliberations thus past inf liction of fgm can now serve as basis for either asylum or withhol ding of removal claims the attorney generals reasoning was s imilar to that of the second circuit he noted that fgm was not necessarily onetime act as characterized by the bia because fgm is capable of repetition the attorney general c oncluded that there was basis for the boards legal conclusion that the past infliction of female genital mutilation by itself rebuts any presumption of future female genital mutilation persecution145 similarly the attorney general also found that the bia was wrong in focusing on whether the asylee applicant would suffer identical future harm the appropriate focus of the inquiry according to the attorney general is whether future harm would be conducte d on account of the same statutory ground ie whether harm would be inflicted on account of the applicants social group146 because the bia failed to determine whic h social group the applicant belonged to but rather focused on the type of harm the applican t suffered the bia rroneously concluded that the applicants presumption of futu re persecution was rebutted in other words in order to determine whether there is changed circumstance such that the presumption of future harm is rebutted the bia should not have focused on whether fgm would recur but rather should have determined whether the applicant if repatriated to her country of origin was still threatened with any type of sufficiently severe future harm on account of being member of social group147 the bias humanitarian ground theory the bia has ruled in matter of sak and hah that prior infliction of fgm can alternatively serve as basis for an asylum claim on humanitarian grounds148 regulations found

level required to qualify as basis for as ylum without wellfounded fear of future persecution150 in that case the chinese red gu ard had subjected the applicant and his family to stoning burning and other forms of persecution on account of their religious beliefs151 because of his persecution the pplicant suffered loss of hearing and many psychological ailments152 by the time of the applicants deportation proceeding however china had liberalized many of its policies thus making it unlikely that the applicant would suffer th same level of pe rsecution if deported normally such changes in circumstances would rebut the presumption of well founded fear of pers ecution but regardless of this the bia held that the past persecution was so severe that standing alone it was sufficient to establish an asylum claim even without the wellfounded fear153 it appears that by citing matter of chen the bia now views fgm to be s imilar situation past persecution so severe that it results in continuing phy sical harm and discom fort which can act standing alone as basis for asylum ev without wellfounded fear of future persecution154 however because of the attorney generals vacatur of in re at it would now appear that prior infliction of fgm can create presumption of well founded fear of future persecution in asylum cases conclusion asylum and withholding of remova l based on fgm are longer limited to only prospective threats with respect to past infliction proof of having suffered fgm can create rebuttable presumption of either wellfounded fear or clear probability of persecution this presumption can s till be rebutted however and claim for asylum or withholding of rem oval denied upon demonstration that the applicant is longer threatened with future harm on account of her social group consequently the controlling factor in previous cases ie the distinction between whether the fgm has already occurred in the past or is instead prospective threat will most likely play an ancillary role in future fgm asylum cases in its pl ace it would seem far greater emphasis will be placed on how the social group is defined in these claims
