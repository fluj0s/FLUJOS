from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to wigleycgducaredu subject re question date thu sep 9 135225 2004 cc santer1llnlgov tom program and the input lks file program is adapted from one i had ended up little convoluted should work with any of the 4 cru temp data files crutem2v hadcrut2v for the russian grid point changing 4 59 to 4 57 will give box with data in from 1929 3rd file is my unix run file for files to channels cheers phil at 1220 09092004 d m r taplin wrote phil thanx looks very interesting i will look more when i get back to boulder it would help if you sent the program just to boulder also what are the numbers listed at the end of the lks file will you be reading email while away tom professor david taplin dsc coliemore house down thomas plymouth pl90bq uk from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleycgducaredu cc professor david taplin coliemorehotmailcom ben santer santer1llnlgov subject re question date wed 08 sep 2004 134444 0100 tom here are some files to look at and think about john lanzante has sent the locations of the 87 stations in the lks dataset i associated these with cru 5 deg grid boxes and calculated nh based on 54 sites sh 32 and global as one domain so to get the globe the cru way you need to average the nh and sh series all to 3 deg places the second line in all the results files is the count of stations i can do this as area if you want the cru data i used is the file hadcrut2v so this includes sst anoms over the ocean i can repeat this with the land only file used the variance corrected version there are 4 files 1 the lks stations this is what john sent with the latlong identifiers for the grid boxes on the front 24 nh sh and globe as one domain results the first file has fix in it this is to pick up the 5 deg square 8590s 5w0 that has the south pole data this square is where ive always put this data for the nh there were 54 sites and for the sh 32 site 9 wmo id 21504 is always missing even with hadcrut2v the site is located on an island in the laptev sea there isnt surface site anywhere near it i could move the location and pick up the nearest cru box but it will be over 5 deg of lat and 10 deg of long away its somewhat unusual for sonde sites not to have surface site near them i guess it just doesnt report its surface data im here until sept 15 then away for much of the time until end of october i could send you the program which should run with crutem2v or the nonvariance adjusted versions which you could pick up from the cru web site cheers phil at 1557 04092004 tom wigley wrote phil on sept 1317 i will be at meeting at the met office to do with report we are writing on trends in vert temp profiles as part of the us climate change science program ccsp it involves all the usual suspects seven chapters the last of which is equivalent to summary for policymakers for which i am the lead author various people are updating data sets and doing calculations of trends etc some of the surface numbers i found to be bit disturbing so i am asking for your opinion these are trends per decade for jan 1979 thru dec 2003 source globe 30s30n hadcrut2v 0169 0127 ncdc 0151 0146 era40 0113 0032 lks 0074 0056 1 cru and ncdc are consistent within the noise but i have one question how do both calculate globe 2 era40 is marginally ok relative to cru in globe but the tropics is alarmingly different the diff here accounts for the globe difference why is this which is better is this discussed in your paper with adrian 3 lks is the surface data from the corrected lks radiosonde data set the difference here must be partly due to coverage issues but i recall that years ago we saw difference between surface sonde and cru data have you done like with like comparison ie selecting the lks sonde sites and extracting the corresp cru and ncdc and era40 and if possible ncep data this seems to be pretty basic sanity check on the sonde data so if you have not done this already could you do it for please i think there is nice little grl paper here for the ccsp we are also giving trends etc over 19582003 so the real need is for full time series comparison over this period ie not just trends in other words what i would like you to produce is the monthly time series for the various data sets for the lks coverage if you dont know the lks site locations i can get these for you re going back to 1958 the sonde trop data have well known but not well explained problem over roughly 1958 to 19645 i am curious as to whether this shows up in the lks surface record i am also curious about the apparent 1976 jump some people have made lot of noise about this but i dont see it as major item in the global surface data so the q here is is is apparent in the restricted coverage of the sonde data i hope you can help i am leaving here on sept 7 to spend few days with friend of mine in plymouth you could contact thru him i am copying this to him so you can see his email thanx tom prof
