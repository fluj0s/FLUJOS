procedures december 31 1998 robert keith specialist in american national government government division congressional research service the library of congress abstract consideration of taxcut legislation is subject to two different sets of budget enforcement procedures first under the congressional budget act of 1974 the house and senate are required to adopt an annual budget resolution which is enforced by points of order when individual spending and revenue measures are considered second under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 taxcut legislation as well as any other legislation affecting revenues or direct spending is subject to payasyougo requirement tied to the sequestration process this report briefly assesses the application of these enforcement procedures to taxcut legislation it will be updated as developments warrant for additional reading see manual on the federal budget process crs report 98720 gov 184 pages taxcut legislation applicable budget enforcement procedures summary the house and senate leadership have indicated that taxcut legislation will be high priority on the legislative agenda for the 106th congress consideration of such legislation is subject to two different sets of budget enforcement procedures first under the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended the house and senate are required to adopt an annual budget resolution budget resolution policies are enforced by points of order when individual spending and revenue measures are considered the house and senate may use various means to waive or set aside these points of order if the budget resolution adopted in 1999 does not recommend tax cut then revenue legislation implementing such policy generally would be subject to point of order in the senate it would require 60 votes to waive such point of order in addition the senate has augmented its procedures with special payasyougo point of order that requires revenue and direct spending legislation to be deficit neutral over 10 years such point of order also would require 60 votes to be waived the budget resolution may include optional reconciliation instructions directing among other things that the house ways and means and senate finance committees develop taxcut legislation reconciliation legislation is considered under expedited procedures in the house and senate any taxcut legislation considered in the senate outside of the reconciliation process is subject to filibuster and 60 votes would be needed to invoke cloture the second set of enforcement procedures was established under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended under the 1985 act taxcut legislation as well as any other legislation affecting revenues or direct spending is subject to payasyougo paygo requirement the net effect of all such legislation enacted during session as recorded on paygo scorecard may not reduce the surplus or increase the deficit or else sequester would automatically occur reducing nonexempt direct spending programs by amounts sufficient to eliminate the violation in order to pass significant taxcut legislation in the 106th congress without incurring paygo violation under current procedures any revenue loss beyond the existing credits on the paygo scorecard would have to be offset by other revenue increases reductions in direct spending or combination of the two two alternatives to this approach include 1 by means of other legislation changing the budget enforcement rules or eliminating them altogether and 2 using directed scorekeeping provision in the taxcut legislation to instruct the director of the office of management and budget not to record the revenue losses on the paygo scorecard such provision however could require waiver of the prohibition in section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act against certain legislation changing the budget process in the senate the waiver would require 60 votes contents

legislation 4 payasyougo procedures 6 taxcut legislation applicable budget enforcement procedures background the house and senate considered significant taxcut legislation during the 105th congress but adjourned with unfinished business in this area in 1997 the two houses passed the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 august 5 1997 111 stat 788 1103 in response to budget resolution policy calling for an 85 billion tax cut over fy19982002 in 1998 disagreements between president clinton and congress and between the house and senate over the appropriateness of tax cut and its size coupled with the failure to adopt budget resolution for fy1999 stymied action on taxcut legislation on september 26 the house passed the taxpayer relief act of 1998 hr 4579 measure containing fiveyear tax cut amounting to about 80 billion but the senate took action on it before the 105th congress adjourned instead scaleddown package of tax changes was included in the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 october 21 1998 the house and senate leadership have indicated that taxcut legislation will be high priority on the legislative agenda for the 106th congress the purpose of this report is to assess briefly the procedural context for action on such legislation revenues and revenue legislation most of the revenues of the federal government arise automatically each year under permanent law revenuesalso called receiptsare income derived principally from the governments exercise of its sovereign powers they consist mainly of individual and corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes such as the social security payroll tax in addition revenues include excise taxes customs duties and tariffs certain fines fees and user charges gifts and donations and certain other income1 although the majority of revenue laws are permanent each congress typically considers many different measures affecting revenues the purposes behind these measures may range from routine extensions of expiring provisions and minor technical modifications in current law to major policy changes involving redistribution of the tax burden while most revenue legislation considered during session has modest or even negligible effects on the federal budget the house and senate usually consider at least one or two measures that have significant revenue impact 1 some funds received by accounts in the federal budget are treated as offsetting collections which are deducted from spending instead of being counted as revenue they involve businesslike or marketoriented activities or payments from one federal account to another crs2 measures with significant revenue impact usually involve changes in income social insurance or excise taxes rather than changes in fees tariffs and other forms of income some measures such as the economic recovery tax act of 1981 make deep tax cuts others such as the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 provide large tax increases and still others such as the tax reform act of 1986 are intended to be revenueneutral over multiyear period but may change revenues markedly in any given year jurisdiction and procedure in the house jurisdiction over revenue matters generally and other specific revenue matters is vested in the ways and means committee by clause 1s of rule x similarly in the senate paragraph 1i of rule xxv assigns jurisdiction over revenue matters generally and other specific revenue matters to the finance committee both committees also have jurisdiction over considerable portion of direct spending ie spending that is controlled outside of the annual appropriations process which includes such programs as social security and medicare revenue measures often are constrained in their scope solely to revenue matters such measures may range from the imposition or waiver of single tariff to extensive changes in the internal revenue code sometimes omnibus measures dealing with direct spending programs may include one or more revenue titles along with titles containing direct spending and other legislative provisions for example legislation pertaining to social security or medicare may contain provisions dealing with payroll taxes and other revenue features pertinent to the program as well as provisions dealing with the programs eligibility criteria and benefit payments in some instances such as for highway and aviation spending the ways and means committee and finance committee develop the revenue portion ie excise taxes of the legislation while other house and senate committees develop the spending portion during the 1980s and 1990s the ways and means committee and the finance committee also have developed revenue reconciliation bills in response to reconciliation directives in the annual budget resolution the constitution in article i section 7 requires that revenue measures originate in the house by custom the annual appropriations acts originate in the house as well in the house the jurisdiction of the ways and means committee as well as the prerogative of the house to originate revenue measures is protected by rule xxi clause 5b of the rule effectively bars other house committees from reporting legislation containing any tax or tariff measure and prohibits such amendments from being offered to other committees legislation similarly the clause bars house consideration of revenue provisions added by the senate to housepassed measure not reported by the ways and means committee the senate has comparable rule specifically to protect the finance committees jurisdiction but its jurisdiction is protected in the same manner as the jurisdictions of the other committees under senate rules and practices generally in addition the house changed rule xxi in the 104th congress to require threefifths vote to pass legislation containing an increase in federal income tax rates and to bar retroactive increases in federal income tax rates crs3 framework for budgetary enforcement two separate sets of enforcement procedures have bearing on the consideration of taxcut legislation first the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended established points of order that can be raised against legislation in violation of budget resolution policies second the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 the budget enforcement act of 1997 and other laws established the sequestration process to enforce discretionary spending limits and payasyougo requirement sequestration involves automatic acrosstheboard reductions in spending if certain budgetary goals are not met enforcement under the 1974 congressional budget act applies to individual measures as they are considered by the house and senate the 1985 balanced budget act is enforced by the executive in strict conformance with statutory requirements at the end of session after congressional action has ceased on the basis of the net effect of all enacted legislation neither set of enforcement procedures is absolutely binding the house and senate sometimes waive provisions of the 1974 act during the consideration of legislation on few occasions congress and the president have enacted legislation suspending canceling or modifying sequester that had taken effect there have been sequesters in recent years congressional budget process the congressional budget process entails consideration each year by the house and senate of budget resolution that establishes congressional budget policies over multiyear period covering five or more fiscal years the budget resolution focuses on budget policies at an aggregate level specific program decisions are left to the committees with jurisdiction over revenue and spending programs in some years the house and senate use an optional reconciliation process to implement key budget resolution policies congressional budget resolution under established budget resolution practices any significant taxcut policy should be reflected in the regular annual budget resolution considered by the house and senate if procedural difficulties are to be avoided as required by section 301a of the 1974 act the taxcut policy would be reflected in the budget resolution primarily in 1 the aggregate revenue levels and 2 the amounts by which the aggregate revenue levels should be changed in this case reduced the aggregate revenue levels for the first fiscal year and the sum of all the fiscal years covered by the budget resolution are enforced by point of order in section 311a of the 1974 act under this approach the aggregate revenue levels for these two time periods serve as floors any legislation that would cause the estimated levels of total revenues to fall below the floors would be subject to point of order crs4 failure to provide for tax cut in the initial budget resolution generally would make legislation providing such tax cut subject to point of order in the senate it would require 60 votes to waive such point of order2 aside from waiving the point of order the only way to avoid it would be to adopt second budget resolution reflecting taxcut policy3 during the early 1980s however congress abandoned the practice of adopting more than one budget resolution in year due to the difficulty of doing so several years ago the senate adopted payasyougo rule as part of budget resolution to augment statutory procedures discussed below applicable to direct spending and revenue legislation4 the rule requires that direct spending and revenue legislation be deficit neutral but it differs from the statutory requirement in two respects first the test of deficit neutrality applies solely to the measure under consideration at the time not to the net effect of all legislation enacted during the session second the rule covers longer time framenot just to the first year and the sum of the five years covered by the budget resolution but to an additional five years as well the senates 10year payasyougo rule remains in effect through fy2002 unless the senate chooses to extend it in order to waive the rule 60 votes are required reconciliation legislation beginning in 1980 the house and senate have regularly used the reconciliation process to enact major components of budget resolution policy reconciliation is an optional process authorized by section 310 of the 1974 act under which legislation implementing budget resolution policies is considered in an expedited fashion with significant time limitations and restrictions on amendments reconciliation involves two separate steps in the first step reconciliation directives are included in the budget resolution in the case of tax cuts for example reconciliation directives could instruct the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee to reduce revenues by specified amounts over the period covered by the budget resolution in the second step the instructed committees submit legislative recommendations to their respective budget committees the budget committees then combine the legislative recommendations usually in single omnibus bill without any substantive revision the reported reconciliation bill usually is modified significantly during initial floor action and subsequent conference proceedings 2 this waiver as well as similar senate waivers requires the affirmative vote of three fifths of the members duly chosen and sworn ie 60 of the 100 senators in instances when some senate seats are vacant the required number of votes for waiver could be less than 60 3 the point of order would not apply if declaration of war was in effect 4 in its current form the senate rule is section 202 of the fy1996 budget resolution hconres 67 104th congress 109 stat 10191021 crs5 in some cases the house and senate have pursued revenue changes under reconciliation separately from spending changes choosing not to incorporate both types of changes into single omnibus bill for example in the 1982 reconciliation process revenue changes were included in the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 while spending changes were included in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1982 pl 97253 similarly the 1997 reconciliation process led to the enactment of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 as well as the taxpayer relief act of 1997 reconciliation directives may even provide for the possibility of action on more than one reconciliation bill containing significant revenue provisions in 1996 for example the reconciliation directives in the budget resolution for fy1997 hconres 178 104th congress anticipated the possibility of three separate reconciliation bills section 201a which pertained to reconciliation directives to house committees identified separate submissions for 1 welfare and medicaid reform and tax relief 2 medicare preservation and 3 tax and miscellaneous direct spending reforms the threestage interdependent reconciliation procedure was intended to allow for consideration of taxcut bill in concert with reconciliation bills achieving savings in medicare medicaid welfare and other direct spending programs as the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on hconres 178 indicated the house conferees note that the multireconciliation process provides maximum flexibility to achieve the changes in spending and the tax relief assumed in this conference report for example any of the spending or revenue changes assumed in the first bill couldif not enactedbe achieved in the third bill moreover the reconciliation committees are permitted to exceed the savings assumed in each of the reconciliation bills nevertheless the process still requires reconciled committees ultimately to meet their targets whether incrementally through the separate reconciliation bills or solely through the third bill5 one option available under this approach was to consider taxcut legislation after the cuts had been paid for by the enactment of spending reductions in the senate the byrd rule section 313 of the 1974 congressional budget act bars the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation measures6 legislation providing tax cut for the years covered by the budget resolution is accommodated by the byrd rule so long as the estimated revenue effects of the legislation are consistent with the amounts of the reconciliation directives but tax cuts extending beyond this period would be considered extraneous under section 313b1e in most major tax bills revenue changes generally are permanent in nature accordingly this portion of the byrd rule potentially threatens major taxcut legislation in the senate unless it is circumvented in some fashion waivers of the byrd 5 see page 81 of the conference report hrept 104612 june 7 1996 6 for more information on the rule see the senates byrd rule against extraneous matter in reconciliation measures by robert keith crs report 97688 gov updated september 9 1998 30 pages crs6 rule require 60 votes with regard to consideration of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 the senate considered the bill under unanimous consent agreement that required the taxcut effects of the bill to be considered in conjunction with the direct spending savings of the other reconciliation bill7 the savings in the other reconciliation bill the balanced budget act of 1997 were largely permanent in nature too and offset the tax cuts therefore point of order under the byrd rule was avoided major revenue legislation also has been enacted since 1980 outside of the reconciliation process for example the social security amendments of 1983 intended to raise revenue and the tax reform act of 1986 intended to be deficit neutral over multiyear period were not reconciliation bills any taxcut legislation considered in the senate outside of the reconciliation process however is subject to filibuster and 60 votes would be needed to invoke cloture payasyougo procedures section 252 of the 1985 balanced budget act as amended imposes payas yougo paygo requirement on revenue and direct spending legislation considered through fy20028 when paygo legislation is enacted its effects on the deficit or surplus are registered by the director of the office of management and budget omb on multiyear paygo scorecard under the paygo process revenues and direct spending for fiscal year from new laws when combined with the balance on the paygo scorecard for that year from prior laws must not result in net increase in the deficit or net reduction in the surplus9 revenue reductions or direct spending increases are allowed so long as they are offset by the carryover balances or other new paygo laws violations of the paygo requirement as determined in sequestration report prepared by the omb director trigger paygo sequester at the end of congressional session under such sequester automatic reductions would be made in direct spending programs sufficient to eliminate any estimated net increase in the deficit or net reduction in the surplus although all direct spending is taken into account in determining whether paygo sequester is necessary10 only small subset of direct spending programs would be subject to the required spending 7 see the remarks of senator domenici in the congressional record of may 21 1997 at page s4873 8 the paygo procedures remain in effect for four additional years through fy2006 to deal with the outyear effects of legislation considered through fy2002 9 the paygo procedures exclude the offbudget social security trust funds and the postal service fund although the total federal budget incurred surplus in fy1998 70 billion for the first time in 29 years and surpluses in the total federal budget are projected well into the future the onbudget portion of the federal budget remains in deficit some argue that the paygo procedures would cease to apply if the onbudget portion of the federal budget moved to surplus 10 social security spending interest on the public debt and certain other mandatory spending is not considered to be direct spending for these purposes crs7 reductions reductions for the largest direct spending program subject to paygo sequester medicare are limited to four percent by the 1985 act in addition to controlling revenue and direct spending legislation through paygo procedures the 1985 act also sets statutory limits on discretionary spending ie spending controlled through the annual appropriations process the enforcement procedures for the paygo requirement on the one hand and the discretionary spending limits on the other are separated by firewall savings made on one side of the firewall cannot be used to the advantage of programs on the other side for example the cost of taxcut legislation could not be offset by reductions in annual appropriations acts in order to avoid paygo sequester at the beginning of each session the president issues as part of his annual budget submission preliminary sequestration reports covering both the paygo requirement and the discretionary spending limits these reports provide an early warning regarding the possibility of sequesters at the end of the session and the potential magnitude of any actions that might be necessary to avoid them an update report is required to be issued in august and the final report is required to be issued within 15 days after congress adjourns the most currently available information obtained from the omb final sequestration report for fy1999 shows paygo credit of about 3 billion for fy2000 with smaller credits for each of the following years consequently the current paygo scorecard would allow taxcut legislation or legislation increasing direct spending to be enacted without triggering sequester but such legislation would have to be quite modest in its impact in order to pass significant taxcut legislation in the 106th congress without incurring paygo violation under current procedures any revenue loss beyond the existing credits on the paygo scorecard would have to be offset by other revenue increases reductions in direct spending or combination of the two as an alternative to this approach some members favor changing the budget enforcement rules so that reductions in discretionary spending could be used to offset revenue losses from tax cut or eliminating the paygo requirement altogether so long as surpluses are projected finally the house and senate could avail themselves of the approach used by the house in the taxpayer relief act of 1998 hr 4579 section 607 of the bill as passed by the house on september 26 1998 simply instructed the omb director not to make any estimates of changes in receipts on the paygo scorecard from the enactment of hr 4579 under section 607 had the measure been enacted into law the tax cuts would have taken effect and paygo sequester would have occurred any legislation that directly or indirectly changes the budget process is prohibited by section 306 of the 1974 congressional budget act unless it was reported by the house or senate budget committee as appropriate or unless the committee was discharged from further consideration this prohibition therefore needed to be waived so that the house could consider the directed scorekeeping provision in section 607 of hr 4579 the house did so by adopting special rule crs8 hres 552 that waived all points of order against consideration of the bill in the senate 60 votes are required to waive points of order under section 306 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30009
