have made significant progress in improving their education systems particularly in the last two decades governments have increased spending on education expanded cooperation with the united states the world bank and other donors and pledged to achieve certain educational milestones established through the organization of american states summit of the americas process latin america is close to attaining the millennium development goal mdg of having universal primary enrollment by 2015 with 97 of students enrolled in primary school the region is also making major progress towards ensuring that once enrolled students complete their primary education improvements in basic education have led to an average youth literacy rate of 96 exceeding the world average rate of 87 the region has also achieved gender parity in literacy performance crs2 and primary school enrollment rates unlike most other regions latin american countries now have more girls than boys enrolled in secondary schools and universities1 in recent years latin american governments have implemented variety of programs to increase the supply of and demand for education in their countries many of which have specifically targeted disadvantaged students and school districts in general the success of those programs has hinged upon the accuracy of their targeting mechanisms in reaching the poorest most disadvantaged students one recent review of education interventions in latin america suggests that providing free textbooks and creating classroom libraries are the most costeffective ways to improve equity in education other interventions that are thought to be effective when implemented in poor districts are in service teacher training programs and tutoring programs for students free food distribution programs while showing positive effects on some learning outcomes are not regarded as particularly costeffective education interventions2 on the demand side many countries in latin america have successfully boosted enrollments by providing compensatory cash transfers to families in exchange for keeping their children in school remaining challenges despite these recent improvements latin americas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22778 education indicators still lag behind the developed world and many developing countries of comparable income levels in east asia students from latin america tend to underperform on international assessment tests even when comparisons are limited to countries with similar income levels3 test scores on national exams for students across all education levels remain low with students from rural poor afrodescendant and indigenous households having less access to quality education than the general population in brazil nonwhite students score significantly lower than white students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds on national tests across the region indigenous people complete fewer years of schooling than nonindigenous people and have lower economic returns for each year of schooling completed4 these gaps in access to quality education are most pervasive in countries with high levels of income inequality in addition to equity issues grade repetition and dropout rates are still high particularly at the secondary level with boys tending to have higher dropout rates than girls this problem is particularly pervasive in the poorer countries of central america where dropout rates stood at roughly 52 in guatemala 53 in honduras and 41 in nicaragua in 20055 haiti the poorest country in the western hemisphere with primary 1

enrollment rate of some 67 and primary completion rate of less than 30 lags far behind other countries in the region on all education indicators6 few governments in latin america invest the percent of their budgets on education that is recommended by international education experts7 moreover most governments have devoted much larger percentage of their education budgets to funding primary schools and subsidizing public universities rather than secondary schools recent world bank study maintains that in order to reach secondary target enrollment rate of 85 latin america would need to double their current resource allocation level for secondary education which could be difficult given current resource constraints in many countries8 us education programs in latin america the united states
