for official use onlywhat is dod forensics figure 1the global war on terrorism gwot has produced emerging needs and capabilities for forensics across the spectrum of combatant operations the goal of dod forensics is to individualize identify associate and link people places things intentio ns activities organizations and events to each other dod forensics supports the full spectrum of everchanging emerging military operations and homeland defense by providing key enablers to meet traditional irregular di sruptive and catastrophic challenges multidisciplinary forensic scie nces contribute to examining sites identifying tracking and targeting the enemy locating and identifying indivi duals identifying the origin of arms ammunition and explosives determining the cause and manner of death and prosecuting offenders in court systems intelligence operations benefit from the rapid forensic exploitation of sites items and information enabling us and coalition fo rces to eliminate threats and to kill capture or prosecute enemies recently operations in the iraqi theater of operation ito have validated the importance of forensics in providing intelligence and battlefield awareness for military decision making and operations at all levels dod is rapidly pushing forensic capabilities forwar d into the ito to help the warfighter 1 identify insurgents

although the dod possesses considerable forensics capabilities see figure 2 th focus has been traditionally on investigative judicial and medical functions however emerging forensic capabilities also significantly aid the us and coalition forces intelligence operations resulting in the identification of friendly and enemy forces and th elimination of enemy threats through disruption target ing detention and subsequent prosecution analysis of forensic materials acts as force multiplier by enabling operating forces to identify enemies and add depth and scope to the intelligence picture items such as fingerprints and dna enable warfighters to identify specifically who handled an item such as an improvised explosive device ied and to connect particular person with certain place or events the resulting information often provides the usable intelligence moral and legal justification needed to target apprehend and prosecute terrorists or enemy combatants capabilities to collect analyz and exploit latent prints dna firearms signatures tool marks trace evidence and document and media exploitati on have all been employed in the ito with great ccess dod is transcending traditional uses of forensic science by becoming surge capable and focused on provid ing holistic and sustainable service to multiuse customer based worldwidefigure 3six forensic functions dod recognizes six forensics functions listed below these functions do not always occur sequ entially and they often occur in parallel order see figure 3 recognize this involves locating and distinguishing materials that have potential forensic value it may entail special methods to detect items preserve this involves protecting ma terials and data from the moment those items are recognized as holding potential forensic value materials must be protec ted and preserved by available reasonable measures marking packaging and tracking to prevent contamination loss or alteration collect this describes recovery of materials from site the sit is documented and contextual information is recorded within the parameters allowed by the situation and the materials accounte d for this often includes limited processing of specific ite ms or areas in an effort to detect additional forensicallyrelevant information presumptive testing of materials may also b involved analyze forensic analysis may occur from the recognition of materials and contextual informat ion at the site to indepth examination at mobile or tradit ional ie institutional labs presumptive testing of materials may be involved variet of factors the submitting units requ est expected use of the results time priorities available lab reso urces etc dictate the type of analyses and examinations that lab will perform store materials and associated information must be maintained until an issue is fully adjudicated or resolved policies and procedures should dictate proper disposition balancing information assurance with necessary retrieval capabilities is critical when storing data share once forensic analyses are completed results are catalogued and shared in accordance with policies and procedures interoperability is key to developing databases and retrieving information sharing information with the r elevant stakeholders to include the submitting unit is vitalfor official use only for official use onlyfigure 4operational process the specific activities performed to carry out the six for ensic functions comprise an operational process that is separate fro m but related to the forensic function s this process as depicted in figure 4 includes the activities of triage transfer exploitation and action each of which may occur in any or all of the forensic functions triage forensic materials are prioritized or triaged at nearly eve ry step of the operational process this begins at the site by deciding which materials might hold forensic value triage conti nues each time an individual handles or examines the materials the appropriate facility for analysis eg lab must be confirmedand whether the materials can indeed be analyzed triage also involves prioritizing which lab sections should receive which materials as well as how long the material s should be stored even the reporting and sharing of information is prioritized transfer transfer consists of physically transporting materials or transmitting electronic information once forensic materials are in the hands of those collecting them the materials and information are usually transferred to an approp riate location that allows for more complete analysis see transfer process in figure 8 exploitation exploitation is taking full advantage of any information for tactical operational or strategic purp oses after the information personnel and materials collected during operations are forensically anal yzed the resulting actionable intelligence is fed back into the operations processi n word exploitedto produce an advantage for followon actions exploitation uses the results of forensic analysis to produce an action action exploiting the results of forensic analysis may lead to such actions as targeting apprehension and prosecution of suspects or helping medical personnel resolve their issues once the appropriate action has been take n to exploit the results of the scientific analyses the operational process has been
