david m bearden resources science and industry division november 19 2008 abstract in 2005 the 109th congress approved new base realignment and closure brac round as the department of defense dod implements the new round issues for congress include the pace and costs of closing and realigning the selected installations and the impacts on surrounding communities the disposal of surplus property has stimulated interest among aﬀected communities in how the land can be redeveloped to replace jobs lost as result of the planned closures environmental contamination can limit the potential for economic redevelopment if the availability of funding or technological capabilities constrains the degree of cleanup needed to make the land suitable for its intended use although most of the properties on installations closed under the four earlier rounds in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 have been cleaned up and made available for redevelopment the most extensively contaminated properties remain in various stages of cleanup to make them suitable for their desired use cleanup began many years ago at 2005 round installations when they were still operational as result cleanup generally should be at more advanced stage upon closure compared to installations closed under earlier rounds when cleanup eﬀorts were less mature still installations closed under the 2005 round could face delays in redevelopment if communitys desired land use would require lengthy and costly cleanuphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22065 order code rs22065 updated november 19 2008 military base closures cleanup

the land suitable for its intended use alt hough most of the prope rties on installations closed under the four earlier rounds in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 have been cleaned up and made available for rede velopment the most extensively contaminated properties remain in various stages of cleanup to make them suitable fo r their desired use cleanup began many years ago at 2005 round installati ons when they were still operational as result cleanup generally should be at more advanced stage upon closure compared to installations closed under earlier rounds wh cleanup efforts were less mature still installations closed under the 2005 round coul d face delays in redevelopment if communitys desired land use would re quire lengthy and costly cleanup introduction following the collapse of the former sovi et union congress authorized the closure of certain military insta llations under four brac rounds in 1988 1991 1993 and 1995 these installations have been closed for many years and the majority of the properties have been made available fo r civilian purposes however cleanup efforts continue at some of the most contaminated properties delaying their reuse public desire for their redevelopment has motivated ongoing concer n about the pace and costs of cleaning up these remaining properties the completion of cleanup is of ten key factor in economic redevelopment because property cannot be used for its intended purpose until it is cleaned up to degree that would be suitable for that use in 2005 the 109th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22065crs2 1 see the brac commission report to the president for list of military installations selected for closure under the 2005 round at h ttpwwwbracgovfinalreporthtml 2 42 usc 9620h 3 42 usc 9620h3capproved new brac round1 although the department of defense dod is required to close and realign selected installations by 2011 there is statutory deadline for the cleanup of contaminated property the timing of cleanup will pend on response actions negotiated with federa l and state regulators capabilities of cleanup technologies and the amount of funding appr opriated by congress to support cleanup efforts this report explains the federal statutory requirements that govern the transfer and reuse of contaminated properties on closed military installations discusses the status of cleanup to prepare these properties for reuse examines estimates of costs to address remaining cleanup challenges and id entifies issues for congress cleanup requirements for property transfer and reuse as amended in 1986 the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla commonly referred to as superfund ge nerally requires the united states to clean up contaminated federa l property prior to transfer out of federal ownership2 this requirement applies to all contaminated property declared surplus to the needs of the federal government including property on closed military installations the agency with administrative jurisdiction over property usually administers and pays for the cleanup to satisfy the responsibility of th united states dod typically assumes this responsibility for closed military installations after property is transferred out of fe deral ownership the ited states remains liable for any original contamination found not to have been sufficiently remediated however the document transferring ownershi p typically guarantees cleanup only to level suitable for specific use and in so cases may include deed restriction prohibiting certain uses that would be considered unsafe relative to the level of cleanup performed considering this condition the unite d states is usually held responsible for further cleanup to the extent th at more work is found to be needed to make the originally agreedupon use safe if new owner later d ecides to use the property for another purpose that would require further cl eanup the new owner ordinarily is held responsible for additional cleanup costs to make th property suitable for that purpose property declared surplus to the needs of the federal government is typically transferred to local redevelopment aut hority lra responsible for implementing plan for civilian reuse while the administering agency generally must complete the cleanup prior to transfer out of federal ownership cercla authorizes early transfer under certain conditions including assuran ces that the cleanup will be carried out3 early transfer can speed the redevelopment process if it may be feasible for cleanup to occur in conjunction with redevelopm ent planning and constructi on or if shortterm use would be suitable for the existing level of contamination while cleanup proceeds to prepare the property for its eventual usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22065crs3 4 42 usc 9620e2 5 10 usc 2687 note 6 epa office of solid waste and emergency response land use in the cercla remedy selection process oswer directive 9355704 may 25 1995early transfer also may offer the potential to speed the redevelopment process in situations in which the recipient voluntarily agrees to administer and pay for the cleanup in such cases the property is usually sold at discounted price to offset the cleanup costs borne by the purchaser discounted price may lower purchasers initial costs to buy the property but the purchaser does assume so financial risk if the cleanup costs are greater than expected the cost of environmental insurance to limit this financial risk may offset some of the initial savi ngs gained from discounted price if property on closed installation still could be of use to the federal government dod may transfer it to another federal agency rather than make it av ailable to nonfederal entities if contaminated property remains in federal ownership cercla does not specify which agency has responsibility for the cleanup the determination of which agency performs the cleanup is subject to negotiation among the agencies involved and as such is an executive branch decisi on although the agency that caused the contamination most often ad ministers and pays for the cleanup disagreements over this responsibility sometimes arise in negotiating the transfer of jurisdiction congress has sometimes addressed such disagreements in legislation specifying agency responsibilities regardless of who administers the clea nup of closed military installation the environmental protection agency epa and state regulatory agencies oversee cleanup decisions to ensure that applicable requirements are met cercla specifically requires epa to take the lead in overseeing cleanup of federal fac ilities on the nati onal priorities list npl4 states usually oversee cleanup of federal facilities not on the npl the role of land use in cleanup decisions cercla generally requires cleanup actions to achieve levels of exposure to contamination that would be protective of human health nd the environment land use is critical in determining the potential expos ure risks and the cleanup actions needed to address those risks cleanup ge nerally is more extensive and more costly for land uses that would result in greater exposure risks cleanup typically is the most stringent and the most costly for residential use because of the greater likelihood of exposure among sensitive populations including children and th elderly cleanup is usually the least costly and the least stringent for industrial use as the exposure ri sks are not as great as amended the defense base closure and realignment act requires dod to give substantial deference to an lras redevelopm ent plan in determining the use of surplus property on closed military installations5 still the locally preferred use can be constrained if costs or technical challenges would make it infeasible to clean up property to certain degree epa guidan ce acknowledges that some uses may not be practical because of such challenges and indicates that cleanup goals may need to be revised which could result in diffe rent more reasonable land uses6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22065crs4 7 10 usc 2701 et seq 8 department of defense defense environmental

munitions dis posal facilities where munitions were presentprogram administration and funding dod administers defense environmental restoration program to carry out cleanup actions under cercla on military insta llations in the united states7 multiple defense appropriations accounts fund this program two defense ba closure accounts fund the cleanup of installations closed under the br ac rounds the 1990 account consolidates funding for the cleanup of installations clos ed prior to the 2005 round this account is now entirely devoted to cleanup as these insta llations were closed many years ago the 2005 account funds the cleanup of inst allations being closed under the 2 005 ro und most of this account currently funds the actions necessary to close and realign the missions of the installations as these acti ons are completed greater portion of the 2005 account will be devoted to cleanup to prepare surplus properties for reuse the cleanup of realigned inst allations that remain in active us will be funded out of the defense environmental restoration acc ounts that support cleanup of ac tive installations see the estimated costs section of this report for the amount of funding spent on the cleanup of closed installations over time out of the base closure accounts status of cleanup to manage cleanup efforts dod divides each installation into di screte sites ie parcels of land based on the nature and boundary of conta mination one installation may contain numerous sites with differing types of contamination as of the end of fy2007 dod had identified total of 5356 sites on hundreds of installa tions closed under all five brac rounds where contamination was known or suspected to be present8 these sites include those on installations that are in the process of closing under the 2005 round the vast majority of sites on brac installations were c ontaminated with hazardous substances ie chemical contaminants but some sites contained abandoned or discarded munitions on former training ranges and munitions disposal facilities9 congress enacted specific authorities for the cleanup of munitions sites in the national defense authorization act for fy2002 pl 107107 see crs report rs22862 cleanup of us military munitions authorities status and costs by david m bearden dod reported that planned response actions were complete at 70 of the 5356 sites it had identified through fy2007 response was required or expected at 14 of the sites because investigations revealed that the potential for exposure to contamination was within an acceptable range based on applicab standards response actions were pending at 10 of the site inventory with varyin g stages of progress among individual sites ranging from the assessment phase to the c onstruction of cleanup re medies evaluations were pending at 6 of the sites leaving much uncertainty as to the extent of contamination at those locati ons and the cleanup actions th at will be required sites requiring further response actions generally have been made available for their intended use some sites wher response actions were not co mplete also have been madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22065crs5 available

sum of brac cleanup sites that dod reported differed from the sum of sites it reported by individual round resulting in 5415 total sites instead of 5356 this difference appeared to result from the inclusion of 59 sites that dod did not attribute to individual brac rounds of these 59 sites 24 did not require response actions 32 were not yet evaluated and 3 had response actions planned or under way considering that the cleanup of 2005 round in stallations began many years ago when these installations were still operational cleanup generally s hould be at more advanced stage upon closure than experi enced under earlier rounds when cleanup efforts were less mature as of the end of fy2007 planned response actions were complete or not required at half of the sites on 2005 round in stallations leaving much of the property inventory suitable for reuse however site s where response actions were complete would have been cleaned up to level compatible with military use at that time if other uses are desired after closure add itional cleanup may be needed estimated costs through fy2007 dod had spent nearly 73 billion out of the base closure accounts over time to clean up contaminated s ites on installations closed under all five brac rounds to prepare these properties for reuse in march 2007 dod estimated that another 39 billion would be needed to complete all planned clea nup actions dod estimated the future cleanup cost s based on its most recent know ledge of conditions at the sites presented in table 1 dod periodically revises its estimates as more is learned about the type and level of c ontamination at each site and the actions that federal and state regulators will seek to address potential risks in effect these estimates are moving targets that change as more information becomes available to project the costs of future actions uncertainties about the degree of cl eanup that ultimately w ill be required at some sites make it challenging to accurately estimate the total costs to complete cleanup table 2 presents the past and estimated future costs to clean up contaminated sites at closed military installations by individual brac

not include program management and other support costs costs incurred only reflect funds spent on cleanup out of the base closure accounts the defense environmental restoration accounts funded cleanup when the installations were in active military use breakout of this funding is not readily available b the sum of all brac cleanup costs that dod reported differed from the sum of costs it reported by individual round resulting in higher past cost of 7307310000 thro ugh fy 2007 and higher estimated future cost of 3881533000 this difference appeared to result from the inclusion of costs associated with 59 brac sites that were not attributed to individual rounds some attention has been drawn to the imp act that potentially higher cleanup costs could have on the savings expected from brac round the closure of litary installation results in annual savings in operational expenses but cleanup costs to prepare decommissioned properties for reuse can reduce these savings however some of the cleanup costs would have been incurre d regardless as dod still is required to clean up its active installations to degree that would be suitable for military purposes issues for congress the amount of time and resources needed to complete the cleanup of closed military installations generally depends on the level of contamination on thos properties and the actions selected to make them suitable for civilian reuse cleanup can take many years in some instances as the continuing cleanup of certain installations closed between 1988 and 1995 demonstrates however the genera lly more advanced stage of cleanup at 2005 round installations anticipated upon closure ma allow contaminated properties to become available for reuse more quickly still th availability of f unding and capabilities of cleanup technologies could limit the feasibility of cleanup at some installations making certain land uses impractical and posing challenges to econo mic redevelopment it is difficult to ascertain whether dod s cleanup cost estimates are reasonable approximation of the funding that will be needed to prepare closed in stallations for reuse because the civilian uses of installations to be closed in the 2005 round have yet to be decided dods cost estimates are based on gree of cleanup that would be compatible with recent military use if property were to be used for other purposes that would result in higher risk of exposure to contamin ation more stringent cleanup likely would be required to make the property suitable for that use in these circumstances more time and resources could be needed to co mplete cleanup than dod has estimated
