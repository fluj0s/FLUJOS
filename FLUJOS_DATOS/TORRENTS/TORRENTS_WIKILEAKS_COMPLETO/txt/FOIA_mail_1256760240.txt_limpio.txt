to hear that you appear to have recovered from your recent illness sufficiently to post response to the controversy surrounding the use of the yamal chronology 5httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffayamal2009cautiouscautioushtm and the chronology itself 6httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffayamal2009 unfortunately i find your explanations lacking in scientific rigour and i am more inclined to believe the analysis of mcintyre 7httpwwwclimateauditorgp7588 can i have straightforward answer to the following questions 1 are the reconstructions sensitive to the removal of either the yamal data and strip pine bristlecones either when present singly or in combination 2 why these series when incorporated with white noise as background can still produce hockeystick shaped graph if they have as you suggest low individual weighting and once you have done this please do the courtesy of answering my initial email dr dr keiller original message from keiller donald sent 02 october 2009 1034 to kbriffaueaacuk cc pjonesueaacuk subject yamal and paleoclimatology dear professor briffa my apologies for contacting you directly particularly since i hear that you are unwell however the recent release of tree ring data by cru has prompted much discussion and indeed disquiet about the methodology and conclusions of number of key papers by you and coworkers as an environmental plant physiologist i have followed the long debate starting with mann et 1998 and through to kaufman et 2009 as time has progressed i have found myself more concerned with the whole scientific basis of dendroclimatology in particular 1 the appropriateness of the statistical analyses employed 2 the reliance on the same small datasets in these multiple studies 3 the concept of teleconnection by which certain trees respond to the global temperature field rather than local climate 4 the assumption that tree ring width and density are related to temperature in linear manner whilst i would not describe myself as an expert statistician i do use inferential statistics routinely for both research and teaching and find difficulty in understanding the statistical rationale in these papers as plant physiologist i can say without hesitation that points 3 and 4 do not agree with the accepted science there is saying that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof given the scientific political and economic importance of these papers further detailed explanation is urgently required yours sincerely dr don keiller emerging excellence in the research assessment
