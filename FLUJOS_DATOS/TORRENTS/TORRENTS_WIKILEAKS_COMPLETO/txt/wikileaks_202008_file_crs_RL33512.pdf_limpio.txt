land and marine transportation systems are designed for accessibility and efficiency two characteristics that make them vulnerable to attack the difficulty and cost of protecting the transportation sector from attack raises core question for policymakers how much effort and resources to put towards protecting potential targets versus pursuing and fighting terrorists while hardening the transportation sector from terrorist attack is difficult measures can be taken to deter terrorists the focus of this report is how best to construct and finance system of deterrence protection and response that effectively reduces the possibility and consequences of another terrorist attack without unduly interferi ng with travel commerce and civil liberties for all modes of transportation one can identify four principle policy objectives that would support system of deterrence and protection 1 ensuring the trustworthiness of the passengers and the cargo flowing through the system 2 ensu ring the trustworthiness of the transportation workers who operate and service the vehicles assist the passengers or handle the cargo 3 ensuring the trustworthiness of the private comp anies that operate in the system such as the carriers shippers agents and brokers and 4 establishing perimeter of security around transportation facilities and vehicles in operation the first three policy objectives are concerned with preventing an attack from within transp ortation system such as occurred on september 11 2001 the concern is that attackers could once agai n disguise themselves as legitimate passengers or shippers or workers to get in position to launch an attack the fourth policy objective is concerned with preventing an attack from outside transportation system for instance terrorists could ram bombladen speed boat into an oil tanker as they did in october 2002 to the french oil tanker limberg or they could fire shoulderfired missile at an airplane taking off or landing as they attempted in november 2002 against an israeli charter jet in mombasa kenya achieving all four of these objectives is difficult at best and in some modes is practically impossible where limited options exist for preventing an attack policymakers are left with evaluating options for minimizing the consequences from an attack

consists of two basic principles riskbased approach for allocating limited security resources to where they are considered most needed and multilayered strategy that establishes redundancies to thwart potential terrorist attack the riskbased approach implemented by the tsa has been criticized by some who believe that an overemphasis on allocating resources to screening airline passengers has left the system vulnerable to attacks in other areasnamely air cargo operations airport access controls protecting airliners from shoulderfired missiles and the security of general aviation aircraft in essence these critics argue that the implementation of aviation security policy since september 11 2001 has focused too heavily on protecting aircraft from past attack scenariossuch as suicide hijackings and luggage bombs carried out by airline passengersand has not given enough attention to other potential vulnerabilities given the emphasis on protecting against bombings and suicide hijackings the multilayered concept for aviation security is most apparent in the protection of passenger airliners passengers undergo prescreening to check their names against lists of known and suspected terrorists then passengers and their carryon items are screened and checked baggage is passed through explosive detection systems eds prior to aircraft boarding once onboard security measures such as air marshals hardened cockpit doors and armed pilots provide added layers of security to thwart an attempted hijacking the principle objectives of these measures are to prevent aircraft bombings and hijackings by terrorist passengers however the effectiveness of the tsa s implementation of virtually all of these security layers has been brought into question at some time or another since its creation g18g138g156g156g142g151g144g142g155g561g18g155g142g156g140g155g142g142g151g146g151g144g561 efforts to improve passenger prescreening have be impacted by concerns over the adequacy of measures to protect fliers personal information and not infringe upon their civil rights critics argued that the tsas everexpanding vision for prescreening was to include data mining of commercial and government databases to look fo r indicators that someone may pose threat and searches of notoriously inaccurate criminal databases these concerns were spurred by vague statements issued by the tsa as to how it might authenticate passenger identity and check for possible links to terrorism along with media reports linking passenger prescreening to controversial proposals such as the department of defenses total information awareness program to detect terrorists by mining personal data this controversy ultimately led the tsa to scrap its proposed enhanced passenger prescreening system the computer assisted passenger prescreening ii capps ii in august 2004 and pu rsue enhanced prescreening capabilities under new system called secure flight while secure flight is touted to be significantly scaled down approach to prescreening compared to capps ii concerns over data protections and redress procedures for passengers falsely identified by the system have also delayed its deployment provisions in the fy2008 homeland security appropriations act pl 110161 like prior appropriations measures prohibit the tsa from fully deploying the secure flight program until these ongoing concerns are adequately addressed and also prohibit the use of commercial data or the transfer of passenger data to nonfederal entity while commercial databases have potential to authenticate the identity of passengers concerns have been raised about tsas past handling of passenger data in manner that was not fully explained to the public leading to this restriction on the transfer of personal data between the government and private entities other than the initial httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33512g22g155g138g151g156g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152g151g561

11053 section 1605 would require the tsa to submit to congress pl an for testing and implementing an advanced passenger prescreening system to replace the current fly and selectee lists distributed to airlines for vetting passengers recently privacy advocates have raised considerable concerns over the automated targeting system ats datamining program for assessing the risk of all international travelers as well as freight carried on international flights recent public disclosure regarding the scope of this program and associated data collection and data retention policies in november 2006 have renewed debate over whether certain passenger information collection and analysis practices unduly infringe upon privacy rights or whether they are necessary actions to assess terrorism risks to aviation provisions in pl 11053 w ould require the dhs to establish an office of appeals and redress that would be charged with implementing timely and fair process for airline passengers delayed or denied boarding due to suspected misidentifications during the prescreening process the tsa has also implemented registered traveler rt program that is intended to speed the passage through security checkpoints of frequent fliers who voluntarily submit background information and biometric identifiers initial trials of the rt program concept concluded in october 2005 and the tsa has launched rt programs operated by multiple vendors at several airports nationwide according to the tsa it is up to individual airports to determine if they wish to participate in this program as tsa moves forward with rt the airline industry which once backed this program as means to reduce hassles for frequent fliers now characterizes the manner in which it is being implemented as having limited and questionable benefit lingering concerns are that the program is not universal nor is it available at all airports also use of the program as testbed for streamlined screening technologies and procedures has thus only provided limited benefits and reductions in travel hassles to participants while the potential benefits of the rt program have not been fully realized congress has included language in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 1 10161 directing the tsa to establish an international rt program that incorporates biometrics and epassport technologies to be used in conjunction with us visit and the visa waiver program under the existing rt program some international carriers have been participatin g for outbound flights originating from jfk and newark liberty

passengers for threat objects without causing undue delays and hassles to travelers while the tsa is usually keeping passenger wait times below the stated objective of 10 minutes at smaller airports average passenger wait times at major airports are typically greater further audits of airport screening have concluded that screener performance still needs improvement the department of homeland secu rity office of inspector general found that screener training screening technology policies and procedures and management and supervision of screening operations all contributed to observed deficiencies in screener performance also the government accountability office gao documented results of covert testing of airport security checkpoints demonstrating deficiencies in detecting improvised explosives and incendiary devices concealed on passengers and in their carryon items despite httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33512g22g155g138g151g156g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152g151g561

secondary screening for explosives on passengers1 the 911 commission recommended that the tsa give priority attention to implementing technology and procedures for screening passengers for explosives something not currently done routinely at screening checkpoints provisions to improve checkpoint technologies to detect explosives were included in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 hereafter the terrorism prevention act to address the issue of detecting explosives carried by passengers the tsa pilot tested walkthrough trace detection portals and has implemented procedures for conducting patdown searches of passengers for explosives full deployment of the walkthrough trace detection po rtals or puffer machines for use in secondary screening of selected passengers has been part of the tsas strategy for screening passengers for explosives but this initiative has been put on hold due to maintenance issues with deployed systems the effectiveness of the strategy has also been brought into question by the recent foiled plot to bomb usbound airliners using liquid explosives the tsa is working to identify strategies and technologies that more completely address the explosives threat posed by passengers and carryon items provisions in pl 11053 see section 1607 would require the tsa to finalize within 30 days the strategic plan for checkpoint explosives detection required by the terrorism prevention act and fully implement the plan within one year of enactment the act also contains provisions see section 1612 that would eliminate the cap on the systemwide number of tsa screeners and would require specialized training for screeners on security skills such as behavioral observation and analysis explosives detection and document examination the act directs the tsa to hire sufficient personnel to ensure adequate aviation security and reduce average securityrelated delays to less than 10 minutes the act creates separate checkpoint security screening fund specifying that 250 million in security fees collected during fy2008 be deposited into this fund see section 1601 amounts deposited into the fund would be available for research development deployment and installation of equipm ent to improve the detection of explosives at passenger checkpoints the act also directs the tsa to carry out pilot study to examine technologies to improve the security at exits to airport secured areas see section 1613

key issue in the debate over aviation security immediately following september 11 2001 was whether airport security screeners should be federalized at that time airport screening operations suffered from high turnover poor supervision and training low wages and lack of regulatory oversight all of these factors were believed to have contributed to poor performing and highly vulnerable screening system federalizing the screener workforce was offered as potential solution to address these deficiencies however while congress ultimately resolved to federalize the screener workforce at most airports under tsa the act also set up pilot program using contract screeners at five airports and gave all airports the option to request private screeners on an airportbyairport basis starting november 19 2004 there has been very little interest in this option among airports where federal screeners are deployed one factor that may have limited 1 us government accountability office aviation

small amount of cargo carried on passenger airplanes is physically inspected the 911 commission recommended that tsa intensify its efforts to identify track and screen potentially dangerous cargo congress responded by increasing funding for air cargo security operations and research to 115 million in fy2005 compared to 85 million in fy2004 and designating funds for expanding the known shipper program for vetting shipments on passenger aircraft increasing oversight of cargo security and continuing research and development of technologies to improve air cargo security in both fy2006 and

cargo screening the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 11053 section 1602 contains provision that would require screening of all air cargo placed on passenger aircraft using methods such as xray systems explosives detection systems explosives trace detection tsacertified canine teams or physical searches with manifest verification in manner that provides level of security equivalent to the screening of passengerchecked baggage the provision would phasein the percentage of cargo required to be inspected setting these levels at 50 within 18 months and 100 within three years of enactment the measure is opposed by various stakeholders in the air cargo industry that believe its requirements are overly burdensome and costly 2 the 911 commission also recommended deployin g at least one hardened cargo container on each passenger airliner for carrying suspect carg while this recommendation was reflected in terrorism prevention act provision mandating study of the proposal to deploy blastresistant cargo containers the 911 commission noted that this is progressing slowly pl 11053 contains provision that would require the dhs to complete its evaluation of this pilot program by january 1 2008 and based on this evaluation provide hardened cargo containers for riskbased deployment on commercial flights under this provision the cost of acquiring maintaining and replacing hardened cargo containers would be provided for by the dhs see pl 11053 section 1609 while hardened containers are designed to mitigate the threat of terrorist bomb carried in cargo shipment or luggage some policymakers believe that the only effective way to mitigate such threat is to screen all cargo placed on passenger aircraft as is currently done for checked baggage as noted above pl 11053 contains provision that would require 100 physical inspection of all cargo placed on passenger aircraft within three years the tsa however has cautioned that such an approach is not technically and logistically feasible at the present time without unduly impacting cargo operations on passenger aircraft the tsa has instead proposed strategic plan calling for the use of riskbased prescreening techniques to identify cargo for targeted inspection or exclusion from carriage on passenger aircraft and threefold increase in random inspections the tsa has been working on freight assessment system for assigning risk to cargo shipments and targeting screening and inspection efforts on elevated risk cargo it is anticipated that the tsa will introduce this system sometime in fy2008 in addition to improving the screening of cargo placed on passenger aircraft improvements in security programs for allcargo operations are planned to protect against unauthorized access to large allcargo aircraft under new cargo security rules secured areas of airports are being expanded to include cargo operations areas thus requiring criminal background checks and security threat assessments for an estimated 50000 additional airport workers the new regulations also impose requirements on freight forwarders that ship by air referred to as indirect air carriers and require security threat assessments for workers with access to air cargo including an estimated 51000 offairport employees of freig ht forwarding companies also under these regulations an industrywide database of known shippers has been established and is being maintained by tsa to allow freight forwarders and airlines to vet cargo shipments 2 house to consider bill today re quiring additional

measures for general aviation aircraft are in their estimation weak and practically nonexistent general aviation operators have countered that they have been overburdened by unnecessary airspace and airport restrictions general aviation restrictions are most prevalent in the washington dc area where the city is encircled by 15mile radius flight restricted zone frz in which general aviation operations are significantly limited and larger air defense identification zone adiz where pilots must strictly adhere to special air traffic control procedures in august 2005 the dhs implemented security plan permitting certain general aviation flightsmostly large charter and corporate operationsto resume at washington reagan nati onal airport dca which is located at the center of the flight restricted area at various times flight restrictions have also been put in place over new york city chicago and elsewhere general aviation pilots have been restricted from flying over disney theme parks and over stadiums during major sporting events leading some general aviation advocates to question whether special interests were using the umbrella of security concerns to curtail unwanted advertising overflights general aviation advocates also point to large number of restricted airspace violationsmore than 1000 per year since the terrorist attacks of 2001as evidence that securityrelated restrictions are overly comp lex and too broad in scope almost onehalf of these violations occurred in the airspace around washington dc where complex communications procedures have been put in place over wide area the faa reduced the size of the washington adiz to 30mile ring in august 2007 but imposed speed restrictions within that ring as well as inside larger 60mile ring below 18000 feet most small general aviation aircraft are not affected by this new speed restriction which exceeds the capability of most small light pistonpowered aircraft and is largely designed to aid in early detection of fastmoving aircraft that may pose threat to critical sites in the washington dc area also about onequarter of airspace violations have occurred in airspace temporarily restricted around sites during presidential visits the scope of restricted airspace around sites visited by the president has been of particular concern to general aviation operators because the size of these areas has grown significantly identifying the boundaries of these temporary restrictions is often difficult for pilots and systems for disseminating information regarding the location and effective times of restrictions are imperfect securing general aviation operations continues to be significant challenge because of the diversity of operations aircraft and airports measures put in place thus far such as the airport watch program and tsa s general aviation security guidelines rely heavily on the vigilance of the pilot community to detect and report suspicious activity in the

few years illustrate the vulnerability of passenger rail systems to terrorist attacks passenger rail systemsprimarily subway systemsin the united states carry about five times as many passengers each day as do airlines over many thousands of miles of track serving stations that are designed primarily for easy access the increased security efforts around air travel have led to concerns that terrorists may turn their attention to softer targets such as transit or passenger rail key challenge congress faces is balancing the desire for increased rail pass enger security with the efficient functioning of transit systems with the potential costs of an attack and with other federal priorities the volume of ridership and number of access points make it impractical to subject all rail passengers to the type of screening all airline passengers undergo consequently transit security measures tend to emphasize managing the consequences of an attack nevertheless there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risks as well as the consequences of an attack these include conducting vulnerability assessments emergency planning and emergency response training and drilling of transit personnel ideally in coordination with police fire and emergency medical personnel additional options include increasing the number of transit security personnel installing video surveillance equipment in vehicles and stations and conducting random inspections of passengers bags platforms and trains visually and with the aid of bombsniffing dogs the challenges of securing rail passengers are dwarfed by the challenge of securing bus passengers there are some 76000 buses carrying 19 million passengers each weekday in the united states some transit systems have installed video cameras on their buses and congress has provided grants for security improvements to intercity buses but the number and operation characteristics of transit buses make them all but impossible to secure dhs

particular concern is ensuring the integrity of imported cargo more than 11 million marine containers from all corners of the globe arrive at us seaports annually while 11 million truckloads and more than 2 million railcars arrive at us land border crossings since the september 11 2001 attack customs and border protection cbp has issued new requirements requiring freight carriers to report cargo manifests shipment information before they reach us borders container ships must report shipment details on each container 24 hours before it is loaded at foreign port truckers from canada and mexico must report their trailers contents from 30 minutes to an hour prior to border arrival and railroads must report this information two hours prior to border arrival cbp analyzes the cargo manifests and other intelligence to select which cargo units to physically inspect cbps selection process is thus critical in keeping terrorists and their weapons from being smuggled into the country in its oversight role congress is scrutinizing cbps cargo inspection process in the port security improvement act pl 109347 congress required dhs to evaluate whether additional cargo information is needed to evaluate shipment risk and required dhs to reexamine its targeting system to determine where improvements to the system could be made 5 congress also required dhs to set up pilot program at three overseas ports to test the feasibility of scanning all us bound containers at those ports program dhs refers to as the secure freight initiative the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 section 1701 requires that all imported containers be scanned by nonintrusive imaging equipment and radiation detection equipment at foreign loading port by july 1 2012 but the secretary of dhs may extend the deadline at port or ports by two year increments if two of the following six conditions are met scanning systems are not available for purchase and installation scanning systems do not have sufficiently low false alarm rate for use in the supply chain port does not have the physical characteristics to install scanning system scanning systems cannot be integrated with existing systems scanning systems will significantly affect trade capacity and the flow of cargo and scanning systems do not adequately provide an automated notification of questionable or highrisk cargo as trigger for further inspection by trained personnel proponents of 100 scanning argue that the manifest information cbp relies on to flag which containers to scan is simply not an adequate basis for determining risk and thus requiring all containers to be scanned is necessary container shippers and carriers have argued that 100 scanning will severely bottleneck port operations not only because of the time required to scan container but more significantly the time required for customs official to analyze the results of container scan opponents of 100 scanning also assert that current scanning equipment is not accurate enough and could be relatively easily circumvented by terrorists 5 dhs has proposed that an additional 12 data items be s ubmitted by maritime importers and vessel carriers see 73 fr 90 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33512g22g155g138g151g156g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152g151g561

and because there are too many shipments for government to monitor on its own government officials have to rely extensively on private industry to tighten control over their supply chains industry has taken steps to protect their operations from terrorist infiltration the association of american railroads has conducted security risk assessment that prioritizes the industrys assets and lists countermeasures to be taken at different alert levels railroads have also created railway alert network that is designed to make sure individual railroads receive timely threat information barge operators have created model vessel security plan through their industry association the american waterways operators the american trucking associations has expanded highway watch program to include tr aining for drivers on how to spot suspicious activity intermodal container shippers have created smart and secure trade lanes program to evaluate antitampering and tracking devices for marine containers an issue for policymakers is determining the best approach for ensuring private industrys cooperation and due diligence over the long term for example policymakers ar evaluating which security measures should be mandated versus which ones should be issued as guidelines or best practices how to validate that the agreed upon security measures are in fact being carried out by industry is also an issue with regard to cbps customs trade partnership against terrorism program congress requested dhs to conduct pilot program to test whether third party entities could be used to validate shippers compliance with the program 6 g18g138g162g146g151g144g561g143g152g155g561g5g138g155g144g152g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561 freight carriers and shippers are private forprofit corporations which raises the issue of whether they or general taxpayers should pay for security improvements advocates for public funding argue that homeland security is national concern and therefore federal government responsibility that should be paid for from the general treasury others argue that carriers and shippers are the direct beneficiaries of improved cargo security they argue that it is in their own economic interest to protect their assets from terrorist attack that additional security measures also deter cargo theft which is costly to the freight industry and that therefore they should bear the cost of security improvements several legislative efforts to establish security fee paid by industry to generate funds for federal port security grant program have failed in congress meanwhile some ports and freight carriers are beginning to add security surcharges to their freight invoices while other carriers are presumably incorporating extra securityrelated costs in their freight rates the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 section 1308 requires dhs to conduct study of the need for and feasibility of creating user fee in the maritime and surface modes for funding transportation security improvements

shipments can be used as instruments or targets of terror there is virtually unlimited number of ways that the hazmat transportation system is at risk from terrorists for example tank trucks can be attacked drivers can be killed and loads can be hijacked and released during shipment simply put there are too many points of vulnerability to ensure security during hazmat transportation major challenge is to cost effectively increase the security of these shipments especially those that pose the most danger to the public while still meeting to the extent possible the transportation requirements of commerce industry and government are gradually implementing layered system of measures affecting shippers carriers and drivers to reduce associated security risks this system involves incident prevention preparedness and response the departments of transportation dot and homeland security dhs have taken actions to enhance the security of hazmat transportation for example dot requires shippers and carriers to implement security plans regarding specified hazmat transportation dot grants encourage state and some local governmental personnel to conduct hazmat inspections and to plan and train for spills of these materials also this department has contacted thousands of companies that are seeking to improve their security programs and has established communication links with industry dhs conveys threat information to law enforcement and industry and conducts vulnerability assessments dhs administers grant that provides for the training and communications infrastructure which truck drivers highway workers and others use to report potential security threats and safety concerns on the nations roads dhs screens commercial drivers applying for an endorsement to carry hazardous materials to determine whether driver poses security threat necessitating denial of the hazmat endorsement dhs has also deployed radiation detection equipment at interstate truck inspection stations whether the pace of these actions is adequate or not is subject to debate it is widely recogniz ed that more could be done to promote hazmat transportation security but additional costs would be incurred and tradeoffs would need to be considered httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33512g22g155g138g151g156g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152g151g561

security many members of congress want to know whether current federal policies regulations and grants could more effectively promote hazmat transportation security at reasonable costs there are issues regarding routing of hazmat through urban centers and debate persists over the pros and cons of rerouting high hazard shipments requiring tracking devices for hazmat shipments and limiting security requirements to just those hazardous commodities that are potentially the most dangerous are also topics of debate other options include increased security awareness training for state truck inspectors and certain employees of truck leasing companies and requiring enhanced security plans and communication systems for carriers of high hazard materials shipments beyond those now required each of these options poses costs that need to be evaluated within the context of other investments the implementing recommendations of the 911 co mmission act of 2007 pl 11053 requires dhs in consultation with the dot to develop program to encourage railroads to equip their railcars carrying securitysensitive materials with tracking devices indicating their location and condition see section 1552 the act requires railroads to annually compile data on certain hazardous materials shipments provide written analysis of the safety and security risks associated with those shipments and identify any practical alternative routes that may be more safe and secure including routes that involve interchange agreements with other railroads see section 1551 regarding the trucking of hazardous materials hazmat the act requires dot in consultation with dhs to review existing hazmat routes and develop criteria based on safety and security concerns to assist states in designating routes for hazmat transportation see section 1553a the act requires dot to assess whether route plans currently required for trucks carrying radioactive or explosive materials should also be required for trucks carrying other types of hazmat see section 1553b the act requires dhs in consultation with dot to develop program to facilitate the tracking of securitysensitive material shipments see
