and janemarie mulvey domestic social policy division june 5 2008 abstract since the beginning of the program social security taxes have been levied on covered earnings up to maximum level set each year referred to as the taxable earnings base social security was enacted in 1935 and the social security payroll tax was ﬁrst levied in 1937 from 1937 through 1949 the tax rate was 1 on employee and employer each on earnings up to 3000 year since that time the rate has risen to 62 and the taxable earnings base has been increased to help meet the ﬁnancing needs of the program and to keep up to date with changing earnings levels since 1982 the social security earnings base has risen at the same rate as wages in the economy by law the commissioner of social security is required to raise the base whenever an automatic beneﬁt increase cost of living adjustment cola is granted to social security recipients assuming wages have risen the increase in the base from 97500 in 2007 to 102000 in 2008 is based on the increase in average wages from 2005 to 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32896 order code rl32896 social security raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base updated june 5 2008

security raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base summary social security taxes are levied on covered earnings up to maximum level set each year in 2008 this maximum or what is referred to as the taxable earnings base is 102000 the taxable earnings base serves as both cap on contributions and cap on benefits as contributi on base it establishes the maximum amount of each workers earnings that is subject to the payroll tax as benefit base it establishes the maximum amount of ear nings used to calculate benefits since 1982 the social security taxable ear nings base has rise n at the same rate as average wages in the economy howeve r due to increasing earnings inequality the percentage of covered earnings that are taxable has decreased from 90 in 1982 to 85 in 2005 the percentage of covered earnings that is taxable is projected to decline to about 83 for 2014 and later since the cap was indexed to the average growth in wages the share of the popula tion below the cap has remained relatively stable at roughly 94 of the 95 million am ericans with earnings above the base roughly 80 are men and only 9 had an earnings from selfemployment income the district of columbia has the highes t share of the population above the maximum 12 and south dakota s the lowest share 2 crs estimated the potential impact of eliminating the taxable wage base on future benefits and taxes if the base were remove d in 2013 crs estimates that by 2035 21 of beneficiaries woul d have paid some additi onal payroll taxes over the course of their lifetimes however the average change in taxes and benefits would be small looking only at individuals who would pa any additional taxes over the course of their lifetimes at the median total lifetime tax payments would rise by 3 and benefits would increase by 2 relative to current law in general those in the highest income groups would have the larg est changes in both tax payments and in benefits relative to current law raising or eliminating the cap on wages that are subject to taxes could reduce the longrange deficit in th social security trust f unds for example if the maximum taxable earnings amount had been raised in 2005 from 90000 to 150000 roughly the level needed to cove r 90 of all earnings it would have eliminated roughly 40 of the longrange shortf all in social security if all earnings were subject to the payroll tax but the base was retained for benefit calculations the social security trust funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years however having different bases for contributions and benefits would weaken the traditional link between the taxes workers pay into the system and the benefits they receive in the 110th congress hr 5779 was introduce d which would require workers and employers to each contribute 3 of ear nings above the taxabl wage base under hr 5779 earnings above the taxable wage base would not be credited for benefit computation purposes this report will be updated as legislative activity

from 2005 to 20061 origin and history of th taxable earnings base in 1935 the designers of social secur ity president franklin roosevelts committee on economic security did not r ecommend maximum level of taxable earnings in its plan and the draft bill that president roosevelt sent to the hill did not include one the bill emphasized who was to be covered by the system not how much wages should be taxed being in the midst of the depression the administrations attention wa s on the large number of aged people living in poverty its goal in proposing social security pr ogram was to compleme nt public assistance measures oldage assistance in its plan the plan offered immediate cash aid to the aged poor and created an earningsrepl acement system intended to lessen the need for welfare benefits in the long run it was recognized that the new system would not be sufficient to provide full income in retir ement but would pr ovide core benefit as floor of protection against poverty not concerned about highincome retirees the administrations proposal exempted nonmanual workers earning 250 or more month from coverage ie 3000 on an annua l basis manual wo rkers were to be covered regardless of their earnings but few had earnings above this level it was the social security bill reported by the house ways and means committee that clearly established ma ximum taxable amount which it set athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32896crs2 2 the maximum for worker was to be 3000 per year per employer so that under the original legislation enacted in 1935 someone could have paid tax on more than 3000 in earnings per year and received benefits from all such wages if they worked for more than one employer 3 the same maximum taxable amount was set for the selfemployed when they were covered in 1951 and for the disability insurance di tion of the tax when it was first levied in 19573000 per year2 in addition the committee dropped the exemption for nonmanual workers with high earnings the committees report and floor statements made at the time give clear record as to the reasoni ng for the taxable limit but concerns about tax equity and attaining as much program coverage of the workforce as possible were suggested as factors for rejecting the hi ghearner exemption not covering them meant that they would not pay the tax wh ere lower wage earners would and coverage would be erratic for workers whose earni ngs fluctuated above and below the 250 monthly threshold although tax policy concerns were raised in later years with higher base preferred by those seeking more propor tional tax system th ere was little if any serious attention given to liminating the base entirely in the late 1940s and early 1950s and to lesser extent later on the ma jor arguments were over the bases size and how it affected the development of social security larger base meant that more earnings would be credited to person s social security record and would lead to higher benefits since benefits are based on workers earnings proponents argued that the base needed to be raised to reflect wage or price growth so that the benefits of moderate and welltodo recipients would not erode over time thereby preserving their support for the system critics argued that this would increase benefits for people who coul d save on their own while making saving by private means more difficult in 1972 as means of financing costofliving adjustments for social security recipients procedures were enacted that increased the base automatically to reflect the growth in av erage wages in 1977 the base was raised beyond what resulted from the automatic increase provision by 7500 over three years as means of raising revenue to help shore up the programs ailing financial condition these ad hoc adjustments were intended to achieve base under which 90 of all covere d payroll would be subject to tax medicare was enacted in 1965 with the hospital insurance hi portion of the program financed with payroll taxes the hi tax was first levied in 1966 at rate of 035 on employee and employer each nd the maximum taxable amount was set at the same level as social securitys3 the hi rate was subsequently raised periodically reaching its current level of 145 in 1986 to meet the financing needs of the program however its base conti nued to be the same as social securitys through 1990 then to reduce federal budget deficits the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 p l 101518 raised the hi base to 125000 the hi base then rose automatically to 135000 ove r the next two years in 1993

his or her employer contribute an equal amount while self employed individual contributes maximum of 126485 the taxable earnings base also limits th annual amount of earnings that are used in benefit calculations and thus sets ceiling on the amount social security pays in benefits for example the maximum amount of earnings in 2008 used to calculate workers benefit is 102000 regardless of whether the worker earned above that amount if an individual earned at or above the earnings base for his or her entire career6 and retired in 2008 at the full retiremen t age his or her annual benefit would

the portion of social security covered ear nings that are subject to the payroll tax has fluctuated over time figure 1 when the program began in 1937 taxable earnings represented 92 of covered earnings table a1 by 1965 this ratio had dropped to its low of 71 prior to 1972 the taxable earning s base wa s updated periodically by congress which contributed to its dramatic fluctuations in the 1950s and 1960s since 1972 the base has been i ndexed to the increase in wages in the economy which has reduced the volatility some what as described earlier to raise revenue congress raised the taxable earni ngs base in the 1977 amendments to the social security act to level that w ould cover 90 of aggregate earnings by 1982 since the 1980s the share of covered workers below the taxable earnings base has remained relatively stable at roughl 94 however the share of covered earnings that are taxed has fallen from 90 of all earnings in 1982 to 86 in 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32896crs5 8 at least some of this decline and subsequent increase in the ratio after 2000 is believed to be due to stock option activity surrounding th stock market bubble

earned more th an the taxable earnings base table a3 10 most of the individuals earning above th base were men 74 million individuals or roughly 80 of the total in 2004 9 of all male workers nd 3 of all female workers had earnings above the maximum most individuals earning above the base were wage and salary workers roughly 90 of the total only 1 in 10 individuals who earned above the base we re selfemployed roughly 6 of all wage and salary workers 86 million individuals and 5 of all selfemployed workers 809000 individuals had earnings above the base in that year the future of the taxable earnings base the taxable wage base is increased annua lly by the average growth in wages so the share of the population below the cap is expected to remain relatively stable over time however due to increasing earnings inequality the share of payroll that is taxed is expected to decline even further under the intermediate assumptions of the 2007 trustees report the percentage of cove red earnings that is taxable is projected to decline to about 83 for 2015 however the trustees repor t assumes the levels will remain stable thereafter projections of the share of the population earning above the taxable wage base over their lifetime workers earnings rise and fall during their careers so any analysis of the population that earns above the taxable wage base in given year is limited in that it may miss individuals who we re above the base in pr evious years or will have earnings above the base in the future to address this issue crs used the dynasim microsimulation model to estimate the

while small share of workers are projected to earn above the taxable earnings base in given year the model estimates that roughl one in five individuals would earn above the maximum at some point in their lifetimes figure 2 the model projects that 12 of workers would earn above the earning s base for between one and five years over the course of their working lives very few individuals sustain the high earnings for long periods in their careers the model estimates that only 5 of workers would earn above the taxable wage base for more than five years13 very few individuals have earnings higher than level of taxable earnings that would cover 90 of aggregate earnings t he level congress attempted to achieve when it last addressed social securitys finances the dynasim model projects that roughly 1 of workers have earnings bove 90 limit each year in other words due to high levels of ear nings inequality roughly 1 of the population earn 10 of all the earnings14 looking over the

1966 the maximum taxable amount was set the same as for social security as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 the hi base was removedprojects that less than 4 of the populati on would ever earn above the 90 base and nearly all of those who do would earn above the base for less than five years figure 2 impact of raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base raising or removing the taxable earnings base could reduce or eliminate the longterm social security deficit15 the additional tax reve nues would be substantial however the full impact of the policy ch ange would depend on whether the wages above the maximum would also be counted toward benefits ra ising or eliminating the taxable earnings base while maintaining the current benefit structure where benefits are calculated on the full contribu tion base would lead to higher monthly social security checks for individuals who earned more than the taxable wage base during their careers these higher benefit payments would lead to greater program outlays although these expenditures would be more than offset by greater tax revenues while the solvency impact woul d be improved to greater degree if the cap on taxes was eliminated and the cap on benefits was retained the traditional link between contributions and benefits would be broken rather than eliminate the taxable wage base policymakers could set it to cover constant share of aggregate earnings as described previously the portion of social security covered earnings subject to the pa yroll tax has fluctuated since its inception rising inequality primarily increases in the earnings of the highest paid individuals has led to decline in the share of us earnings that is taxed the proportion of earnings that is taxed is project ed to continue to fall maintaining consistent tax base woul d increase revenue and help to improve the systems solvency some have proposed raising the taxable earnings base to consistently tax 90 of aggregate us earnings restor ing it to roughly the level in 1982 when congress last addressed social securitys finances the social security administration and the joint committee on tax have also used this benchmark to analyze the impact of raising the base on the social security trust funds and the budget the following sections examine the impact of raising or eliminating the taxable

calculating both the payroll taxes and future social security be nefits the following sections detail the impact of eliminating the base on beneficiaries based on their income and gender16 aggregate changes if the base were removed the majority of beneficiaries would pay additional taxes compared w ith current law as fewer than 8 of workers are projected to earn above the taxa ble wage base each year examining the impact on individuals receiving social security benefits in 2035 roughly one in five beneficiaries 21 would have paid any additional taxes over their lifetimes compared with current law figure 3 for most of these affected individuals the increase would be moderate roughly 16 of all beneficiaries would see their lifetime tax payments increase by less than 10 however 3 of all beneficiaries would have their tax payments increase by 10 to 19 and 2 would have tax increases of 20 or more to maintain the traditional link between contribution and benefits policymakers could choose to calculate bene fits based on workers total earnings including those above the taxable wage base under this option some beneficiaries would receive higher social security benefits crs estimates that 23 of beneficiaries in 2035 would have higher benefits than under current law this share of beneficiaries who receive higher benefits is greater than the share of individuals who pay higher taxes because some low earners receive benefits based on their spouses higher earnings most of the affected beneficiaries 20 would see their benefits increase by less than 10 relative to current law only 3 of beneficiaries w ould see their benefits increase by 10 or more while 21 of beneficiaries in 2035 would pay some add itional payroll taxes over the course of their lifetimes if the base were removed the average change in taxes and benefits woul d be small looking only at individuals who would pay higher taxes over the course of their lifetimes at the median total lifetime

75year estimate option 1 cover 90 of earni ngs and pay hi gher benefits one proposal would slowly raise the taxable wa ge base for both employers and employees to cover 90 of all earnings and credit th taxes to allow individuals to receive correspondingly higher benefits in 2006 it was estimated that cap of 171600 would roughly cover 90 of wages19 under this option bene fits at retirement for high earners would also rise these changes would have net positive impact on the social security trust funds table 1 raising the wage base to 90 would eliminate 43 of the longrange financial shortfall extending the trust funds exhaustion date to 2044 to achieve solven cy for the full 75year projection period under this option the total payr oll tax rate would have to be raised by an additional 109

at the social security administration ssa and the joint committee on taxation jct differ slightly due to different assumptions ssa assumes the maximum wage base will be adjusted each year to keep taxable wages at constant percent of wages while the jct assumes it will be onetime increase with continuedoption 2 cover all earnings and pay highe r benefits if the earnings base was completely eliminated for both employers and employees so that all earnings were taxed 95 of the projected fi nancial shortfall in the social security program would be eliminated to achieve solvency for the full 75year projection period under this option the total payroll ta x rate would have to be raised by an additional 01 percentage points from 124 to 125 or other policy changes would have to be made to cover the shortfall under this scenario high earners would pay higher taxes but also receive higher benefits however the net benefit to the trust funds is positive as 5 in additional revenue would provide only 1 in additional benefits on average over their 75year valuation period nnual social security benefit pa yments would be much higher than todays maximum of 25440 wo rker who paid taxes on earnings of 400000 each year would get benefit of approximately 6000 month or 72000 year replacement rate of 18 wh ile someone with lif etime earnings of 1 million year would get monthly social security benefit of approximately 13500 month or 162000 year replacement rate of 1622122 option 3 cover all earnings nd pay additi onal benefits finally if the base was completely eliminated for both employers and employees so that all earnings were taxed but those earnings did not count toward benefits solvency would be restored to social security the increased revenue would eliminate 115 of the projected shortfall and the program would have projected surplus equal to 28 of taxable payroll under this scenario the payroll tax rate could be immediately lowered from 1240 to 1212 and the system would remain solvent for the next 75 years however the traditional link between the level of wages that is taxed and the level of wa ges that counts toward benefits would be broken impact on federal revenue raising the taxable earnings base would lead to an increase in total federal revenues the joint committee on taxation has estimated that raising the wage base to 90 of earnings to 186000 in

ht to be progressive in that the monthly benefits of lowwage earners replace grea ter proportion of their earnings than do the monthly benefits of highwage earnersarguments for and against raising or eliminating the base some of the general arguments for and against changing the social security taxable earnings base follow arguments for the major critique about the social security base is that it creates regressive tax structure workers earning less th an the base have greater proportion of earnings taxed than workers whose earning s exceed it in 2008 someone with annual earnings of 30000 pays 1860 in social secu rity taxes or 62 of his or her earnings ignoring the employer share of the tax however because the tax is levied on only the first 102000 in earnings someone earning 200000 year pays 6324 or 3 of his or her earnings supporters of changing the wage base point out that only 6 of workers have earnings above the base in any given ear however due to rising earnings inequality the amount of their earnings th at escapes taxation has risen from 12 to 15 since 1991 and is projected to continue to rise through 2014 they therefore contend that the current tax structure favors small group of the more welloff workers in society they also point out that the overall employee tax rate rose from 613 in 1980 to 765 in 1990 counting the medicare tion or by 25 and assert that this increase is one of the main reasons fo r disproportionate rise in the aggregate federal tax burden on lower and middleincome people over that decade28 they further maintain that for most workers social security and medicare taxes counting the employer share which they view as foregone wages are now greater than their income taxes supporters argue that subjecting larger percentage of earnings to the payroll tax would also adjust for the higher life expectancies of high earners29 on average people with more education and higher ear nings live longer than those with lower earnings and less education and this difference has been growing over time the impact on the social security program is that these individuals receive benefits for more years over their lifetimes making the system less progressive30 they claim that raising the taxable wage base would make reasonable adjustment for the faster thanaverage life expectancy gains among high earnershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32896crs18 31

security tax and related issues november 30 2006 at http wwwctjorgpdf socialsecuritytaxearningscapnov2006pdf thus supporters of changing the base argue that raising or eliminating the base not only would be more fair but also that social securitys projected longrange financing problems could be subs tantially alleviated or alternatively that the payroll tax rate could be reduced without causing loss of revenue to the system it is estimated that almost 100 billi on in revenue to the social security program would be generated annually by taxing all earnings and if such revenues were not used to lower the tax rate they would reduce th governments outstanding debt and eliminate about 95 of social securitys longrange deficit among supporters of changing the current base there is disagreement regarding how high the base should be raised or if other changes should be made to tax income above the base seve ral proposals would not eliminate the base entirely but raise it to cover 90 of taxable wages restor ing the level that was set in the 1977 amendments to the social security act others have claimed that increasing the base to 90 would be large tax increase for those who earn between the current base and the new level but would have little impact on the share of taxes paid by individuals with the highest earnings31 other options would be to remove the cap completely over the base but lower the tax rate on those higher earnings32 or tax employers and employees at different rates above the current base others have called for broadening the sources of income that are taxed beyond earnings33 proponents of these ideas argue that they would close significant portion of social securitys long range deficit without subj ecting uppermiddle income individuals to sizeable increases in their marginal tax rates arguments against those who support keeping the base as it is point out that while the structure of the payroll tax may be regressive it is offset by the progressive calculation of benefits they further maintain that its critics fail to take into account the effect of other tax and transfer programs targeted to lowearners they point out that mitigating the social security tax bite was part of the motivation for creating the earned income tax credit eitc which provides an inco tax credit on earnings up to 41646 in 2008 for married workers with two or more children up to 15880 for married workers without children they also poi nt out that lowincome families receive greater share of government transfer payments that are not subject to social security payroll taxes they argue that the combination of these factors mitigates the flatrate nature of the tax at lower earnings levels and that for most other workers the tax ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32896crs19 34 see d mark wilson removing the social securitys tax cap on wages would do more harm than good the heritage foundation october 18 2001proportional because it is flatrate it is only at the upper end of the income spectrum that it takes on regressive appearance critics also argue that raising the cap will serve as disincentive to work and could serve as drain on the economy34 because additional work effort would generate less aftertax income supporters claim that workers faced with this higher marginal rate would either reduce their hour s or avoid the tax by changing the form of their compensation from another perspective some who might otherwise espouse progressive taxation support raising the base but not eliminating it having cap makes social security seem less like general pur pose taxation they argue that the system needs support from people of all earnings levels and that the larger benefits that high earners would receive would represent poor return for the higher taxes they would pay moreover regardless of the money s worth issue some question the wisdom of paying large benefits to welltodo people they argue that the purpose of the program is to provide floor of protection for retirement not large benefits for those who can save on their own they contend that eliminating the base would raise public cynicism about
