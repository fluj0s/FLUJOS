current proposals to help delinquent homeowners share many f eatures in common with all of these actions the home owners loan corporation holc purchased delinquent mortgages at discount and worked with homeowners to restructure the mortgages into more manageable terms holc accepted slightly more than one million applications from homeowners to refinance their homes betw een june 1933 and june 1935 it rejected 488000 applications most for inadequate security and lack of distress holc foreclosed on 194000 of those it was attemptin g to assist at the time many had serious concern that holc could be cos tly undertaking but when it disbanded in the early 1950s holc returned sma ll profit to the government holc successfully conceived and implement ed new ways to contact delinquent homeowners and in some cases help homeowners find new jobs in 1984 continental illinois national bank suffered run after loans that it had not properly underwritten fa iled the federal reserv and the federal deposit insurance corporation led intervention efforts there were concerns that allowing the bank to fail could have serious repercussions throug hout the financial system this led to the fdic improvement act of 1991 in the 1980s the federal savings and an insurance corporation approached insolvency because of the failure of mber savings and loan institutions also known as thrifts working together congress and the george h w bush administration established the resoluti on trust corporation rtc which was funded by the resolution funding corpora tion refcorp the thrift industry is still paying off the intervention operati on which is estimated to have cost 1529 billion in 1989 brady bonds helped less developed countries mostly in latin america restructure their debt by renegotiating terms and writing down some of the loans the plan proposed by thenus treasury secretary nicholas f brady overcame coordination problems in previous restructuring efforts in addition to writing down some loans the plan included some inte rest rate reductions and having debtor nations post us treasury bonds as co llateral with the federal reserve approximately 918 billion was refinanced under the

along with liquidity problems in other fi nancial sectors have led some to call on the federal government to intervene in the mortgage market the administration and the mortgage industry have devel oped an approach called hope now that works with borrowers with subprime mortga ges facing interest rate increases and increasing payments who could be helped with combination of counseling and either an interest rate freeze or new mortgage1 critics of the plan believe that hope now is doing too little too slowly to help those in need today and those who will face interest rate increas over the next few years2 foreclosure is costly for the lender the borrower and owners of neighboring property efforts to reduce foreclosures coul d very well be in the interest of all three affected parties in foreclosure the nder is unlikely to recover the outstanding balance on the mortgage and the cost of fo reclosure the borrower is likely to lose any equity in the home incur additional costs and suffer

mortgage interest rates by david h carpenter and edward vincent murphypolicy issues one of the first issues that c ongress may choose to consider when contemplating an intervention is which hom owners should be included in the plan when there is limite d amount of aid how should it be divided at the one extreme if assistance goes to only few those who obtain it may receive more assistance than is necessary or some in identical situations could be excluded at the other extreme if the assistance goes to large number there is risk of spreading the help too thinly to be of assistance or those who do not need help may receive it in short who deserves to be helped for example should owners of rental property be assisted or only present ow ners should vacation and other second homes be included should persons with two homes who are trying to sell one be aided should owners of any type of housin g be helped or just owners of single family housing4 if only one group such as owners with subprime mortgages is to be helped should this group be further divided fo r example should those current on their mortgages be assisted should those w ho are behind on their payments be aided what about those whose mortgage intere st rates will reset in the future should borrowers with certain types of mortgages be excluded for example should those with or lowdocumentati on loans be excluded should an owner who made false or fraudulent statements to obtain the mortgage be aided does it matter if the mortgage was obt ained to purchase home as opposed to refinancing the home if refinancings are to be included should there be limit to the amount of cash equity that th borrower extracted from the house finally should there be cutoff date if there should should it be date certain or when certain objective measure is reached one response is the hope now which is available to homeowners through free telephone consultations with hudapproved credit counselor5 its financial assistance is offered only to ownero ccupied housing financed by subprime mortgages where the owners are current in their payments but are not likely to be able to make payments after the mortgage resets some of

moral hazard could lead to riskier decisions in th future as home buyers both those helped and those who did not require aid in the current case take more risk than they might otherwise do in the expectation that the government will assist them in the future in turn this could lead to resources being used in riskier way than would have occurred without the interven tion insurance policies usually include deductibles and copays to limit moral hazard and to discourage excessive use the rationale for such standard practices is th at because the policy holder would bear part of the financial loss he or she will exert greater prudence brief overview of subprime delinquency and default in mortgage finance delinquency occurs when payment on loan is overdue default occurs when borrower has failed to meet any of the terms of mortgage contract including timely payment foreclosure occurs when the lender files to seize the house collateral because the borrower is in default

rl33930 subprime mortgages primer on current lending and foreclosure issues by edward vincent murphythe nature of the subprime reset problem as long as home prices were rising lenders and borrowers had less need to worry about the ability of the borrower to make payments after mortgage reset because the mortgage would be refinanced before the reset and the borrower would profit from the price appreciation10 if borrower could not make the mortgage payments house price appreciation made cer tain that the lender was paid and the borrower might also make profit one reaction to this was the popularity of documentation or lowdocumentation mortgages in which borrowers supplied little or information about their financial situations another response was the extension of subprime mortgages to borrowers with impaired credit histories all of these mortgages depended heavily upon home price appreciation to provide repayment in case of foreclosure where home prices stop appreciating rapidly the collateral represented by the home can be insufficient to liquidate the debt without loss to the lender selected previous government interventions the federal government has intervened in the past to modify market outcomes in keeping with the current debate on th subprime mortgage actions this section analyzes in greater detail those previous government actions that directly affected individuals and those that are most releva nt to the current discussion on assisting homeowners this report examines four government market interventions 1 the home owner loan corporation holc of 1933

continental illinois in 1984 is include d because the bank failed to properly underwrite loans and because the federal reserve and th federal deposit insurance corporation led assistance efforts the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s is included because the problems were closel connected to the financing of homes brady bonds are discussed in part becau previous attempts to solve the

24home owners loan corporation holc was established in 1933 to prevent mortgage foreclosures11 mortgages at that time usually were for three to five years were generally expected to be renewed and did not amortize i were not designed to be paid in full by series of monthly payments holc exchanged its bonds for mortgages that were in default and mortgages held by financial institutions that were in distress in holcs first year the federal guarantee increased from interest only to interest and principal mortgages were limited to one to fourunit structures with an holcappraised value of 20000 or less 321791 in 2008 dollars could be for more than the lesser of 14000 225254 in 2008 dollars or 80 of holc appraised value carried maximum interest rate of 5 and required monthly amortizing payments for not more than 15 years12 the 14000 maximum mortgage meant that house worth the maximum value of 20000 could not have mortgage for the maximum 80 loantovalue ltv ratio holc was authorized to issue up to 475 billion 76 billion in 2008 dollars in bonds that could either be exchanged for defaulted mortgages or for cash the cash could be used to purchase mortgages fro m lenders who did not want to take the holc bonds the bonds carried maximum in terest rate of 4 for maximum of 18 years and were exempt from all state local and federal taxes13 holc lent homeowners money to pay taxes and insurance contemporary issues at the time that holc was created some were concerned that lenders would not accept the holc bonds this was addressed by allowing the defaulted mortgages to be purchased for cash and increasing the government guarantee on interest to federal guarantee on both principal and interest today both private and fha mortgage insurance guarantee payment of principal and interest results not all of those eligible applie d and not all those who applied were eligible approximately 40 of those eligible for holc mortgages applied and half of these were rejected or withdrawn of

records were kept on paper bank failure could prevent homeowners from making mortgage payments resulting in their delinquencymoney it ended up making relatively small profit wh it was liquidated in 1951 in part because declining interest rates and the government guarantee allowed it to borrow inexpensively15 holc developed its own mortgage processing and servicing system it superv ised and trained appraisers holc negotiated flexible repayment terms but it sought eventual full repayment of the mortgages it devel oped new methods of working with borrowers who became delinquent including persona l contact with the borrowers holc would try to find jobs for unemployed hom eowners and suggested renting out spare bedrooms beginning in 1937 it rewrote loan s to make them more affordable of the one million loans holc issued it acquired 200000 homes from borrowers who were unable to pay their mortgages th national foreclosur rate was 194 but there was wide variati on in different states16

there were provisions to purch ase mortgages held at troubled banks holc was designed to work with homeowners19 based on the appraised value the amount of the new mortgage could be less th an the original mortgage and the lender could take loss on the mortgage from an economic point of view this was providing the lender with financial incentives to mark the mortgage to the current market value and to recognize the loss application to subprime mortgage restructuring program similar to holc could be adopted by congress several questions would need to be answered in applying the lessons from the holc to the current situation what is the maximum house value that could participate in the program what should the maximum loantovalue ratio be what should the maximum term of the loans be should

continental participated heavily with penn square bank in loans to gas and oil projects after penn square was closed because of defa ults on these loans other banks and cd holders became concerned that continental might not be able to pay them back the banks and cd holders refused to roll over their investments an analysis by the fdic concluded th at continental had failed to properly underwrite oil and gas loans made with penn square bank many analysts say that subprime lenders also failed to properly underwrite loans but in this case the loans were to homeowners savings and loans in the 1980s many us savings and loan associations sls expanded beyond their traditional business of making mortgages to local home buyers at the same time sl profitability declined because of rising

to the extent that federal intervention led to general confidence in financial markets consumers benefitted congress provided 913 billion 1587 billion in 2008 dollars to the resolution trust

available at httpwwwfrbsforgeconrsrchwklyltrel9624html application to subprime mortgage restructuring t h s l intervention is included because the problems in the thrift industry were in part due to mortgage lending however the purpose of the savings and loan intervention was to minimize the cost to the government of honoring the federal insurance of deposits at illiquid and insolvent savings and loans most depositors were not at risk unless the federal government failed to honor its guarantee and th is was not considered few depositors were at risk for the amount above 10000026 the intervention was important to the viability of the financial system the same could be argued for much of the federal reserves recent actions brady bonds in 1982 variety of factors combined to result in problems for latin american nations trying to repay loans mostly to us commercial banks most observers blame relaxed lending standa rds poor debt management by borrower countries and changing international economy for the in ability of debtor nati ons to repay their debts27 us banks accounted for 918 billion 2051 b illion in 2008 dollars of 2194 billion 4902 billion in 2008 dollars lent worldwide to 17 highly indebted countries initial attempts by thenus treasury secretary james baker to combine structural economic changes of debtor nations and debt re scheduling including lengthening maturities did not succeed becau of difficulties in coordinating action among lenders28 in 1989 thenus treasury secr etary nicholas f brady proposed what became known as the brady plan combination of bank loan forgiveness and repackaging remaining debt into bonds that could be traded on securities markets one key feature of the brady pl an was for lenders to recognize that doubt over the timely repayment of the existing debt had reduced its value and to agree to allow borrowers to buy back debt at discount after the buyback the remaining loan principal was restructured using three types of bonds in the first case dollardenomin ated discount bonds paying market interest rates were exchanged for outstanding commercial bank loans these bonds were interest only principal was repaid at maturityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34423crs10 29 the issuer of zero coupon bond pays all interest and principal at maturity the bond is sold for less than this single payment zero coupon bond

second case dollardenominat ed below market interest rate bonds were exchanged at face par value for outstanding commercial bank loans these bonds also were interest only with the principal repaid at maturity in the third case dollardenominated bonds were exchanged for outstanding loans at face value and paid market interest rates in addition banks provided ne w money to maintain liquid ity of the borrower nations borrower nations were required to purchase us treasury zero coupon bonds that were held in escrow at the federal reserve bank of new york to partially collateralize the principal of discount and par bonds29 debtor countries also collateralized 1218 months of interest by making deposit at the federal reserve bank of new york or by purchasing us treasury bills the world bank and the international monetary fund imf made structural adjustment loans to debtor nations contemporary issues discussions at the time centered over what countries would be eligible for debt restructuring and the terms of the restructuring the analogy for aiding homeowners delinquent on mortgage payments would be the question of who should be eligible nd how the mortgages should be recast results the brady plan is widely credited with accelerating the creation of new international financing mechanisms by shifting much lending from bank loans to bonds liquidity was added to the intern ational financial syst em which has grown in the intervening years benefitting many nations liquidity and the multiple types of bond exchanges meant that lenders did not have to agree on single solution application to subprime mortgage restructuring on the one hand the brady plan restored financial stability to us commercial banks and international lending grew more affordable terms and the assurance of longterm financing were benefits to both borrowers and lenders brady bonds allo wed the federal government to facilitate the restructurin g of debt into more affordable payments without any federal guarantee on the other hand shifting the denomina tion debt from the borrowers currency to dollars shifted exchange rate risk from lenders to borrowers new collateral shifted more risk from the us banks to th debtor nations t every debtor nation was willing and able to renegotiate its loans banks negotiated custom agreements with some debtor nations this was practical because of the size of the loans mexico for example had 17 billion 40 billion in 2008 dollars in short term debt30 this renegotiation might be more difficult in the case of two millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34423crs11 30

that could default in 2008 and 2009 most valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars31 lenders recognized losses on existing loans but had more assurance that renegotiated loans would be repaid in full and on time borrowers had more manageable repayment schedules similar approach could be used to restructure subprime loans some mortgages could have their principal andor interest rates redu ced this could be viewed as an acknowledgment of the econo mic reality that the value of the subprime mortgage is less than its face value because of the weakened value of the home as collateral and the increased probability of default lenders might be willing to advance additional funds to some subprime borrowers if these funds were placed in escrow as collateral for new loan holc used similar recognition of the reduced value of the mortgages it purchased it is likely that not every subprime borrowe r facing an interest rate reset would be willing or able to renegotiate their loans lenders would be unlikely to agree to renegotiate terms that would leave them wors off than foreclosure for example if homeowner cannot afford to make paymen ts on fixed rate mortgage based on the current value of the home the lender is likely to decide that foreclosure is the more profitable option if this inability to make payments is temporary such as would be the case if someone is unemployed but likely to find new job shortly the longer run interests of the lender might be to nego tiate new mortgage if however the inability to make payments is seen as permanent then lenders are more likely to be unwilling to negotiate it is not likely that domestic private sector third party w ould make additional loans to subprime borrowers in manner such as the imf and world bank did for debtor nations this might be role for fha or the veterans administration conclusion if congress were to consider some intervention to aid homeowners there are number of questions for its consideration who should be helped should th ere be an income limit should it be limited to owneroccupied housing what should be the tax treatment of the assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34423crs12 32 members of hope now

should happen if foreclosure becomes necessary what should be the governments continuing ro should the program have fixed life what restrictions if any should be placed on the ab ility of homeowners that receive assistance to sell their homes in the future what if the sale is at profit what if the sale is at loss if the government makes financ ial contribution how much should it be and how should it be financed one of the lessons from these four instances of government intervention is that those in financial difficulty are frequently reluctant to acknowledge the existence or severity of the problem on the other hand in these four cases recognition that substantial losses had occurre d was key to beginning the recovery process the question remaining was how the losses c ould be paid for at the least cost most government market interventions have used the emergency medicine principal of triage to divide those into distress into three groups those who cannot be helped with the resources available those who will recover or at least survive without any help and those who will rec over only with immediate assistance the difficulty is in determining to which category the affected persons or institutions should be assigned holc and brady bonds involved negotia tions between the borrower and the organizations involved in th refinancing not every distressed borrower was willing or able to meet the terms of the assistance effort it is probably unrealistic to expect that any plan could keep all subprime borro wers in their homes for example some borrowers will become unemployed and not have the income to make even reduced mortgage payments even moratorium on foreclosures would prevent loss of homes only while the moratorium lasts the holc experience was that some of those who could be helped would not contact the holc it was necessary for holc to reach out to borrowers who became delinquent and to deve lop personalized plans to modify the mortgage so that it could be repaid eventually many of the largest mort gage lenders and associations such as those represented by hope now are urging delinquent homeowners to talk with their lenders and credit counselors32 hope now also is dividing callers into three categories trying to work quickly with the easiest situations first so that those who require more extensive help can get the resources neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34423crs13 economists use the phrase moral hazard to represent the change in behavior due to insuring risks purchasing insu rance probably makes so individuals more likely to take risks than would be pr udent without the fi nancial safety net economists who worry about moral haza rd are concerned that government intervention in market outcome also enc ourages individuals and companies to pay less attention to risk in the future in the expectation that the government will intervene again they worry that in the case of government intervention to help homeowners the possibility of repeat of the intervention could encourage some lenders to lend more than they would absent the history of government action it is possible that homeowners who are helped nd others who see the intervention occur also could react this way
