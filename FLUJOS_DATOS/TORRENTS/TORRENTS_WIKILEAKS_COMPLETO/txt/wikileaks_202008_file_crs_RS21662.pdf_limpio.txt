defi ned as work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected c oordinated or arranged in such way that the resulting work as whole constitutes an original work of authorship1 to be work of authorship the database must exhibit at least modest amount of original creative expression on the basis of the selection organization or the overall coordination of th data elements the data elements may themselves be original works of authorship or may be uncopyrightable facts or similar items as consequence of the us supreme court decision in feist publications v rural telephone service co 2 databases that lack at least modest amount of original creative expression are not constitu tionally eligible for c opyright protection in feist the

database producers became concerned about the lack of protection for databases that are the result of industrious but noncreative effort that concern has been exacerbated by post feist court decisions4 international developments added to the concerns of database producers the european union issued directive mandatin g new form of protection for noncreative databases by its member states effec tive january 1 1998 eu members must protect noncreative collections of information th rough an extraction right this sui generis form of protection is availabl to noneu nationals only on the basis of reciprocity unless the database producer essentially maintains subsidiary within an eu member state that is american database producers will be able to enjoy this new form of protection in europe only if they establish european subs idiaries or if the united states reciprocates by providing essentially the same protection for europeano rigin databases in the united states as the eu states provide in their countries under the new sui generis protection for noncreative databases legislative background in response to the concer ns of the database producers legislation was introduced in the 105th congress which would have created misappropriationbased protection for noncreative databa ses under the authority of the commerce power the house passed bill twice it passed hr 2652 as freestanding bill and later incorporated closely similar provisions as title v of hr 2281 although hr 2281 was enacted the proposal concerni ng noncreative databa ses was dropped from the bill before final passage similar database proposal was reintroduced in the 106th congress as hr 354 the collections of information antipiracy act but with significant modifications the three major changes in hr 354 in compar ison with the database bills of the 105th congress were 1 new exception from prot ection for individual use of the database for teaching research or explanation under reasonableness standard 2 specific exclusion from subject matter coverage in th case of products or services that include collections of information used to transmit or store or provide access to

investor access to information act of 1999 was introduced on may 19 1999 and re ferred to the house commerce committee it was similar to hr 354 in that it created commerce clausebased right against prohibited duplication and comme rcial distribution of nonc reative database it was unlike hr 354 in several respects for exam ple 1 the bill provided only civil not criminal penalties against violation 2 enforcement was vested solely in the federal trade commission ftc private right of action wa s created 3 it did not have fixed 15 year term of protection nd 4 it applied only to databa ses created after enactment in the 105th and 106th congresses arguments in favor of new legal protection against copying noncreative databases were based on three main points 1 databases have enormous economic importance appropriate laws are needed to encourage the creation and dissemination of new and updated databases by protecting the investment in their development against unfair pr edatory conduct 2 there is gap in appropriate forms of legal protection in the aftermat h of the supreme court decision in feist publications v rural telephone service company and 3 the creation of new database extraction right within the european union means that the united states must reciprocate by creating an equivalent form of protec tion for databases within the united states in order for u s database producers to compete effectively in the lucrative european market opponents of bills asserted 1 the new pr otection would have negative impact on science and basic research 2 it would contribut to the spiraling costs of access to online databases and 3 the proposals we re anticompetitive and overbroad5 legislation was introduced in the 107th congress hr 3261 108th cong 1st sess

to database protection the house committee on energy and commerce has declined to endorse hr 3261 citing c oncerns about the bills constitutionality and its potential chilling effect on the use of information16 t h committee reported hr 3872 on march 16 200417 the consumer access to information act offers more limited protection to databases while preserving consumer acce ss to and use of factual information18 like hr 3261 the bill is based on the principles of misappropriation and unfair competition established in the international news service and nba v motorola cases hr 3872 incorporates all the motorola criteria including the requirement absent from hr 3261 that in order to be misappropr iation the taking and use must be effected by one in direct competition with the infringed database19 interactive computer service providers are exempt from liability for making available information provided by others20 the major distinction between the bills is the remedy provided hr 3872 does not create private right of action it directs the ftc to treat misappropriation of databases as violation of its rules defining unfair or deceptive practices21
