division august 1 2008 abstract total nonfarm private employment has fallen since the beginning of 2008 job loss is one of the most important macroeconomic problems facing policymakers both in terms of its economic and social cost but what is often missing from the policy debate is distinction between net job loss and gross job loss gross job loss is the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting ﬁrms in given period whereas net job loss is the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains in given period economists view net job loss as detrimental phenomenon and most recommend that ﬁscal and monetary policy be used to mitigate it however they view gross job loss as long as it is oﬀset by gross job gains as healthy and normal part of functioning market economy although it may have social costs and will not aﬀect all regions or industries

since the beginning of 2008 job loss is one of the most important macroeconomic problems facing po licymakers both in terms of its economic and social cost but what is often missing from the policy debate is distinction between net job loss and gross job loss gross job loss is the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting firms in given period whereas net job loss is the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains in given period economists view net job loss as detrimental phenomenon and most recommend that fiscal and monetary policy be used to mitigate it however they view gross job loss as long as it is offset by gross job gains as healthy and normal part of functioning market economy although it may have social costs and will not affect all regions or industries equally data reveal that gross job loss and job gains are each on average 20 times higher than net job loss or gains in any given quarter this is true in both expansions and recessions clearly gross job loss is not incompatible with healthy labor market during the 1990s expansion in which the unemployment rate was lower than it had been in three decades gross job losses steadily increased as the expansion progressed even during the 2001 recession and subsequent jobless recovery gross job gains continued to average about 8 million per quarter but these gross job gains were more than offset by gross job losses in the subsequent expansion gross job gains stayed relatively constant but gross job losses fell small businesses have both higher gross job gains and losses than large firms and have tended to contribute modestly more net job creation many causes of job loss have been offered including imports trade deficits offshore outsourcing direct investment abroad and restructuring but economic theory suggests that all of these cause gross job loss not net job loss historical experience is supportive neither imports the trade deficit nor the implementation of trade liberalization agreements are correlated with net job loss theory suggests and empirical evidence has confirmed that only recessions cause net job loss policies that impede gross job loss may seem to be desirable way to limit net job loss at first blush however such policies could make firms reluctant to hire new workers because firm would not be able to subsequently reduce its workforce easily if the need for the new workers proved to be only temporary as result gross job gains could decline if gross job gains declined by more than gross job loss declined net job creation would decline international comparison confirms this view germany france italy and spain all had high barriers to job loss and unemployment rates that were typically twice as high in the 1990s as low barrier countries like the united states although attempts to impede gross job loss may reduce economic efficiency policy can and does assist some of those affected by gross job loss through unemployment insurance and other parts of the social safety net whether the existing social safety net is adequate as gross job loss increases is the subject of policy debate this report will be updated as events

february 2001 to trough of 1084 million in july 20031 it then expanded through 2007 reducing the unemployment rate to relatively low level although not as low as was reached at the end of the previous expansion since the beginnin g of 2008 employment has fallen again and the unemployment rate has risen job lossdeclines in employmentis one of the most important macroeconomic problems facing policymakers both in terms of its economic cost and the social toll it takes on our society but what is often missing from the policy debate is distinction between net job loss and gross job loss gross job loss is the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting firms in given period whereas net job loss is the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains in given period in expansions the labor market is characterized by net job creation amidst gross job loss this is required to maintain steady employment rates with growing population it is only during recessions that the overall labor market experiences persistent net job loss economists view net job loss as detrimental phenomenon and most recommend that policy be used to mitigate it however they view gross job loss as long as it is offset by gross job gains as healthy and normal part of functioning market economy although it may have social costs

distinction between gross and net job loss into perspective2 these data are measured from the firms perspectivechanges in the size of the firms workforcenot the employees perspective for this reason the data in sense undercount the amount of change in the workforce because they do not account for movements of individual workers to and from any given firm if the firm remains the same size eg worker quits and is quickly replaced by new hire 3 the gross job loss figures from the employees perspective could be involuntary layoff firing or voluntary quitting retirement4 in the third quarter of 2007 gross job loss and gains equaled 75 million and 72 million per quarter respectively each about 5 of total employment as can be seen in figure 1 gross job loss and job gains are each on average around 20 times higher than net job loss or gains in any given quarter this is true in both expansions and recessions the rate of job gains increased steadily from the beginning of the series in 1992 until the end of 1999 at the same time job 1 total employment is measured in two different bls surveys the household survey and the establishment survey data on total employment cited in this report come from the establishment survey which queries employers about the number of jobs on their payrolls unless otherwise noted 2 for more information see timothy pivetz michael searson and james spletzer measuring job and establishment flows with bls longitudinal microdata monthly labor review april 2001 p 13 3 job flows from the employees perspective were estimated in bruce fallick and

employees change jobs each month 4 data on layoffsdischarges and quits can be found in separate noncomparable data series from bls which was started in december 2000 in the r ecessionary year of 2001 layoffsdischarges averaged 20 million per year and quits averaged 31 million per year in 2006 layoffsdischarges averaged 19 million per year and quits averaged 32 million per year these data are

g561losses increased steadily from 1992 to 20015 some but not all of the long run increase in gross job gains and losses can be attributed to growing labor force6 the rest of the increase indicates that the us labor force is becoming more mobile over time but the data do not indicate whether this is the workers or the firms decision or both most of the gross job flows occur at existing firms and are not due to new firms opening or old firms closing clearly gross job loss is not incompatible with healthy labor market during an expansion in which the unemployment rate was lower than it had been in three decades gross job losses steadily increased as the expansion progressed and even during the 2001 recession and subsequent jobless recovery7 gross job gains continued to average about 8 million per quarter but gross job gains in this period were more than offset by gross job losses8 in the current expansion job gains and losses have been modestly lower than in the second half of the 1990s although gross job gains stayed relatively constant net employment began to rise again because gross job losses fell there is not yet data available on whether net job loss in 2008 has been driven primarily by gross job gains or losses 5 although the government does not provide official data on gross job loss and gains before 1992 private research suggests that gross job loss an d gains on large scale are not new using government data davis haltiwanger and schuh estimated that gross job gains averaged 52 and gross job loss averaged 55 of total employment per quarter in the manufacturing sector from 1972 to 1988 steven davis john haltiwanger and scott schuh job creation and destruction cambridge ma mit press 1996 6 fujita finds that gross job gains and losses due to workers entering and exiting the labor force are about twice as large as those due to workers entering and exiting unemployment workers are classified as unemployed if they are actively seeking employment otherwise they are classified as out of the labor force shigeru fujita what do worker flows tell us about cyclical fluctuations in employment federal reserve bank of philadelphia business

job creation in the us economy to an extent this is misconception based on the confusion between net and gross job flows firms with 99 employees or fewer which account for 381 of total private employment accounted for 611 of gross job gains between 19923 and 20051 but while these firms had disproportionate share of gross job gains they also had disproportionate share of gross job loss 621 of the total on net they accounted for 463 of net job gains over that time period modestly more than their share of total employment but significantly less than gross flows would indicate recent employment trends followed similar pattern interestingly in the 2001 recession and jobless recovery very large firms accounted for disproportionate share of net job loss 9 overall these data provide picture during expansions of highly dynamic us labor market in which labor rapidly shifts from firm to firm to its most efficient use this vitality is the essence of economic growth and rising living standards fo r society as whole in market economy10 it is caused both by output shifting from some firms to more efficient ones within an industry and by shifts in spending from one industry to another due to factors such as changing consumer tastes technology or comparative advantage of course there will always be winners and losers in market economy although significant gross job loss is consistent with net job creation because it is offset by gross job gains for the nation as whole gross job loss can translate into net job loss 9 all data from bureau of labor statistics new quarterly data from bls on business employment dynamics by size of firm news release usdl 052277 december 8 2005 10 to judge the benefits of gross job loss from the perspective of nations economic development consider the counterexample if the us had experienced gross job loss in the 20th century at the beginning of the 20th century much of the us population worked in the farming sector if gross job loss in the farming sector had not occurred those workers would not have been available to work in the growing manufacturing and service sector today farms account for about 15 of the total employment and 1 of the nations output if gross job loss had not occurred in the last century much of todays labor force would not be available to produce the other 99 of us output

the losses and gains may not occur in the same geographic area g6g146g156g153g149g138g140g142g141g561g25g152g155g148g142g155g156g561 furthermore while steady net employment gains are unambiguously good for society as whole the data do not necessarily indicate that the same individuals who lose jobs also gain jobs the data also do not indicate whether the job loss is voluntary or involuntary nor how many of the individuals who involuntarily changed jobs were forced to take new jobs that were less desirable or paid less separate and noncomparable data series on worker displacement from bls can help to answer these questions 11 bls classifies workers as displaced if they lost their job because their plant closed down or moved their positions or shifts were abolished or there was insufficient work from 2003 to 2005 38 million workers with tenure of three years or more were displaced another 43 million shorttenured workers were displaced during that period although the two data series cannot be compared directly gross job loss equaled 90 million over that threeyear period displacement is significantly higher during recessions for example from 2001 to 2003 53 million longtenured workers were displaced of the displaced workers about 70 were reem ployed 13 were unemployed and 17 had left the labor force at the beginning of 2004 of those reemployed fulltime about 51 were now earning more than they had at the displaced job and 29 were now earning significantly lower wages at least 20 lower workers 55 years of age and older had lower reemployment rates than younger workers 12 displaced workers fared better during expansions for example in 2001 2003 20 of displaced workers were unemployed and 33 of those reemployed had significantly lower wages g15g138g156g156g561g14g138g162g152g143g143g156g561 some gross job loss takes the form of mass layoffs during both expansions and recessions in another noncomparable survey from bls 09 million workers lost their jobs from extended mass layoffs in the four quarters ending 20081 this figure undercounts workers affected by mass layoffs because it does not include mass layoffs of less than 50 workers or layoffs that lasted less than 30 days mass layoffs tend to be cyclical workers separated by mass layoffs rose from 12 million in 2000 to 15 million in 2002 since unemployment totaled 84 million in 2002 mass layoffs are an important but not primary cause of unemployment bls has not kept continuous data series long enough to determine if there has been longterm upward trend in mass layoffs beyond the cyclical trend 13 11 bls worker displacement 20032005 press release usdl 061454 august 17 2006 the newest available data in this series are from 2005 all of the following data refer to workers

phenomena have been identified in popular discussion as purportedly causing job loss although all of these phenomena cause gross job loss most have much smaller effect on net job loss than popularly perceived the exception is the business cycle in each instance recessions have been the cause of persis tent net job loss in the postwar period g22g155g138g141g142g561 when trade expands greater imports cause gross job loss as products that were previously produced in the united states are now produced by workers in other countries rendering those us workers redundant however economic theory states that expansions in trade have effect on net employment as foreign countries increasingly exchange their goods for us exports more workers are needed in us export industries in addition because trade is based on comparative advantage trade increases the purchasing power of us incomes in the aggregate thus trade allows the us economy as whole to produce and consume more domestic goods requiring more workers to produce them 14 it is possible that there could be some transitional loss in net employment if workers cannot easily be reallocated into other sectors of the economy causing net employment to temporarily be greater than zero for example workers who have lost their jobs in the importcompeting industries may not have the skills needed by export industries but this transitional effect would disappear once markets had adjusted 15 us history offers persuasive evidence that tr ade liberalization has effect on net employment as can be seen in figure 3 during the postwar period us trade has become progressively liberalized with eight rounds of world trade liberalization negotiated between 1947 and 1993 through the general agreements on tariffs and trade gatt later became world trade organization as well as the canadian free trade agreement in 1989 and north american free trade agreement nafta in 1994 imports have increased steadily as percentage of gdp throughout the postwar period from about 4 of gdp in the 1940s to about 14 of gdp in recent years if trade caused net job loss employment would have declined and unemployment risen throughout the postwar period the opposite is the case employment has steadily increased during the postwar period and the unemployment rate has mirrored the business cycle not trade patterns indeed trade liberalization does not appe ar to have strong effects on even transitional unemployment for example nafta was implemented when aggregate employment was rising and unemployment was falling gatt rounds 1 3 4 6 7 and 8 were completed when unemployment was low and unemployment though high fell subsequent to ga tt rounds 2 and 5 the most recent example the united states has with significantly increasing trade restrictions 14 for more information see crs report rl32059 trade trade barriers and trade deficits implications for us economic welfare by craig k elwell 15 even if us workers could not compete with foreign workers the floating exchange rate system would prevent imports from leading to net job loss since dollars must be so ld in the foreign exchange market to purchase imports if

that the implementation of trade liberalization agreements has virtually relationship historically to changes in net employment in the same or following year in case there is lagged effect as economic

quarter of 2008 reported import competition to be the cause of the layoff recent study found that trade had limited effect on net job loss in the recent recession and jobless recovery 18 it found that the industries with the greatest job loss during that period included both those affected business services manufacturing and unaffected leisure and hospitality transportation construction and communications by trade and outsourcing it then measured the number of american workers that would be needed to produce us imports compared to the number of workers that are ne eded to produce us exports and found that the difference amounted to only 24 of total employment in 2003 this estimate should not be interpreted as how much employment would rise in the absence of trade since workers affected by trade may be reemployed producing nontradable goods some policymakers are particularly concerned that trade is responsible for the continuing decline in manufacturing employment in recent years even after employment began increasing in the rest of the economy in 2003 manufacturing employment has continued to fall from 176 million in 1998 to 139 million in 2007 yet trade cannot be the

exports argue that trade nevertheless reduces net employment when higher imports are matched instead by larger trade deficit they reason that higher imports cause gross job loss but are not offset by gross job gains in the export sector if they lead to trade deficit while this is true trade deficits do lead to gross job gains in other ways when the united states runs trade deficit it exchanges foreign imports for us assets this puts downward pressure on us interest rates stimulating spending on physical investment plant and equipment lower interest rates also stimulate spending on housing and interestsensitive goods such as automobiles and appliances as result the trade deficit causes gross job gains in the sectors that produce plant equipment housing and interestsensitive goods all else equal these gross job gains may not occur instantaneouslyso there could be transitional net job lossbut when they do occur they will offset the gross job loss caused by higher imports so that the trade deficit causes net job loss as can be seen in figure 3 the historical experience confirms this conclusion the large increase in the trade deficit in the 1980s and 1990s took place at time of rising employment and falling unemployment while the trade deficit rose during the 2001 recession and jobless recovery it continued to rise from 2003 to 2007 as unemployment fell this suggests that some other factor such as strong aggregate demand growth tends to simultaneously push the trade deficit up and unemployment down in 2008 to date unemployment rose despite decline in the trade deficit table 1 demonstrates that there was almost correlation between changes in the trade balance and changes in employment 20

other nations when outsourcing occurs those foreign firms must be paid using us dollars the foreign firms in turn can use those dollars in three ways first they can buy us exports resulting in gross job gains in the export sector second they can buy us assets increase the trade deficit resulting in gross job gains in the interestsensitive sectors that produce plant equipment housing and interestsensitive goods as explained in the previous section third they can sell their us dollars for another currency causing the dollar to depreciate as result the output of us exporting firms and us importcompeting firms would increase as us goods become more price competitive internationally thus in all three scenarios gross job loss is offset by gross job gains so that there is net job loss although there may be for transitional period quality data on outsourcing is scarce because the term has only recently been coined there is not yet any consensus as to how it should be defined and the concept cannot easily be measured accurately it is popularly used to mean net job loss but conceptually the term applies only to gross job loss net measure of outsourcings effects would be hard to calculate because it would be difficult for bls to measure gross job gains caused by foreign firms outsourcing to the united states and impossible to trace the rise in employment caused by the spending on us goods of foreign firms that us firms have engaged in outsourcing changes in imports of services suggests that outsourcing by that definition is minor phenomenon relative to total gross job loss the one official data source on outsourcing comes from the bls mass layoffs series and this only includes one type of outsourcing us firms relocating work abroad in the first quarter of 2008 only 1200 employees out of 301400 were subject to extended mass layoff because of relocation abroad 22 g17g159g142g155g156g142g138g156g561g11g151g159g142g156g157g150g142g151g157g561 the argument is sometimes made that when us firms decide to undertake direct investment abroad it reduces us employment according to the argument if the us firm had not say built the new factory abroad that employs foreign workers it would have built factory in the united states that employed us workers as result net employment is lower than it would have been economic theory states that capital investment determines the wages of employees not the level of employment that is because capital investment increases the productivity of existing workers and in competitive market wages are determined by productivity if the level of employment was based on the amount of capital available per worker then the united states would not have been able to achieve full employment in the past since capital per worker has increased steadily over time yet throughout its history the united st ates has achieved full employment most of the time even if us investment abroad did lead to net job loss the data do not suggest that this explanation is possible since the united states is net recipient of foreign capital and has been for the past few decades in other words any jobs hypothetically lost by us investment abroad 22 because the survey question is new it is difficult to judge its accuracy for example the res ponse could be biased in favor of overreporting if outsourcing is being used as scapegoat for other reasons for layoffs

foreign investment in the united states although us direct investment abroad exceeds fo reign direct investment in the united states overall foreign investment in the us direct portfolio and official is greater than us investment abroad23 ultimately foreign investment has the same effect on the economy regardless of the form it takes net foreign investment in the united states is by identity equal to the us current account deficit trade deficit plus net transfers and net investment income that is because capital cannot flow into the country on net net borrowing cannot occur unless the united states imports more than it exports any time us investment abroad increases all else equal the trade deficit must fall thus explanations of net job loss attributed to the trade deficit and explanations of net job loss attributed to us investment abroad are mutually exclusive both stories cannot be correct this can be proven by considering the foreign exchange market if us direct investment in the euro area increased dollars must be exchanged for euros this causes the dollar to depreciate against the euro causing us exports to the euro area to rise and euro imports to the united states to fall as result the trade deficit narrows g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g20g142g156g157g155g158g140g157g158g155g146g151g144g561 declines in aggregate employment are often blamed on restructuring in the economy for example the decline in employment from 2001 to 2003 is often attributed to the collapse of the dotcom industry according to this argument resources had been overinvested in the dotcom industry in the late 1990s when this situation was rectified in the late 1990s workers in that industry were longer needed causing overall employment to decline the reallocation of resources in the economy is probably the primary reason that gross job loss occurs changes in tastes technology and comparative advantage continually cause labor and capital to be shifted from one industry to another in market economy as this report has demonstrated sizeable reallocations of labor across industries has been constant in the united states for as long as data has been collected but in most years the economy has not had any problem offsetting gross job loss with greater number of gross job gains thus economic restructuring typically is not accompanied by net job loss overall even though it often results in net job loss at the local level it is possible that if restructuring were unusually large at any given time perhaps like the dotcom collapse the economy could be unable to absorb that many workers in new jobs fast enough to prevent net job loss unfortunately there is way to systematically identify which restructuring events are large enough and separate their effects on net job loss from other economic phenomena occurring simultaneously for example the net job loss associated with the 2001 recession could be caused by nothing more than an unrelated decline in aggregate spending as is typical of other historical recessions in the absence of this decline in aggregate spending it is possible that the dotcom collapse would not have had any effect on aggregate employment 23 portfolio investment refers to the purchase of financial secur ities official investment refers to the purchase of assets by government treasuries or central

debate as to whether recessions have the beneficial effect of hastening restructuring some argue that when times are tough firms are forced to innovate to survive and during booms weak firms are propped up by prosperity24 if correct this points to an economic benefit from recessions in contrast to the mainstream economic view that recessions are economically wasteful because they cause productive labor and capital to lay idle but it is difficult to evaluate this argument quantitatively g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g6g152g160g151g157g158g155g151g156g561 unlike the other factors described above economic downturns are the only factor that causes both gross and net job loss according to economic theory this theory is borne out by historical experience as illustrated in table 2 which show the high correlation between contemporaneous gdp growth and employment growth in fact falling employment is part of the official definition of recession economic downturns are characterized by insufficient aggregate spending to support existing labor and capital resources as result capital goes idle and workers are laid off until spending revives 25 the government can boost aggregate spending back to full employment through expansionary fiscal policy larger government budget deficit or monetary policy lower short term interest rates by the federal reserve net job loss caused by economic downturns is temporary because insufficient aggregate spending is only temporary phenomenonin the long run markets adjust to bring spending back into line with potential production since 1947 net job loss lasting more than one quarter has only occurred during or immediately following recession there have only been two recoveries in which net job loss has continued for more than one quarter after the recession had ended the recoveries beginning in 1991 and 2001 26 24 by contrast caballero and hamour argue that recessions actually retard restructuring because historically they have been

business cycle ch anges on net job creation cancel outnet job loss in downturns is offset by net job gains in booms thus in the long run net job creation is determined by the characteristics of the labor market over time growing population leads to rising employment or net job creation in 1950 the us population equaled 1513 million and nonfarm employment equaled 453 million in 2000 the us population equaled 2814 million and employment equaled 1318 million the fraction of the population employed in 2000 was so much higher than in 1950 primarily because of the entrance of women into the labor force what proportion of the population is employedboth the labor force participation rate and what economists refer to as the natural rate of employment or nairu nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemploymentis determined in the long run by demography eg younger workers have higher unemployment rates social norms eg the large scale entrance of wives into the working force and policy eg welfare reform27 in the long run the rate of net job creation will equal the rate needed to keep the economy at the natural rate of unemployment sometimes the rate of employment growth will change

increase but there is little consensus among economists on the relative importance of each factor because changes in the natural rate are gradual an increase in the natural rate is more likely to be associated with slower rate of net job creation than net job loss all else equal at other times the employment growth rate will change in order for the actual unemployment rate to return to the nairu since unemployment rates in the most recent expansion never fell to 1990s levels part of the labor market sluggishness from 2001 to 2003 may have been caused by return to the natural rate after unemployment was held below it in the late 1990s g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 most economists agree that net job loss is an undesirable phenomenon and recommend that public policy be used to offset it policymakers can use expansionary monetary policy lower short term interest rates by the federal reserve or expansionary fiscal policy an increase in the budget deficit to stimulate aggregate spending and offset net job loss 28 if used properly and prudently these policy tools can theoretically minimize net job loss unfortunately because of policy lags in recognition implementation and effectiveness fiscal and monetary policy will probably never be conducted effectively enough to eliminate recessionary periods of net job loss direct job creation programs have been used by the government in past recessions to stem net job loss but from an economic perspective these policies have similar effect to any expansionary fiscal policy and they also are prone to implementation lags 29 policies that impede gross job loss eg regulatory restrictions on dismissal or layoffs may seem to be desirable way to limit net job loss at first blush however such policies could have the unintended effect of making firms reluctant to take on new workers because firm would not be able to subsequently reduce its workforce easily if the need for the new workers proved to be only temporary as result gross job gains could decline if gross job gains declined by more than gross job loss declined net job creation would decl ine this suggests that attempts to limit gross job loss could be counterproductive because gross job flows are on the whole caused by the reallocation of resources to their most efficient use policies to impede gross job loss would also likely have adverse consequences for growth and efficiency helping job losers make the transition into new employment situation is less costly alternative and one that is compatible with an efficient dynamic labor market 28 for more information see crs report rl30354 monetary policy and the federal reserve current policy and conditions by marc labonte and crs report rl31235 the

rotection if policies to forestall gross job loss are deemed to have too high an efficiency cost what role can policy play two perspectives can be used to an swer that question one perspective would view the labor reallocation issue as purely social problem that is allowing gross job loss to occur with impediment from the government may be an economically desirable outcome as long as it is cancelled out by job creation but the situation creates social problems that government may wish to tackle on noneconomic grounds these soci problems include poverty psychological problems crime alcoholism and substance abuse the undermining of families and communities and so on that reportedly increase when gross job loss occurs economic analysis provides little guidance on the best role for the government to play in tackling these noneconomic problems alternatively an economic perspective would ask if any market failure is associated with gross job loss and what role the government can play in potentially rectifying that market failure although it can be argued that gross job loss poses market failure in and of itself persuasive argument can be made that there are market failures that prevent individuals from efficiently insuring themselves in the private market against the risks posed by gross job loss 33 to considerable extent the possibility of gross job loss is risky event beyond workers control such as adverse changes in the business cycle tastes technology or trade patterns one would expect worker to be willing to use some of his income to privately purchase insurance against those risks just as individuals insure against the risk of death fire health problems and so on yet the limited use of private unemployment insurance to supplement governmentprovided insurance suggests that market failures may significantly hamper the functioning of the private market all insurance markets are hampered by two important market failuresadverse selection and moral hazard persuasive argument can be made that unemployment insurance may be more adversely affected by both types of market failure than most other types of insurance adverse selection is caused by asymmetric information buyers of insurance know more about their riskiness than sellers as result only buyers with higher risks will tend to purchase insurance because they are more certain that the benefit of the insurance will exceed the cost this pushes up the price of insurance and hampers insurers efforts to pool risk adverse selection hampers 33 for more indepth discussion of the following argument

some causes of unemployment are beyond the workers control and some are not since insurance firms cannot identify which workers have greater chance of losing their jobs because of the factors within their control they cannot efficiently pool the risks that workers do not control moral hazard occurs when an individuals behavior becomes more risky once he is insured moral hazard also drives the cost of insurance above its efficient level moral hazard can occur in the unemployment insurance market in two ways it can cause insured workers to engage in behavior that is more likely to lead to job loss and once job loss has occurred it can make an insured worker less willing to take new job because the worker can subsist on the income provided by the insurance government provision of unemployment insurance solves the adverse selection problem by making participation universal as long as all workers are participating insurance can be priced at its efficient level even though benefit will not match cost for any given worker government mitigates but does not eliminate the moral hazard problem by making the insurance temporary normally 26 weeks in most states and imposing eligibility restrictions eg not providing insurance when the worker has quit or been fired the government has also tended to extend the duration of insurance during economic downturns since events beyond the workers control are greater source of job loss then the private sector could use the same methods as the government to mitigate moral hazard but it could not prevent adverse selection if one accepts that government provision of unemployment insurance is more efficient than private provision then the policy issue is whether or not insurance is adequate or excessive at current levels are workers adequately protected against the risk of gross job loss at existing benefit levels should benefit levels or duration be increased or coverage be expanded since gross job loss seems to be following an upward trend would more generous insurance reduce the social problems associated with gross job loss the tradeoff here is between both benefit and cost to the individual more generous insurance would require higher premiums and cost to the economy because of the moral hazard problem as the insurance becomes more generous disincentives to maintain employment or seek new employment among the unemployed increase governments role in insuring workers against the risks associated with gross job loss can also be viewed through broader prism than the unemployment insurance program 34 disability insurance insures against the risk of job loss due to physical incapacity trade adjustment assistance taa which offers extended unempl oyment benefits and job training reduces the risk that workers adversely affected by trade will be unable to find reemployment some policymakers have suggested that taa be extended to workers in the service industry given the growing concern with offshore outsourcing government programs such as cobra named after title x of the consolidated omnibus budg et reconciliation act of 1985 reduce the loss of health care associated with job loss some would argue that income redistribution in general is form of income insurance whether it takes the form of progressive taxation the earned income tax credit the food stamps program the supplemental security income program and so on kletzer and litan have argued that the government should implement wage insurance program so that workers who lose their jobs and are forced to take lower paid employment are 34 the theoretical underpinnings of this view are laid out in edgar browning and jacquelene browning public finance and the price system new york macmillan publishing 1979 p 188

alternative trade adjustment assistance program for older workers was introduced in 2002 an eligible worker over 50 years old earning less than 50000 and meeting other criteria can receive half the difference between the wages received from reemployment and the wages received at the displaced job for up to two years and payments up to 10000 this program applies only to workers affected by trade although the economic rationale for such program could apply to all workers bills in the 110th congress such as s 1330 senator schumer and hr 2202 representative mcdermott would create broader wage insurance programs at the community level fiscal transfers differences between outlays received and taxes paid that change with economic conditions and gove rnment programs such as the empowerment zoneenterprise communities program provide what could be characterized as insurance for the community as whole against the economic effects of significant job loss

monetary policy can be used to mitigate although it has social costs gross job ss is part of the normal functioning of market economy and has the beneficial role of reallocating resources to their most efficient use when tastes technology or comparative advantage changes even in expansions gross job loss is sizeable between 65 million and 85 million per quarter from 1992 to 2000 but it is more than offset by gross job gains trade trade deficits offshore outsourcing overseas investment and economic restructuring all cause gross job loss36 but in normal economic conditions none typically causes net job loss according to theory and evidence to see why consider that they all have the same effect on employment as technological advances for example the advent of the automobile caused gross job loss in the horse buggy i ndustry but was more than offset by gross job gains in the rest of the economy as the buggy example suggests policies that impede gross job loss can have high efficiency costs the difference in the unemployment experience of countries with high barriers to job loss such as the high unemployment countries of western europe and countries with low barriers such as the united states offers some evidence that barriers to gross job loss can lead to lower gross job gains making such barriers ultimately selfdefeating however public policies to protect workers against the risks posed by gross job loss can be justified on both social and economic grounds if crafted properly they have been shown not to reduce gross job gains and they can arguably raise efficiency by addressing market failures for example public provision of unemployment insurance helps overcome moral hazard and adverse selection problems in that 35 lori kletzer and robert litan prescription to relieve worker anxiety institute for international economics policy brief 012 february 2001 36 bureau of labor statistics data indicate that trade and outs ourcing cause relatively little gross job loss at least in the form of extended mass layoffs
