reconciliation directives in the fy2004 budget resolution summary on april 11 2003 the house and senate reached agreement on budget resolution for fy2004 hconres 95 whic h recommends that revenues be reduced by 1225 trillion over the 11year period covering fy20032013 in addition the budget resolution recommends increases in outlays stemming from related tax policy changes ie refundable tax credits these recommendations in the aggregate roughly parallel those proposed by presid ent george w bush in the fy2004 budget he submitted to congress on february 3 the fy2004 budget resolution recommends that large portion of the revenue reductions and associated outlay increases pertaining to an economic growth package be achieved through the budget reconciliation process the remaining revenue reductions amountin g to about 691 billion plus associated outlay increases may be considered unde r regular legislative procedures the reconciliation process author ized under section 310 of the 1974 congressional budget act is an optional pro cedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process the chief pur pose of the reconcilia tion process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue and mandatory spending levels in to conformity with the polic ies of the budget resolution while budget resolution may rest on assump tions regarding changes in revenue and mandatory spending levels reconciliation may make it more likely that such changes will occur by compelling committees to velop the necessary legislation and providing for its expedited consideration the reconciliation directives set forth in section 201 of the budget resolution require the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee to report reconciliati on legislation to their respective chambers by may 8 2003 although the level of tax policy changes is the same for each committee not more than 550 billion over the 11year pe riod covering fy20032013 the two committees have different mix of directives to reduce revenues and increase outlays related to tax policy changes the ways and means committee is directed to reduce revenues by not more than 535 billion and to increase outlays by not more than 15 billion the corresponding amounts for th finance committee are not more than 522524 billion in revenue reduc tions and not more than 27476 billion in outlay increases in an innovative procedure intended in part to avoid conflicts with the senates socalled byrd rule section 313 of th 1974 congressional budget act the budget resolution also contains point of order set forth in section 202 that prohibits the initial consideration in th senate of rec onciliation legislati on proposing revenue reductions and

1225 tr illion over the 11year period covering fy 2003 20135 the level of revenue reduction over 11 years ssumed in the conference agreement is much closer to the position initially passed by the house 1350 trillion than the position initially pa ssed by the senate 801 billion6 as with the presidents proposals the outlay effects of related tax policy proposals in the budget resolution are not reflected in these figures budget reconcilia tion procedures the budget reconciliation process authorized under s ection 310 of the 1974 congressional budget act is an optional pro cedure that operates as an adjunct to the budget resolution process the chief pur pose of the reconcilia tion process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue and mandatory spending levels into conformity with the policies of the budget resolution7 while budget resolution may rest on assumptions regarding changes in revenue and mandatory spending levels reconciliation may make it more likely that such changes will occur by compelling committees to develop the necessary legislation and providing for its expedited consideration reconciliation is twostage process first reconciliation directives are included in the budget resolution instruc ting the appropriate committees to develop legislation achieving the desired budget ary outcomes the instructed committees submit their legislative recommendations to their respective budget committees by the deadline prescribed in the budget reso lution the budget committees incorporate them into an omnibus budget reconciliati on bill without making any substantivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31902crs3 revisions in cases where only one committee in chamber has been instructed the process allows that committee to report its reconciliation legislation directly to the chamber thus bypassing the budget committee the fungibility rule section 310c of the act allows some flexibility in determining committee compliance when rec onciliation directives involving both revenue and spending changes are issued within limits revenue changes may be substituted for spending changes or vice versa in sum the fungibility rule applies to any house or senate committee that is subject to reconciliation directives in budget resolution requiring it to recommend reconciliation legislation changing both spending and revenues deems any such committee to be in compliance with itsreconciliation directives if its recommended legislation does not cause either the spending changes or the revenue changes to exceed or fall below 20 of the sum of the two types of changes and the total amount of changes recommended is not less than the total amount of changes that were directed and authorizes the chairman of the senate budget committee to fileappropriate adjustments in the vels in the budget resolution and committee spending allocations ther eunder upon the exercise of the rule and requires any committee receiving revised spending allocations to promptly repor t section 302b suballocations under the fungibility rule for example committee directed through reconciliation to reduce re venues by 75 billion and to increase outlays by 25 billion for total of 100 billion in directed changes could choose instead to reduce revenues by only 55 billion 75 billion minus 20 billion or 20 of 100 billion total the committee would still be considered to be in compliance with its directives as long as it increased the other required change in this case outlay increases by the same amount by 20 billi on to total of 45 billion so as to achieve the total amount of savings that were directed 100 billion the second step in the reconciliation pr ocess involves consideration of the resultant reconciliation legislation by the house and senate under expedited procedures among other things debate in the senate on any reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and 10 hours on conf erence report and amendments must be germane the 20hour bate limitation provides sign ificant advantage to the proponents of the legislation without th is limitation the measure would be subject to filibuster which could require as many as 60 votes to invoke cloture in order to bring consideration of the measure to close in the house the house rules committee typically sets limitations on debate and the offering of amendments during consideration of reconciliation measurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31902crs4 8 for more detailed information on this rule see crs report rl30862 budget reconciliation procedures the senates byrd rule by robert keithin the senate the socalled byrd ru section 313 of the 1974 act bars the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation8 there are several strict definitions of extraneous matter in the by rd rule which genera lly involve failure to relate to the budgetary purposes of the legislation eg which are nonbudgetary in character or have merely incidental budget ary effects the byrd rule applies to reconciliation bills and resolutions amendments and motions thereto and conference reports thereon waivers of the byrd rule require the affirmativ vote of threefifths of the membership ie 60 senators if seats are vacant once the reconciliation legisl ation called for in the budget resolution has been approved or vetoed by the president the process is concluded if the legislation is vetoed congress cannot develop another reconc iliation b ill wit hout first adopting another budget resolution containi ng reconciliation instructions revenue reconciliation directives in the fy2004 budget resolution the fy2004 budget resolution hc onres 95 includes reconciliation directives to the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee the directives set forth in section 201 require each committee to report reconciliation legisla tion to its chamber by may 8 2003 although the level of tax policy changes is the same for each committee not more than 550 billion over the 11year period covering fy20032013 the two committees have different mix of directives to reduce revenues and increase outlays related to tax policy changes as shown in table 1 as indicated previously certain tax policy changes such as increases in refundable tax credits may be scored as outlay increases rather than revenue reductions

2013 the conferees indicated that an add itional 6909 billion in tax relief could be accommodated under the budget resolution over the 11year period but that they chose not to make it subject to reconciliation directives consideration in the house and senate of any legisla tion providing such additi onal revenue re duction would occur under regular legislative pr ocedures the conferees noted the assumed additional tax relief could accommodate the permanent extension of the provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra the tax provisions of energy policy legislation the revenue impacts of trade legislation and several miscellaneous tax provisions proposed by the president or congress9 the byrd rule influenced the form of the reconciliation directives in the budget resolution initially house nd senate leaders indicated that they would settle on conference agreement instructing the house ways and means committee to reduce revenues and increase outlays through related tax policy changes through reconciliation by 550 billion or more for the period covering fy20032013 and the senate finance committee to make s imilar changes of 350 billion for the same period majority of sena tors had indicated their opposition to revenue reductions and related outlay changes greater than 350 billion included in the budget resolution passed by the senate sconres 23 on march 26 2003 under this approach the use of dual reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution would enable the senate lead ership to secure passage of the budget resolution while leaving open the possibility that subsequent conference on the differing versions of the revenue reconciliation measure passed by the two houses might reach compromise between these two amounts however it soon became apparent that if the senate initia lly passed revenue reconciliation measure consistent with the directive in the budget resolution ie reducing revenues and increas ing outlays by 350 billion the later consideration of conference agreement reflecting compromise level of revenue reductions and related outlay increases greater than 350 billion could violate the byrd rule in particular section 313b1b defines as extraneous any provision reported by committee that reduces revenues or increases outlays if the net effect of all of the committees provisions is that it fails to achieve its reconciliation instructions proposing revenue reductions greater than the level of reductions set in the reconciliation instructions would be considered failure to achieve the instructions under these circumstances senate adoption of conference report on ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31902crs6 10 for further discussion of this matter see 1 concessions to moderates imperil

votes of 50 senators and th vice president if breaking tie in order to resolve the problem the c onferees resorted to novel procedure while section 201 of budget resolution in structs both the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee to reduce revenues and increase related outlays by not more than 550 billion over fy20032013 section 202 of the budget resolution sets forth point of order that bars the initial consideration in the senate of reconciliation measure containing revenue reductions and related outlay increases in excess of 350 billion for th is period the point of order does not apply however to the consideration of conference report on the reconciliation measure section 202 further provides that the sena point of order can be waived only by the affirmative vote of thr eefifths of the membership ie 60 senators if seats are vacant section 202 of the budget resolution reads as follows sec 202 limit on senate consideration of reconciliation point of orderit shall not be in order for the senate to consider bill reported pursuant to section 201 or an amendment thereto which would cause the total revenue reduction to exceed 322524000000 or the total outlay increase to exceed 27476000000 fo r the period of fiscal years 2003 through 2013 except for the purpose of inserting the text of senatepassed measure and requesting conference with the house of representatives b waiverthis section may be waived or suspended in the senate only by the affirmative vote of threefifths of the members duly chosen and sworn c appealsan affirmative vote of threefifths of the members of the senate duly chosen and sworn shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on the point of order raised under this section this procedural formulation strengthens the position of those who favor initial senate passage of reconc iliation measure limited to 350 b illion in revenue reductions and relate d outlay changes but removes the potential byrd rule hurdle should majority of senators later choose to support c onference agreement providing as much as 550 billion in reve nue reductions and re lated outlay changes10 the unique procedural techniques empl oyed by sections 201 and 202 of the fy2004 budget resolution sparked some cont roversy during senate consideration of the conference report while some supported these technique s as an integral part of difficult political compromise on crucia l legislation others derided them as gimmickshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31902crs7 11 see the remarks of senator max baucus in

the ranking minor ity member of the senate finance committee questioned whether the directiv to the committee should be regarded as 350 b illion or 550 billion11 further senator charles grassley chairman of the senate finance committee indicated that he had reached agreement with other senators to adhere to the 350 b illion level in the confer ence on the reconciliation measure

on may 8 there are some procedural issues that may have bearing on the development and consideration in the senate of reconc iliation legislation pursuant to the directives in the fy2004 budget resolution these issues which pertain to the operation of the fungibility rule and the application of the senates paygo rule ar discussed briefly below operation of fungibility rule in the senate the existence of both reconciliation directives amounting to 550 billion in section 201 and point of order limitation amounting to 350 billion in sec tion 202 raises question as to the appropriate amount that should be used for making calculations under the fungibility rule some have argued that the direc tives amounting to not more than 550 billion in section 201 are directives only in literal or technical sense and that the 350 billion limitation under the point of order s upersedes them and should be regarded as the actual amount of reconc iliation directives at the higher level the fungibility rule would allow flexibility up to 110 b illion while at the lower level the amount of flexibility would drop to 70 billion preliminary indications suggest that the senate parliamentarian would advise the chair that fungibility calculations s hould be based on the 350 billion level when the reconciliation measure is reported by the finance committee and on the 550 billion level when it is reported by the conference committee in implementing the rule however substitutions should be made that effectively would reduce directive below zerohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31902crs8 13 for more

budget enforcement procedur under the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended and until recently the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended with payasyougo paygo rule13 the rule which was establis hed and has been revised in annual budget resolutions bars the consideration in the senate of an revenue or mandatory spending legislation that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit in any one of three different intervals covering 10 years ie the first year covered by the budget resolution the first five fiscal years covered by the budget resolution and the next five fiscal years thereafter any waiver of the rule requires the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership although the senates paygo rule was slated to expire on april 15 2003 it was extended through september 30 2008 by section 505 of the fy2004 budget resolution14 reconciliation legislation c onsistent with the directives in the fy2004 budget resolution would cause the onbudget deficits projected over the coming fiscal years to increase significantly including the effects of reconciliation the fy2004 budget resolution estimates onbudget deficits over 11 years ranging from 302 billion for fy2013 to 558 billion for fy200415 consequently without special accommodation such legislation would be subject to point of order under the senates paygo rule as included in the fy2004 budget reso lution the senates paygo rule has been modified in several respects in particular section 505 a5a requires that estimates prepared under the ru use the baseline surplu s or deficit used for the most recently adopted concurrent reso lution on the budget as adjusted for any changes in revenues or direct spending ssumed by such resolution inasmuch as reconciliation legislation was assumed in the fy2004 budget reso lution the consideration of any such legislation that is consistent with the reconciliation directives would not viol ate the paygo rule further the consideration of legislation providing the remaining 691 billi on in tax relief assumed in the budget resolution presumably would not be subject to the paygo rule either16
