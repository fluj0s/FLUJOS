disclosures to family members and friends the rule requires plans and providers to give the individual the opportunity to object to the disclosure the rule also permits the use and disclosure of health information without the individuals permission for various specified activities eg public health oversight law enforcement that are nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20500crs2 directly connected to the treatme nt of the individual for us and disclosures that are not permitted by the rule plans and providers must obtain patients written authorization they must also have in place reasonable administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect patient information from intentional or unintentional uses or disclosures that are in violation of the rule the health privacy rule is one of seve ral new standards manda ted by the 1996 health insurance portability and accountability act h ipaa to support the growth of electronic record keeping and claims processing in the nations health care system under hipaa the secretary of health and human services hhs has issued electronic format and data standards for several routine administrativ transactions between plans and providers eg claims for payment the secretary has also issued security standards to safeguard electronic patient information against unaut horized access use and disclosure most plans and providers have til april 21 2005 to comply with the security standards the hipaa privacy and security standard s have helped lay the groundwork for the adoption of information technology it syst ems in health care to support the electronic collection and exchange of patient informati on developing secure platform to protect confidential health information is central to the growth of national health information infrastructure that allows hea lth care providers to share pa tient information small but growing number of communities and health care systems around the country have developed electronic medical r ecords and established secure networks for the exchange of health data among provide rs patients and other author ized users the creation of regional networks is seen as critical step toward the goal of interconnecting the health care system nationwide the handling of elect ronic patient information by these networks has important and as yet not fully underst ood implications for the privacy rule which was developed with the trad itional paperbased system of medical records in mind questions and answers about the health privacy rule who is covered as specified under hipaa the privacy regulation applies to three groups of entities i individual and group health plan s that provide or pay for medical care ii health car clearinghouses ie entities th at facilitate nd process the flow of information between health care providers and payers and iii health care providers who transmit health information electronically in standard format in connection with one of the hipaaspecified transactions or who rely on thirdparty billing services to conduct such transactions the rule therefore does not apply directly to other entities that collect and maintain health information such as life insurers researchers employers unless they are actin g as providers or pl ans and public health officials however business associates with whom covered entities share health information are covered business associ ates include persons who provide legal actuarial accounting data aggregation management administrative accreditation or financial services to or for covered entity the rule permits covered entity to disclose health information to business associate or to allow the business associate to create or receive health information on its behalf provided both parties sign written contract that essentially binds the business associate to the covered entitys privacy practices what types of health information are covered the rule covers all individually identifiable health information that is created or received by covered entity including genetic tests and info rmation about an individuals fa mily history it applies tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20500crs3 1 all federally

access and amend their health information yes covered entities must allow patients to inspect or obtai n copy of their health information except in certain limited circumstances covered entities may charge reasonable costbased copying fee patients may also request ame ndment or correction of information that is incorrect or incomplete fina lly patients have the right to receive detailed accounting of certain types of disclosures of their health information made by covered entities during the past six years disclosures for routine health care operations nd those made pursuant to an authorization see below are exempt from the accounting requirement how may plans and providers use and disclose patient information the privacy rule places certain limitations on wh and how health plans and health care providers may use and disclose medical information generally plans and providers may use and disclose health information for their own treatment payment and health care operations tpo without the individuals authoriza tion and with few restrictions covered entity may also disclose information for the treatment and payment activities of another provider the payment activities of another health plan and for certain health care operations of another covered tity if each entity has relati onship with the patient for example physician can mail or fax medical test results or patients medical record to specialist who intends to treat the patient pr ovided that reasonable safeguards are used patients may request that covered entities restrict the use and disclosure of their information for tpo but covered entities are not required to agree to such request the privacy rule also permits the disclosure of health information without patients authorization for the following specified national priority activities consistent with other applicable laws and regulations fi rst disclosures may be made for public health purposes eg reporting diseases collecting vital statis tics as required by state and federal law second health information may be disc losed to public agencies to conduct health oversight activities such as audits inspections civil cr iminal or administrative proceedings and other activities necessary for oversight of the health care system third disclosures may be made to law enforcement officials pursuant to warrant subpoe na or order issued by judicial officer or pursuant to grand jury subpoena disclosures for law enforcement purposes are also permitted pursuant to an administrative s ubpoena or summons where threepart test is met ie the information is re levant the request is specific and nonidentifiable information could not reasonably be used fourth health information may be disclosed in judicial and administrative proceedings if the request for the informa tion is made through or pursuant to court order fifth covered entities may disclose health information to researchers without patients authoriz ation provided an institutiona l review board irb or an equivalent newly formed pri vacy board reviews the resear ch protocol and waives the authorization

programs iii to government authority authorized to recei ve reports of abuse neglect or domestic violence iv to organizations in order to facilitate organ eye and tissue donation and transplantation v to government agencies for various specialized functions eg national security and intelligence activities vi to avert serious threat to health or safety vii and in other situations as required by law for the most part the privacy rule addresses permissible uses and disclosures hhs expects covered entities to rely on their professional judgement in deciding whether to permit the use or disclosure of hea lth information covered entities are required to disclose information only to the individual w ho is the subject of the information and to hhs for enforcement of the rule for all uses and disclosures of health information that are not otherwise required or permitted by the rule covered entities must obtain patients written authorization eg releasing information to financial institutions that offer mortgages and other types of loans or selling mailing lists to marketing companies authorization forms must contain certain specified core elements including description of the health information to be used or disclosed and the identity of the recipient of the information in general covered health care pr ovider may not condition treatment on receiving patients authoriz ation health plans may condition enrollment or eligibility for benefits on the provision of an authorization prior to an individuals enrollment in the plan patients may in wr iting revoke their authorization at any time can medical information be shared wi th patients family or friends yes the rule permits covered entities to disclose information to family member relative close friend or other person identified by the i ndividual only information that is directly relevant to such persons i nvolvement with the individuals care may be shared if the individual is present and able to make health care decisions the covered entity may disclose information provided 1 the patient has been give n in advance the opportunity to object to any disclosures or 2 the covered entity using professional judgment reasonably infers that the patient does not obj ect in an emergency situation or if the patient is not present the covered entity may use its professional judgment and experience with common practice in deciding whether disclosure is appropriate hhs has repeatedly stated that it is not the intent of the rule to impede common health care practices eg hospitals disc ussing treatment options with spouses and relatives and family members picking up prescription does the rule restrict parental involvement and notification i n general parent is deemed to have the rights associated with minors health information including the right to authori ze disclosure or to request access to the information but if minor is authorized by law to consent to treatment and has consented to care with or without the consent of parent or if the parent has assented to an agreement of confidentiality between provider and minor then the minor has the exclusive rights associated with that info rmation the rule however defers to state parental notification laws it allows covered entities to disclose minors information to parent or provide the parent with access to such information if such disclosure is permitted or required by state law similarly disc losure to and access by parent is prohibited where prohibited by state law where state law is silent or unclear abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20500crs5 parental notification the rule permits cove red entity to provide or deny access to the parent provided that action is consistent with state law are there limits on the amount of information disclosed the rule requires that whenever covered entity uses or discloses health in formation or requests such information from another covered entity it must make reasonable effort to limit the information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use or disclosure the minimum necessa ry standard does not pply to disclosures to or requests by provider for treatment purposes disclosures made to patients upon their request disclosures made to the secret ary to enforce compliance authorized uses or disclosures and uses or disc losures that are required by law what about incidental disclosures incidental uses and disclosures of health information that occur as result of use or disclosure that is otherwise permitted under the privacy rule are not considered violations of the rule provided that the covered entity has met the reasonable safeguards and min imum necessary standards examples of incidental uses and disclosures include pa tient signin sheets bedside charts and confidential conversations that are inadvertently overheard by others are covered entities required to explain their privacy practices to patients health plans and health care providers must provide patients with written notice of their privacy practices plans are required to give notice at enrollment providers that have direct treatment relationship with the patient are required to give notice at the date of first service delivery and except in emergency situations make good faith effort to obtain written acknowle dgment from the patient of receipt of the notice the notice must include description of the patients rights the legal duties of the covered entity and description of the types of uses and disclosures of information that are permitted including those that do not require an authorization does the rule restrict employers access to health information the rule permits group health plan to disclose individually identifiable health information to an employer that sponsors the plan pr ovided the information is used only for plan administration purposes in order for group h ealth plan to disclose health information to plan sponsor the plan documents must be amended so that they limit the uses and disclosures of information by the sponsor to those consistent with the privacy rule in addition an employer must certify to group health plan that it will not use the information for employmentrela ted actions eg hiring and promotion decisions the employer must agree to establish adequate firewalls so that only those employees that need health information to perform functi ons on behalf of the group health plan have access to such information can health information be used for marketing covered entity may not disclose health information to third party eg pharmaceutical company in exchange for direct or indirect rem uneration for the marketing activ ities of the third party without first obtaining patients authorization similarly covered entity may not use or disclose health information for its own marketing activities w ithout authorization however communications made by covered entity or its business associate to encourage patient to purchase or use health carerelated product or service are not defined as marketing under the rule and therefore do not require the patients authorization even if the covered entity is paid such communications includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20500crs6 prescription refill reminders nd information about alternativ treatments as well as more controversial activities paid for by third parties eg communications by pharmacies paid for by drug manufacturer that recomme nd patients switch their medication to the companys product what must covered entities do to ensure compliance covered entities must have reasonable administrative technical and physical safeguards in place commensurate with the size and scope of thei r business to protect the privacy of patient information these include designating privacy official trai ning employees and developing system of sanctions for employees who violate the entitys policies covered entities are not directly liable for the actions of their business associates they may be held liable if they know of business associates patte rn of activity or practice in violation of the contract unle ss they take reasonable steps to correct the problem and if such steps are unsuccessful terminate the contract or report the problem to hhs does the rule preempt state health privacy laws as mandated by hipaa the rule does not preempt or override state laws that are more protective of patient privacy although most states do not have comprehensive health privacy laws many states have detailed stri ngent standards governing the use and disclosure of health information related to certain medical conditions such as mental illness genetic testing and communicable diseases eg hivaids these stronger privacy protections will remain in force the rule only preempts state laws that are in conflict with its requirements and that provide less stringent privacy protections therefore it serves as federal floor of min imum privacy protections how will the rule be enforced any person who believes covered entity is not complying with the privacy rule may f ile complaint with hhss office of civil rights ocr which is responsible for imp lementing and enforcing the rule ocr is working with covered entities to encourage voluntary compliance it says that enforcement of the rule will be reactive nd complaintdriven under hipaa ocr has the authority to impose civil monetary penalties against covered entities that fail to comply with the rule and the department of justice may seek criminal penalties for certain wrongful disclosures of personal health information the civil fines are 100 per incident capped at 25000 per year for each provision that is violated the criminal penalties include fines of up to 250000 and up to 10 years in prison for disclosing or obtaining health information with the intent to sell transfer or use it for commercial advantage personal gain or malicious harm hipaa did not provide private right of action for individuals to sue fo r violations of their health information privacy in federal court however nothing in hipaa prohibits aggrieved individuals from filing state law claim against covered entity for its noncompliance and resulting harm where can i obtain more information general information on all the hipaa standards can be found
