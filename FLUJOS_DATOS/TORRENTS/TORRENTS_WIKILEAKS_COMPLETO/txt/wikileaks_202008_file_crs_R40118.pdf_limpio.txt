authorized by the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act of 1990 pl 101625 home is federal block grant program that provides funding to states and localities to be used exclusively for affordable housing activities to benefit lowincome households funds for home are appropriated annually to the department of housing and urban development hud which in turn distributes funding to states and certain localities by formula sixty percent of home funds are allocated to localities and 40 of home funds are allocated to states the formula takes into account six factors including the number of units in jurisdiction that are substandard or unaffordable the age of jurisdictions housing and the number of families living below the poverty line in the jurisdiction states and localities that receive home funds are known as participating jurisdictions as part of the process of becoming participating jurisdiction states and localities must submit consolidated plan to hud that identifies the communitys housing needs and describes in detail how home and other hud block grant funds will be used to meet those needs participating jurisdictions can undertake projects themselves or they can distribute funds to qualified organizations to undertake projects on their behalf home funds can be used to finance wide variety of affordable housing activities that generally fall into four categories rehabilitation of owneroccupied housing assistance to home buyers rental housing activities and tenantbased rental assistance projects that use home funding must meet certain income targeting and affordability requirements specifically all home funds must go to projects that benefit households with incomes at or below 80 of area median income and 90 of the funds that are used for rental units or tenantbased rental assistance must benefit households with incomes at or below 60 of area median income additionally all housing that uses home funds must remain affordable for set period of time that varies according to the type of activity for which funds are used and the amount of home funding contributed to the project participating jurisdictions must also match the home funds they receive with their own 25 permanent contribution to affordable housing activities funding for home has been between 15 and 2 billion for each of the last several years in fy2008 all fifty states and 591 localities received home formula grants along with the district of columbia puerto rico and four insular areas the median state grant amount was about 99 million and the median locality grant amount was about 831000 since the programs inception over half of home funding has been used for rental housing or tenantbased rental assistance furthermore larger percentage of home funding has been used for housing rehabilitation activities than for new construction or acquisition this report will be updated as events warrant

housing this concern stemmed from an increasing awareness of variety of problems related to housing including homelessness families living in substandard housing and decreasing opportunities for homeownership 1 the concern over these issues led to number of efforts to focus attention on housing policy including the creation of national housing task force comprised of housing policy experts and industry leaders in march 1988 the task force produced report on its findings 2 among the housing issues that the task force report identified was diminishing supply of rental and homeownership housing that was affordable to low income households3 in 1988 hearing on the task force report some members of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs suggested that the federal funding for housing programs was inadequate to meet the affordable housing needs identified in the report4 most federal housing assistance distributed to states and localities at the time was restricted to specific uses such as section 8 vouchers or public housing projects furthermore programs that did give communities flexibility to choose how to use their funds such as the community development block grant cdbg program5 were primarily meant to fund economic development and community revitalization activities and restricted the ways in which funding could be used for affordable housing for example cdbg funds could be used for some housing rehabilitation but could not 1 us congress senate committee on banking housin g and urban affairs and house committee on banking finance

level of federal funding specifically dedicated to affordable housing should be increased in order to fully address affordable housing issues at the same time task force members argued that local jurisdictions should be allowed more control over the ways in which they used any such dedicated federal affordable housing funding7 in 1990 congress passed major housing bill that responded to some of the issues raised by the housing task force and other experts8 the cranstongonzalez national affordable housing act pl 101625 or naha stated th at the nations housing policy was not meeting the goal of providing decent safe sanitary and affordable living environments for all americans that was first set out in the housing act of 19499 the law revised and amended several existing housing programs and authorized number of new programs including the home investment partnerships program10 the home investment partnerships program is authorized by title ii of naha11 in creating home the law consolidated several smaller housing programs into the largest federal block grant program that provides funding dedicated exclusively to increasing adequate affordable housing opportunities for lowand very lowincome households12 the program places particular emphasis on giving states and localities flexibility in how they achieve their affordable housing goals home is also designed to expand the capacity of states and localities to meet their longterm affordable housing needs by leveraging federal funding to attract state local and private investment in affordable housing and by strengthening the ability of government and nonprofit organizations to meet local housing needs 13 6 eligible activities that can be undertaken with cdbg funds are codified at 42 usc 5305 for more

together to form consortia states are automatically eligible to become pjs and receive the greater of their formula grant amount or 3 million annually localities can only become pjs if they are metropolitan cities or urban counties14 and if they meet two funding thresholds first localities must be eligible for minimum amount of funding under the formula usually 500000 15 once localities meet this threshold they must also meet second threshold localities must dedicate total of at least 750000 to affordable housing activities either by having home formula grant of at least 750000 or by making up the difference between their grant amount and the 750000 threshold with their own funds or state home funds16 localities that do not meet the requirements to become participating jurisdictions may join with other contiguous localities to form consortia in order to reach the minimum funding thresholds localities that are not pjs can also participate in the home program by applying to their home state to receive portion of the states allocation of home funds states in which locality receives its own allocation of home funding have their grant amounts increased by 500000 once state or locality is informed of how much funding it is eligible to receive according to the formula the entity must 1 notify hud of its intention to participate in the program and 2 14

weighted 20 the number of occupied rental units in jurisdiction that have at least one of four problems 1 overcrowding defined as more than one occupant per room 2 incomplete kitchen facilities defined as the lack of sink with running water range or refrigerator 3 incomplete plumbing defined as the lack of hot and cold piped water flush toilet or bathtub or shower that is inside the unit and used solely by the units occupants or 4 high rent costs defined as rent that costs more than 30 of the households income the number of rental units in jurisdiction that were built before 1950 and are occupied by poor households the number of occupied rental units in jurisdiction that have at least one of the four problems discussed above overcrowding incomplete kitchen facilities incomplete plumbing or high rent costs multiplied by the ratio of the cost of producing housing within the jurisdiction to the cost of producing housing nationally the number of families at or below the poverty level in jurisdiction the remaining two factors are weighted 10 the number of rental units in jurisdiction adjusted for vacancies where the head of households income is at or below the poverty line this number is multiplied by the ratio of the national rental unit vacancy rate over the jurisdictions rental unit vacancy rate the jurisdictions population multiplied by its net per capita income 19

while many activities are eligible uses of home dollars participating jurisdictions must specify which activities they intend to fund in their consolidated plans in order to use home funds to finance those activities the consolidated plan includes detailed description of the jurisdictions housing needs and an explanation of how it will use home and other hud block grant funds to meet those needs over fiveyear period the consolidated plan also describes how the jurisdiction will leverage home funds to attract local private nonprofit or other nonfederal sources of funds for affordable housing and it prioritizes projects by type and geographic location the consolidated plan is meant to be the product of participatory process among citizens organizations businesses and other stakeholders in community 22 the home regulations stress community participation especially by low and moderateincome persons in developing the consolidated plan although jurisdictions consolidated plan covers fiveyear period it must be updated annually and each year the jurisdiction must submit to hud an update on its progress and citizen participation plan that describes how citizens have been included and consulted in the process 20 community housing development organizations are private nonprofit organizations that meet certain legal and organizational requirements as well as requirements

varied and that localities should be free to develop solutions that fit local conditions23 hud describes one of the purposes of the home program as reinforcing the principle that states and localities should have flexibility and control over how to best meet their affordable housing needs24 accordingly wide range of activities qualifies for home funding including both homeownership and rental housing activities the law requires participating jurisdictions to give rehabilitation of existing rental and owneroccupied units priority however pj can undertake other activities if it certifies that rehabilitation is not the most costeffective way for it to increase its supply of affordable housing or that rehabilitation is inadequate to meet its affordable housing needs the eligible uses of home funds fall into four broad categories rehabilitation of owneroccupied housing funds may be used to help existing homeowners repair rehabilitate or reconstruct owneroccupied housing assistance to home buyers funds may be used to help home buyers acquire acquire and rehabilitate or in certain circumstances construct new homes rental housing activities funds may be used to help developers or other housing organizations acquire rehabilitate or in certain circumstances construct affordable rental housing tenantbased rental assistance funds may be used to help renters with costs related to renting such as security deposits rent and under certain circumstances utility payments there are certain activities which are not eligible for funding under the home program ineligible uses of home funds include modernizing public housing providing tenantbased rental assistance under the section 8 program supporting ongoing operational costs of rental housing paying back taxes or fees on properties that are or will be assisted with home funds and providing nonfederal matching funds for any other federal program other uses not authorized in statute or regulation are also prohibited 25

private investment in affordable housing activities and to increase the capacity of states and localities to meet their affordable housing needs33 accordingly the home statute requires participating jurisdictions to match the home funds that they use in fiscal year with their own 25 permanent contribution to affordable housing activities pjs matching funds can come from wide variety of nonfederal sources including state or local governments charitable organizations and the private sector the matching funds must be devoted to affordable housing activities that are eligible under the home guidelines but they do not necessarily have to support projects that use home funds the match can also take many forms including inkind contributions such as labor construction materials and land for homeeligible projects other contributions such as foregone taxes other foregone fees and infrastructure improvements may also count toward the matching requirement if they are used specifically for projects funded by home dollars the matching requirement may not be met using federal funds 34 the matching requirement must be met in the same fiscal year that home funds are used but if jurisdiction provides more matching funds than are required in given year it can carry those funds forward to meet the matching requirement in subsequent years the statute directs the 32 if rental units temporarily fail to meet either of the requirements governing the incomes of occupants of home assisted units because of an increase in the current tenant s income the unit is still meeting the requirements of this section as long as vacancies are filled according to these requirements 33 42 usc 12722 34 for the purposes of the matching requirement equity derived from lowincome housing tax credits lihtcs is considered federal funding see us department of housing and urban development cpd notice 9703 march 27 1997 p 14 available at httpwwwhudgovofficescpdla wsregsnotices1997973pdf there is some disagreement over whether tax credits such as the lihtc should be considered federal spending some argue that since tax credits represent foregone revenues rather than government outlays they should not be counted as federal spending others argue that since tax credits represent money that otherwise would have accrued to the federal government they should be counted as federal spending for

states received the minimum grant amount of 3 million and sixth state wyomin g received the minimum grant amount plus the additional 500000 awarded to states that have localities receiving their own home formula grants in fy2008 591 localities or consortia also received their own home formula grant allocations42 the median grant to localities was about 840500 and the mean grant was around 16 million43 again the mean grant amount is significantly higher than the median because few localities received especially large grants in particular new york city received grant of almost 112 million close to three times the size of the next largest formula grant to locality and over twice the next highest formula grant amount awarded the grant to the state of california the smallest formula grant

g343g347g561program is to attract state local and private funding for affordable housing activities for low income households49 hud reports leveraging statistics for several of its programs including home according to hud every dollar of home funds used for housing units that were completed between fy1992 the first year in which the program was first funded and november 30 2008 attracted 370 in nonhome funds50 the government accountability office gao has analyzed the leveraging statistics that hud and the department of the treasury report for various programs and has calculated alternatives to the way that hud reports its leveraging statistics in order to look at the different types of nonhome funding that homeassisted projects attract51 gao found that projects that use home dollars do attract private funds and state and local funds however huds reported leverage ratio of nonprogram dollars to program dollars may overstate homes ability to attract nonfederal funding for affordable housing because home projects also make use of other federal funding using data on home projects completed in fy2006 only huds reported leverage ratio for the program in that year is 4 of other funding for every dollar of home funding using the same data gao found that much of the non home program funding included in huds reported leveraging measure for the program comes from other federal sources 52 specifically as figure 1 illustrates homeassisted units that were completed in fy2006 used 236 billion in home funding 452 billion in private funding 314 billion in other federal funding and 179 billion in state or local funding this works out to 192 of private spending 133 of other federal spending and 076 of state or local spending for every dollar of home funding leverage ratio that only took into account other nonfederal sources of funding for homeassisted projects completed in 2006 would be 268 for every dollar of home funding 192 of private funding and 076 of state and local funding this is 132 less than the reported leverage ratio that includes all nonprogram funds one reason for the relatively large amount of other federal spending on home projects is that in gaos analysis equity from low income housing tax credits lihtcs was counted as other federal funding many affordable housing projects use both home funding and funds raised by lihtcs calculating alternative leverage measures for the home program such as those presented by gao may provide more complete picture of how well home is meeting its stated purpose of leveraging federal funding to attract other types of funding for affordable housing including contributions from states localities and private entities 49 42 usc 12722 50 us department of housing and urban development home program
