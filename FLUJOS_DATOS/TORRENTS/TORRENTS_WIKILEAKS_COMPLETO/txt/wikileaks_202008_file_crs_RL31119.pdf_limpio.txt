affairs foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31119terrorism near eastern groups and state sponsors 2002 summary the qaeda terrorist network founded by osama bin laden is believed to pose continuing although diminished threat to the united states at home and to us interests and allies abroad following the networks defeat in its base in afghanistan as stated in taped appearances by its leaders since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and th pentagon the goal of qaeda is to destroy high profile us targets in order to end what qaeda claims is us suppression of islamic societies in these appearan ces bin laden virtually claimed responsibility for the september 11 attacks throughout its history qaeda has sought to oust prous regimes in the ddle east and gain removal of us troops from the region before september 11 signs pointed to decline in state sponsorship of terrorism since the attacks some countries that are signated by the united states as state sponsors of terrorism including ir an and sudan have c ooperated to an extent with the usled war against qaeda and its taliban protectors in afghanistan in spite of its cooperation ag ainst the taliban and qaeda iran is still considered major sponsor of radical islamic groups that conduct terrorism against israel the arabisraeli peace process is longstanding major us foreign policy interest and the administration and c ongress are concerned about any terrorist groups or state sponsors that oppose the pr ocess possibly because of breakdown in the palestinianisraeli peace process in september 2000 palestinian organizations such as hamas as well as older groups ch as the popular front for the liberation of palestine that have been inactive for years have stepped up operations against israelis following several major terrorist attacks against israelis since december 2001 the united states has strongly criticized palestinian author ity president yasir arafat for failing to exert sufficient effo rts to constrain these and other groups some analysts assert that israels actions against the palestinians have contributed to increased palestinian support fo r violence against israel us differences with other governme nts on the strategies for countering terrorism in the near east have to some extent narrowed since september 11 the united states in the past differed with its allies particularly on how to deal with state sponsors of terrorism most allied g overnments believe that engaging these countries diplomatically might sometimes be more effective than trying to isolate or punish them the united states has generally been more inclined than its european allies to employ sanctions and military action to compel state sponsors and groups to abandon terrorism postseptember 11 velopments seem to have validated the importance of both diplomacy and in certain circumstances more forceful responses in dealing with terrorism differences with allies have begun to reemerge as the bush administration expands its war on terrorism indicating it will seek to prevent the emergence of threats by regimes some of which also have ties to terrorist groups that are developing w eapons of mass destruction wmd this report will be updated annuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31119contents introduction 1 radical islamic groups 4 h i z b l l h p r t f g d 4 h i

violence against israel and whether they should be named as ftos when the fto list was reviewed and reissued in october 1999 the democratic front for the liberation of palestine dflp was dropped

has conducted veral recent suicide bombings many of which killed only the bombers many experts believe that the renewed terrorist activity is at least partly attributable to breakdown in security cooperation between israel and the palestinian authority cooperation that was widely credited with keeping terrorist attacks to minimum in the preceding few years the renewed terrorist threat has led israel to adopt policy criticized by the united states and many other countries of assassinating mas and pij activists to preempt their suspected attacks hamas continues to receive funding fro m

appears closest of any of the near eastern countries on the terrorism list to being removed despite congressional and outside criticism over its prosecution of the war against christian and other rebels in its south prior to the september 11 attacks the state department said it was engaged in discussions with sudan with the objective of getting sudan completely out of the terrorism business and off the terrorism list46 the administration has praised sudans cooperation with the us investigation of qaeda and the september 11 plot in recognition of this cooperation the administration did not block security council vote on september 28 2001 to lift u n sanctions on sudan in recent years sudan has signaled willingness to assuage international concerns about its support for terrorism in

islamist figure hassan alturabi in february 2001 turabi was arrested and has remained under house arrest since ma 2001 turabi was one of the primary proponents of sudans ties to regionwide islamic m

sudan on the terrorism list in august 1993 according to patterns 2000 by the end of 2000 sudan had signed all 12 international conventions on combating terrorism one issue that apparently has been resolved is sudans compliance with three security council resolutions adopted in 1996 1044 of january 31 1054 of april 26 and 1070 of august 16 the resolutions manded that sudan extradite the three islamic group suspects in the june 1995 ssassination attempt against president mubarak in ethiopia restricted the num ber of sudanese diplomats abroad and authorized suspension of international flig

2001 there is lingering resentment among some sudanese against the united states because of the august 20 1998 cruise miss ile strike on the shifa pharmaceutical plant in khartoum conducted in conjunction with the stri ke on bin ladens bases in afghanistan the united states destroyed the plant on the grounds that it was allegedly contributing to chemical wea pons manufacture for bin laden

to the pr oduction of chemical weapons the plant owners 24 million in usbased assets were unfrozen by the administration in 1999 move widely interpreted as tacit u s admission that the strike was in error iraq47 usiraq differences over iraqs regional ambitions and its record of compliance with postgulf war ceasefire requirement s will probably keep iraq on the terrorism list as long as saddam husayn remains in power some us officials want to expand the war on terror to iraq despite lack of hard evidence of iraqi involvement in the september 11 attacks president bush in his january 292002 state of the union message suggested iraq was part of an axis of evil along with north korea and iran statement that some took as an indication that the united states would eventually take action against iraq ev those us officials who oppose extending the war to iraq assess iraqs record of compliance with its postwar obligations as poor and its human rights record as abysmal however international pressure on iraq on these broader issues appears to have constrained iraqs ability to use terrorism patterns 2000 as have the past few patterns reports notes that iraq continues to plan and sponsor international terrori sm although iraqs activities are directed mostly against antiregime opposition those iraq holds responsible for its past defeats or bodies that represent or imple

intelligence officer in prague met with september 11 lead hijacker muhammad atta in early 2001 reportedly to discuss an attack on the radio facility some observers believe the meeting suggests an iraqi role in the september 11 attacks iraq which historically has had close ties to yasir arafat has given some support to antipeace process palestinian groups and hosts the abu dal organization abu

eastern terrorism prior to september 11 there was little ag reement on strategy for countering the terrorism threats discussed above the apparent success of the us military campaign against the taliban and qaeda in afghanistan appa rently has prompted wider acceptance of the utility of military force than was the case previously observers tend to agree that the continued success against qaeda and other terrorist groups will depend on sustained bilateral multilateral or international cooperation with us efforts not all options focus on pressuring stat or groups some experts believe that diplomatic engagement with some stat sponsors and us efforts to address terrorists grievances could be more effective over the long term the united states has claimed some successes for its policy of pressuring state sponsors but there are signs that the united states is now incorporating greater degree of engagement into its policy framework at the same time the united states has not dropped the longstanding stated us policy of refusing to make concessions to terrorists or of pursuing terrorism cases politically or legally as long as is needed to obtain resolution an exhaustive discussion of us effo rts to counter terrorism emanating from the region is beyond the scope of this paper but the following sections highlight key themes in us efforts to reduce this threat49 military force the success of the us military against the taliban movement of afghanistan that had protected the qaeda organi zation has according to many experts validated the utility of military force against terrorism some believe that many governments are now moving against qaeda cells and other terrorist groups present in their countries fearing that us military force might be used against regimes that tolerate the presence of terrori st groups advocates of broad application of military force believe that military action against qaeda in afghanistan has severely disrupted that organizations ability to plan new acts of terrorism skeptics of further military action maintain that c onditions in afghanistan are unique and that the antiterrorism campaign in afghanista n cannot easily be replicated elsewhere us officials say that the continued campaign against qaeda might unfold differently elsewhere including the use of us military advisers to help governments destroy qaeda sanctuar ies in other countries us military attacks were conducted in retaliation fo r terrorist acts sponsored by libya and iraq as well as those allege dly sponsored by qaeda on april 15 1986 the united states sent about 100 us aircraft to bomb military installations in libya the attack was in retaliation for the april 2 1986 bombing of berlin nightclub in which 2 us military personnel were

violations of ceasefire terms not related to terrorism the august 20 1998 cruise missile strikes against th bin laden network in afghanistan represented us strike against group not state sponsor the related strike on pharmaceutical plant in sudan could have been intended as signal to sudan to sever any remaining ties to bin laden the effectiveness of other us military action against terrorist groups or state sponsors is difficult to judge libya did not immediately try to retaliate after the 1986 us strike but many believe that it did eventually strike back by orchestrating the pan am 103 bombing since the 1993 u s strike iraq has avoided terrorist attacks against high profile us targets but it has continued to challenge the united states on numerous issues related to its august 1990 invasion of kuwait the 1998 airstrikes against qaeda did not prompt the taliban leadership to extradite or expel bin laden from afghanistan nor did the strikes deter bin ladens network from engaging in further terrorist activities including september 11 unilateral economic sanctions the united states has been willing to apply economic sanc tions unilaterally particularly against state sponsors of terrori sm in an effort to pressure those states to expel terrorist gr oups they host analysts doubt that unilateral us economic sanctions by themselves can force major ch anges in the behavior of

rejected several outside recommendations most recently those issued in june 2000 by the congressionally mandated national commission on terrorism to place afghanistan on the terrorism list the clinton administration said that placing afghanistan on the list would imply that the united states recognizes the taliban movement as the legitimate government of afghanistan position later adopted by the bush administration however president clinton on july 4 1999 issued executive order 13129 imposing sanctions on the taliban that are similar to those imposed on terrorism list countries and on foreign terrorist organizations th order imposed ban on us trade with areas of afghanistan under taliban control froze taliban assets in the united states and prohibited contributions to taliban by us persons the clinton administration justified the move by citing the talibans continued harboring of bin laden also in its june 2000 report the national commission on terrorism recommended naming greece and pakistan as not fully cooperating with us anti terrorism efforts the clinton administration rejected those recommendations as well in patterns 2000 the state departme nt implied that pakistan and lebanon were potential candidates for the terrorism list or possibly the not cooperating list for supporting or tolerating opera tions by terrorist groups53 on the other hand patterns 2000 did credit

has praised pakistans cooperation lifted us sanctions and begun new fo reign assistance program for that country multilateral sanctions in concert with us unilateral actions the united states has sought to enlist its friends allies and other countries to em ploy multilateral sanctions against middle eastern terrorism as noted above th united states led efforts to impose international sanctions on li bya and sudan for their support of terrorism and both those states sought to dist ance themselves from terrorist groups this suggests that the perception of isolation caused by the u n sanctions was factor in the terrorism policy decisions of these countries in 1998 and 1999 the united states and russia jointly worked successfully to persuade the united nations security council to adopt sanctions on the taliban because of its refusal to extradite bin laden security council resolution 1267 adopted oct ober 15 1999 banned flights outside afghanistan by its national airline ariana and

central as ian states against islamic militant groups linked to qaeda all of these countri subsequently alig ned themselves openly or tacitly with the us war against the taliban and qaeda every year since 1999 the state department hosted multila teral conference of senior counter terrorism officials from the middle east central as ia and asia focusing on combating the terrorism threat from afghanistan these conferences and meetings have often resulted in agreements to exch ange information to conduct joint efforts to counter terrorist fundraising and to develop improved export controls on explosives and conventions against nuclear terrorism55 for the past few years the united states has been providing some detection equipment and few million dollars in financial assistance to the central asian states to help them prevent the smuggling of nuclear and other material to terrorist groups such as qaeda the measure yielded some results in april 2000 when uzbek bor der authorities used this equipment to detect and seize ten contai ners with radioactive material bound for pakistan56 the united states has worked with the european union eu to exert influence on iran to end its sponsorship of terrorism in exchange for relaxing enforcement of us sanctions under the iranlibya sanc tions act pl 104172 which would have sanctioned eu firms that invest in irans energy industry in

countries wher much of the fundraising for qaeda is conducted selective engagement as noted in the discussions of terrori sm list countries the administration has shown increasing willingness to engage st ate sponsors once these countries have demonstrated some willingness to curb suppor t for terrorism us officials justify engagement with the argument that doing so creates incentives for terrorism list countries to continue to reduce their support for international terrorism on the other hand critics believe that terrorism list countries are li kely to view us policy of engagement as sign that supporting terrori sm will not adversely affect relations with the united states of the middle eastern terrorism list c ountries the united states engages in bilateral dialogue with all except iran and iraq the united states has called for dialogue with iran but iran has thus fa r refused on the grounds that the united states has not dismantled what iran calls hos tile policies

that iraq is too far from complia nce with gulf warre lated requirements to make official talks useful legal action legal action against terrorist groups and state sponsors had become an increasingly large component of us c ounterterrorism strategy although the september 11 attacks and us military res ponse has to some extent diminished support among observers for this option in the case of the bombing of pan am 103 the bush administration chose international legal action trial of the two libyan suspects over military retaliation simila r choice has apparently been made in the khobar towers bombing case although that legal effort consists of us indictments of suspects and not uncen tered legal effort the united states is planning to try some qaeda fighters captured in afghanistan although the us strategy has been primarily to defeat qaeda militarily rather than treat the september 11 attacks primarily as criminal case congress has attempted to give victims of international

investigative powers have drawn substantial criticism from us civil liberties groups which have expressed concern about excessive intr usions by law enforcement authorities some arabamerican and american muslim organizations have long complained that us residents and citizens of arab descent are unfairly branded as suspected terrorists and that this sentiment increased dramatically after
