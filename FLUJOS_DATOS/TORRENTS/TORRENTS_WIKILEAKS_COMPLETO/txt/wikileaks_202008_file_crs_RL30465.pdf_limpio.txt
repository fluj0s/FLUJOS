50 usc 1801 et seq as passed in 1978 provided statutory framework for the use of electronic surveillance in the context of foreign intelligence gathering in so doing congress sought to strike delicate balance between national security interests and personal privacy rights subsequent legislation expanded federal laws dealing with foreign intelligence gathering to address physical searches pen registers and trap and trace devices and access to certain business records the usa pa triot act of 2001 pl 10756 made significant changes to some of these provisions further amendments were included in the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2002 pl 107108 and the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 the usa patriot

factual situation may be the focus of both criminal investigations and foreign intelligence collection efforts some of the changes in fisa under these public laws are intended in part to facilitate information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence elements in its final report the 911 commission noted that the removal of the pre911 wall between intelligence and law enforcement has opened up new opportunities for cooperative action within the fbi on may 17 2002 the us foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc issued memorandum opinion and order written by the then presiding

wall procedures in all cases now or ever before the court including this courts adoption of the attorney generals july 1995 intelligence sharing procedures which are not consistent with new intelligence sharing procedures submitted for approval with this mo tion the fisc granted the departments motion but modified part of what it saw as propose d minimization procedures this decision was

intercept and obstruct terrorism act or the usa patriot act among its provisions are number which impacted or amended the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa 50 usc 1801 et seq an act which provides statutory structure for the use of electronic surveillance physical searches pen registers trap and trace devices and orders requiring production of tangible things within the united states to gather foreign intelligence in formation or to assist in specified types of investigations the changes made to fisa by pl 10756 were far reaching for example the law expanded the number of united states district court judges on the foreign intelligence surveillance court and provided for roving or multipoint electronic surveillance authority under fisa it amended fisa provisions with respect to pen registers and trap and trace devices and substantially expanded the reach of the business records provisions to provide mechanism for production of any tangible thing pursuant to fisa court order the amended language changed the certification demanded of federal officer applying for fisa order for electronic surveillance or physical search from requiring certification that the purpose of the surveillance or physical search is to obtain foreign intelligence information to requiring certification that significant purpose of the surveillance or search is to obtain foreign intelligence information as implemented this has made it possible for fisa to be used where the primary purpose of the investigation is criminal investigation so long as significant foreign intelligence purpose is also present fisa as amended also affords private right of action to persons aggrieved by inappropriate use or disclosure of information gathered in or derived from fisa surveillance or physical search or through the use of pen register or trap and trace device of the amendments made by the usa patriot act all but the section which increased the number of judges on the foreign intelligence surveillance court were set by that act to sunset on december 31 2005 pl 109160 and pl 109170 extended the sunset of certain fisa provisions among others to february 3 2006 and march 10 2006 respectively the usa pa triot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 pl 109177 replaced the sunset provisions of pl 10756 as amended with new provisions extending the application of the affected amendments to december 31 2009 amendments to fisa were also made by the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2003 pl 107108 the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 and the intelligence reform and terrorism protection act of 2004 pl 108458 in the 109 th congress two measures the usa pa triot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 pl 109177 and the usa patriot act additional

devices it also added requirements to applications for production of certain sensitive types of records and expanded the requirements for applications for fisa orders for production of tangible things and for orders authorizing such production this act created new petition review pool within the us foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc to address challenges to such production orders or to related nondisclosure orders and established detailed procedure for review of such orders further it directed the inspector general of the us department of justice to perform comprehensive audit of the effectiveness and use including improper or illegal use of the investigative authority under title v of fisa 50 usc 1861 et seq for fiscal years 20022006 the measure modified the requirements for

g345g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 investigations for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence give rise to tension between the governments legitimate national security interests and the protection of privacy interests6 the stage was set for legislation to address these competing concerns in part by supreme court decisions on related issues in katz v united states 389 us 347 1967 the court held that the protections of the fourth amendment extended to circumstances involving electronic surveillance of oral communications without physical intrusion7 the katz court stated however that its holding did not extend to cases involving national security8 in united states v united states district court 407 us 297 1972 the keith case the court regarded katz as implicitly recognizing that the broad and unsuspected governmental incursions into conversational privacy which electronic surveillance entails necessitate the application of fourth amendment safeguards 9 mr justice powell writing for the keith court framed the matter before the court as follows the issue before us is an important one for the people of our country and their government it involves the delicate question of the presidents power acting through the attorney general to authorize electronic surveillance in internal security matters without prior judicial approval successive presidents for more than onequarter of century have authorized such surveillance in varying degrees without guidance from the congress or definitive decision of this court this case brings the issue here for the first time its resolution is matter of national concern requiring sensitivity both to the governments right to protect itself from unlawful subversion and attack and to the citizens right to be secure in his privacy against unreasonable government intrusion 10 the court held that in the case of intelligence ga thering involving domestic security surveillance prior judicial approval was required to satisfy the fourth amendment11 justice powell emphasized that the case before it required judgment on the scope of the presidents surveillance power with respect to the activitie s of foreign powers within or without the country12 the court expressed opinion as to the issues which may be involved with respect 6 the fourth amendment to the united states constitution states the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized 7 katz v united states 389 us 347 353 1967 8 id at 359 n 23 9 united states v united states district court 407 us 297 31314 1972 10 407 us at 299 11 id at 391321 justice powell also observed that national security cases often reflect convergence of first and fourth amendment values not present in cases of ordinary crime though the investigative duty of the executive may be stronger in such cases so also is there greater jeopardy to constitutionally protected speech historically the struggle for freedom of speech and press in england was bound up with the issue of the scope of the search and seizure power marcus v search warrant 367 us 717 724 1961 fourth amendment protections become the more necessary when the targets of official surveillance may be those suspected of unorthod oxy in their political beliefs the danger to political dissent is acute where the government attempts to act under so vague concept as the power to protect domestic security 12 id at 308 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30465g22g145g142g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151

which the court provided in keith with respect to national security surveillance in domestic context to some degree presaged the approach congress was to take in foreign intelligence surveillance the keith court observed in part we recognize that domestic surveillance may involve different policy and practical considerations from the surveillance of ordinary crime the gathering of security intelligence is often long range and involves the interrelation of various sources and types of information the exact targets of such surveillance may be more difficult to identify than in surveillance operations against many types of crime specified in title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act 18 usc 2510 et seq often too the emphasis of domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of unlawful activity or the enhancement of the governments preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency thus the focus of domestic surveillance may be less precise than that directed against more conventional types of crimes given these potential distinctions between title iii criminal surveillances and those involving domestic security congress may wish to consider protective standards for the latter which differ from those already prescribed for specified crimes in title iii different standards may be compatible with the fourth amendment if they are reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens for the warrant application may vary according to the governmental interest to be enforced and the nature of citizen rights deserving protection it may be that congress for example would judge that the application and affidavit showing probable cause need not follow the exact requirements of 2518 but should allege other circumstances more appropriate to domestic security cases that the request for prior court authorization could in sensitive cases be made to any member of specially designated court and that the time and reporting requirements need not be so strict as those in 2518 the above paragraph does not of course attempt to guide the congressional judgment but rather to delineate the present scope of our own opinion we do not attempt to detail the precise standards for domestic security warrants any more than our decision in katz sought to set the refined requirements for the specified criminal surveillances which now constitute title iii we do hold however that prior judicial approval is required for the type of domestic surveillance involved in this case and that such approval may be made in accordance with such reasonable standards as the congress may prescribe 14 court of appeals decisions following keith met more squarely the issue of warrantless electronic surveillance in the context of foreign intelligence gathering in united states v brown 484 f2d 418 5th cir 1973 cert denied 415 us 960 1974 the fifth

defendants unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence from the fisa wiretap and the warrantless search on appeal the court upheld the warrantless suitcase search as supported by exigent circumstances defendants contended that the fbis primary purpose for the surveillance had shifted at the time of the wiretap from an intelligence investigation to criminal investigation and that court approval for the wiretap therefore should have been sought under title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act 18 usc 2510 et seq rather than fisa the court while noting that in other cases it had stated that the purpose of electronic surv eillance under fisa must be to secure foreign intelligence information not to ferret out criminal activity declined to decide the issue of whether the standard under fisa required the purpose or the primary purpose of the surveillance to be gather ing of foreign intelligence information the court stated regardless of whether the test is one of purpose or primary purpose our review of the governments fisa materials convinces us that it is met in this case we refuse to draw too fine distinction between criminal and intelligence investigations international terrorism by definition requires the investigation of activities that constitute crimes 50 usc 1806f that the government may later choose to prosecute is irrelevant fisa

in criminal proceeding only so long as the primary purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information id at 131314 after noting that congress in enacting fisa expected that evidence derived from fisa surveillances could then be used in criminal proceeding the court concluded that it was proper for the fisa judge to issue the order in this case because of the on going nature of the foreign intelligence investigation the fact that evidence of criminal activity was thereafter uncov ered during the investigation does not render the evidence inadmissible there is question in the courts mind that the purpose of the surveillance pursuant to the order was the acquisition of foreign intelligence information accordingl the court found that the fisa procedures on their face satisfy the fourth amendment warrant requirement and that fisa was properly implemented in this case id at 1314 it is worthy of note that none of these decisions were handed down by the us

minimization procedures please see the discussion in the portion of this report regarding recent decisions of the fisc and the u s foreign intelligence surve illance court of review infra nor do these

implications and the us foreign intelligence court of review in its decision ppears to imply that some four th amendment issues in the fisa context may be nonjusticiable alternatively the language in the court of review opinion might mean that the issue has not yet been considered by the courts using balancing test it derived from keith between foreign intelligence crimes and ordinary crimes the court of review found surveillances under fisa as amended by the usa patriot act to be reasonable and therefore constitutional while at the same time acknowledging that the constitutional question

conference report on hr 2338 the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2002 which became pl 107 108 hrept 107328 at page 24 provided the following explanation of these changes the multipoint wiretap amendment to fisa in the usa patriot act section 206 allows the fisa court to issue generic orders of assistance to any communications provider or similar person instead of to particular communications provider this change permits the government to implement new surveillance immediately if the fisa target changes providers in an effort to thwart surveillance the amendment was directed at persons who for example attempt to defeat surveillance by changing wireless telephone providers or using pay phones currently fisa requires the court to speci fy the nature and location of each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance will be directed 50 usc 105c1b obviously in certain situations under current law such specification is limited for example wireless phone has fixed location and electronic mail may be accessed from any number of locations to avoid any ambiguity and clarify congress intent the conferees agreed to provision which adds the phrase if known to the end of 50 usc 1805c1b the if known language which follows the model of 50 usc 1805c1a is designed to avoid any uncertainty about the kind of specification required in multipoint wiretap case

committees understanding that the authority provided in the legislation to designate magistrate judges to consider applications for pen registers and trap and trace devices in the foreign intelligence gathering context would be closely monitored by the department of justice and this designation authority would not be exercised until the committee was briefed on the compelling need for such designations as reflected for example through statistical information on the frequency of applications to the fisc under the new procedure srept 105185 at 28 may 7 1998 the provision authorizing the

all of the judges then sitting on the fisc the fisc granted the department of justice doj motion with significant modifications to section iib of what the fisc characterized as the proposed minimization procedures the court required continuation of the attorney generals 1995 minimization procedures as subsequently modified by the attorney general and the deputy attorney genera l and preservation of wall procedure to maintain separation between fbi criminal investigators and doj prosecutors and raw fisa investigation data regarding the same facts or in dividuals so as to prevent these law enforcement personnel from becoming facto partners in fisa surveillances and searches 169 while permitting extensive sharing of information between such investigations the fisc was particularly concerned with those aspects of section iib of the proposed procedures which would permit criminal prosecutors and law enforcement officers to initiate direct or control electronic surveillance or physical searches under fisa with an eye towards law enforcement objectives rather than foreign intell igence information gathering the fisc set the stage for its analysis by recounting significant number of past instances where fisa applications had included false inaccurate or misleading information regarding information sharing or compliance with wall procedures in fbi affidavits or in one case in statutorily required certification by the fbi director and past occasions where the fiscs orders had been violated in regard to information sharing and unauthorized dissemination of fisa information to criminal investigators and prosecutors while both the fbis and dojs offices of professional responsibility had been investigating these incidents for over year at the time of the writing of the opinion the court had not been advised of any explanations as to how such misrepresentations had occurred the courts dissatisfaction with these irregularities formed

based upon its reading of the statutory language and premised in part on the fact that the usa pa triot act had not amended the provisions of fisa dealing with minimization requirements although other fisa provisions d been modified the minimization provisions with respect to both electronic surveillance and physical searches under fisa continue to be designed to minimize the acquisition and

the court regarded the standard it applied to the proposed procedures before it as mandated in 50 usc 1805a4 and 1824a4 which state that the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures under 101h 1801h and 18244 of the act in its memorandum opinion the fisc first discussed the courts jurisdiction noting that the text of the statute leaves little doubt that the collection of foreign intelligence information is the raison detre for the fisa 171 the court found support for this conclusion in review of pertinent provisions of the act it found further support in eo 12139 and eo 12949 which give the attorney general authority to approve the filing of applications for orders for electronic surveillances and physical searches and authorize the director of the fbi and other senior executives to make required certifications under fisa for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information the fisc therefore concluded that its jurisdiction was limited to granting fisa orders for electronic surveillance and physical searches for the collection of foreign intelligence information under the standards and procedures prescribed in the act 172 in reaching this conclusion the fisc in footnote characterized the issue before it as whether the fisa authorizes electronic surveillance and physical searches primarily for law enforcement purposes so long as the government also has significant foreign intelligence purpose rejecting the approach taken by the government in its supplemental brief in the case the court stated that its decision is not based on the issue of its jurisdiction but on the interpretation of minimization procedures 173 maintaining its focus upon the minimization procedures the fisc also declined to reach the question raised by the attorney general whether fisa may be used primarily for law enforcement purposes174 170 50 usc 1802h 18214a emphasis added 171 fisc op 218 f supp 2d at 613 foreign

the fisc indicated that it was not addressing directly the department of justice argument that so long as significant purpose of fisa surveillance or physical search was to gather foreign intelligence information the primary purpose of such an investigation could be criminal investigation or prosecution fisc op 218 f supp 2d at 615 n2 the fisc was not receptive to the doj theory that wall procedure

minimization175 as applicable only to communications concerning us persons as defined in 1801i of the act us citizens and permanent resident aliens whether or not they are named targets in the electronic surveillance and physical searches176 it emphasized that its opinion was not applicable to communications of foreign powers as defined under 50 usc 1801a or to nonus persons177 after stating its continued approval of the standard minimization procedures for us person agent of foreign power the court turned its attention to two sections of supplementary minimization procedures adopted by the attorney general on march 6 2002 regarding ii intelligence sharing procedures concerning the criminal division and iii intelligence sharing procedures concerning usao us attorneys of fice the fisc regarded these procedures as minimization procedures as that term is defined und er fisa by virtue of the fact that they were adopted by the attorney general and were designed to minimize the acquisition and retention and prohibit the dissemination of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting united states persons178 therefore these procedures were measured against the standard for minimization procedures set forth in 50 usc 1805a4 and 1824a4 the operative language of each section to be applied by the court provides that minimization procedures must be reasonably designed in light of their purpose and technique and mean 175 fisa defines minimization procedures with respect to ectronic surveillance in 50 usc 1801h the term is defined under fisa with respect to physical searches in 50 usc 18214 as the two definitions are similar the definition from section 1801h is included for illustrative purposes h minimization procedures with respect to electronic surveillance means 1 specific procedures which shall be adopted by the attorney general that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance to

attorney gene rals 1995 procedures for contacts between the fbi and criminal division concerning fi foreign intelligence and foreign counterintelligence investigationsas augmented by the attorney general in january 2000 and expanded further by the deputy attorney general in august 2001 the fisc indicated that these procedures permitted the following substantial consultation and coordination reasonable indications of significant federal cr imes in fisa cases are to be reported to the criminal division of the department of justice b the criminal division may then consult with the fbi and give guidance to the fbi aimed at preserving the option of criminal prosecution but may not direct or control the fisa investigation toward law enforcement objectives c the criminal division may consult further with the appropriate us attorneys office about such fisa cases d on monthly basis senior officials of the fbi provide briefings to senior officials of the justice department including

information screening walls proposed by the government in its applications to maintain both the appearance and the fact that fisa surveillances and searches were not being used sub rosa for criminal investigations181 in march 2000 september 2000 and march 2001 the fisc was advised by the department of justice of significant number of erroneous statements or omissions of material facts in fisa applications almost all of which involved misstatements or omissions as to information sharing and unauthorized disseminations to criminal investigators and prosecutors 182 although the fbi and the department of justice office of professional responsibility had been investigating the circumstances involved in these misstatements and omissions for over year as of the date of the opinion the court had not been advised of the reasons for these erroneous statements the court responded to these concerns in 2001 by instituting supervisory measures to assess compliance with wall procedures in the case before the fisc the government moved that all wall procedures be eliminated in international terrorism surveillances and physical searches under fisa the fisc indicated that the new 2002 procedures proposed by the attorney general would apply to two types of cases in which fisa is the only effective tool available to both counterintelligence and criminal investigators emphasis suppliedthose involving overlapping investigations which the court described as cases usually international terrorism cases in which separate intelligence and criminal investigations of the same fisa target who is us person are conducted by different fbi agents where separation can easily be maintained and those involving overlapping interests ie cases in which one investigation of us person fisa target is conducted by team of fbi agents with both intelligence and criminal in terests usually involving espionage and similar cases in which separation is impractical 183 in both types of investigations the fisc indicated that the 2002 proposed minimization procedures provided authority for extensive consultations between the fbi and criminal prosecutors to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against actual or potential attack sabotage international terrorism and clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers and their agents such consultation is expressly provided for in 50 usc 1806k1 and 1825k1 under the proposed minimization procedures those consultations would include providing prosecutors with access to all information developed in fbi counterintelligence investigations including through fisa among other informati on section iib of the proposed minimization techniques would authorize criminal prosecutors to consult extensively and provide advice and recommendations to intelligence officials about all issues necessary to the ability of the united states to investigate or protect against foreign attack sabotage terrorism and clandestine intelligence activities the fisc was particular ly concerned about the authority given criminal prosecutors under section iib to advise fbi intelligence officials concerning the initiation operation continuation or expansion of fisa searches or surveillance 184 the court regarded this provision as designed to use this courts orders to enhance criminal investigation and prosecution consistent with the governments interpretation of the recent amendments that fisa 181 id at 620 182 the september 2000 notification to the fisc from the department of justice identified 75 cases of

section iii of the proposed procedures us attorneys are given the authority to engage in consultations to the same extent as the criminal division of doj under parts iia and iib in cases involving international terrorism the fisc interpreted these procedures as giving criminal prosecutors significant role directing fisa surveillances and searches from start to finish in counterintelligence cases involving overlapping intelligence and criminal in vestigations or interests guiding them to criminal prosecution186 in light of the courts past experience with fisa searches and surveillances the fisc found the proposed procedures to be designed to enhance the acquisition retention and dissemination of evidence for law enforcement purposes instead of being consistent with the need of the united states to obtain produce and disseminate foreign intelligence information emphasis added by the fisc as mandated in 1801h and 18214187 the court regarded the procedures as in effect an effort by the government to amend fisas definition of minimization procedures in ways that congress had not and to substitute fisa for the electronic surveillance requirements of title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act 18 usc 2510 et seq and for the search warrant requirements in rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure the court found this unacceptable nor was the court persuaded by the governments contention that the 1995 procedures prohibition against criminal prosecutors directing or controlling fisa cases should be revoked if criminal prosecutors direct both the intelligence and criminal investigations or single investigation having combined interests coordination becomes subordination of both investigations or interests to law enforcement objectives 188 the fisc stated advising fbi intelligence officials on the initiation operation continuation or expansion of fisa surveillances and searches of us persons means that criminal prosecutors will tell the fbi when to use fisa perhaps when they lack probable cause for title iii electronic surveillance what techniques to use what information to look for what information to keep as evidence and when use of fisa can cease b ecause there is enough evidence to arrest and prosecute the 2002 minimization procedures give the departments criminal prosecutors every legal advantage conceived by congress to be used by us intelligence agencies to collect foreign intelligence information based on standard that the us person is only using or about to use the places to be surveilled or searched without any notice to the target unless arrested and prosecuted and if prosecuted adversarial discovery of the fisa applications and warrants all of this may be done by use of procedures intended to minimize collection of us person information consistent with the need of the united states to obtain and produce foreign intelligence information if direction of counterintelligence cases involving the use of highly intrusive fisa surveillances and searches by criminal prosecutors is necessary to obtain and produce foreign intelligence information it is yet to be explained to the court 189 having found

international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or agents of foreign powers so that th goals and objectives of both the intelligence and law enforcement investigations

civil liberties union joined on the brief by the center for democracy and technology the center for national security studies the electronic privacy information center and the electronic frontier foundation and the national association of crim inal defense lawyers the court of review concluded that fisa as amended by the patriot act supports the governments position and that the restrictions imposed by the fisa court are not required by fisa or the constitution195 g6g146g156g140g158g156g156g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g17g153g146g151g146g152g151g561 the court of review began its analysis by articulating its view of the may 17th fisc decision the court of review stated that the fisc appear ed to proceed in its opinion from the assumption that fisa constructed barrier between counterintelligenceintelligence officials and law enforcement officers in the executive branch but did not support that assumption with any relevant language from the statute 196 the court of review opined that this wall was implicit in the fiscs apparent belief that it can approve applications for electronic surveillance only if the governments objective is not primarily directed toward criminal prosecution of the foreign agents for their foreign intelligence activity while referencing neither statutory language in fisa nor usa patriot act amendments which the government argued altered fisa to permit an application even if criminal prosecution was the primary goal 197 instead the court of review noted that the fisc relied upon its statutory authority to approve minimization procedures in imposing the restrictions at issue the court of review stated that the governme nt raised two main arguments first doj contended that the restriction recognized by several courts of

therefore should have been sought under title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act 18 usc 2510 et seq rather than fisa the court while noting that in other cases it had state that the

governments primary purpose in gathering foreign intelligence information was not criminal prosecution was not supported by the statutory language or the legislative history of fisa this argument was not presented to the fisc but the court of review indicated that it could entertain the argument because proceedings before the fisc and before the court of review were ex parte 199 second the government argued that even if the primary purpose test was appropriate prior to the passage of the usa patriot act the amendments made by that act eliminated that concept the government also argued that the fiscs interpretation of the minimization procedures provisions misconstrued those provisions and amounted to an end run around the usa patriot act amendments doj argued further that the fisc minimization procedures so intruded into the departments operations as to be beyond the constitutional authority of article iii judges finally doj contended that application of the primary purpose test in fisa case was not constitutionally compelled under the fourth amendment the court of review noted that as enacted in 1978 fisa authorized the grant of an application for electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information if there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is foreign power or an agent of foreign power 200 and that each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is being used or is about to be used by foreign power or an agent of foreign power201 the reviewing court focused upon the close connection between criminal activity and the definitions of agent of foreign power applicable to united states persons contained in 50 usc 1801b2a and c to wit any person who knowingly gages in clandestine intelligence activities which activities involve or may involve violation of the criminal statutes of the united states or knowingly engages in sabotage or international rrorism or activities that are in preparation therefor202 the court noted further that fisa defined international terrorism to mean continued the investigation does not render the evidence inadmissible there is question in the courts mind that the purpose of the surveillance pursuant to the order was the acquis ition of foreign intelligence information accordingly the court found that the fisa procedures on their face satisfy the fourth amendment warrant requirement and that fisa was properly implemented in this case id at 1314 199 court of review op 310 f3d at 722 n6 200 the court of review did not

as defined by fisa covers activities that involve violation of chapter 105 of the criminal code 18 usc 21512156 or that would involve such violation if committed against the united states204 for

population b to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion or c to affect the conduct of government by assassination or kidnapping and 3 occur totally outside the united states or

law enforcement purposes in an effort to conform to district court holdings court of review op 310 f3d at 727 most of the published decisions were court of appeals decisions rather than district court decisions the court of review expressed puzzlement that the justice department at some point during the 1980s began to read the statute as limiting the departments ability to obtain fisa orders if it intended to prosecute the targeted agentseven for foreign intelligence crimes while noting that 50 usc 1804 at the time required that national security official in the executive branchtypically the director of the fbi certify that the purpose of the surveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information amended by the patriot act to read significant purpose id at 723 the court did however discuss series of 19821991 cases upholding the constitutional sufficiency of electronic surveillance under fisa as long as the primary purpose of the surveillance was gathering foreign intelligence information rather than criminal pr osecution if foreign intelligence gathering was the primary purpose of fisa electronic surveillance initially and throug hout the surveillance and fisa was not

national security official of the executive branch usually the fbi director206 to certify that the purpose of the electronic surveillance under fisa was to obtain foreign intelligence information and opined that it is virtually impossible to read the 1978 fisa to exclude from its purpose the prosecution of foreign intelligence crimes most importantly because as we have noted the definition of an agent of foreign powerif he or she is us personis grounded on criminal conduct207 it found further support for its view that foreign intellig ence information included evidence of foreign intelligence crimes from the legislative history as reflected in hrept 951283 and srept 95 701208 while acknowledging that the house report also stated that fisa surveillances are not primarily for the purpose of gathering evidence of crime they are to obtain foreign intelligence information which when it concerns united states persons must be necessary to important national concerns 209 the court of review regarded the latter statement as an observation rather than proscription210 the court of review saw the us court of appeals for the fourth circuits decision in united states v truong dinh hung 629 f2d

purpose test the court of review concluded that dichotomy between foreign intelligence gathering and criminal investigations implicit in the application of the primary purpose test was not statutorily compelled the court found that fisa as originally passed did not preclude or limit the governments use or proposed use of foreign intelligence information which included evidence of certain kinds of criminal activity in criminal prosecution212 in addition the court of review relying on arguments of the department of justice and the language of subsection 1805a5 interpreted 50 usc 1805 of fisa as originally enacted as not contemplating that the fisc would inquire into the governments purpose in seeking foreign intelligence information213 further the court rejected the fiscs characterization of the attorney generals 1995 procedures as modified and augmented in january 2000 and august 2001 as minimization procedures these procedures were formally adopted by the fisc as minimization procedures defined in 50 usc 1801h and 18214 in november 2001 after passage of the usa pa triot act and were incorporated in all applicable orders and warrants granted since their adoption by the fisc on march 6 2002 the attorney general adopted new intelligence sharing procedures intended to supercede prior procedures to allow complete exchange of information and advice between intelligence and law enforcement officials to eliminate the direction and control test and to permit exchange of advice between the fbi oipr and the criminal division regarding the initiation operation continuation or expansion of fisa searches or surveillance 214 the following day the government filed motion with the fisc advising the court of the attorney generals adoption of the 2002 procedures seeking to have that court adopt the new procedures in all matters before the fisc and asking the court to vacate its orders adopting the prior procedures as minimization procedures and imposing wall procedures in

departments 1995 procedures as modified and augmented as minimization procedures as follows essentially the fisa court took portions of the attorney generals augmented 1995 proceduresadopted to deal with the primary purpose standardand imposed them generically as minimization procedures in doing so the fisa court erred it did not provide any constitutional basis for its actionwe think there is noneand misconstrued the main statutory provision on which it relied the court mistakenly categorized the augmented 1995 procedures as fisa minimization procedures and then compelled the government to utilize modified version of those procedures in way that is clearly inconsistent with the statutory purpose 215 the court of review interpreted minimization procedures under 50 usc 1801h to be designed to protect as far as reasonable against the acquisition retention and dissemination of nonpublic information which is not foreign intelligence information in light of the court of reviews interpretation of minimization procedures under 50 usc 1801h the court found basis for the fiscs reliance upon that section to limit criminal prosecutors ability to advise fbi intelligence officials on the initiation operation continuation or expansion of fisa surveillances to obtain foreign intelligence in formation even if such information includes evidence of foreign intelligence crime 216 in addition the court of review found that th fisc had misconstrued its authority under 50 usc 1805 and misinterpreted the definition of minimization procedures under 50 usc 1801h the court of review expressed approbation for the governments argument that the fisc in imposing the modified 1995 procedures upon the department of justice as minimization procedures may well have exceeded the constitutional bounds that restrict an article iii court the fisa court asserted authority to govern the internal organization and investigative procedures of the department of justice which are the province of the executive branch article ii and the congress article i 217 the court of review deemed the fiscs refusal to consider the legal significance of the patriot acts crucial amendments to be error218 the appellate court noted that as amended by the usa pa triot act the requirement in 50 usc 1804a7b that the executive branch officer certify that the purpose of the fisa surveillance or physical search was to gather foreign intelligence information had been changed to significant purpose219 the court noted that floor statements indicated that this would break down traditional barriers between law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering 220 making it easier for law enforcement to obtain fisa court orders for surveillance or physical searches where the subject of the surveillance is both potential source of valuable intelligence and the potential target of criminal prosecution221 the court 215 id at 730 216 id at 731 217 id at 73132 218 id at 732 219 id at 72829

implications of this language change which permitted the government to obtain court order under fisa even if the primary purpose is criminal investigation222 interestingly although the court of review did not regard dichotomy between foreign intelligence gathering and law enforcement purposes as necessarily implied by the 1978 version of 50 usc 1804a7b the court viewed the statutory change from the purpose to significant purpose in the usa pa triot act as recognizing such dichotomy 223 the court of review disagreed with the fisc interpretation of the consultation authority under 50 usc 1806k224 the court of review saw this provision as one which reflected the elimination of barriers between law enforcement and intelligence or counterintelligence gathering without limitation on law enforcement officers directing or controlling fisa surveillances when congress explicitly authorizes consultation and coordination between different offices in the government without even suggesting limitation on who is to direct and control it necessarily implies that either could take the lead 225 in analyzing the significant purpose amendment to 50 usc 1804a7b the court of review deemed this clear rejection of the primary purpose test if gathering foreign intelligence information is significant purpose another purpose such as criminal prosecution could be primary226further the court found that the term significant imposed requirement that the government have measurable foreign intelligence purpose other than just criminal prosecution of even foreign intelligence crimes although section 1805a5 may well have been intended to authorize the fisa court to review only the question whether the information sought was type of foreign intelligence information in light of the significant purpose amendment of section 1804 it seems section 1805 must be interpreted as giving the fisa court the authority to review the governments purpose in seeking the information 227 the court of review saw the significant purpose language as excluding from the purpose of gaining foreign intelligence information sole objective of criminal prosecution228 if the government at the commencement of fisa surveillance has not yet determined whether to prosecute the target so long as the government entertains realistic option of dealing with the agent other than through criminal prosecution it satisfies the significant purpose test 229 under the court of reviews analysis if the certification of the applications purpose articulates broader objective than criminal prosecutionsuch as stopping an ongoing conspiracyand includes other potential non prosecutorial responses the government meets the statutory test of course if the court continued working criminal matters and agents working in telligence investigations concerning the same international terrorism target the full range of in vestigative tools against suspected terrorist can be considered within one agency the removal of the wall that existed before 911 between intelligence and law enforcement has opened up new opportunities for cooperative action within the fbi 222 court of review op 310 f3d at 733 quoting sen feingold 147 cong

evidence of past criminal conducteven foreign intelligence crimesto punish the agent rather than halt ongoing espionage or terrorist activity the application should be denied230 the court stated further that while ordinary crim may be intertwined with foreign intelligence crimes the fisa process may not be utilized to investigate wholly unrelated ordinary crimes231 the court of review emphasized that the governments purpose as reflected in the section 1804a7b certification is to be judged by the fisc on the basis of the national security officers articulation and not by fisa court inquiry into the origins of an investigation nor an examination of the personnel involved it is up to the director of the fbi who typically certifies to determine the governments national security purpose as approved by the attorney general or deputy attorney general that means perforce if the fisa court has reason to doubt that the government has any real nonprosecutorial purpose in seeking foreign intelligence information it can demand further inquiry into the certifying officers purposeor perhaps even the attorney generals or deputy attorney generals reasons for approval the important point is that the relevant purpose is that of those senior officials in the executive branch who have the responsibility of appraising the governments national security needs 232 turning from its statutory analysis to its examination of whether the statute as amended satisfied fourth amendment parameters the court of review compared the fisa procedures with those applicable to criminal investigations of ordinary crimes under supreme court jurisprudence and under the wiretap provisions of title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act relying upon dalia v united states 441 us 238 255 1979 the court indicated that in criminal investigations beyond requiring that searches and seizures be reasonable the supreme court has interpreted the fourth amendments warrant requirement to demand satisfaction of three criteria warrant must be issued by neutral detached magistrate those seeking the warrant must demonstrate to the magistrate that there is probable cause to believe that the evidence sought will assist in particular apprehension or conviction for particular offense and the warrant must describe with particularity the things to be seized and the place to be searched 233 the court of review compared the procedures in title iii with those in fisa finding in some respects that title iii had higher standards while in others fisa included additional safeguards in both there was provision for detached neutral magistrate the probable cause standard in title iii for criminal investigations was deemed more demanding than that in fisa title iii requires showing of probable cause that specific individual has committed is committing or is about to commit particular criminal offense fisa requires showing of probable cause that the target of the fisa investigative technique is foreign power or an agent of foreign power foreign power is not defined solely in terms of criminal activity in the case of target who is us person the definition of agent of foreign power contemplates in part the involvement of or in the case of clandestine intelligence activities for foreign power the possibility of criminal conduct the court regarded the lesser requirement with respect to criminal activity in the context of clandestine intelligence activities as to some extent balanced by the safeguard provided by 230 id 231 id at 736 232 id 233 id at 738

target is acting for or on behalf of foreign power234 with regard to the particularity requirement as to the first element title iii requires finding of probable cause to believe that the interception will obtain particular communications regarding specified crime in contrast fisa requires an official to designate the type of foreign intelligence information being sought and to certify that the information being sought is foreign intelligence information when the target of the fisa investigation is us person the standard of review applied by the fisc is whether there is clear error in the certification lower standard that judicial finding of probable cause while the fisc can demand that the government provide further information needed for the court to make its determination as to whether the certification is clearly erroneous the statute relies also upon internal checks on executive branch decisions through the requirement that the certification must be made by national security officer and approved by the attorney general or deputy attorney general in connection with the second particularity element title iii requires probable cause to believe that the f acilities subject to surveillance are being used or are about to be used in connection with co mmission of crime or are leased to listed in the name of or used by the individual committing the crime 18 usc 25183d while fisa requires probable cause to believe that each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is being used or is about to be used by foreign power or agent of foreign power 50 usc 1805a3b simply put fisa requires less of nexus between the facility and the pertinent communications that title iii but more of nexus between the target and the pertinent communications 235 the court of review also compared title iii to fisa with respect to necessity both statutes require that the information sought is not available through normal investigative procedures although the standards differ somewhat236 duration of surveillance 30 days under title iii 18 usc 25183c as opposed to 90 days under fisa for us persons 50 usc 1805e1237 minimization and notice with respect to minimization the court of revi ew noted that title iii under 18 usc 25185 required minimization of what was acquired directing that surveillance be carried out in such 234 id at 73839 235 id at 740 236 for electronic surveillance to be approved title iii requires judicial finding that normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous 18 usc 25183c fisa requires certification by the national security officer involved that the foreign intelligence information sought cannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative means 50 usc 1804a7c the certification must include statement of the basis for the certif ication that the information sought is the type of foreign intelligence information designated and that such information cannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques 50 usc 1804a7ei and ii in issuing an ex parte order granting an application for electronic surveillance the fisc judge must find that in the case of ta rget who is us person th certifications are not clearly erroneous on the basis of the statement made under 50 usc 1804a7e and any other information furnished under section 1804d thus the relevant findings to be made by the courts under the two statutes differ 237 court of review op 310 f3d at 740 the difference in the courts view was based on the nature of national security surveillance which is often long range and in volves the interrelation of various sources and types of information keith 407 us at 322 see also s rep at 16 56 the court also noted that in fisa the longer surveillance period is balanced by continuing fisa court oversight of minimization proce dures during that period 50 usc

subject to interception under this chapter fisa on the other hand requires minimization of what is acquired retained and disseminated238 observing that the fisc had found in practice fisa surveillance devices are normally left on continuously and the minimization occurs in the process of indexing and logging the pertinent communications the court of review deemed the reasonableness of such an approach to be dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case239 less minimization in the acquisition stage may well be justified to the extent the intercepted communications are ambiguous in nature or apparently involve guarded or coded language or the investigation is focusing on what is thought to be widespread conspiracy where more extensive surveillance may be justified in an attempt to determine the precise scope of the enterprise given the targets of fisa surveillance it will often be the case that intercepted communications will be in code or foreign language for which there is contemporaneously available translator and the activities of foreign agents will involve multiple actors and complex plots 240 with respect to notice the court of review observed that under 18 usc 25188d title iii mandated notice to the target of the surveillance and in the judges discretion to other persons whose communications were intercepted after the surveillance has expired in contrast under 50 usc 1806c and d fisa does not require notice to person whose communications were intercepted unless the government intends to use disclose or enter into evidence those communications or derivative information in trial hearing or other proceeding in or before any court department officer agency regulatory body or other federal state or local authority against that person the court of review noted that where such information was to be used against criminal defendant he or she would be given notice and stated that where such evidence is not ultimately going to be used for law enforcement congress had observed that the need to preserve secrecy for sensitive counterintelligence sources and methods justifies elimination of the notice requirement 241 in footnote the court noted that the amici had drawn attention to the difference in the nature of the notice given the defendant or aggrieved person under title iii as opposed to fisa under title iii defendant is ge nerally entitled under 18 usc 25189 to obtain the application and order to challenge the legality of the surveillance however under fisa the government must give the aggrieved person and the court or other authority or in the case of state or local use the state or political subdivision must give notice to the aggrieved person the court or other authority and the attorney general of their intent to so disclose or use communications obtained from the surveillance or derivative information in addition under 50 usc 1806f and g if the attorney general files an affidavit under oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm national security the us district court may review in camera and ex parte the application order and other materials related to the surveillance to determine whether the surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted whether disclosure or discovery is necessary and whether to grant motion to suppress the court of review noted that these determinations are to be made by the us district judge on case by case basis and stated that whether such decision protects defendants constitutional rights in given case is not before us 242 238 id 239 id 240 id at 74041

found that to the extent that the two statutes diverge in constitutionally relevant areasin particular in their probable cause and particularity showingsa fisa order may not be warrant contemplated by the fourth amendment ultimately the question becomes whether fisa as amended by the patriot act is reasonable response based on balance of the legitimate need of the government for foreign intelligence information to protect against national security threats with the protected rights of citizens 243 the court framed the question as follows does fisa amplify the presidents power by providing mechanism that at least approaches classic warrant and which therefore supports the governments contention that fisa searches are constitutionally reasonable in its analysis the court first considered whether the truong case articulated the correct standard truong held that the president had inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information but did not squarely address fisa starting from the perspective that truong deemed the primary purpose test to be constitutionally compelled as an application of the keith case balancing standard the court of review found that the truong determination that once surveillance becomes primarily criminal investig ation the courts are entirely competent to make the usual probable cause determination and individual privacy interests come to the fore and government foreign policy concerns recede when the government is primarily attempting to form the basis of criminal investigation 244 the court of review found that this analysis was based upon faulty premise that in the context of criminal prosecution foreign policy concerns recede and found further that the line the truong court sought to draw was inherently unstable unrealistic and confusing245 the court of review opined that in the context of counterintelligence foreign policy concerns did not recede when the government moved to prosecute rather the governments primary purpose is to halt the espionage or terrorism efforts and criminal prosecutions can be and usually are interrelated with other techniques used to frustrate foreign powers efforts 246 in addition the court found that the method of determining when an investigation became primarily criminal by looking to when the cr iminal division of the department of justice assumed the lead role had led over time to the quite intrusive organizational and personnel tasking the fisa court had adopted247 the court found the wall procedure to generate dangerous confusion and create perverse organizational incentives that discouraged wholehearted cooperation of all the governments personnel who can be brought to the task248 this the court suggested could be thought to be dangerous to national security and could be thought to discourage desirable initiatives in addition the court saw the primary purpose test as administered by the fisc by focusing on the subjective motivation of those who initiate investigations was at odds with the supreme 243 id at 74142 244 id at 74243 citing truong supra 629 f2d at 91415 245 id at 743 246 id 247 id 248 id

an officer conducting search or seizure as irrelevant 249 assuming arguendo that fisa orders were not warrants within the scope of the fourth amendment the court of review returned to the question of whether searches under fisa are constitutionally reasonable while the supreme court has not considered directly the constitutionality of warrantless government searches for foreign intelligence purposes the balance between the governments interest and personal privacy interests is key to an examination of this question the court of review viewed keith as suggesting that somewhat relaxed standard might be appropriate in foreign intelligence crimes as opposed to ordinary crimes 250 the court of review then briefly touched upon the supreme courts special needs cases where the court upheld searches not based on warrant or individualized suspicion in extraordinary circumstances involving special needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement in city of indianapolis v edmond 531 us 32 42 2000 the us supreme court held that highway check point program designed to catch drug dealers was not within the special needs exception to the requirement that search be based upon individualized suspicion because the governments primary purpose was merely to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing the court stated that the gravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of questions concerning what means law enforcement officers may employ to pursue given purpose 251 the court relied upon an examination of the primary purpose of the program but not the motivations of individual officers to determine whether the special needs standard had been met the supreme court noted that an appropriately tailored road block could be used to thwart an imminent terrorist attack252 after summarizing edmond the court of review emphasized that it is the nature of the threat or emergency that took the matter beyond the realm of ordinary crime control253 it concluded that while the gravity of the threat alone cannot be dispositive of the reasonableness of search under the fourth amendment standard it is critical factor in the analysis in its view the programmatic purpose of fisa to protect the nation against terrorists and espionage threats directed by foreign powers was one which from fisas inception was distinguishable from ordinary crime control 254 the court of review also concluded that even without taking into account the presidents inherent constitutional authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance we think the procedures and government showings required under fisa if they do not meet the minimum fourth amendment warrant standards certainly come close255 applying the balancing test that it had drawn from keith between foreign intelligence 249 id citing whren v united states 517 us 806 13 1996 see also arkansas v sullivan 532 us 769 77072 2001 scott v united states 438 us 128 135138 1978 in these cases the court has held that in fourth amendment probable cause analysis of warrantless search or seizure the fact that an otherwise lawful search or seizure may have been made as pretext for searching for evidence of other criminal behavior does not render that search or seizure unconstitutional one might note that the probable cause standard applicable to search or seizure in criminal investigation is different from that under fisa so that the pretextual search criminal cases may not be directly analogous to the fisa situation 250 id at 744 251 531 us at 42 cited in court of review op 310 f3d at

seizures not electronic searches in one sense they can be thought of as greater encroachment into personal privacy because they are not based on any particular suspicion on the other hand wiretapping

and pen registers and trap and trace devices for example under pl 10756 an application for court order permitting electronic surveillance or physical search under fisa is now permissible where significant purpose of the surveillance or physical search rather than the purpose or as interpreted by some courts the primary purpose of the surveillance or physical search is to gather foreign intelligence information while the previous language withstood constitutional challenge the supreme court has not yet determined the constitutional sufficiency of the change in the fisa procedures under the fourth amendment on the other hand the us foreign intelligence court of review has examined number of constitutional issues in in re sealed case finding that fisa orders if not satisfying the constitutional warrant requirement are close to doing so and finding that even if fisa order does not qualify as warrant for fourth amendment purposes electronic surveillance under fisa as amended by the usa patriot act is reasonable and therefore constitutional at the same time however the court of review acknowledged that the constitutional question of whether congress disapproval of the primary purpose test is consistent with the fourth amendment has definitive jurisprudential answer 259 the usa pa triot act also amended fisa to allo w court orders permitting socalled multipoint or

processes and differing perspectives of the two courts created by fisa the fiscs decision was set against backdrop of significant number of instances in which the department of justice had failed to maintain wall between foreign intelligence gathering and criminal investigations all seven of the then sitting members of the fisc concurred in the may 17 2002 order of the court written by the then presiding judge of the court the fisc in its may 17 th opinion and order treated the attorney ge nerals proposed 2002 intelligence sharing procedures for foreign intelligence and foreign counterintelligence investigations conducted by the fbi as minimization procedures and approv ed them as modified the modifications made by the court permitted the fbi the criminal division and oipr to consult with one another to coordinate their efforts to investigate or protect against foreign attack or other grave hostile acts sabotage international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or their agents in so doing the fisc permitted such cooperation and coordination to address among other things the exchange of information already acquired identification of categories of information needed and being sought prevention of either foreign intelligence gathering or criminal law enforcement investigation or interest from obstructing or hindering the other compromise of either investigation and long term objectives and overall strategy of both investigations to insure that overlapping intellig ence and criminal interests of the united states are both achieved 263 while permitting direct consultation and coordination between components the fisc required that oipr be invited to all consultations and if oipr was unable to attend the modified procedures required that oipr be for thwith informed in writing of the substance of the meeting so that the fisc could be notified promptly264 in addition under the procedures as modified by the fisc law enforcement officials were prohibited from making recommendations to intelligence officials regarding the initiation operation continuation or expansion of fisa searches or surveillances nor could law enforcement officials direct or control the use of fisa procedures to enhance criminal prosecution the fbi and the criminal division were given the responsibility to ensure that this did not occur and were also required to make certain that advice intended to preserve the criminal prosecution option did not inadvertently result in the criminal division directing or controlling the investigatio n using fisa tools to further law enforcement objectives 265 in addition the fisc adopted new rule 11 dealing with criminal investigations in fisa cases to facilitate monitoring of compliance with its may 17 2002 order this rule required all fisa applications to include informative descriptions of ongoing criminal investigations of fisa targets as well as the substance of consultations between the fbi and criminal prosecutors at the department of justice or us attorneys office in its november 18 2002 opinion the court of re view took starkly different view of the attorney generals proposed procedures and firmly rejected the fisc analysis and conclusions the issue came before the court of review as an appeal of two fisc orders one granting an application to authorize electronic surveillance of an agent of foreign power subject to restrictions stemming from the fisc may 17 th opinion and order and the other renewing the authorization for electronic surveillance subject to the same conditions the court of review held that the fiscs inte rpretation of the augmented 1995 procedures and the proposed 2002 procedures as minimization procedures under 50 usc 1801h was in 263 fisc

of review found that the fisc had misconstrued 50 usc 1801h and 1805 and may have overstepped its constitutional authority by asserting authority to govern the internal organization and investigative procedures of the justice department it found that fisa as originally enacted did t create dichotomy between foreign intelligence information gathering and law enforcement investigations nor did it require maintenance of wall between such investigations while fisa as enacted in 1978 required that national security official certify that the purpose of the investigation was to gather foreign intelligence information the court regarded the definition of foreign intelligence information as including evidence of criminal wrongdoing where us person is the target of the fisa investigation in light of the fact that the definition of agent of foreign power applicable to us persons involved criminal conduct or in the context of clandestine intelligence operations the possibility of criminal conduct the court distinguished foreign intelligence crimes from ordinary crimes in foreign intelligence crimes intelligence gath ering and criminal investigations may become intertwined the court of review reviewed past court decisions requiring that in seeking fisa order authorizing electronic surveillance the government must demonstrate that the primary purpose of the surveillance was to gather foreign intelligence information and not to further law enforcement purposes rejecting the primary purpose test as applied by the fisc and the courts of appeals of several circuits the court of review did not find it to be compelled by the statutory language of fisa as originally enacted or by the fourth amendment the court of review also held the fisc to have b een in error in its refusal to consider the legal significance of the patriot acts crucial amendments in particular the court focused upon the change of the required certification by the national security official from certification that the purpose of the surveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information to certification that significant purpose of the surveillance was to obtain foreign intelligence information in 50 usc 1804a7b and the enactment of 50 usc 1806k authorizing consultation and coordination by federal officers engaged in electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information with federal law enforcement officers finding that the significant purpose amendment recognized the existence of dichotomy between intelligence gathering and law enforcement purposes the court of review concluded that this test was satisfied if the government had measurable foreign intelligence purpose other than just criminal prosecution of even foreign intelligence crimes 266 while the gathering of foreign intelligence information for the sole objective of criminal prosecution would be precluded by the significant purpose language if the government entertains realistic option of dealing with the agent of foreign pow er other than through criminal prosecution the court found the significant purpose test satisfied 267 although the court was of the view that prior to passage of the usa pa triot act the fisc may well not have had authority under 50 usc 1805a5 to inquire into anything other than the issue of whether the information sought was type of foreign intelligence information in light of the significant purpose amendment of section 1804 the court of review concluded that it seems section 1805 must be interpreted as giving the fisa court the authority to review
