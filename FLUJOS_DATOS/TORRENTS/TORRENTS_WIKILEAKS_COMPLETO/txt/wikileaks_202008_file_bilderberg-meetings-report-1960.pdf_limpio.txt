bilderberg meetings burgenstock conference 2829 may 1960 participant list has been moved to separate file introduction the btirgenstock conference was the ninth of its kind th previous ones having been held in various european countries and in the united states it is not the purpose of these confer ences to attempt to make policy or to recommend action by governments their sole object is by bringing together men of outst anding qualities and influence in circumstances where discussions can be frank and where arguments not always us ed in public debate can be put forward to reach better understanding of prevailing diffe rences between the western countries and to study those fields in which agreement may be sought the discussions are so organized as to permit broad and frank exchange of views to take place they are held in conditions of strict privacy and neither the press nor obs ervers are admitted resolutions are passed and statements have to be approved by the participants who are free to draw their own conclusions those invited to attend the bilderberg conferences are c hosen from different nations and from all fields of public activity and include statesmen diplomatists business and professional men intellectuals and leaders of public opinion all participants attend the meetings in purely personal capaci ty and the views they express do not necessarily represent those of the organizations or parties to which they belong the various topics on the agenda are introduced by rapporteurs who have prepared papers on these subjects thes documents are as far as possible circulated in advance of the meetings in the following text the views expressed during the debates are briefly summarized under headings which correspond to the different points of the agenda i state of the world situationafter the failureof the summit conference in opening the meeting h r h prince bernhard thanked his swiss hosts for their hospitality stressing in particular the excellent choice of meetingplace he also recalled the rules applying to bilderberg conferences with especial reference to the avoidance of leakages to the press the subject for discussion was introduced by two statements the first made by an american participant and the second by european one the american participant spoke of the reactions produced in united stat opinion by the u2 incident both press and public agreed that it was very illchosen mo ment to announce the continuation of these flights although if this standard were to be adopted some factor or another would always mili tate against such flights it was also felt that the various statements made after the incident had been hardly wise in the early stages meteorological research had been invoked as an excuse later it had been given out that the president was unaware of what was happening and finally it had been announced that the flights would continue thus causing confusion in the atlantic camp the speaker dismissed these attitudes as b oyscout behaviour on the other hand he stressed the extremely valuable intelligence that had thus been obtaine d constituting as it did powerful reinforcement to the atlantic concept of the deterrent all the more valid in that the russians now knew that flights of the u2 type had been undertaken for some four years already the soviet s now realize that the dispersion of targets they have carried out over their territory is real safeguard the sp eaker also explained that very probably the pilot had only been forced down after enginetrouble had caused his airc raft to lose so much altitude that it was within the range of russian antiaircraft defences the speaker belie ved that the balance of forces was favourable to the atlantic camp and that the likelihood of war had been temporarily removed to some extent however it had to be admitted that if mr k had decided to torpedo the summit conference the pretext for doing so had been handed to him on silver salver the same speaker also mentione d some important consequences of the incidentthe resuscitation of the eisenhower open skies plan the real ization that the policy of diplomacy based on smiles had failed for good the salutary effect pr oduced on american parliamentary opinion with regard to aid budgets and the increased firmness now visible within nato on the whol it seemed that american opinion now saw things far more clearly and was more disposed to cohesion in the face of the coming struggle particularly on the economic plane incidentally one could say that mr k had overplayed his hand it was eq ually certain that his attitude would have an effect on the american presidential election ks candidate was obviously stevenson with rockefeller and kennedy after whatever the repercussions might be it was of assistance to any candidate to be ks favourite the european participant began by sketching an outlin of events since the yesilkoy conference late september 1959 the whole period d been dominated by the summit and by certain atmosphere of optimism the famous spirit of camp david however mr k while ad mitting that the problems might be solved in not one but series of conferences had bl own hot and cold for his own part the speaker had never ceased to believe that progress had been very slight disarmament nuclear tests and that when it came to the essential problemberlinthere had be progress at all public optimism was based on the idea of krushchev who was the enemy of the stalin ists and who needed period of peac in order to carry out his fiveyear plan without forgetting the threatening shadow of china on th horizon in the face of this optimism it could be asserted that the thaw that had occurred inside russia had left the doctrine intact and had been accompanied by more aggressive attitude towa rds other countries it was clea r that mr ks aim was to appeal to the populations of the west and of the world over the heads of their governme nts in the hope of making th former revolt against the latter as for the u2 incident itself two theories were possible either mr k had realized as result of his trips abroad that the summit conference was bound to end in failure and had wished to avoid this in order not to be forced to carry out immediatel his threats separate peace treaty with germany etc or he expects his technicians to produce some decisive military novelty in the near future which would put him in better bargaining position it might also be true that he does not know what to do for the moment and needs time for thought we must therefore make the best use of the breathingspace allotted to us in this connection the speaker feared that further smiles from mr k might revive optimism with its attendant dangers one positive element in any event was the abandonm ent of the idea that the summit was panacea the speaker thought that the west ne eded success in th field of military technology in the course of the discussion british speaker who attempted to describe the prevailing sentiment in his country although his views were not entirely shared by another british participant showed certain optimism in spite of appearances he thought the failure of the mmit was due rather to erro rs of judgment both in washington and moscow and pointed out that certain moderation had not tirely disappeared from eastwest relations the c 47 affair in east germany mr gromykos attitude in the security council and the fact that the experts were continuing their geneva talks the facts which had led the parties to seek solution remained unchanged the speaker was in favour of continued peacemaking efforts by the west and in this connection recommended the admission of communist china to the united nations he also stressed the risk to the west of waging an allout economic war on the battlefield of the underdeveloped countries he said that british public opinion was in increasing doubt about the wisdom of american leadership while realizing the wests increasing need of american military strength the consequence was an ever stronger tendency within nato in favour of greater european influence on that organization at the same time british public opinion was coming closer to that of the continent several participants mentioned the favourable effects that recent even ts had had on western public opinion there was evidence of greater realism and greater belie f in the value of traditional diplomatic methods one had also to bear firmly in mind that it is mr k who has given the current initiative and the style to the cold war fact that does not call for either optimism or pessimism on our part but simply for an extreme flexibility of attitude as both camps still seemed to agree that total war was improbable several participants spoke of the reasons that had in their opinion led mr k to torpedo the conference before it even began some speakers maintained that the pressure exerted on mr k within the soviet union was not imaginary but appreciable it came not so much or not only from the military but also from certain members of the central committee who would be ready to attack their l eader if the expected results of his spectacular travels abroad failed to materialize soon cf the recent reshuffling of the secretariat of the soviet communist party it should not be forgotten either that mr k is highlyconceited individual and it may be that he expected to be called to the telephone by ike immediately after the u2 incident another cause for concern is that he has idea how the west will react to his behaviour for instance his harbouring of illusions about the possible effects of his attitude towards the american elections he will never be content unt il he has legaized his countrys wartime conquests and from this point of view the german treaty is and will remain his chief objectivehence the permanent validity of his ul timatum perhaps the outcome will be the c onvening by the ussr after the american elections of general peace conference of all the exbelligerents including the two germanies as the west will not give in to such demand separate treaty will be signed and nothing dramatic will happen in berlin which will rather be slowly strangled the west then must draw up as accurate balancesheet of the situation as possible once this had been done there could be two alternativeseither to offer the russi ans solutions that they found acceptable or to bring forcible pressure to bear on them one of the speakers described this choice as tragic and inextricable another speaker went further in his analysis of the inte rnal situation in russia he pointed out that from the point of view of pure doctrine mr k had shown himself to be heretic wh he declared at the xxth congress that war was not inevitable this opinion as to heresy was not generally shared however the same speaker also said that the problems raised for the soviet world by coexistence were just as numerous as those of the cold war among other things the soviet people wa s nowadays less inclined to accept sacr ifices than it had been when it believed itself to be encircled by capitalists and its natural sympathy for foreigners was on the increase mr k himself had encouraged this attitude to the great annoyance of the communists in africa and asia it was also striking fact that until president eisenhowers pre ss conference of 11 may mr ks tone had been relatively moderate it was certain that the r eaction in the ussr against the thaw had grown stronger as the american statements had succeeded ea ch other the west should know how to an alyse the determining factors in its own attitude if one looked to the future said the speaker two questions arose did we really want another summit conference b if so what should we do to make it success howe ver before replying to the second question the speaker mentioned several drawbacks which according to him we re characteristic of summitconference diplomacy the problems of today were of such nature that they re quired specialized technical knowledge on the part of the negotiators of kind not to be expected in heads of state and what was to be done if the conference failed an ambassador who failed in his negotiations could be recalled cabinet minister could fall but when heads of state reached deadlock there could be solution then there were factors of personal order states of mind and of health which in negotiations between heads of stat might assume exaggerated proportions the speaker expressed his preference for the diplomatic method combined with firm but flexible positionfirm inasmuch as we should harbour illusions about the possibility of re aching true compromise with the communist world but flexible because the west should make greater effort of imagination than it had in the past in particular the attitude traditionally adopted by the diplomats geneva wa s case in pointof refusing to base discussion on note prepared by the other side should be toned down it was certain that the west could learn lesson from recent events by trying to lessen its own internal conflicts this had led to the recent british turning towards europe the speakers were unanimous in thinking that there coul d be question of yielding over berlin on the other hand several thought that we should not reject soluti on which would enable the russians to save face in this context we should avoid playing with fire as far as possible several speakers returned to the idea of balancesheet and defined the task of the west in the near future as being the careful elaboration of position on the berlin i ssue to counter any intransigence on the russian part at the same time counte rmeasures should be worked out in preparation for ne w diplomatic offensive one participant pointed out that mr ks heresy w ith regard to the permanent aims of communism had consistedif such had really been his purpose in promoting higher living standards and in relaxing military tension it might be that faced with the danger of crisis caused by the impo ssibility of keeping these promises the soviet leaders had found it expedient to return to the cold war in order to avoid coming under pressure as the initiative has always belonged to them it was still time for the west to change this state of things by holding bayonet to the russians throats for example by sugges ting the implementation of the measures formerly agreed on at yalta it should also be remembered that mr k was tired man and that his state of health might have exacerbated the ambitions of those who surrounded him and upon whom he mu st depend an american pa rticipant who failed to agree with his countrys rapporteur drew negative conclusi ons from the recent events if one considered he said that an effort had been made by thos responsible for american political life in order to make public opinion more conscious of the implications of the last world war the shock produced by the summit failure had brought to the surface again all the negative elements which were stern and unbending in their approach this fact was aggravated by the opening of the electoral battle at time when there should be serious soulsearching so that the united states could define longterm constructive pol icy in concert with its allies however as another american participant remarked the congress was now far more disposed to accept the executives request for funds in order to strengthen the defence potential of the free world he did not believe that we were face d with rebirth of isolationism the american congress would doubtless be prepared to favour new and positive steps both in the united nations and in nato it appeared clear that eastern and western policies woul d continue the first attempting to widen the scope of communist domination the second to fend the cause of freedom the harden ed attitude of communist parties in the western countries showed that for some time past ther had longer been any illusions in the east about the results that could have been obtained at the summit it is fact that mr k had committed himself to considerable extent with regard to the east german government in th light of this situ ation the west should show signs of strength and move towards positive policy seizing all oppor tunities of negotiation that might present themselves once clear picture had been formed one participant returning to previous speech stressed the fact that the united states was not trying to impose its leadership on the west on the other hand he quoted some examples of recent past during which events had driven the us to take the initiativethe reconstruction of europe after the war the korean crisis the berlin airlift and atlantic collaboration the speaker did not wish to go into detail about cases where th initiative certainly did not come from washington such as action in the arab c ountries and suez in this connection one might wonder whether the development of events had not demonstrated that the united states had not perhaps been entirely wrong either at the beginning or even later it might howev er be true to say that the united states had too easily yielded to allied pressure in admitting the possibility of summit conference on this score an american participant warned representatives of the other atlantic powers against showing undue defiance of the americans who could after all conceivably reach an unders tanding with the russians in disregard of the interests of the rest of the world he also recommended clear western declaration on berlin guaranteeing the former status for example another american participant thought that perhaps not enough attention d been paid by either side to what could be done in the matter of extending arms contro l there might be common gr ound here for east and west who could combine to banish fear and devote increased re sources to raising the general standard of living one of the participants was requested to sum up the main issues in the discussion he found that there were three 1 was mr k an heretic or not 2 what should we do about berlin 3 what should we think about american leadership although opinions were divided on the firs t point it could not be denied that something new had happened to the soviet way of thinking since their ne w leader came upon the scene russian public opinion was beginning to grow up and it was counter to the notion of police stat which was the doctrinal position mr k was playing deep game and one could not predict what would happen on the berlin problem it was clear that we had reached deadlock from which it would be difficult to extricate ourselves we should not dismiss the idea of compromise but the ussr would have in return not only to make conc essions but to make such c oncessions as were apparent to the man in the street on the third point the speaker said that rather than speaking of leadership the west should concert its efforts so as to be ready for the next sale coup which might come from the east it would however be better still if the latter received warning in the shape of new western initiatives and in this respect the failure of the summit conference had opened up new perspectives ii new political and economic developments in the western world discussion under this heading was mainly concerned with the problems raised by the development of the european community of the six and the creation of the eu ropean free trade association of the seven and with the american attitude to these probl ems with the scope of developing worl d trade the discussion was introduced by three papers one by participant from one of the si x countries the second by participant from one of the seven countries and third document drafted by an american expert in the first report after stressing th interest of strengthening economic cooperation within the atlantic frameworkespecially towards the underdeveloped countrie sthe author recalled the history of the community of the six ecsc euratom eec from the beginning until the recent steps taken to implement the eec the report also discussed the liberal policy envisaged by the european common market with regard to the rest of the world and the difficulties which arose in deciding on common policy for agriculture transports and monopolies it was also pointed out that the treaty was based on the so lidarity of europe and certain african territories fact which raised the problems of the relati ons between other african territories and the community most of the report was devoted to the external relations of the communi ty common customs tariff which would represent considerable decrease for france and it aly and an increase for the benelux countries and germany and current proposal for 20 reduction in this tariff with respect to countries outside the commun ity reference was made to the british effort to set up wide free trade area and to the attitude of the six w ho insisted on the obligations the member countries had imposed on themselves and whic h found counterpart in the british proposals the fundamental factor was the willingness of the six to ca rry out common policy in number of fields finally there was new factthe appearance of balance of payments deficit in the united states which made that country far more sensitive to anything that resembled discri mination against it the rapporteur recalled the studies now being undertaken for setting up new organization to replace the oeec the twenty plus the eec he also spoke of the political aspect s of cooperation between the six and present schemes to strengthen the community election of the assembly by universal suffrage reinforcement of its powers cooperation in foreign policy and the merging and strengthening of the three existing executives the second report that by participant from one of th seven countries described how that group was brought about by the failure of discussions on the free trade area at the end of 1958 and the rejection of economic isolationism agreements between individual members of the seven and the eec constituting an insufficient palliative it was true that the alliance of the seven looked like countermeasure against th eec but the seven insisted on their willingness one day to promote largescale european economic integration the system of the european free trade association was that of classic free trade area as defined in the gatt it left intact the sovereign rights of the member states although it was recognized that certain decisions could be taken by vote of the majority if this new arrangement was less detailed than that of the six it was partly because the contracting parties did not wish to lay down from the beginning lines of conduct concerning concrete problems that would arise in the future the whole approach was pragmatic one just as the previous report had insisted on the positive ex ternal policy of the eec this one devoted several pages to the prospects opened up by the european free trade association the maintenance and development of intraeuropean trade sufficient communication between the two groups to avoid double investment this being true also for transatlantic investors and an attempt at some thing more than the mere concept of coexistence the rapporteur stated in this connection that 46 of intr aeuropean trade took place between the two groups the author also said that the very wide formula adopted by the european free trade association would allow the eec to participate in it without losing its own characteristics and especially its political aims in conclusion the speaker mentioned certain points the acceptance of the reality of the eec by the members of the association their conclusion that new channels co uld be explored in the search for general european solution the avoidance of any pressure by one group on the other and the development of world trade and aid to underdeveloped countries the author of the american paper also went back to the pa st recalling the american attitude to europe since 1945 the two main objectives of the ited states had been to get the european economy working again as rapidly as possible and to integrate germ any into that pattern the marshall plan had played very important part in bringing about these two objec tives and when robert schuman and jean monnet had launched their scheme for european coal and steel pool it was clear that an important step was about to be taken in both directions but this new step had necessarily d to another in the shape of the common market and euratom which had been hailed by the american public as the keystone of the whole edifice on the other hand the european free trade association did not represent the same aspirations at least not in the political field and this had led to certain american hesitation with regard to it th more so as the obstacles it raised to their own external trade were not counterbalanced by any political advantages as in the case of the six however although it sometimes seem ed as though the united states we re manyheaded monster pursuing different policies simultaneously there c ould be doubt that the new situation of their external finance had given new lease of life to objectives that had always been those of the american economy that is to say an ever increasing development of world trade in this respect extreme vigilance was becoming apparent both with regard to the trade policies of the seven and the present or future steps taken by the six over their common external tariff nor should the needs of other noneuropean countries be forgotten japan and latin america for instance it was not therefore impossible said the rapporteur th at certain amount of agoni zing reappraisal would take place in america after the presidential elections th is would not mean that they would adopt negative attitude towards the eec but american pressure might be exerted within gatt and the international monetary fund in order to bring about general lowering of world tariffs in this respect the attitude that would finally be adopted by th eeg would be of th greatest importance the various points were rapidly recalled by the ra pporteurs at the beginning of the discussion the representative of the european free trade association expre ssed the firm hope that the present transactions with view to widening and transforming th oeec would bear fruit the ra pporteur of the six insisted on the political aim pursued by his group of countries and mentioned the supranational characteristics that had been introduced into the system he also said that this political orientation ran counter to the idea of neutral europe which was danger in the actual state of affairs he added that if the concept of the european free trade association was to be that of the classic free trade area type then the eec could not go very far to meet it very full discussion took place after this the vari ous opinions expressed fell under two headings discussions about the economic organization of eur ope and the speedingup of the common market b the attitude of the united stat and the problems of noneuropean states especially the developing countries the economic organization of europe as several participants both from th six and seven groups remarked th european economic community was now an accomplished irreversible fact whatever might have been in the past the doubts as to its existence that had inspired the attitude of some among the seven countries several speakers from countries of th community supported the statements of their rapporteur and pointed out the main characteristics of the eec two points were pecially stressed the community of the six could only be clearly understood if one realized that the various institutions of which it was composed presupposed in the near or distant future greater degree of political integration to which the measures mentioned by the rapporteur might be the prel ude did this assumption foreshadow the danger of greater split among the countries of europe as some speakers seemed to fear certainly not replied one participant who pointed out that the fact that some european countries belonged to nato while others did not introduced far greater differentiation the arti cles of the rome treat were an indissoluble whole some of them being the entrance fee abling countries to profit by the advantages it thus followed that country outside the scheme could not extract from the treaty only those clauses which suited it while arguing that it was granting reciprocity because that was not true counterpart similarly th tariff policy adopted by the community was only one element of vast political economic and social system from which it could not be detached did this mean that the community of the six was rigid on account of the wealth of detail appearing in the treaties that had set it up in contrast to the pragmatism of the seven speaker who was particularly familiar with the workings of the common market said that pragma tism could equally be applied to that organization all those who spoke on this point mentioned the necessarily liberal characte r of the common market with regard to external trade some speaking of it as though it were to be hoped for others as though it were already certainty in defence of their thesis the latter br ought forward the recent eec proposal to reduce its common external tariff by 20 if reciprocity was granted moreover one of these speakers declared this measure would not exclude additional arrangements between the six and the seven with regard to specific commo dities that played great part in trade between the european nations and the rest of the world especially the united states the eec had proposed to the seven discussion within the framework of the seven plus one whereas failure would probably result if obstinate efforts were made to resusc itate the former maudling committee this view was not shared by another speaker who thought that useful re sumption of negotiations coul d take place within that committee if its members were willing to reach agreement it is certain that the accelerated implementation of the common market cided upon recently had provoked fresh fears in the countries that did not belong to it they feared that such acceleration would ma ke any agreement between the six and the seven mere illusion one participant tried to show that such an accelerati on would on the contrary increase the likelihood of multilateral european solution since strengthening of the economic position of the six would enable the eec to show itself more flexible towards the nonmember countri another speaker said th at the development of the common market had not so far been accompanied by any sign of hostility towards the countries outside it and that there was reason to think that this state of affairs would alter besides it was wrong to exaggerate the importance of the discriminatory element within th common market scheme once the common tariff was in force the expression could disappear from use even if one was not concerned about the political future of big europe and several speakers did express such concerna number of participants felt that every effort must be made to avoid the crystallization of the two economic blocs this would have serious effects in several spheres to take investment as an example it might oblige investors both european and american and it wa s clear that the latter were becoming increasingly interested in europe to make far greater overall effort whereas if there were single greater economic unit much overlapping could be avoided moreover the common market was begi nning to produce visible changes in several trade currents and an advantage accruing to one count ry could only do so at the expense of another even if the existence of the free trade association provided com pensation for the exporters of its member countries by stimulating fresh trade in its turn and it was difficult to draw up balancesheet of this at the present time it was likely that less dynamic market than that of today w ould longer mask the difficu lties but present instead problems that only closer cooperation could solve in an swer to these fears speakers belonging to the six pointed out that the problem of double investment had always existed and that its consequences must not be exaggerated as regards currents of trade they stated that the common market stimulated just as important changes within its own framework and that it had finally been recognized that these changes were beneficial to the community if it was recognized that the eec had common policy in the wider sense of the word whereas this is not true of the free trade association several speakers thought th at it would still be possible to examine arrangements for laying down certain lines of action for both groups in the future agriculture was quoted as one possible sphere for such an effort and also economic aid to overseas countries see below and the external tariff policy which would come about if the association adopted the appropriate clau ses of the rome treaty this led to the question of the institutional setting within which suchcooperation could wo rk scandinavian participant suggested that very close comparative study be made of the respective clause s of the rome and stockholm treaties he felt that this would show that there were more points in common than was generally thought after which it would merely be necessary to incorporate those points into permanent agreement an american speaker who follows european economic evolution very closely sugge sted two possible approaches either as mentioned above extending to the seven the character of customs union already possessed by the common market or including the latter as body into the european free trade association as its eighth member however continental speaker thought it advisable that in the light of the po litical impli cations of the six any negotiations between them and the seven should be preceded by formal declaration as to the final aims of both parties an american speaker added th at any merging of the two groups that did not include polit ical implications would be considered unsatisfa ctory to the united states however all the economic and even po litical problems governing the future development of europe could not be resolved by confrontation of the id eas of the six on the one hand and of the seven on the other several speakers underlined the special circumstances of certain countries for example austri sweden and switzerland had to be very careful not to appear to compromise their political neutrality in the slightest degree on the other hand it seemed that british public opinion was more prepared than formerly to envisage strengthening of ties with the six and one participant pointed out that the reasons that had led the latter to bind themselves so closely were almost all valid for the united kingdom also however real political willingness was needed on both sides and before that could happen certain ghosts must be laid the six and the united kingdom must be given enough time to reach agreem ent in the meanwhile difficulties of commercial nature should not be allowed to prejudice political relations in this connection the special position of the united kingdom as mentioned by several speakers who stressed that countrys importance in the eu ropean context but as one speaker said it was not certain in the present state of things that british request to join the six whether it were as has been suggested euratom and ecsc or ec within the scope of articles 237 nd 238 of the rome treaty would be so favourably received by the latter so of whom might suspect that th ere was fly in the ointment if the political unity of the six is c onsidered desirable and most of the pa rticipants thought it was it was not certain that the common market was the best method of achie ving this aim said one speaker who pointed out that the unity in question was making slower progress than the dismantling of tariff barriers however said scandinavian speaker one had to admit that the six c onstituted the nucleus of great united europe who should remain the long term objective and be th task of an entire generation the attitude of the unit ed states and problems of noneuropean countries if the problems raised by the two groupings of the si x and seven should be exam ined by the countries concerned there is new and capital factor in the now more direct association of the united states and canada in the development of the european economy as shown in th eir intended participation in the future organization for economic cooperation and development ecd which is shortly to replac the oeec in very detailed speech an american participant gave comprehensive picture of the attitude of the united states with regard to european economic achievements in passing he pointed out as several other speakers had done that the behaviour of mr k had done much to strengthen the links that bind the west especially in europe and mr k he said should be thanked for that he recal led the part played by the oeec just after the war in reestablishing economies and promoting the freedom of trade that task had now been accomplished and the choice was not between the new organization and the existing one in other words the status quo but between that new organization and regression the only difficulty was th at which might occur between the oecd and the gatt or the imfwhich the united states wished to see reinforced progress of convertibility especially had abolished any justification for european discrimination against united states exports the problems that the oecd would have to face went far beyond the quarrel of the six and the seven and were more concerned with the position of small countries as compared with big ones analysing the policy of the united states the speaker sa id that this had changed considerably the americans now recognizing for example that the steps to be taken should include safe guards against restrictive practices however problem of principle arosethat of delega ting to an external organization matters which were traditionally within the competence of the united states congress such as the control of commercial policy finally the importance of the external trade of the united states was greater than the 1 of the total previously quoted would lead one to suppose on the one hand the united states could not allow the deficit in their balance of payments of the past two years to continue on the other their whole policy of promoting investment abroad and sustaining the development of the world economy would thus be called in question the united states thought that the industrial development of the community of six would make it an increasingly interesting market for american exports and that was why they were paying close atten tion to the common external policy of the eec which should not only be liberal but also cons tructive agricultural problems moreover the existence of the six group enabled the united states to negotiate with them concrete arrangements on points of detail that had not so far been satisfactorily settled as for the solution adopted by the ven it raised objections in the united states so long as it proved to be entirely compatible with the rules of the gatt to which the united states were increasingly attached as an instrument for the implementation of nondiscriminatory world trade other speakers both american and european insisted on the need for the whole free world to distribute more widely the expenses in the common interest which have laid at the root of the difficulties experienced by the united states for the past two years this was true not only of military expenditure abroad but also of aid to under developed countries which should not on ly be maintained but even considerably increased in the years to come it was within this context that solution should be sought ra ther than in massive increase of american exports which would not be particularly suitable for european countries the problem of institutions arose again here one speaker doubted whether the oecd would be able to deal with the tasks of the future and asked whether nato would not be more appropriate setting in any event stop had to be put to dividing up of action in this field be tween the united states the united kingdom and the rest of europe instead of that distribution there should be co rrect division of tasks under the political patronage of the atlantic organization scandinavian speaker recommended the reduction of tari ffs on the part of the indus trialized countries within the framework of gatt this would accelerate the development of trade in the backward countries previously several speakers had insisted on the special responsibilitie s for africa assumed by such countries as belgium france great britain and portugal in the first two cases this fact was reflected in the rome treaty which laid down preferential treatment for the produce of the afri can territories for its part great britain granted commonwealth preference and this did not only apply to raw materials far from it british speaker suggested that the six and the seven should agree to c oordinate measures in this connection although africa was often mentioned in the course of the discussion it was also recognized that the united states has special responsibilit ies mainly in asia and tin america more generally it was stressed that in the face of growing aspirations in all underdeveloped count ries it was essential that the west should give the impression of being able to guide them while at the same time granting them satisfaction simultaneously each european country should receive certain liberty of action so that it might develop certa in bonds especially in the cultural sphere whatever solutions might finally be adopted with respect to the oegd and its field of action it was indispensable that there should be hiatus between the end of the oeec activitie s and the beginnings of the new organization two speakers particular ly stressing the need to continue the contracts of the excellent technical teams set up by the oeeg if by some mishap the statute of the oecd were not to be ratified by the united states an american participant pointed out that protectionist forces might eventu ally win the day over the liberal forces if there were improvement in the balance of payments before that time than as one european speaker said there would have to be reinforcement of the mutual obligations of the free world that would go further than the rules laid down by gatt and the imf in summing up certain of the points raised the secretary general of the european group drew few conclusions 1 the problem of the six and the seven was not purely eu ropean it was of capital im portance for our american friends and solution should be adopted to which they c ould not subscribe 2 despite this there was room in certain conditions for several intraeuropean arrangement s 3 in the light of the different points of view expressed it was noteworthy that all speakers had thought that certain frictions between the six and the seven could be smoothed over provided that the problems arising were precisely circumscribed many speakers had stated that an overa ll settlement of the sixseven pr oblem could only take place if there were common aim desire for political cooperation other speakers however did not feel that multilateral association called for such common view point it might be tried to come to an arrangement on selective points of specific economic friction betwee n the two groups it was important that none of the participants believed that an economic cooperation could be limited to purely commercial and tradeelements it had been advised not to dramatize the issues but this did not mean that the future negotiations on both sides should not show proof of bonne volonte it was worth noting that the discussions which had taken pl ace had enabled full light to be shed on the arguments for both sides and this meant that unless there were very important developments new discussion of this problem in the bilderberg combinati on should not be necessary the complete text of the secretary generals conclusi ons is appended as an anne x before adjourning the participants expressed through the session chairman their warmest wishes for quick recovery to hrh the prince of the netherlands who had been prevented by sudden illness from presiding over the second days meeting press statement on may 28th and 29th bilderbergconference presided over by hrh the prince of the netherlands was held in burgenstock near lucerne 60 participants from 12 countries of europe and from the usa and canada attended the meeting participants came from the political industrial labor and professional fields the conference started with survey of the present political situation after which the economic problems of europe were discussed with special reference to the futu re relations between the european common market and the european free trade area and of the united states and canada to them prince bernhard was to his great regret unable to presid over the sessions of may 29th owing to indisposition 30 may 1960 annex i summary of the discussions on saturday 28th may by mr c d jackson ever since our friend van der beugel asked to do little summing up 30 seconds ago i have been scrambling desperately in order to have something to say i think that the salient points are the discussion as to whether or not mr k is heretic what are we going to do about berlin and the question of american leadership warning note has been sounded this afternoon and this morning about the question th at we really had to do something about berlin it is very true th at it is extremely difficult to think ones way out of the berlin cul sac it is so easy to say well let us just get out and see wh at happens but we have sett led ourselves with kind of mystical symbolism in the case of berlin that just cannot be disregarded and it seems to that the concession the compromise the device the formula that we would work out with the russians in order to find solution to berlin would be very dangerous and make sense if we were not to get an equal nd comprehensible concession from the russians and when i say comprehensible i mean not just comprehensible to another foreign minister but comprehensible to the man in the street otherwise we will be both physically and psychologically outflanked in europe if our berlin concessions are too great or without adequate quid pro quo the west germans will have to make some kind of accommodation with the east germans which means the russians then nato will inevitably begin to go down the drain nato may continue to exist on paper but it will have eth it may have some beautiful gums but not much to chew with now on mr ks orthodoxy i thought that the exchange between some of the participants was absolutely fascinating is it not fact though that something new has entered into the soviet picture since the advent of mr k something new to the extent that whether for reasons of heresy or unorthodoxy or because he thought he could make the sovi et people evolve at his wish mr k has permitted the dawn of what might be referred to as public opinion in the soviet union now public opinion is the direct antithesis the direct contradiction of the policestate nd the policestate is essential to the statereligion of marxism of which mr k is the high priest and how long or how far can you tamper with statereligion without raising certain amount of hell with the cathedral in which the high priest operates mr k is engaged in an extremely interesting game he is trying to have his coldwar and eat it too and it may be trifle indigestible as it has appeared at times now that is not something that we should take too much comfort from i wish that i could leave this room thinking with anothe r speaker that mr k might not be there in month or two that would be just wonderful but i dont dare thi nk about this any more than i think about our new favorite topic which is that the chinese and the russians are goi ng to be at war in the next couple of months now i must return to this matter of preparing for some new diplomatic initiative on the part of the russians as explained by some of the speakers there is question bu t there is going to be anot her move the west has fallen into the habit of scoring points by getting out of tight fixes heaving great sigh of relief and then going off to have martini at 530 that 530 whistle never blows in the kremlin and these gentlemen are hard at work at the moment preparing the next sale coup which is sure to come and probably very soon i would hope in concert with our allies and our allies in concert with us that we could get around together at all levels and try to think through an initiative on our part this word initiative is worth much these days an d we have had it heaved at us for long time by great many people unfortunately we ve not taken great many initiatives because many of them are awkward and difficult but i think it is essential that we should get ourselves into an initiative mood and i think that the breakup of the summit in paris furnishes us with such an opportunity that we might not have had otherwise now to wind the matter of us leadership i am fra nkly and flatly on the side of those speakers who do not believe washington has been too unsuccessful in that respect i cannot present my personal experience as comparable to that of my compatriot who stood up for th american leadership or to some of the other foreign service gentlemen here but having done stage in the white house having done stagebrieferin the state department i can assure you that the omnipresence of bri tish desires matter what the subject can be pretty appalling at times and it really makes little difference whether labour is in power or the tories it can be profoundly irritating and besides induces sort of pavl ovian reflex on our part by now we almost have conditioned reflex that if downing street so much as twitch an eyebrow we have to dive under the desk which is rather bad thing for us and not conducive to that much desired or deplored leadership annex ii summary of the discussions on sunday 29t h may by mr h van der beugel i shall be very short which is not diff icult i will be serious which is rather more difficult at this time of the day and i will be objective which is still more difficult for summing up cannot be repetition of the arguments this probably means that practically ev erybody who has intervened during this days debate will feel that his particular point of view has not been dealt with but it cannot be otherwise i was extremel grateful to mr rijkens for pointing out one fact which seems rather important in this kind of gathering ie that the six did not speak with one voice that the seven did not speak with one voice nd that even between fellowcountrymen there was what i should like to call slight differen ce in accent with the possible exception of our united kingdom friends when i now try to sum up what we have done today i think that one result of our discussion is that it has been established beyond any doubt that the pr oblem between the six and the seven is not purely european problem there has been some doubt in the minds of our american friends whether it would be appropriate for them to intervene and i think that it has been established here that the problem we have discussed is problem of the greatest interest to our friends overseas for several reasons in the first place i think in practically every speech it has been pointed out that an eventual solution cannot be found without the active assistance support or even agreement of our overseas friends in the second place as to the organiza tional structure which is now being discussed in paris it is definitely certain that this orga nization cannot work without active participation of our us and canadian friends and in the third place from the point of view of the us it has been made very clear by some american speakers that even for the internal development of the us events in europe not only as to aid the underdeveloped countries but in the grea ter framework are very relevant the second point i should like to make is this an amer ican inter vention has made it clear that notwithstanding this first point there is some room under certain conditions for an intraeuropean arrangement i say under certain conditions taking into account our global responsibilities i think this is very important point because some of us have feared that the external relations of the six could only be global or not at all and if th at were true there would be room for any specific european arrangement now as my third point i should like to mention what we can expect for the fu ture there i think it is not possible only to mention common ground i think that if we make fair summingup it is necessary to mention different points of view there is common ground fortunately but in rather limited field the common ground is that practically every speaker thinks it possible to make arrangements on specific and selective points of economic friction between the six and the seven but that does not touc h the heart of the matter it is in itself an important achievement but it does not touch the heart of our discussions the heart of our discussion was that and i think that is fair summingup very substantial part of the opinions expressed leads to th conclusion that an overall settlement of the six and seven problem can only be found wh there is common political aim in other words that an economic cooperation of real ma gnitude is only possible if it ultimately teads to some form of political co operation that is one very important schopl of thought which has been expre ssed here today on the other band there are those who think that achieving multilateral association in europe does not require political aim i think that it is highly improbable that this rather deep differe nce of opinion can be solved in very short time i think what we shall see in the future is an effort to come to an arrangement on selectiv points of specific economic friction between the two groups but i do not think that the discussion of to day can lead to any optimism with regard to the possibility of an overall settlement in the very near future what i think was rather important element of our discussion is that both groups even those who thi nk that some form of economic cooperation will do have recognized the fact that even this ec onomic cooperation cannot be limited to what i should like to call commercial and purely tradeelements we have been advised not to dramatize the issues which ve been discussed and i think this is very wise advice we have seen rather important debunking of the trag ic prospects of split in europe nevertheless mr chairman i should like to say th at not dramatizing the thing should not mean that we should not take this thing very serious ly and our debate can only lead to the hope that those responsible for the negotiations in the future will do so with what the french call bonne vol onte as to the bilderberg meetings itself i think that i find myself in agreement with french participant when he said that we have reached the phase where we practically know all each others arguments and pers onally i do not think that it would be wise to discuss this specific matter again in bilderberg conference unless there are really very important new developments nevertheless i think hat these talks have definitely cleared our points of view annex iii introduction on oecd by mr m martin i want to talk primarily about the or ganisation of europe in the economic field and about some us attitudes toward the issues in this area first i should like to say something about the developm ent of the successor organisation to the oeec known currently as the oecd th organisation for economic co operation and development we have made considerable progress toward developing the outlines of such an organisation and had relatively successful meeting during this past week on the subject which i attended there are still good many problems ahead and i would just as an introductory comment like to call attention to the statements made yesterday morning by number of people about the help which khrushchevs attitude has been toward solidifying the west and to indicate that i think we ma need this help to come to successful conclusion of these particular negotiations yet this leaves little unh appy i must say it seems to that while we all want detente it is hard to see how we are going to get one if after few successful ne gotiations with the soviets our spirit of cohesiveness is going to disappe ar it does not seem to that the disappearance of our unity and our will is the best way to get further concessi ons from the soviet while we may get over this hurdle it seems to that in the longer term we still have some real problems if our public opinion keeps pressing us into this dilemma of being able to be firm only when khrushchev makes mistakes firs t little history about the eec problem it seemed clear to us and some other people that over the past year the vitality of the present eec organisation had been running down it did magnificent job w ithout any question in helping europe recover from the disruption and the damage of the war it pioneered the development of liber trade policies keeping pressure on the countries to move ahead much more rapidly than they otherwise would have however this task d been essentially completed and it was necessary to find some new direction in which to move in addition rightly or wrongly certain bad odor had wiped off on the oeec in the minds of some c ountries because of its role in the sixseven negotiations and at least one major country was riously considering withdrawing i ght add that this country indicated formally just this past week in the meeting that it still had this under active consideration what all this means i think in approaching new organisa tion is that we are not faced with the choice between new organisation or standing still we are faced with choice between new organisation or moving backward and eventually having nothing we and others felt that it was not an acceptable alternative to let the present organisation die on the vine but that it was important to have str ong organisation in europe deal ing with economic questions in an overall fashion we thought that if one looks to th future instead of the past there were problems coming up in the sixties which could be dealt with in this way the increasing importance of economic growth maintaining degree of economic stability the im portance of doing what we could do for the less developed areas whose standards of living are not rising as rapidly as our own an d the provision of larger organisation or framework of strong character within which the diffe rences between the six and the seve n could perhaps be better solved we also thought that it was useful to have such an organisation as this as the one framework in which the neutrals could find themselves in association with the west an important thing in our view we also thought that to have this organisation disappear would be mark of western disunity which we wished to avoid now when we looked at the problems coming up for the future and the possibility of creating strong organisation to deal with them we thought that the best way to approach it was to try to strengthen the organisational structure whic h we had to direct it to the problems of the future rather than of the past and that since these problems were ones which on the whole wethe us and canada as well as the europeanshad good many points in common we could join and become full members participating in trying to solve them now it is in this direction that the group of four has moved in propos ing new organisation and this is direction which in general the us has t hought was desirable the major difficulty which has arisen is over the scope of the activity of the organisation in the field of trade we have thought that with the coming of convertibility with the completion of the period of postwar reconstruction the need for trade arrangements on regional basis has pretty much disappeared we also thought that future trade problems could be handled in the global framework of g att and of the imf we were prepared to see considerable strengthening of gatt to this end and are making proposals at the current meetings to this effect howeverand i must say this is pr oblem which concerned our congress as wellwe have tolerated accepted as desirable and necessary for period of nearly fifteen year s extensive discrimination against us exports on the part of the european members of the oeec we thought th is was desirable and necessary to help them in their wartime reconstruction but with the co ming of convertibility for most of these countries this justification had disappeared therefore we felt that whatever trade arra ngements might be continued those which had regional discrimination built into them could not be acceptable as solution to the future problems that we face ahead of us on the other hand we found that good many of the europ ean countries were very attached to the code of liberalisation and the other trade arrangements which have been built up in the oeec they felt that these arrangements were more compre hensive more detailed than the rules and regulations under gat t they also felt that in the smaller group of europe there could be more ffective pressures to enforce them than in global area like gatt where many of the countries would not be particularly interested in actions by one european against another now they have agreed however that regional disc rimination as they define itand i am not sure whether we agree on the definitionshould be thi ng of the past and should not be continued these countries are however not prepared in other trade matters to give up what has b een set up for the past but feel there may be problems in the future which will require the framework they have had and therefore it should be retained now this difference has been the central issue of the meeti ng we had this past week and will continue to be so for some time i think it is important to note in this connecti on that this is not six and seven issue as far as the us is concerned position that we have taken and language that we d wished to have in the treaty was related to the question of attitude towa rd the six and seven problem it was also interesting that the three countries which took the lead in wanting to retain the full scope of the oeec regulations we re drawn from both the six and seven camps and the three countries which primarily took the lead in the discussion along the lines of essentially the us position were also drawn from both camps it seemed to be much more small versus large country split than six and seven split i may say some of us found it also amusing that one of the countries which was most active in support of the oeec code of liberalisation has traditionally been the mo st difficult to keep in line with oeec rules and the one country that spoke most vigourously in favour of ga tt as solution to all pr oblems has been notorious in the past ten years for its cynicism with respect to gatt the meeting this past week ended with some degree of ccess the us recognising as it had not done before the strength of the feeling on the part of many of these count ries about the old oeec arrangements we modified our position considerably we agreed for example that it w ould be desirable to have in the new organisation trade committee that this trade committee s hould be empowered to deal with such six and seven problems as still existed when the new organisation comes into effect that it should be form in which there could be what we call trade confrontation in other words one country can bring complaints against the trade practices of another we also agreed that we would be prepared to go through the code of liberalisation and see what provisions in it seem to us still appropriate for the future and what provisions were acceptable in our terms now this is where one of our difficult problems arises our congress is exceedingly jealous of delegating any power over us trade policy to an international body or even to the executive branch of the us government which will operate in an international body and the tight rope which we have to walk is to try to see how much we can buy without prejudicing the possibilities of ratification be cause our adhesion to this new organisation will have to be ratified by the congress now we feel that the real issue as it has developed is one of those awkward ones which though very difficult in principle can be solved in practice essentia lly as i would see it our congress is reluctant as matter of principle to delegate to an intern ational organisation control over us trade policies control which they realise will probably never be exercised because within the framework of these rules our trade policies are pretty good on the other hand number of european c ountries are reluctant in principle to give up controls having in mind primarily other european countries and not the us controls which they too realise they will probably never have to exercise so what we have to do is to try to move pe ople as far as we can away from this devotion to principle and down to the pr acticalities of specific arrangements and see what we can work out in the form of compromise but this moving from principle to practical compromise thats where the will to have an arrangement to continue to show the solidarity of the west comes in and plays an important role i now to move little bit to the six and seven problem the us delegati on s has distributed paper prepared by an american expert on this subject it may appear little long but i would suggest that from the bottom of page 5 on is the most pertinent material i would like however to give perhaps somewhat different view as there is still considerable lack of clarity about what i see to be the us official position as distinct from us public opinion on the six and seven issue the essential background to the current us position on this specific six and seven question is i think the concern in the us about the us balance of payments i believe this to be jus tifiable feeling as we cannot continue indefinitely to have deficit of 3 billion or more in our balance of payments despite our large gold reserve we have obligations in the wo rld that we would be reluctant to cut back we dont want to cut back our rather liberal trade policy and move further in this directi on we do not now foresee the possibility of cutting back the 3 billions year that we spent on us military forces abroadthat is not including military aid but just us forceswe will be reluctant to slow down the us pace of investment which is running at over 3 billions year to finance this we require surplus of exports over impor ts and it is in this sense that our trade position and our export opportunities are far more important to us policy than would be sugge sted by the 1 of national income figure that swiss participant referred to consequently there is concern in the us about any arrangement in the present position which represents discrimination against us expo rts as far as the six are concerned this worry has been outweighed as matter of us government policy by the great pol itical advantages we in the six with their objective of political federation we also believe as sec ondary point that the deep integration in the economic field contemplated by the six including free movement of goods capital labor and close integration will result in rapid economic growth and the best markets for us exports have traditionally been those in which there is rapid rate of industrial growth we would therefore hope that the discrimination will be at least to some extent outweighed by the increased opportunities this growth will provide at the same time we are as interested as any one else in seeing that the six external policy be liberal when we first heard about the idea of acceleration i thi nk we made it quite clear in informal channels that acceleration without reduction in othe r words without proposal to reduce th level of tariffs would in our view be an undesirable step the accelerati on proposal which has been made has been accompanied with the proposal to reduce the external tariffs we have particular commodity tobacco which has been heavily hit by the rate established in the treaty of rome for it and we have made our protest vigorously publicly as well as privately with respect to the impact of this what we consider unfair duty on our tobacco exports and we hope others will feel free to do the same when they are hurt we are also concerned that the agricultural provisions that may be adopted by the six could be considered restrictive in us terms nd we will be watching the development of this policy though one is lilywhite pure in this resp ect with respect to other arrangements we will necessarily look at them in the light of their desirability from the standpoint of th us position and the attitude of good many wouldbe protectionists in our congress particularly reflecting the ttitude that they may have toward them as they affect us export possibilities with respect to the seven and larger arrangement our basic position has been that we have objections if they are broadly consistent with the gatt this is not precise position because the provisions of gatt are not precise but one can not go further than that without seeing the details of specific arrangements but in fact we have gone fu rther than that in the case of efta we have about ten days ago said in the gatt where waiver was necessary because of the exclusion of agriculture from the arrangements that we thought it was good arrangement and justified waiver from gatt and we proposed to vote for such waiver and we hoped that other countries would do so as well efta does not have all the advant ages that we think the six has but it has some of them and we were prepared to come to its support even though it did not meet all the requirements of gatt as we saw them what our position would be with respect to wider arrangement is more difficult to say in the abstract until one can see what it would be certainly if it were consistent with gatt we w ould not block it and we would be in position to exercise veto on it if it were not consistent with gatt it would represent wider area of discrimination and i think we would undoubtedly speaking in all franknesshave greater difficulty in supporting waiver under the gatt than we found in the case of efta this does not m ean to say however that we would refuse to do so we would have to examine the circ umstances at the time economic as well as political in order to determine what our position would be we do feel from what we have learned from both sides that the negotiation of wider arrangement which is clearly consistent with the gatt is an unlikely possib ility in the foreseeable future and this is why we have suggested that as prac tical matter it might be more useful to concentrate energi on reducing the areas of trade friction between the two groups as the immediate measure which has the best prospects of success not only do we have the 20 reduction which we hope w ill be confirmed by reasonable degree of reciprocity but we also have an offer from the six to negotiate with respect to partic ular items that are causing difficulty one cannot tell how effective this will be till one sees not only that they are willing to negotiate but what agreements they are willing to reach something you cannot tell in advance but it seems to us that it would be mistake not to take advantage of this opportunity as we have tried to take advantage of their willingness to negotiat on the tobacco matter new duty on tobacco is now under discussion as we understand it in the eec this is matter of viewpoint as to the most helpful tactics at the present juncture rather than any commitment in principle against another arrangement if it can be negotiated contrary to our expectations
