for costly complexity and damage to economic efficiency reform suggestions have proliferated including national retail sales tax several versions of valueadded tax v t the muchdiscussed flat tax on consumption the hall rabushka tax the usa proposal for direct consumption tax and revisions of the income tax the president has indicated that major tax reform will be priority item in his second term and his tax reform commission has included modified flat tax as one of its options most reform proposals are based on the notion that switching to consumption tax base or exempting savings from tax would increase the savings rate and improve economic efficiency although theoretical intertemporal models predict that saving and efficiency would increase evidence from past tax cuts does not bear out this prediction any effect on savings would depend crucially on the transition provisions it is also argued that these taxes could improve the countrys trade balance trade balances however depend on capital flows and would be affected by these tax changes only if they do bring about an increase in the us savings rate there is reason to expect trade benefits from any of the tax changes per broader tax base would have diverse effects on economic sectors sectors that might be adversely affected include the nonprofit sector loss of charitable contributions deductions the state and local sector loss of state tax deductions change in their own tax structures and the health care sector taxation of fringe benefits shifting the tax base from income to consumption while generally increasing business investment would differentially affect firms depending on their growth rate capital structure and employee benefit structure such shift would also make investment in pensions insurance policies owneroccupied housing and taxexempt bonds relatively less attractive there are macroeconomic problems with transition to consumption tax and these problems are extremely serious for transiting to system that collects all revenue from business v t or retail sales tax for these tax shifts avoiding serious economic contraction would be quite difficult the flat tax would not have these problems but it can cause significant windfall losses in asset values flatrate tax is also intended to simplify the system and reduce compliance and administration costs many of the proposals if kept simple while being enacted would reduce costs however many individual taxpayers are currently under flatrate income tax so their lot would not be much improved an enacted law however might not be as simple as the proposals consumption taxes also change the distribution of tax burdens especially on generations the old consume more of their incomes and their burden would increase younger people save more and their burdens would fall higher income individuals would see reduction in taxes this report does not track current legislation and will not be updated

replacing our current income tax system has been topic of perennial congressional interest although many recent proposals are referred to as flat taxes most actually go much further than merely adopting flatrate tax structure and would change the tax base from income to consumption more recently the president has in dicated some interest in such fundamental tax reform and his advisory commission has proposed modified flat tax g22g145g155g142g142g561g15g138g146g151g561g22g138g161g561g4g138g156g142g156g561 theoretically one could construct tax system using one or combination of three main tax bases income wages or consumption incomeand wagebased taxes are familiar and relatively easy to understand under comprehensive income tax all income whether from labor or capital would be included in the tax base wagebased tax would be levied only on income from labor income from capital would be excluded from the base obviously wages provide smaller tax base than income and would therefore require higher tax rates to raise the same revenue as tax based on all income with the exception of sales taxes the american people are not very familiar with other forms of broadbased consumption taxes and so there is some confusion about how they might be measured and levied the easiest way to understand the basis of consumption taxes is to first define and understand the economic concept of income in its broadest sense income is measure of the command of resources that an individual acquires during given time period conceptually an individual has two options with respect to his income he can consume it or save it this relationship means that by definition income must equal consumption plus saving this relationship helps in understanding how comprehensive consumptionbased tax might be levied at the individual level an individual would add up all his income as he does under the current tax system but would then subtract out his net saving saving minus borrowing or add net borrowing the result would produce tax based on consumption at the individual level t

retail sales tax on final consumption retail sales tax exempts in theory the sale of intermediate goods including capital goods to be used in business or it could be collected at each stage of the production process in the form of valueaddedtax v t with the v t firms face tax on gross receipts less purchases of materials goods for resale and capital to be used in the business v at can be implemented using either creditinvoice method or subtraction method1 another way of collecting the tax the hallrabushka flat tax would split the v t base between firms and individuals firms would deduct wages from th eir tax base and individuals would pay tax directly on their wages although the point of collection differs individual level retail level or firm level when defined comprehensively the tax base is the same consumption regardless of the point or form of collection however consumption tax is ultimately paid by the individual consumer because consumption is smaller than income comprehensive consumption tax would require higher tax rates than comprehensive income tax to raise the same revenue although with low savings rate the bases and thus tax rates are very close other developed nations have v ats of the creditinvoice type but also have income taxes their v ts do not replace income taxes but rather finance higher level of government spending most of these nations do not have retail sales tax which is an important subnational tax in the united states g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g138g149g156g561 there is currently serious proposal to shift the entire tax system to wagebased tax as such the current proposals are almost all based on switch to some form of consumption taxation either national sales tax or some form of valueadded tax they differ principally in their point of collection rather than their tax base these proposals include several versions of the valueadded tax widely used in europe national sales tax such as those used in the states and more exotic variations such as the flat tax devised by economists robert hall and alvin rabushka and the unlimited savings account or usa tax originally introduced in the 104 th congress by senators dominici and nunn there is also some interest and at least one serious proposal in broaderbased flatter rate income tax2 bill for this type of fundamental tax reform has had sufficient detail to be operational and such bill has ever received floor vote the president indicated that fundamental tax reform would be major priority of his second term although the shape of that reform is uncertain at this point his advisory commission has included modified flat tax which included tax on financial income as one of the recommended options along with an income tax reform3 many of the issues discussed in this paper especially sectoral effects on currently favored industries would also apply to broader based income tax 1 under the creditinvoice method firm pays the vat on total output and r eceives credit for taxes paid by its intermediate suppliers under the subtraction method firm pays tax on total output less the costs of intermediate inputs the credit invoice method is commonly used in other countries and because of multiple reporting tends to lead to high level of compliance the credit invoice method allows differential rates to be applied to final products based on the tax at the last stage while the subtraction method is appropriate for single uniform rate 2 for summary of current bills and proposals see crs report rl34343 tax reform an

g7g140g152g151g152g150g162g501g561 probably the most often repeated argument in favor of switching to flatrate consumption tax is that it will make the economy more efficient and will increase private savings when evaluating this argument however comparisons should not be made between the current income tax system and an ideal consumption tax compared to theoretically ideal tax whether the base is consumption or income the existing tax system will always appear flawed for policy evaluation therefore more appropriate comparison is between theoretically pure consumption tax and theoretically pure income based tax g7g143g143g146g140g146g142g151g140g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the economic efficiency or inefficiency of tax system may be judged by its effects on behavior to the degree that the tax system distorts economic behavior from what it would be in the absence of the tax it is economically inefficient the distortion prevents the efficient allocation of resources basically with the exception of lu mpsum or head taxes all taxes regardless of whether they are based on income or consumption distort behavior and affect the allocation of resources both an income and consumption tax distort the choice between labor and leisure for example under either tax the price of leisure is reduced relative to the consumption an individual could finance with an extra hour of labor an income tax also distorts the choice between present and future consumption saving under an income tax the return to savings is subject to tax this reduces the resources an individual will have available for consumption in the future and hence raises the price of future consumption relative to the price of present consumption in contrast tax on consumption is neutral with respect to the choice between present and futu re consumption the relative price of future consumption in terms of present consumption is the same as if there were taxes in theory adopting consumption tax may or may not increase overall economic efficiency under consumption tax which yielded revenue equal to an income tax the tax rates would have to be higher than the tax rates on the income tax base because consumption is smaller than income the higher tax rates under consumption tax would increase the distortion between work and leisure choices the efficiency gain from removing the presentfuture consumption distortions therefore might be offset by the efficiency loss inherent in the larger distortion between work and leisure decisions many economists have argued however that consumption tax is superior in achieving economic efficiency ie in leading individuals to consume and work in more optimal fashion because of the elimination of the distortion between present and future consumption they base this argument on the simulated outcomes of intertemporal models which virtually always predict

rate consumption taxes4 one reason for this predicted efficiency gainwhich often does not occur with shift from an income to wage tax baseis that consumption tax is the equivalent of tax on wages and lump sum tax on existing wealth the lump sum tax allows tax rates to be much lower with consumption base than with wage base even though neither tax the return to new investment in fact when an economys saving rate is very low the consumption tax base is quite close to the income tax base there are distributional consequences to this feature that will be discussed subsequently thus even though tax rates may be higher under consumption tax than under an income tax and increase the distortion between work and leisure this increase is relatively small effectthe lump sum tax on old wealth has made this efficiency gain possible the existence and even the magnitude of this efficiency gain however is not entirely clear under less abstract modeling of the tax first under current law the income tax imposes higher marginal tax rates on capital income than on labor income primarily because of the corporate income tax to replace both corporate and individual revenues by flat consumption tax would require higher consumption tax rate and the tradeoff between the labor leisure distortion and the present and future consumption distortion is less clear there may be potential gain from moving from graduated tax rates to flat rates but such gains could be accomplished within an income tax reform moreover many consumption tax proposals include some form of relief for lower income individuals perhaps more importantly there is good deal of uncertainty about whether these intertemporal models actually reflect how people behave the presumed sophistication and information requirements of such models is high and there is evidence and reason to believe that most individuals decide their savings behavior based on fairly straightforward rules of thumb that suggest savings does not respond positively to higher rates of return although it could decline there is even less evidence that individuals are able to shift their leisure and therefore their working hours over time behavior that is an important feature of many of these intertemporal models if the behavioral responses are small then the efficiency gains are small there are certain practical aspects of consumption taxes however that may give them some advantages over income taxes for example the problems and complexities of measuring income from capital are eliminated under consumption ta x eliminating the current law differential in the tax treatment of different forms of capital could improve resource allocation and economic efficiency in practice of course there may be pressure for differential taxes on different types of consumption goods differential that is quite feasible with the retail sales tax and with some forms of the v t but much less likely under tax on consumed income moreover in some types of taxes particularly the retail sales tax it is very difficult to separate out intermediate purchases from final purchases and administer such rules as result some final goods are likely to escape the tax and some intermediate goods and capital goods are likely to be subject to the tax it appears that on the whole switching from an income to consumption tax would probably not produce great improvements in economic efficiency nonetheless even small efficiency gains may be important because they continue year after year however similar gains might also be achieved though income tax

effect is often viewed to be positive result of consumption tax separate from the efficiency gains described above an increase in the savings rate however cannot be determined to be necessarily desirable since it trades off current consumption for future consumption moreover under consumption tax the old retirees who are dissavers because they are drawing down their accumulated capital to finance consumption would pay higher taxes and the young would pay lower taxes because of their higher tax liabilities retired workers would have to reduce their consumption or return to the work force since some of the increase in savings at least in these models is the result of windfall tax on assets of the old it is even more difficult to determine the extent to which the savings effects are desirable for the young consumption tax is the equivalent of exempting the rate of return on savings from tax normally the effect on savings of increasing the rate of return via tax cut is ambiguous there is substitution effectbecause the return is higher one has to give up less consumption today in order to consume given amount in the future this lower price of future consumption encourages more of it at the same time there is an income effectbecause the rate of return is higher one can actually consume more in the future while saving less allowing more consumption today the net effect of these two forces is uncertain consumption tax has another important feature however that overwhelms this income effect unlike mere exclusion of tax on the return the consumption tax allows an upfront deduction for savings but requires the payment of tax on both principal and return when consumption occurs in the future thus individuals need to save today to pay these taxes due in the future they can do so while still consuming more today because of their large tax cuts thus while the young may consume some part of their tax cut the old reduce their consumption by much more and the overall effect is to increase aggregate savings in the economy as with the case of efficiency gains some of the results regarding the effects of consumption tax on savings are based on intertemporal models which rely on somewhat idealized assumptions for instance they assume that all taxpayers have perfect information and the sophistication to map out their consumption choices over long period of time and that they are certain that the tax system will not change during their lifetimes if these idealized assumptions are relaxed then the results are not conclusive that switching from an income tax to consumption tax would increase savings in addition the empirical evidence regarding the effect of tax incentives on savings is inconclusive for example the economic recovery tax act of 1981 significantly reduced marginal income tax rates expanded the availability of individual retirement accounts iras and accelerated depreciation deductions lifecycle models would predict that these changes should dramatically increase private savings but that did not happen finally it is critical to note that any transiti on rules that are enacted to mitigate the increased taxes on the elderly at the time of transition to consumption tax would tend to reduce the stimulus to new saving crucial part of the savings effect is the reduced consumption of the old moreover any increase in taxes on the young would be more likely to come partly at the expense of savings indeed if enough transitional relief were given to the elderly the income effect could be reduced to point where there may be effect or even negative effect on new saving at least in the short run in addition the elderly particularly those with high incomes often do not

make us industries more competitive and help the us balance of trade when analyzing the effects of tax policy change s on international trade it is important to differentiate between nations perspective and firms perspective nation engages in trade because through trade it can obtain the goods and services its people want or need at smaller resource cost than if it were to produce those goods and services itself nation exports its products as means of paying for what it imports on the other hand firms ultimate goals are to sell its products and maximize its profits exports provide means to achieve these goals g22g145g142g561g4g138g149g138g151g140g142g561g152g143g561g22g155g138g141g142g561 popular perceptions about trade tend to reflect firms perspective on trade most people believe that if the united states could produce goods at costs comparable to or lower than those abroad our exports would increase and our imports decrease this in turn would improve our trade performance and reduce our trade deficit in the aggregate however the united states is not like firm that can continually capture larger shares of the world market by producing output at lower costs than foreign firms nation engaging in trade cannot be market winner in all products indeed without borrowing and lending internati onal capital flows trade between nations would always be balanced the only way trade can be out of balance is if one nation lends another nation the resources to pay for the extra goods it imports but does not pay for with its current exports capital flows and trade balances are always mirror images of one another capital inflow produces trade deficit while capital outflow produces trade surplus hence tax policy designed to reduce the cost of traded us goods and services will have little effect on trade performance or the balance of trade

borderadjustable v t then us trade performance would improve and the trade deficit would diminish under the world trade organization wto rules indirect taxes such as v at may be rebated on exports and imposed on imports direct taxes such as income taxes however cannot be adjusted at the border the existence of these border tax adjustments has led some to conclude that nations with v ts have trade advantage over the united states on the surface this appears to be plausible argument reduce the price of us goods and exports will rise increase the price of foreign goods and imports will fall trade it is said will move into balance simple response to this argument is that most european countries with v ts also have income tax structures similar to the united states their v ts are not displacing income taxes they are permitting higher level of government spending but at more fundamental level border tax adjustments dont matter other than in the composition of trade and in this case they serve to preserve relative prices in each country in accord with that countrys own consumption taxes this is because the balance of trade is function of international capital flows not the flow of traded goods and services therefore in the absence of changes to the underlying macroeconomic variables affecting capital flows for example interest rates any changes in the product prices of traded goods and services brought about by border tax adjustments are ul timately offset by exchangerate adjustments bordertax adjustments would have effect on nations balance of trade or its basic competitiveness

influence trade levels or patterns changes in tax policy which affect the underlying macroeconomic variables that govern capital flows for instance by increasing either public or private savings which in turn would lower interest rates or by making investment in the united states more attractive could affect the balance of trade for example if tax policy change caused domestic savings to rise then likely outcome would be fall in interest rates and re duction in the net inflow of capital which would reduce the level of imports relative to exports this effect of capital flows is transitory however as foreigners adjust their portfolios these effects would reverse as the smaller stock of capital would result in smaller earnings and an increase in the net inflow of payments outside of trade these last effects would be small but permanent and offset in present value the initial short run effect in addition tax reforms which increase the overall efficiency of the us economy will ultimately have positive effect on this nations terms of trade defined simply terms of trade reflect the amount of domestic resources that have to be given up in order to acquire given quantity of imported goods if nations terms of trade improve it gives up fewer domestic resources to

deteriorate then it gives up more domestic resources to acquire the same level of imports5 taxes distort the allocation of resources in the economy if tax reforms reduce the distorting effects of the tax system then resource allocation will become more efficient which will increase domestic economic welfare when the allocation of domestic resources is less distorted domestic goods can be produced at lower total resource cost than they could before the tax reforms so to acquire the same amount of imported goods the nation gives up fewer domestic resources which represents an improvement in the us terms of trade the gain however is likely to be small finally tax policy can and does affect the composition of trade for example if the tax change increased the tax burden of some firms relative to others then those firms with an increased tax burden might see their market share and their exports decline on the other hand those firms that experienced relative decline in their tax burden might see their market share and their exports increase these relative shifts in the interfirm tax burdens and the resultant shift in market output could affect the composition of both expor ts and imports indeed the purpose of allowing rebates of value added taxes is to prevent one countrys pattern of differential consumption taxes from being imposed on another by stripping out the relative taxes on exports and allowing the importing country to impose their own pattern of taxes

tax reforms would affect the allocation of economic resources some sectors generally those that are capital intensive and growing will gain slower growing firms will lose other sectors that might be adversely affected by broadening the base to more fully reflect income and by removing itemized deductions are the nonprofit sector the state and local sector the residential real estate industry and the health care sector these are sectors that receive special benefits under the income tax proposals to shift the tax base from an income base to consumption base most proposals while generally increasing business investment would differentially affect firms depending on their growth rate capital structure and employee benefit structure they would also make investment in pensions insurance policies owneroccupied housing and taxexempt bonds relatively less attractive and investments in ordinary stocks and bonds more attractive g21g142g140g157g152g155g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 firms and sectors that would be adversely affected by tax change may face difficult transition period which could lead to some economic disruption moreover for certain types of tax structures there would be need for major onetime price inflation to avoid an economic contraction some tax revisions present design challenges regarding the treatment of some industries such as financial institutions

compliance and to some extent conform to the federal tax base states would either face increased enforcement costs and lost revenues if they retained current rules or they would have to adapt their systems to the federal system also for the reform proposals that do not tax capital income taxexempt bonds would become less attractive and borrowing by states and municipalities more costly also proposals that disallow the deductibility of state and local taxes would make increases in these taxes more costly to taxpayers finally for some proposals state and local governments would need to remit taxes on employee fringe benefits g17g160g151g142g155g556g17g140g140g158g153g146g142g141g561g10g152g158g156g146g151g144g561 generally businesses include receipts in income and deduct costs owneroccupants of housing do not include the imputed income rental value of living in the house while mortgage interest and property taxes remain deductible thus the federal income tax favors owneroccupied housing changes in the tax structure that restrict deductions of interest and taxes or that exempt income from new investments from tax would divert investment out of this sector and into the business sector the likely magnitude of this effect is uncertain g16g152g151g556g18g155g152g143g146g157g561g11g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g156g561 proposals that would eliminate the charitable contributions deduction could decrease charitable giving to some degree the incentive for higherincome individuals and hence charitable giving to the recipients of their contributions would be most affected since they are the ones who itemize nonprofit institutions might also need to remit taxes paid on fringe benefits for their employees under some proposals g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g5g138g155g142g561 health insurance fringe benefits are favored under current tax law which allows firms deduction for contributions but does not include benefits in

basis while firms would still have reasons to provide pensions proposals that would extend this treatment to all investments would make pensions relatively less attractive and might discourage their

their tax bills rising investment would be favored under sales tax because investment goods are exempt some proposals would tax certain employee fringe benefits which would increase the relative cost of compensation for firms that have large share of these fringe benefits in their benefit package growing firms that rely heavily on equity and offer few fringe benefits would be the beneficiaries of

difficult issues to address in considering shift to consumption taxes is the transition from the current system to the new tax regime6 while all shifts to consumption tax cause some common transitional disturbances and windfall gains and losses the most serious problems arise from shift to national retail sales tax or to value added tax in these cases tax formerly largely collected from individuals is now collected at the firm leveleither from retailers on total sales or from both final and intermediate producers value added flat taxes avoid this problem but can result in confiscatory taxes on existing assets 6 see crs report 98901 shortrun macroeconomic effects of fundamental tax reform by jane g gravelle for more detailed discussion of these issues

enough of profit margin to pay the tax without something elseeither prices or wagesadjusting consider for example grocery retailer that may have 1 or 2 profit margin now owing tax equal to 20 of receipts this firm simply does not have the cash to pay the tax if it is difficult to lower wages and presumably it would be significant onetime price inflation to allow these costs to be passed forward in prices instead would be required to avoid potentially serious economic contraction note that the price increase were it possible to implement correctly and precisely would solve the transition problem because although prices would rise individuals would have more income to purchase the higher priced goodsand demand would not fall it is difficult however for the monetary authorities to engineer such large price change moreover even with the monetary expansion in place to do so the imposition of such tax would be disruptive if firms are reluctant to immediately raise prices again leading to an economic contraction that is firms could contract their business or even close down until output had contracted enough to raise prices these disruptions are not minor in natureimagine the difficulties of engineering and absorbing onetime price increase that is likely to be close to 20 the level approximately that might realistically be needed to replace the income tax 7 even if such an inflation could be managed there are always concerns that any large inflation could create inflationary expectationsits hard to manage single oneyear price increase in fact economists who judge consumption tax to be superior to an income tax may nevertheless be skeptical about the advisability of making the change because of these transition effects despite the extensive analysis of the economic effects of fundamental tax reform however little attention has been devoted to potential shortrun contractionary effects particularly of proposals that would shift the liability for tax payments from individuals to businesses one may note however that when major macroeconomic forecaster roger brinner from drimcgrawhill modeled v t replacement in joint committee on taxation study he found output falling over the first five years reaching height of 125 in the fourth year 8 the other forecaster did not simulate v t but only flat tax which does not require this price accommodation the remaining modelers had full employment models although the short run disruption from the retail sales tax and the v t is most pronounced any shift to consumption tax will likely cause short term economic contraction due to sectoral shifts in the joint committee on taxation study both macroeconomic modelers who used cyclical models that permitted unemployment projected the flat tax which continues to tax individuals on their wages to cause contractions albeit smaller in the short run 7 the rate would depend on whether and the extent of any family exemption 20 tax

the flat tax also produces some transitional effects on cash flow that can be quite severe for owners of assets because it does not require price accommodation consumption tax can also be characterized as wage tax plus lump sum tax on old capital that is it taxes the sources of income used sooner or later for consumption pu rposes individuals will eventually consume out of new assets but the cost of those new assets will also have been deducted from income when acquired 9 one explicit manifestation of this effect is that businesses that have already purchased assets and inventories in the expectation of being able to deduct their costs over period of time under fixed depreciation schedule for plant and equipment and when sold for inventories will longer be able to take such deductions if firm is constantly growing then the ability to deduct new investments in full will more than compensate for this loss of old deductions on cash flow basis although the value of the firm will still fall but for firm that is not growing or is liquidating or for an investor who wishes to sh ift from physical ownership such as real estate to financial asset tax liability could rise dramatically consider the following example suppose an investor purchases building for 450000 with mortgage of 95 427500 two years later the price has increased to 500000 and he has taken 23000 of depreciation deductions to simplify suppose he has refinanced to maintain the same mortgage he decides to sell and use the proceeds to buy financial asset such as corporate stock under current law he would measure gain subject to tax as the sales price of 500000 less the basis original cost of 450000 less 23000 in depreciation or 427000 this gain would amount to 73000 which is the sum of the appreciation in the property of 50000 and the depreciation he has already taken assuming for simplicity 20 tax rate he would pay capital gains tax of 14600 he pays the mortgage of 427500 and is left with net cash of 57900 suppose however that flat tax consumption tax had been enacted in the interim at the same rate under the flat tax he would pay 20 tax on 500000 or 100000 one can see that this tax is more than confiscatory after repaying the mortgage of 427500 and paying the tax of 100000 he has loss in cash flow of 27500 why does this happen it happens because the flat tax is collected in way that does not require price increase and the lump sum tax on assets falls solely on the equity claim to an asset the holder of the mortgage has had loss in value with either retail sales tax or v at and price accommodation the investor would be left with 73000 in cash whose purchasing power has decreased by 20 10 the mortgage holders asset would also lose 20 in value thus the lump sum tax is allocated to both debt holders and equity holders 9 physical business assets equipment structures and inventories would be deducted from income as an intermediate good under the flat and vat approaches and not subject to the retail sales tax sales of business assets whether new or used would be taxed under the vat and flat tax owner occupied housing would presumably be an exception b ecause the stream of imputed rental income is not taxed newly constructed housing would presumably be subject to the retail sales tax and the purchaser would not be allowed deduction or credit under flat tax or vat existing housing would presumably be neither taxed nor eligible for deduction the return to this new housing would still be exempt from tax but the method of doing so would be different 10 the price level in the economy would increase by 25 why 25 rather than 20 this is simply the difference between the tax inclusive rate of 20 and the tax exclusive rate of 25 the tax

form of consumption tax that does not require price accommodationa direct tax on consumed income under this approach individuals would begin with the income tax base and deduct net investment or add net withdrawals of investments to income with th is type of tax both financial and physical investments would be included in the calculation and the individual would be able to deduct the mortgage repayment as an investment the direct tax on consumed income has not proven to be very popular however as it would complicate rather than simplify tax calculations for the individual and require unfamiliar and probably unpopular tax rules such as including loans in taxable income one could avoid this cash flow problem under the flat tax by allowing the recovery of depreciation inventory and basis such revisions would be costly to include and would require much higher tax rates perhaps for long period of time 11 they would also zero out the tax for many firms the lump sum tax on old capital is an important contributor to the projected efficiency gains for switching to consumption taxes the major reason that so many economists favor consumption base

to stock prices if tax is levied at 20 rate with inflation to fully accommodate all consumption prices would rise by 25 dollar of financial or physical assets can purchase only 80 of the real consumption goods it could purchase in the past if there is inflation the nominal price of consumption goods should be constant and debt retains its purchasing power but since new assets can be purchased at 20 discount the value of firms old capital would fall by 20 if the firm has debt the stock should fall by 20 if third of its assets are financed by debt typical of the economy the stock should fall by 30 if half is debt the stock should fall by 40 individuals who have borrowed to buy stock could be significantly affected 12 continued tax inclusive rate if prices go up by 25 you lose 20 of purchasing power that is an 80 basket of goods would now cost 25 more or 100 and you spend 100 to purchase goods that are worth only 80your 100 has lost 20 of its purchasing power in our example in the case of the retail sales tax the individual keeps 72500 the 500000 sales price less the mortgage repayment which is 72 500 he implicitly pays tax of 20 because this am ount can only purchase 58000 of goods before the application of 25 retail sales tax in the case of vat the price of the building would rise by 25 to 625000 and after paying 20 tax on receipts the investor would have 500000 less the mortgage paymentwith the same results ensuing 11 the magnitude of these transition issues for the flat tax is discussed in crs report rl33545 the advisory panels tax reform proposals by jane g gravelle 12 some people disbelieve that this price effect would occur but if it did not then in effect the tax is not acting as consumption tax and none of the investment incentives would work it is the fall in the price of stock that makes investment in corporate equity more attractive and it correspo nds to the ability when directly investing to deduct the cost of capital acquisitions

costs reduced by v at however depending on how the taxes were structured businesses might find themselves facing two largely incompatible accounting systems for financial purposes creditors and stockholders would still require net income calculations with depreciation inventories and all the other accrual accounting conventions at the same time the tax system would require valueadded computations on cashflow basis flat tax with single rate would not by itself do much to simplify things for most individual taxpayers in fact for many individuals the current system is flat tax with single rate and large exemption almost 41 of all individual income tax returns currently either owe tax or are taxed at 10 rate the flat tax therefore would not represent much of simplification for many individual taxpayers who are already subject to similar system nor for larger businesses which would be relieved of only the marginal accounting costs as sociated specifically with the income tax its simplifications would mostly benefit smaller businesses and individuals with more complex income tax filings individuals with businesses however would be required to file two returns one for the business and one for their wage income if v at or retail sales tax were to provide mechanism to relieve the burden for the poor though credit system as many propose individuals would still have to

outside the tax system this may depend on what part of the underground economy is meant the informal economy which involves evading taxes on legal activities is partly function of tax rates reducing rates would reduce the rewards of evasion and thus the incentive to cheat but some proposals would result in higher marginal rate for most smaller taxpayers 17 instead of 10 for example for the illegal economy where tax evasion is normally minor part of the criminal activity there is reason to expect any outcome except continued evasion although different tax structure would alter the way in and degree to which income avoids tax and depending on behavioral responses the actual burdens for example under an income tax producers in an underground market pay taxes while their customers who operate in the legal market do under sales tax producers effectively pay taxes on income when it is spent in the market their customers pay tax on the segment of income that reflects value added by the illegal part of the market although tax is paid on intermediate inputs in many ways certain forms of value added taxes and to greater extent retail sales taxes increase the incentive for firms to avoid tax for retailer with say 2 profit margin the benefit of avoiding profits tax is less than one percent of profits if the retailer stands to save 20 of each dollar the incentive to avoid tax is much greater that is the reason that many tax administrators would recommend the invoice credit form of the v t used by europeans so that firms present evidence on their intermediate purchases which helps to monitor the behavior of the seller rather than the subtraction method where firms subtract from intermediate purchases from their tax base it is also reason that many tax scholars doubt that

done however number of the flattax proposals could in their current form lose revenue perhaps substantial amounts they would also reduce the progressivity of the tax

however has analyzed version of the flat tax with proposed rate of 17 finding revenue shortfall this estimate however was made in 1995 before the major tax cuts were enacted the treasury found that the revenueneutral flattax rate in the proposal given the level of exemptions ranging from about 10000 for single individual to about 30000 for family of four would be around 21 208 about four percentage points above the proposed permanent rate of 17 20 alternatively the 17 rate could be maintained nd the exemptions cut by over half to maintain revenue neutrality with neither revision treasury estimated the proposal would lose 138 billion annually there has been considerable dispute about whether the 23 tax rate proposed for the fair tax national retail sales tax with rebate for low income families would be adequate to replace the income tax and payroll tax reasons for the dispute include technical questions about the requirements to keep government spending fixed in real terms the degree of evasion the effects on economic growth and whether the tax is replacing the current level of tax revenues following the recent tax cuts or the level after these tax cuts expire 21 other proposals with lower rates andor more exemptions would presumably lead to larger revenue losses adding deductions such as the payroll tax deduction or restoring itemized deductions such as those for mortgage interest and charitable contributions would cause larger revenue losses 20 us department of the treasury office of tax analysis preliminary analysis of flat rate consumption tax march 10

flat tax except that they have exemptions could presumably raise adequate revenue at lower rates if the base were kept broad the required rates in other proposals will depend on the base any revenue losses would either lead to higher deficits and debt or require spending cuts generally the latter option has been proposed some proponents have incorporated in their plans the presumption that tax rates can be lowered in the future due to economic growth it is important to note that number of these taxes have consumption base thus any growth that arises from increased savings would contract rath er than expand the tax base in the short run increases in labor supply would increase the tax base our knowledge of the likely effects on labor supply and savings is very limited however

from an income to consumption base for taxation could cause large changes in the distribution of taxes across generations and family types as well as income classes

repealed the burden would rise on low income individuals as well as the middle class based on the 21 tax rate and using percentage change in disposable income as measure poor individuals would experience decreases of 67 under the flat tax and middle income individuals decreases about 3 to 5 while the highest income class will gain about 9 according to the treasury analysis again ba sed on estimates before the recent tax cuts 22 these effects would be more pronounced if revenue neut rality were achieved through lower exemptions rather than higher tax rate there are however conceptual problems in assessing distribution of consumption taxes23 valueadded and sales taxes would reduce tax progressivity further because they do not permit exemptions unless credit mechanism were introduced proposals with graduated rate structure would be more progressive than other proposals but they have not been closely examined by the treasury or the joint committee on taxation 22 ibid most analyses find that highincome individuals would gain from flat tax some studies find plan with rebate would benefit very lowincome individuals as well see for example peter mieszkowski and

shift the tax base from an income to consumption base most proposals would shift the tax burden substantially across generations the flat tax for example has consumption base although it appears to be wage tax for individuals the burden of tax would be shifted from wages and capital income to consumption which is equivalent to wages and old capital both principal and return since older individuals own capital the burden would tend to be shifted to those individuals g3g561g14g146g143g142g157g146g150g142g561g18g142g155g156g153g142g140g157g146g159g142g561 the ways in which consumption tax burdens old capital are complex and the incorporation of generations as well as income in distributional analysis is limited at this time in general however younger individuals who are in taxable status and who will save substantial sums over their lifetimes would benefit relatively from the tax while middle and higher income older individuals consuming assets would bear greater burden wealthy individuals would have their tax burdens reduced over their lifetime if they maintain and increase their assets poor individuals with little savings over their lifetime would be relatively unaffected by the change in the base as long as transfer payments are indexed to changes in the price level needed by tax revision the rate structure is more important for these lowincome individuals

consumption hence both an income and consumption based tax can be marriage neutral if the accompanying tax structure is designed appropriately marriage penalties andor bonuses can be avoided if taxes are levied on individual rather than family income or consumption and if standard deductions and tax rate brackets for married couples are twice the size of those for single taxpayers under the current income tax when married couples are compared to single filers marriage tax penalties are confined to very lowincome married couples who claim the earned income tax credit and to highincome married couples above the 25 marginal income tax threshold all other married taxpayers receive marriage tax bonuses or at worst neutral tax treatment when compared to two singles with the same combined income flatrate consumption tax with two filing stat uses married and single and with standard deduction for married couples that is twice the size of the standard deduction for single individual would eliminate all marriage tax penalties and bonuses the same result however could also be achieved under an income tax by adopting single tax rate and standard deductions that are twice as large for married couples as for single individuals there are marriage bonuses or penalties with sales or value added tax
