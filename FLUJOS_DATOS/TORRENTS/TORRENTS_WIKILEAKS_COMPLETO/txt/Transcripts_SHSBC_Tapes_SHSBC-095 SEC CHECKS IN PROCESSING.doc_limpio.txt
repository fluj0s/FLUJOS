sec checks in processing lecture given on 12 december 1961 hey what do you know theres two or three live people in here today hey what do you know thats pretty good huh all right this is what the 12th of dec still the nautical month ad 11 saint hill special briefing course and if i were in fine fettle boy would you get it ive heard it said that there are states beyond despair your instructors have reached them well by and large i think youre all doing fine and if you improve five or six hundred percent in the next twentyfour hours itll be all right okay well i want to talk to you today about security checking and some other things but first i would like to make mention of what an auditor who can really audit should have id just like to mention this in passing he should have good security on his ability to audit he should have british mark iv emeter he should have somebody to take care of appointments receptions and do those nasty things connected with money and he ought to have at least two understudies two auditors who have had good hpa training and who need some real brushups up to class ii thats what he ought to have i would consider that an absolute minimum for an auditor auditingan absolute minimum why well hes not going to get any auditing done unless he has these things lets look at the present setup lets look at the way it is are youthe only person in your immediate area who can do 3d assessment accuratelyare you going to spend all of your time upwards to seventyfive hours case getting all the security checks in line getting this person up to point where hell respond on meter and so forth because youre not going to do it thats the answer to that youre not going to do it youre going to go in and youre going to try to get 3d and youre going to fall on your heads and then youre going to get in and try to get 3d and then youre going to fall on your heads and then youre going in and youre going to try to get 3d and youre going to fall on your heads why because you havent got time to set case up properly and so youre going to make lot of bulls thats about the way it is youre going to make lot of flubs i can just see it on the wall now you better get couple of people by the scruff of the neck who have some good central organization academy training and you better gun them up to being good class iis that can do reliable security check to set up cases for you to assess and it takes about two to one minimum more opportunely about five thatd be better number but it takes at least two to one in other words you can run 3d accurately off in perhaps half the time that it takes to set case up if the case has been set up so you would be auditing one for one with two auditors doing class ii skills now what about this other what about this other all right couple of very good auditors left here and they went down to an area and theyve written some letters about technical matters since but administrative matters boy are they off the lines are they in mess administratively somebody comes up apparently and waves some money under their nose and they shove it in vest pocket or something of the sort and then they audit this person one way or the other and try to keep their appointments straight and are going straight out of communication their administrative records must look like cows dinner and theyre going to get so lost in all this mess that they will feel that they are terribly pressed and confused why do theywhy would they feel they are pressed and confused why theyre not being pressed and confused by auditing theyre being pressed and confused by administration theyre being pressed and confused by mrs glutz who is calling up who must have their appointment changed on thursday and they are all mixed up because they havent got time to sit down and do their income tax because they cant have an accountant do their income tax because they themselves dont have any records so they have to do the records before the accountants can pick up the income tax in order to do the income tax you get the idea so youre going to get all mixed up about how arduous it is to be an auditor when as matter of fact you will not even vaguely be concerned with auditing itll be terrible itll be absolutely awful trying to keep up with the administrative end of it and auditing at the same time and the next thing you know everything will look all confused and you wont know which way youre going whether youre going or coming thats what it amounts to and thats what anybody who has an advanced skill in society ought to be doing now i hope youre high enough on the level of help to be able to be effective in this particular direction can you accept help to this degree yes we know you can help people but can you accept help to this degree all right now i can give you something that if you put it in newspaper would get you preclears its something on the order central organization should put it in you can always talk to scientologist about your difficulties interesting isnt it and that i think youd not been tested but im sure youd find that about the hottest response button that you could possibly get we will talk for you to anyone about anything that had an interesting run wherever it was done but i would think you will find that this will enormously exceed that one justits on this basic theory you can always talk to scientologist about your difficulties you want to say well you can always talk to about your difficulties youve got about the same thing with your address and phone number you get pcs now as far as thats concerned there are plenty of pcs in any district just in the field of scientology itself and youve gotyou yourself know of bunch of cases that have fallen on their heads or havent quite made it or this or that or know some situations that you could straighten out all right if youve got somebody that could handle money for you you can always sayyou can always say to this person well ill straighten it out and this other person plucks their sleeve and says for so much but if theres nobody there to say for so much then you go ahead and you help people ragged and let tell you that the world is full of people who have to be helped have to be helped and they never outflow anything at all so you could rapidly put yourself in position where you couldnt help peoplevery rapidly put yourself in position economically where you couldnt afford to help people by simply having administrative person who would take money off people so that you could help people now starting up practices and that sort of thing isnt so much the question most of you people are known one way or the other or youre going back to central organization but im just giving you piece of advice off of theoff of the bat here dont go plowing yourself in and feeling how confused it all is simply because you lack basic ingredient which is little tiny bit of organization now youre so used to thinking of yourself as you so used to thinking of yourself as one personperhaps perhaps standing alone and dauntless against the worldthat you dont realize that all you have to do is just say to somebody you can help and you immediately have all the help you want the only reason you dont get personnel is nobody is telling people that you need help see and so on one of the basic things thatone of the basic things that has been difficult in my experience in the last eleven yearsi wont say its too much help that isnt true but i will say its trying to adequately handle people who want to help so that they are not deadending with their offers of help that has been my main problem it hasnt been the problem of getting help its been the problem of making very sure that if help was offered some way or another it could be utilized if at all possible and this has been very tough problem to solve now if you can get yourself into that category youre all set as far as economics are concerned youve got the world what more do you want it goes from pole to pole from sundaymonday line straight around to the sundaymonday line there are several pounds of earth here it weighs quite few pounds theres quite bit of distance around it of course i realize its twelfthrate sun and secondrate planet around twelfthrate sun nevertheless it is planet and the truthtruthfully speaking as of this momentit is yours there is doubt about that at all you let any advanced technology forward which can accomplish its ends in finite period of time and can predict its accomplishment and you have the area you are in that is all there is to it i mean thats it if you went into this technical society and you could just make better screwdrivers than anybody else why if you had any acumen at all you eventually would make some kind of minor success of the situation but were not talking now about screwdrivers were talking about the stuff of which life is made life itself and any time you get technology of that character going forward and you have grasp of that technology you cannot help but win you dont even have to try to win people will come ahead and present you with large sections of earth that is all i mean it cant help it for instance right now ive told them occasionally from time to time theyd never get into space without us ive told them that from time to time well what do you know cape canaveral just sent for scientologist they wont get into space without us and then some psyrologist is going to try to copy all this and some psychiatrist you d can you imagine any of these boys being able to do 3d assessment or even reliable security check look at the state our technology is in at the present time it happens to be selfprotecting mechanism i as matter of fact occasionally held my breath and said supposing it came out so simple at the other end and all you said was woofwoof and somebody was clear wouldnt that be nice and youve all said wouldnt that be nice but let point out something else if you let this much technology that can be that easily done loose youre in for trouble technology which does not require skilled applicator is what the world and this universe mainly suffers from you put out an atom bomb that any government official can press the button of and what have you got see youve got it all set all you have to have is one button you push the button they got button up here at brizenorton very interesting its big thingamabobshielded area and i think one key is held by british officer and one key is held by an american officer and frankly the frontpiece on the thing says war and peace and when they turn the key it turns to war and all they do is they both insert their keys and they go click and there goes the abombs and the hbombs there it is thats all they have to do isis that thats it its that easy of course it takes some airplanes to deliver them maybe or something like that but i think theyre even cutting that down to zero now theres what happens when technology of very powerful nature requires special skill because you can never build an ethic into it then it can be used for anything let tell you that an abomb release button or an hbomb release button does not ask whether the presser is communist democrat kennedyite presbyterian member of the bachbach we kill them all society of southern jungleosis doesnt care who see doesnt care who presses it at all and you have an irresponsibility of some magnitude thats what happens when the technology i may exceed your grasp of this thing very often and you say what you mean its good thing that we have to sit here at saint hill and shiver out in thein cold rooms andandandand get up in the dark and go home in the dark you mean its good thing we have to sit here and sweat yes ladies and gentlemen its good thing its good thing you do all right for one moment then with that one out of the road lets take anlook at something else lets look at theat what were walking into forwardly the broad program on which we are operating is very broad and very concise program we have central organizations and offices all over earth its exaggeration they are functioning ways and means are always being implemented to make them function better to get up their units and that sort of thing what they suffer from mainly is lack of technology as soon as that technology is secure why youll be in very fine position supposing i were in position now to tell somebody in northern quebecand i said now all you have to do is go down to the new york office and get yourself class ii rating and go home youll be able to take care of your wife all right and supposing i could say that with fantastic security supposing i could say that with such security that i knew very well that the message passed on to the new york office would actually pull the person in when they got there would they be adequately and rapidly trained to the exact degree of skill or audited to that exact degree of skill and rundown which would produce that exact result be fabulous be utterly fabulous all right now therefore were working right now on establishing technical superiority and security in every one of these central organizations and its proceeding with considerable speed i mean were doing all right with this its going rapidly enough so that right up till two weeks ago one central organization was falling on its head didnt know whether it was going or coming or what to do with its property or who was fighting it or otherwise it had been enturbulated for about two or three years with rather poor handling and all of sudden got all of its organizational rudiments in and got things pretty well squared away and suddenly got the idea that our business is scientology started doing scientology and had their first thousandpound week since february just bang just got their house in order and started making money again and everything seems to be falling off now thats because it was running on pattern it went back to running on pattern its never been on pattern beforethat particular central organization interesting my policy with regard to central organizations and city offices is to build in selfreliance selfreliance initiative the ability to act and operate under fixed pattern with considerable aplomb so that they can take care of what goes on in their area we dont want situation where every time they want to buy new teacup they have to send cable to saint hill you get the idea nah that doesnt ever work well it depends to large degreehaving an organizational setup of that typeon the technical accuracy and results of the application of technology if you can do these thingsif you can train people well and you can process people well and if you follow set patternpeople know what theyre doing you cant help but win all right now an extension of that we have franchise holders and these people routinely and regularly are trying to put up standard and it falls in on them and they try to put it up and it falls in on them and they try to put it up and it stays up for while and then it falls in and then they try to put it up and it stays in for quite while and it falls in and theyllthats about the cycle theyve been going on but remember that they have been much less accurate on an averagefield auditor auditing resultshave been much less accurate and much less high than central organization on an average most field auditors dont believe that and i myself might not believe that if i myself had not long examined the records now of course there have been exceptions in the field there have been exceptions and these people have allhave all done very well but im talking of the broad average do you know why an hgc was ever started in the first place what was the genus of the hubbard guidance center what was it its because field auditors could not audit pcs to results they couldnt so we had to set up some kind of unit that took care of this up to that time we were only interested in training but that was why an hgc got set up and that happened right here in england and the results were too chaotic and we got better results in the hgc than were normally gotten elsewhere well theres various reasons for that but the basic reasonlet put your attention on this for moment the basic reason is because there is more severe discipline in operation in an hgc and thats just about all there is to that even though i may lead them over hill and dale occasionally and get them onto this and get them onto that and so forth and try to get some results in spite of it all nevertheless they do get better results with all that now the central organization as long as its impoverished or feeling bad or feeling upset or something like this tends to combat other activities it tends to go into games condition with other activities you get two central organizations on either side of one continent theyll go into games condition with each other or on two different continents they will and they do tend to go into games condition with let us say field auditors and the field auditor goes in games condition with the central organization do you know what this is this is simply lack of success thats all its very funny when pcs are scarce and everything is scarce and its all running on high scarcity youll get games condition the havingness is inadequate and so the central organization tries to pull in all the pcs and keep the field auditor from having any pcs and the field auditor tries to pull in all central organizations pcs and so forth well what is this this is just scarcity scarcity is repaired by technical excellence the better job you do the less scarcity there will be that is all there is to that and i always look at central organization or field auditor who has gotten into games condition as an organization or person who arent getting results thats just as simple as that it just goes one two if theyre in games condition with everybody in sight theyre not getting results thats all all right this course here at saint hill was instituted and instigated for one purpose only it wasnt because i didnt have enough to do if youll look over my roster youll find it hasi have couple of odd jobs this was all in the direction of getting the highest possible level of technology which was attainable now ive tried to stabilize the technology which was in use and we have stabilized it remarkably well it is stabilized right up to point ofwell i think about the last third of 3d is possibly subject to variation right now there may be some method of running case off faster after the case has run lot of levels ive already informed you of this but lets take what is basic there are going to be some little changes in beginning and end rudiments but otherwise youve already had those changes and most of you are using them right this minute model session is stable the auditors code is stable the code of scientologist the axioms are stable the basic processes of rudiments actually exist in too great number at the present moment there are too many effective processes and ill have to shake that down so that we have few less processes that you can do rudiments with and then we wont make any mistakes on this and well get the rudiments in better thats little point of variation you always expect those points security checking man that is stable like the rock of gibraltar that is the way you security check reading meter boy i dont know every time i go into researching anything about advanced meters i always come back and say what marvelous instrument this mark iv is its just marvelous because advanced meters of various kinds tend to do something else they tend to read too much body action and the body reactions become too great and this becomes too great and that becomes too great and every time you increase the sensitivity of the meter you double the response of body action and get whata onethird gain on the mental action in other words when you increase the sensitivity of your meter your mental action increases just that much and your body action increases that much so of course the responses of the meter then are lost in those body reactions im talking now about advanced experimental meters of one kind or another thats very stable meter and i work hard to hold it stable and to continue it that way you might be interested that the reason other meters which have been built from one time to anotherwhy i invalidate these meters nowis not because you might not have good one you might have good one you might be lucky you see you might have good squirrel meter butyou might have good american meter but on the assemblylining of these things some of them were built with cheap parts and some of them expensive parts and some of them were finished by electricians who knew nothing of scientology who protected the action by putting in damping mechanisms but it isnt just damping mechanism because they put in the damping mechanism they changed other parts of the circuit and that was right there on the assembly line as meter number 15 and 16 was all right and then 17 and 18 are damped and then 19somebody found some cheaper component some place or anotherso 19 is built out of cheaper components you get whats variable about these meters it is not that you yourselfin having meter that was built somewhere in the field or was an old american meter or something like thatit isnt that that meter is necessarily bad meter it may be that that meter has an instant response that meter has proper gradient its linear curve for the potentiometer is all goodmaybe thats all right but the one right after that that isnt all right and the one right after that is probably in the hands of some poor joe down in tucson that is trying to clear somebody and he gets nothing but lags and he hears about instant response and of course he cant get one and that sort of thing so this is all in thein under the heading of stability security checking is very stable the construction of meters is tremendously stable the various parts and things which you are using are very stable i dont think the trs have been changed for years you havent learned them either and the now i packed up on problems intensive were not asking anybody to do problems intensives here to amount to anything but nevertheless it came out in bulletin its all just brrrrt and thats the way you do problems intensive and i dont think there is any other way to do problems intensive so these are stability stability stability stabilities the assessments processing on 3d assessment by elimination how you find the parts of this thing there arent new answers to these things the old answers followed give you the result maybe one day i will get extremely bright and i will find out some way someand i will because we need itill find out some way to figure out which is the pcs term and which is the oppterm absolutely reliably bangbang so that you never make the slightest quiver on this thing and thatd be good thing to know thatd be good thing to know before you start running lot of pcs backwards because on some of them unless i myself sat down onwith an emeter i wouldnt know whether they were running frontwards or backwards i frankly wouldnt right this minute id have to watch the pc for session or two this is on secondhand basis not auditing you see thats you auditing and watching your reports and im saying ohh is it isnt it you know sort of hold breath two three sessions well this is running all right and then i forget it thats all right another onewell we dont know we dont know well all i can tell from your session is at least the pc isnt getting into trouble but at any moment prepared to shift over the opposite way to so we need bettera better gimmick better test right there now all of these thingsthe form of sessionthese things are all stable as the devil and were ready were ready just now to push off ill show you some of the things that have defeated us in the past remember old step 6 well do you know step 6 would work today it was never done and that is very true of practically well 99 percent of the stuff step 6 was never done do you know what you had to do with an object before you had the pc make it bigger and make it smaller and solider and all that sort of thing do you know what you had to do with one you had to find null object on the emeter it had to be null object and wherever it beefed up the banks you didnt find null object well lets look at that with relationship to the goals problem mass of course if you had any object that quivered youd be onto the goals problem mass and wouldnt dare do anything with it but you could take something not associated with it which wouldnt register and you could do something with that and therefore you could exercise the pcits an interesting idea you seeyou could exercise the pc on creating and mocking up without antagonizing or messing up particularly the goals problem mass and you could stay off of that and come off of that theoretically and then the pc with some of the automaticitythis is theoreticalsome of the automaticities of mocking things up off of course could then have had the goals problem mass evaporate thats theoretical thats theoretical if he wasnt close to it it could have been knocked out by exercises in creatingness we have one pc right now whose auditor is quite concerned who is running create on level i think youre the only one in the whole unit anyplace that has hit create as prehav level and of course this is giving this pc fits because it fits the terminal perfectly and its just about to run forever well why is it about to run forever well its the basic button of the reactive bank of course what else could it do but run forever its going to go on and on and on of course the more he creates why the morethe less bank and its doing something to the goals problem mass all the time so he isnt running into it you say well thatd be good idea then we ought to run all pcs on their terminals on create go ahead youll spin them in it was just fluke that this pc hit it and if youll notice your pc is running for long time on the level that exactly fits the terminal you notice that if you get the exact level see that just fit that thing just marvelously see well heresheres terminal lets take terminal little boy and if we had level play now how long do you think that would run see it would go on and on and onif it were hot on the case which it might very well not be see but youd run level one level two level three and all of sudden youd hit this one play see this is crossexample because nobody has hit it but there it is see and youre running this one well of course itll run and run and run and run and you say wheres the case wheres the case wheres the case and itthis one wont pile up the goals problem mass because the goals problem mass is practically totally made out of that level so every time you start to rassle with the goals problem mass it thins out and pieces fly off of it again see so up goes the tone arm and down goes the tone arm and up goes the tone arm so instead of lot of levels pulling the goals problem mass apart you have one level pulling it apart because its basic level that fits the terminal you could expect that to happen but theres something else you can expect to happen with regard to the goals problem mass is any time youre running pc with the rudiments out youre going to run forever and the way to test it is test the terminal when youre in the rudiments stage of the session just ask just say the terminal and see if you get needle response if you get needle response on the terminals your rudiments are sufficiently in to run it of course you go through the rudiments and clean them up but if you dont get terminal response dont run the level in other words run rudiments till you get terminal response on the needle and that is the sure test that means rudiments are in now im quite interested in this other factor you are running double command particularly on the 7 december thirtycommand bracket youre running double command did it ever strike you that it could run forever on the oddnumbered commands without the level being introduced and later in runi can add this to your knowhowif you cant get it to flatten realize please that it is running only because of the odd numbered commands and the evennumbered commands which contain the level on them are ineffective and the first chance that you would notice of this is the pc starts telling you that the level doesnt fit the problem he has just thought up he starts telling you this oh he can tell you once he can tell you twice during run thats normal hell hit one or two that dont match but all of sudden he starts saying oh well lets see now heres waterbuck and uhmproblem about waterbuck well how to get some water all right and the prehav level is devastate all right and you say well how might devastate solve that confusion and he says well it wouldnt it doesnt well it has previously hes hit similar problems devastate oh well yeahoh waterbuck would just devastate the surrounding countryside and the rivers would all run and hed get water you know before going on devastate ah hm well you have choice but to have him contrive some way it would do so and he goes on to the next one and how might devastate resolve that problem devastate who ever heard of that word you see what youre doing youre getting your motion on the casethe motion on the case is occurringpurely and entirely because youre asking him for confusions which would give you tone arm motion youre saying tell confusion thank you tell or problem or whatever word youre using tell trouble tell trouble tell trouble tell trouble tell trouble youre getting tone arm motion but longer is the oddnumberthe evennumbered command functional and the way you do that isone of the symptoms would beit suddenly doesnt fit anymore oh you got tone arm action and previously this case has been going up and sticking you know and everythings fine now it goes up and sticks and falls off and it goes up and sticks and falls off and the pc cant answer thatthose evennumbered commands you had better ask the magic crystal ballthe emeterwhether or not that level still has any action on it so you say devastate devastate its not prayer its faintly rising needle you know and you say devastate devastate it doesnt stop it theres quiver devastate devastate devastate oooooooooh all right very good thank you very much were going to do another prehav assessment be about the end of that give you two more commands and end this process then is that all right with you after youve done it you see how that would be you can actually get tone arm action on the oddnumbered commands independent of the evennumbered commandsand you should look at that because case starts going bluuurew now it is true that if the level is right on the cases button that is that case you see waterbuck swimmer see swim swim swim you see it just runs on and on and on and on and on swim swim swim swim swim solves everything everything is solved by swimming swimming if you get into trouble you swim if you get out of trouble you swim if you want to have some fun you swim if you want to get even with somebody you swim swim swim swim swim swim swim swim swim swim and then all of sudden after hes run from this maybe two or three days hes very fit you know youve already done lot to the goals problem mass with this thing you see you chewed it up enormously and then all of sudden you ask him all right tell problem about waterbuck and he says oooh waterbuck getting across some trees getting cross some downed timber how to get across some downed timber and you say how might swim have resolved that problem he says swim swim who ever heard of swimming and you say well think of way you know just to get the question answered ive used this myself well give an answer just so we wont have an unanswered question please and the pcll answer it some way try it again see because it might have been fluke you know and you say all right tell problem waterbuck might have with tiger and he says how to escape forest fire and tiger at the same time and you say good now how might swim have resolved that problem swim swim have resolved the problem lets see swim swim do waterbucks ever swim what youve done is run the top of the automaticity dont you see and thens about the time you ought to say swim swim swim swim not quiver you say well thats very fine but this is only after level has been run long and the tone arm has stuck usually on other levels and lot of action has been going on on this particular case and you have gotten the risestick phenomenon to occur you get the idea that has occurred and so forth well you got this other phenomenon so remember that it can occur that pc can be absolutely flat on the level and be getting tone arm action like mad on the oddnumbered commands tell problem and as i say the remedy is to check the level for reaction the level longer reacts get off of it its things of that character little points of that character that you run in youll still be getting points of this particular type clarified as people run into difficulties youre not going to run into peculiar cases dont worry about that man ive audited too many cases i know how theyre put together but you are going to get into peculiar questions usually these stem out of an irregularity of technology you should realize that your peculiar question ordinarily stems out of some additive of omission you have made from routine lineup thats something to remember and thats really something to remember if youre ever teaching auditors in an academy because man new auditor can think of more things to do wrong than you can catch up with all morning and all afternoon and if you were to take this verbal from themmeets you out in the hall and says well this case doesnt get any tone arm action of any kind whatsoever on security check form 4 your immediate response isyouve assumed you see that this auditor is actually auditing and that its all set and all square and so you say well your rudiments are probably out check your rudiments he goes in he comes back in little while he said the rudiments the rudimentstheres reaction on the rudiments well extraordinary solution if you were inexperienced would be your next step and youd say well change the security check to childs security check next day theres tone arm action on childs security check of any kind whatsoever and the rudiments are in because there is response of any kind on the meter now you could really get an extraordinary solution well try the cchs well probably this would be better because close examination demonstrates that the student does not know that this pin goes in this side of the can youd be amazed youll be amazed youll be absolutely amazed now the other one is i know you dont believe that that that can happen that can happen its the weird things like thatwell they hadnt got the meter turned on or something stupid like that therethats what can throw you its wild departures that you couldnt even envision you sit back and you sit back and you think and you think and you think and you think what could they be doing now what are they doing ill bet you dont suppose they never go to session and that would be closer to the actual answer than the one you will think up with your own background of training itll be thatitll be that type of thing it wont be the type of thing that their model session wasnt perfect and their tr 4s werent perfect and so on itll be the fact they dont know the emeter plugs in or that they read only body motion they read only body motion i saw some experimental shots taken of aof an emeter just as an experimental film basis and the person making them had used nothing but body motion and any trained scientologistthey look at this and they say well all right so the pcs moving you know just picture of the meter so the pc is moving see they were trying to make rock slam look like rock slam didnt look like rock slam to anybody that was trained so the pc was moving is about all that particular shot would have taught anybody but these little distinctions are not present at lower training level so you really have to reach for it now i was going to say some more about security checking and i am you should be terribly terribly interested then with the material which i have been giving you here or talking to you about you should be terribly interested in getting people up to class ii not only will your life become livable but your pcs will make gains if you are terribly interested in making class ii auditorsif youre terribly interested in that and your life will be as peaceful asas far as technology is concernedwill be as peaceful as the person who is turned over to you for assessment has had perfectly accurate class ii job done on them and then your assessment is possible and accurate and swift i know you dont think you can ever do twoandahalfhour assessment but one has just been done two and half hours of assessment was done in cape town this by the way was patchup one of these patch up assessments you know two elements had already been found and run there wasnt enough action left on the meter to bother with yet the person found the other elements of the 3d in two and half hours that doesnt seem believable to you at this stage of the game let tell you though that people leaving here find this rather easy why because youre operating from an altitude here youre bunch of schnooks theres nobody going to whod respond to his command value for the last two weeks hes only had two passes week youre used to reading 3d with microscope you know and you ask miss glutz of upper burbank what terminal would oppose this that could onlyonly represent cat halfdial drop your reaction is halfdial drop cat drops half dial for you from there on out you ask hershe had choice but to tell you because you were you yeah but some studentnyah give him list of 442 terminals let him sweat big difference in attitude then so you should get terribly terribly interestednot in just becoming good security checkerbut in what it takes to make security checker in the first place we probably should stop calling it security checking and start calling it what ive started to call it several times which is processing checks those are much more easily explainable and we willyoull see processing check in literature going out so dont let it throw you im talking about security checks but anyway but you go ahead and reap the whirlwind by taking some person who has had some hpa training three years ago and youre going to make class ii auditor out of him you indifferently say well they can sit there and hold the emeter balanced well on their lap they look appreciative and alert and so therefore well classify them as class ii and after that go blow your own brains out because thats just about what youre doing youre going to be assessing 3d after this person someday or youre going to be patching case together after this someday or youre going to be holding the hand of some fellow auditor someday who has just been trying to or this person himself feeling this cocky about it all has now done an assessment and what is worse run it he knew how to run it if it didnt react on the meter at all he knew he had the right one see he read step 6 thats what were doing isnt it you know youre just setting up trouble for yourself and when you carelessly rate an auditor you basically set up trouble in your area todayor in an organization or wherever youre operatingif you carelessly rate an auditor youre setting up grief there will be trouble from there on make this classification amount to something and you wont have much trouble with regard to it and id classify people class iii away from saint hill when they had beardeven the girlsdown to their toes oh man id really make them come through for class iii man i mean id really make them sweat but certainly make good class ii and then you have protected yourself now class ii must be able to security check so that security checks are muffed thats the first thing questions are muffed withholds are missed and that is your criteria now if the rudiments are in in the session of course the person will get the withholds but if you come along with greater altitude after this fellow and get an additional withhold dont think its because the case improved it was because that class ii auditor didnt have altitude enough to run the case with rudiments out and you will have so rudiments were out for him but in for you they knew better than to tell you lie but they knew they could lie to him see this is the difference so actually your criteria has to be very high to get around that sort of thing so that they will get all of the withhold so they will get everything now the fastest way in the world to upset case and reap the whirlwind is to miss withhold take it from thats the fastest way ive had more trouble with this single item what trouble i have hadactual out in the field and here and there trouble in the last three monthsthan with any other single activity anywhere missed sec check questions that has been way up on the graph nearest approach to it well it just didnt approach it its something like the order of measuring grain of sand and the sun they just were not of comparable magnitude ive traced every single upset ive had back to missed sec check questions initial withhold setup one kind or another caused randomity in the area but where the randomity was tamed down by somebody and they missed sec check question the randomity doubled it wasnt so bad before that but the whole roof was falling in now you see so that can really cause an upset so i better tell you just two or three very brief little facts of life about this sort of thing when pc starts to curse you outthese are little maxims that you could usewhen pc starts to curse you out find the missed withhold that is rule of thumb that you will never never never never miss on when the pc starts to curse you out find the missed withhold where did this pc miss there is halftruth or completely missed setup there you wont believe this until youve got good subjective reality on it as an auditor and one of these fine days as an auditor youre going to run into thisright here on this unit and the pcs going to be sitting there saying well what therrrr why dont you rraoww wow wow and i want too much to do with that anyhow and so on and why dont you study your trs little bit your tr 4 is certainly terrible and so forth well maybe it is but they would never have commented on it if it werent for missed withhold now of course you chop into all of this suddenly now what was the missed withhold question you see you throw your rudiments out at the same time so youve got to go into it smoothly but you can always find it you could always find it and there is something here which has not been aired to the bright fresh sunlight there is something still floating along in the stygian dark thats an interesting one and until you solve one like this you wont believe how much fury can come out of it its as though youve suddenly charged up the machine with pressure pellet of some kind or another like youve suddenly thrown ether into petrol engine this thing is really going to go on higher roar and tear and finally its going to fall apart then you suddenly get bright all of sudden and say you dont suppose there could be missed withhold here well lets just check it out to see and we breeze over what we were doing and we bridge it in and we get it into position where we can do little bit of withhold asking and we just ask for any withholds weve missed or any halftruths theyve told uswhich is the same thing and all of sudden why there youve got it the pc is just sweetness and light and at the end session end rudimentyoure getting in your end rudimentsand you say all right are there any arc breaks or upset in the session the pc sits there well how do you feel about that mess that we had at the beginning of the session what mess oh oh oh that oh well thats nothing i was probably being very hard on you this is really goofy you know well the liabilities of sec checking the reason sec checks are difficult lie in the 3d items so sec checker is always sec checking over the unknown identities of the 3d items he doesnt know what mores the pc would violate if the pc had withhold see the mores of the terminalthe opptermthese various combinations are what established the moral caliber of the pc which gives you the mores on which the pc will or will not operate so sec checker is always able to do much better job after 3d has been found and then you dont have to do any isnt that interesting just the time youve got all the data to do perfect sec check you dont have to do it anymore i think thats something or other but isnt it odd that if you dont do very fine quality series of sec checks before you assess you dont get the 3d at all so the sec checker actually has to be tremendously skilled because hes going up against an unknown and this unknown wont become known until the pc is assessed and the pc cant be assessed until some sec checks are done now how do you like that you always enter the case at the hard end the longer you audit case well the easier case is to audit the best auditing must always be at the beginning of the case the most skilled auditing is always at the start of case so dont get any ideas that class ii auditor should be bum that you can get away with something as class ii you cant because it requires the smoothest trs and the smoothest metering and the smoothest model session that will be performed on the case are needed at the beginning of the case while those first critical sec checks and so forth are being run if any upset occurs during that period you of course are messed up on an assessment later on or the case just never gets up to being assessed so the person at the open gate is actually the class ii auditor hes the seneschal because he can shut people out entirely and completely until they get past him theyre never going to be assessed and all he has to do is miss some sec checks questions all he has to do is arc break the pc all he has to do is run the wrong preparatory processes all he has to do is muck the case up and of course hes finished the case because the case wont come through to assessment case will blow leave for alaska get job with the united nationswhich is the most suicidal activity i can think of right at the present moment pcs liable to do anything in other wordsany low thing so thats not an unimportant zone thats not an unimportant zone and ill give you another maxim is q and puts the withhold in to stay now let give you very precise thing very precise example of q and have you ever stolen any umbrellas yes i stole my fathers once auditor how did you come to do that at that point an instructor should set up militruce on the one side and rocket launcher on the other side and pull both triggers that is q and of magnitude changed the subject didnt it you ask for withhold the guy gives you withhold and now you ask him about the withhold you asked for withhold it is enough that he got off the withhold now the only question is does that withhold still register if it still registers theres another withhold so heres maxim any additional registry that you get on withhold question stems from fresh undisclosed withholdsnot from the withhold he has given you thatll keep you from doing any qandaing and itll doitll keep an awful lot of auditors you train from qandaing thats quite important this is proper auditor have you ever stolen any umbrellas pc i stole my fathers once okay thank you have you ever stolen any other umbrellas well all right thank you now look at your meter and say have you ever stolen any umbrellas instant read so you look at the pc and you say all right when is the first time you ever stole an umbrella oh well id forgotten that one hahahahaha just slipped my mind yes as matter of fact i was two years old and we were out at garden party and i saw an umbrella with silver handle and i dragged it out on the lawnand they teased about it for very long time afterwardsbut i really didnt mean to take it all right okay well have you stolen any other umbrellas thats all okay thank you get hold of your meter have you ever stolen an umbrella remember that was the auditing question that was the question that made it fall well thats the question youre trying to clear youre not trying to clear whether or not this person is related to umbrella manufacturers in the marcab confederacy youre just trying to clear whether or not they ever stole any umbrellas thats all you want to know and any other material to that is simply assistive any other questions you have is assistive to clearing that exact question thats the only question you want to clear thats the only thing you have any interest in now the reason you vary the question is just to get more withholds and thats where you go astray the instructor says well vary the question dont keep saying have you ever stolen an umbrella thank you have you ever stolen an umbrella thank you because he wont get anyplace you have to ask him well did you everdid you ever pinch one in restaurants did you ever take umbrellas accidentally in restaurant you know youre helping out the pc did you everdid you ever take any out of offices did you ever take any out of homes did you ever take any out of shops shops shopswatching the emeter did you ever take any umbrellas out of shops id completely forgotten that hahaha as matter of fact and pal rarobbed an umbrella store one time when i was sixteen oh you say good all right now have you ever stolen any umbrellas thats the question youre trying to clear that question must follow immediately after see have you ever stolen any umbrellas theres instant read and youre off of it like startled deer and on to the next question now providing you routinely check up to find out if there are any withhold questions that have been missed and providing this always occurs as question in your end rudiments of any security checktype session have i missed any withholds on you you will never miss and youll find it all goes off like hot butter now let give you another horrible example of this have you ever been mean to pc oh yes as matter of fact i was mean to pc yep i was mean to eleanor when i was auditing her all right where was that this is justfrom here on see we this is the blowthebrainsout type of an approach oh that was in washington mmhm well what were you doing in washington at that time uhm is that so mm did you ever ride any horses do you like cats howve you been feeling today do you think its going to rain i mean all of these questions are equally relevant to what youre doing do you happen to know the exact figure of gold production in the rand area during the past fortnight would just be about as pertinent to the case you see as any of this other bunk you see you want to know if this pc has ever been mean to any pcs or mean to an auditor or whatever the question is see thats all you want to know and you set out to find this exact package fact and that package fact is the only fact that you were trying to find out now if you suspect that this question may be related to some other questions which are also withhold questions you add these as though they were also security check questions and you clean each one of those and the proper way to do it is not sit there and clip them off the end of your bat the proper way to do is sit down and write them down and clear them as though they were complete list otherwise youre going to wind up missing some withholds now that is the severely proper way to do it but dont ever monkey with these qs and as that is q and the pc says something so the auditor says something so the pc says something so the auditor says something and what is the price of gold do you suppose in upper tibet or was it on march the 9th 1913 that has just as much to do with auditing of the case dont you see how many photons fall per minute on the head of pin in latitude 0 9 minutes 11 seconds north longitude 167 west well that had nothing to do with it see so in sec checking be pertinent to what you are doing be pertinent to what youre doing if thats what youre doing do it dont wander around about it now if burst of misemotion occurs on the part of pc during security check or class ii activity it is turned off by what turned it on and that is true of all secondaries now thats particularly true of an assessment running havingness or security check question what turned it on will turn if off well what turned it on getting withhold turned it on whats the withhold thats still keeping it powered up thats the mistake you make you see is taking up the secondary you dont take up the misemotion in any other way than what turned it on you get what im talking about i mean you turned it on with waterspout youll turn it off with waterspout thats all there is to that its the same thing otherwise youre guilty of mopery and dopery and misdemeanors on the high seas the point im making here is youre running havingness on this pc and youre saying point out something thank you point out something thank you point out something thank you and the pc says whaaaooo terrible and so forth point out something thank you oooooh it was terrible you say thank you point out something thank you woooooooowowwow you want to ask him whats wrong you say whats happening and when he says ooooohooo i just remembered oh its terrible and so forth you say thank you very much good point out something thank you point out something why it is complete cruelty to stop the process that turned it on and say oh poor bill what are you crying about bill well lets run that as secondary you idiot youre running it as secondary the process thats running it is point out something do i make my point clear about this see its cruelty to do it otherwise even though the pc just begs you to be sympathetic you can go ahead and be kind and halfkill the pc because you will all right lets take the middle of 3d run think of something ortell somethingtell problem you have had with waterbuck well wooooow my god oh gee oooohooh terrible now this is dead wrong this is utterly dead wrong see what happened oh oh well what happened just before that well what was the waterbuck doing just then mm oh yes when do you suppose that was youre going to park him youre going to park him just sure as hell he goes wow crash terrible and so forth well what made it go wow crash terrible it was thinking of problem that waterbuck had all right whatll settle it down is how might swimming have resolved that problem the pc all of sudden says ohhoho hoho thats ahohohothats wonderful idea how about swimming boy swimmingthat really gets lot whew boy you got out of that thank you very much and you say all right tell problem waterbuck might have had with tiger oh well soandso and soandso you get all around it and you come back to it again and you say all right now tell problem you might have had with waterbuck wow its the same problem he gives you the same answer see still charged you get another level its not going to flatten on that level ill let you in on something hes got several million incidents of that type only you just happened to have hit one that he was expressing the way to handle it is to go on auditing the pc you will be tempted on many occasions now on security check question you say all right have you ever stolen any umbrellas woooow oh gee why have you brought that up thats terrible and so on and so on well have you yes all right how many oh lots of them lots of them lots of them how many times have you stolen umbrellas oh lots of times ohho lots of times think of all those poor people out there in the rainumbrellas stolen how mean of to do this okay thank you now have you ever stolen an umbrella oooooh gee you keep asking that question my god good have you stolen any other umbrellas well yeah you put it that wayyes yes i used to collect them out of the whole faculty at my prep school now thats what the grief is coming from the grief was coming from withhold see because the withhold had the incident charged up now if the incident remains charged up there must be another withhold see if you can set off an incident by simply getting off withhold you must realize that if it keeps running its only half set off so there must be something else there so theres another pin to pull an unkind thing to do is to run it i can tell you this because ive watched this over quite period of time now and the only safe thing to do is remember vividly that what turns it on turned it off if you want to turn something off with what were using today well just keep on running some of the same and youll get it offbut thats the only way youll get it off because the other processes of twoway comm and this sort of thing are so much weaker than any other process you happen to be running now that they dont come up in order of magnitude so youre running sec check question sec check question sec check question my god ive seen thepractically the dead get up and walk if you ask the right sec check question and youre going to all of sudden run all right think of time you were happy thank you think of time you were happy well think of how many times youve run some such inane process on pc and nothing happened to the pc you sat there and sweated for an hour or two you knew it was the exact process to fit the case you knew he should get up and walk but by golly he never did have you ever had that experience you run some mild process all right well consider it as though you were all of sudden running 155 millimeter process you see and its going boom you know in salvo boom and then you all of suddenthe pc says oh thud ive been bracketed and then you suddenly say bb gun bb gun bb gun bb gun bb gun youof course you leave the pc right in the middle of the woooooouh the only thing that could possibly boot him through it was what you were running 3d process absolutely fantastically powerful that process is sec checking very very powerful process extremely well done sec check can do almost anything with pc havingness tremendously powerful process you think youre going to get processes all of sudden out of aout of your hip pocket that are suddenly going to outrank these three processes youre not so if they turn something on believe youre not going to get it off by getting kleenex and wiping the pcs fingernails or something its going to take more of the same see so thats something for you to realize now in training sec check peoplein training people to sec checkyou should recognize that their first tendency will be to bekind and in that lies their greatest cruelty in auditing in kindness lies the greatest cruelty always youre being kind and by that i mean the pc is crying so you say well we better not keep the session going because its getting the pc too upset huhhuhhuh slit your throat you just did another instance of being kind well the pc was too upset in the session yesterday so ill let him get rested up little bit and we wont have session today cut your throat you just did pc is always getting angry every time you approach sec check questions in the rudiments so avoid them thats the kind thing to do because it makes nice smooth session in which nothing ever happens ever you could audit him for thousands of hours and nothing would ever happen with the case case has obviously got withholds all right because the pc might get upset pulling the withholds we wont approach sec checking on this particular pc because its very kind the best thing we can do for this pc is to run 3d assessment very very rapidlywithout any security checking without any problems intensive and just get it very very rapidly and hang it all together again and so forth and then run him immediately and rapidly on 3d level thatd be nice because he wouldnt then be upset at all that sec checking and all that wasted time and itd be the nice thing to do cut your throat you just did case is in nomight have been in shape to be assessed you might even with altitude have gotten by and through and finished with an assessment but let tell you something youll nevernever get him through alive at the other end of 3d run see even if you did do the assessment you would nevertheytheyd just probably wind up practically threequarters of the way dead at the other side of it if you havent noticedi think some of you have noticed 3d runs are bit tough they have tendency to have some somatics connected with them have you noticed that you noticed there was something to 3d run indeed well how would you like to go into 3d run with the entirety of joburg loaded and undisclosed isnt that kind of gruesome completely out of communication with the auditor and liable to arc break with the auditor at any moment and go out of session so the 3d run is left half flat oh thatd be great wouldnt it wouldnt that be ducky thats just exactly what the doctor didnt order thats what the doctor would order i ran pc one timei learned my first lesson on this i ran pc halfway through an incident pc turned on an actual registrable temperature of 102 medical doctor observing took the patients temperature and instantly stood up with great heroic gestures and said the pc must at once go to bed because the man is obviously very very ill and i said the doctor must at once sit down because i am in charge here youre not he sat down looking somewhat cowed and i ran it through at the other end and in incredulous fashionit was only fifteen minutes laterhe takes out his thermometer and puts it in the pcs mouth and by god the pcs temperature was normal it had gone from normal to 102 to normal in the matter of half an hour i said you want to see it go up and down again doc he said he said thats all i want to see now his whole concept you see of what turned on temperatures had been turned upside down all right seeing somebody suddenly in duress and agony the doctors response was of course to do something heroic and different and that would have been the one thing that would have dished the pc that would apparently have been the professional or the kind thing to do but for scientologist that is neither professional nor kindvery cruel pc gets upset and we dont drive the pc through to the other end of itits cruel never kid yourself otherwise its cruel thing to do to pc matter how pc is upset we know how he got upset and we know why hes upset and id straighten it out if we had sec check question halfflat in the last session and we approach this session we cant get the rudiments in do we spend the rest of this session getting the rudiments in we do not we get the rudiments in somewhat in this fashion room auditor withhold ptp thank you very much now the question is have you ever stolen any umbrellas see pcs all upset well thats where we left the pc that must be what hes upset about and youll find out itll usually work out thats exactly what the pc is upset about now the pc goes out of session reading at 30 and comes back in session reading at 50 on the tone arm we ought to notice this something has happened in the interim it might benot considered socially marvelous to go around and inquiring after everybodys private life and it might not be the accepted thing but its cruel thing to start session without having noticed that tone arms gone up two divisions what did this pc do between sessions now were going to try to get the rudiments in ah well its going to be very rough jobunless were terribly specific we say what have you been doing we dont even get session started you look at this and its on the emeter and you just got him on the emeter all right start of session thank you now what have you been doing since yesterday afternoon what has happened oh well we dont want to go into that well im afraid we do now whats happened what happened oh well ive got well that thatthat you see right there whatwhat has happened whatwhat happened well i dont want to tell you and so forth my third wife arrived you see ive neverive never bothered to get divorces from my first two wives and she just got into town and i didnt mean to tell you and tone arm goes down clank now you spend the rest of the session discussing this not unless it shows up as ptp you say do you have present time problem pc is very oftenis trying to sponge session off of you or something of the sort youre getting registries see youre getting registries on the meter so the meter isnt null because of an arc break see if you can get registry on meter you know the pc hasnt got arc breaks to the point where you dont get registry you recognize thatthat some people are not going to all right and your registry is right there and very nice everything is fine and you say do you have present time problem you dont get any response of any kind whatsoever you couldnt read it with microscope you know the pc says oh well yes i mean i have terrible worries and im awfully worried about aunt agatha and aunt bessie and all of that sort of thing and you say well all right now how do you feel about that now well i feel terrible about it well all right good good thank you very much okay now is it all right if i youre off of it sometimes itll arc break the pc but itd only arc break the pc if you missed the withhold question that went immediately ahead of it so if bypassing ptp upsets the pc you go back to the withhold question thats the mechanics of the situation pc has been trying to tell you something and he circuitously wants present time problem run or something like this the pc wants something else done in the session well the way you keep the pc from dictating whats going to be done in the session is return to the earlier rudiment that just mechanically is good sense but its also scientologically good sense because the pc didnt get upset about this unless he had withhold of some kind that you missed when you went by the withhold question all right there are these little maxims of one character or another and i could go on about these things for some time but ive given you the principal ones right here it is actually not very difficult job to do class ii but it is sometimes very very very difficult to get somebody to do only class ii they want to do eighteen other things too youve got to blow lot of confusion off somebody the person is sitting there and he doesnt know whether youre supposed to look into the top of the case or the bottom of the emeter or the pcs shoes simultaneously while and how can you possibly read the question off because at the moment youre reading the question off of course the meter might be moving on the instant read but at the same time you have to do tr 0 but your tr 2 you seethat might be poor and the pc might not quite be getting that either andand it just looks like big mess to the person now if it looks that confused to the auditor the pc of course will get very upset so actually the pc is sort of trying to stay insession and make session out of it and is eight times as hard to audit see so confused auditora pc is much harder to audit in actuality the pc does not behave properly for session because the pc is reacting to the confusion of the auditor so therefore an unskilled auditor has much tougher pcs than anybody else thatsthats thethats the horrors of theof the truth of the matter now your next point is that because it is all so complicatedthe auditor whos learning this routineof course doesnt see anything wrong with throwing five or six more complications in on top of it so he starts doing all kinds of additives and its frankly not so much job of teaching somebody something is trying to teach them some only things see its not so much trying to cram all this stuff down their throats is keep them from imbibing all of this useless gutter water along with the drink of wine you see and its sort of you go on onlys on this type of training and you will win you know onlys figure out something very simple figure out something very simple how do you hold an emeter on your lap and get them to do that one well and then for while just get them to read an emeter on body responses or something and then get them to do something else like read security check question you know meter around you know get some dummy security check question and let them fire that have you ever been horrible person you know something like that something you would never miss have you ever been horrible person thank you have you ever been horrible person thank you have you ever been horrible person thank you you say that isnt the way you audit security check question you ask the person pointedly have you ever been horrible person and admitting that they have said yes they have been horrible person now lets ask them if theyd been horrible person any other time than that and lets just keep plugging the idea of sec check question on horrible person on this thing until the person runs out of answers on it and lets do it that way all right now lets get registry on the meter of these things and lets see if these things register on the meter in other words any way you want to plot it up im not giving you the ideal combination im just giving you an idea that you teach them they can do these things and its not really matter of upending bucketful of facts over their heads its trying to keep them from upending bucketful of facts over their heads you know see theyre thinking all the time lets see the potentiometer and i wonder if one tone armdo you supposed to get tone arm motion while the needle bops isisis there any data in here aboutabout rock slamming if it rock slams if the sensitivity is high maybemaybe as the rock slam turns on if the sensitivitys too high maybe if you turn down the sensitivity wouldnt have rock slam maybe that has something to do with it i wonder whatif you have to read the proper name of the security check off to the pc before you start giving the security check that seems to to be awfully important uhlets see this is form 3 uhi dont know why its called joburg uhthatsthats not very good auditing presence butand so forth oh i have to remember i have to keep my tr 0 in keeping your tr 0 in is going silent and motionless like cigar store indian for fortyfive seconds with nothing happening when person starts to learn these things he looks like juggler you know with fifteen indian clubs and eight cubes in the air and all of them about to hit him on the head the thing to do is to show him theres one indian club and that is an indian club and really get him to point where hell actually go out and tell people this is an indian club and think of himself as great authority on the subject now if he can do that he eventually gets this one thing you know i learned this from psycho girl one time she was really crazy and i saw her turn sanejust like that and she was never crazy afterwards it was look around here and find something real you know something thats really real to you is i think the wording of the old one and this girl picked up one sugar bowl and all of sudden clutched the sugar bowl to her bosom and said its real it really is it exists i couldnt get the sugar bowl away from her i never did get to flatten the process and that happened to other auditors too all of sudden somebody would you know and then the process didnt seem to work anymore after that theyd made all the gain that the process was capable of making well thats kind of the way training is if you went over you could actually train person on an emeter this way you could name off all of the parts of class ii auditor until you got fall that one would be real to them get them to learn that one sounds weird and get them to learn that one real well and youd find in practically time at all theyd become complete authority on it now go over all the remaining parts of class ii on the emeter until one fell and then get them to learn that one you could do it this wayim just reduotio ad absurdumbut im trying to give you the idea that if you can teach them an only not an allthe only approach not the all approach is what wins in this because the pc is already snowed under with the allness on it oh my god here i am actually sitting here tampering with somebodys mind and didnt i learn 5685000 years ago that tampering with somebodys mind was my downfall and i wasnt supposed to do that and ohi must keep my tr 0 in yeah now lets get on to the emeter and so forth here i wonder if you reduce the sensitivity if the rock slam comes off mm tr 0 so its rough man i mean you can practically hear the brains wheel when youre doing this kind of thing so it seems very easy to you after youve done it lot it seems very simple to you youd say oh well i can do this why should anybody else ever have any trouble at any time and so forth and now i come in and tell you that as soon as you get back to where youre going in central organization or otherwise you should tap two people on the shoulder and you say many are called few are chosen and one of them says to you sneeringly oh ive passed class ii skills ive already been passed on it huhhuh ive already passed on it check them out they wont get to the first paragraph of the examination without falling on their heads then you start in from scratch and make class ii auditor out of them after that if youve got to assess somebody you can always send somebody to that auditor youve always got that auditor to lean back on you better do thatbecause youre going to need help youre going to need it but not in the way you thinknot in the way you think you will need help the way you need help is to keep an assembly line going to keep people getting audited with the skill that only you can provide other people can provide the more basic skills but of course you have to know those basic skills much more perfectly than anybody you will ever teach so get busy thank you
