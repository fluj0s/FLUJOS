david koitz geoffrey kollmann and dawn nuschler domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086social security what happens to future benefit levels under various reform options summary because social security is facing l ongrange financing difficulties numerous proposals have been made to solve the problem with reforms that typically bundletogether variety of individual measures often it is difficult to identify when and by how much these measures would alter fu ture benefits as an aid to those exploring social security reform this report unbundles various conceptual elements of many of the reform plans and presents them in generic form in order to illustrate how certain changes would alter projected future retirement benefits the report first examines several benef itconstraint options among them are raising the age at which full social security retirement benefits can be receivedchanging the way initial benefits are computed and constraining costoflivingadjustments colas it also illustrates the effects of creating new personal savingsaccounts and presents their projected impact as supplement to or partialreplacement of the existing system or as means to close the gap between the benefit levels promised by the existing system and what can be paid under its projected future income finally because acrosstheboard cuts may be seen as toosevere for several types of recipients other options that would ameliorate theireffects including one that would raise revenue are also illustrated the benefits resulting from the principal options are compared to those computed under different baselines benefits provided under currentlaw rulesbenefits affordable under the systems current financing provisions the purchasingpower of benefits of people retiring today and benefits of recent retirees expressed as percentage of preretirement earnings the analysis shows that although thevarious benefit constraints would reduce benefits promised under current law nonewould cause the purchasing power of future retirees benefits to be lower than that of someone retiring today they would how ever reduce the role of social security as an earnings replacement system the anal ysis also shows that because of the way the different options are phased in the ffects on different age cohorts would vary the role of personal accounts is examined under two financing alternatives one assumes the accounts would be funded by diverting to them part of the current social security tax carveout appro ach the other assumes additional payments from workers or from federal general re venues an addon approach two annual rates of return are used to compute the value of the accounts safe rate of 64 reflecting the projected rate of return for longterm government bonds and amarketbased rate on stocks of 10 given adequate time to grow under either scenario the value of the accounts would substantially offset or exceed the benefitreductions that would occur under number of the larger social security constraints that might be used to restore the systems solvency however because the eventual worth of the personal accounts depends h eavily on the power of compound growth they would have significantly smaller eff ects on workers retiring in the next three decades including most of the baby boom they also would have larger effect in mitigating acrosstheboard benefit cuts on highpaid workers than on lowpaid workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086contents introduction and overview of findings 1 v r v i w f f i n d i n g s 2 i l l u s t r t i v

report for further discussion see crs report rl30571 social security reform the issue of individual versus collective investment for retirement by david koitzsocial security reform what happens to future benefit levels under various reform options introduction and overview of findings social security has projected longrange funding problems according to the latest estimates of the social security bo ard of trustees in 2016 the systems taxes will fall below its expenditures and by 2038 its trust funds will be depleted at thatpoint its incoming tax receipts would be fficient to cover only 73 of its benefits and even less in later years 1 the question of how to deal with this gap has been major catalyst for the social security refo rm debate should we raise revenue andor cut benefits should we completely repl ace the system with something else or should we blend elements of the current system with elements of new one numerous bills introduced by members of congress and recommendations made by various commissions attempt to solve the problem with reforms that typically bundle together multitude of measures often it is difficult to identifywhen and by how much these measures would alter future benefits as an aid tothose exploring social security reforms this report unbundles various conceptualelements of many of the reform plans presenting them in generic form and using benefit computation model developed by the congressional researchservice examines how certain options would alter projected future retirementbenefits among the options illustrated are proposals to raise the age at which recipients can receive full social security retirement benefits to alter the way initial benefits are computed to constrain annual costof living adjustments colas and to raise the maximum amount of earnings on which social security taxes are levied andbenefits are computed ie the socalled taxable earnings base also included areillustrations that show the effect of incorporating personal savings accounts intosocial security accounts that might be seen as supplement or an alternative to the existing system or portion thereof or as means to close the gap between the benefit levels the current system promises and what can be paid under its projected future income 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs2 to simplify the presentation most of the illustrations are based on the commonly used example of worker with 43year career who always earnedaverage wages and retired at age 65 although additional career profiles could beused they would greatly expand the length and complexity of the paper and theywould not affect the illustrations of the relative impact of the social security benefit constraint options presented here because the benefit constraint s are acrosstheboard in nature other career work patterns could have an effect on the relative value ofpersonal accounts however and the report provides number of additionalillustrations of these effects overview of findings illustrative benefit reductions the report first shows the amount of benefit reductions that would arise from several proposals that could help to bringthe system into longrange actuarial balance ie to restore its solvency by constraining its growth see table 1 the proposal causing the smallest longrange benefit reduction would eliminate only 13 of the systems projected average 75year deficit in contrast the proposal causing the greatest reduction would produce program savings sufficient to restore solven cy at least on average for the projection period as whole the other proposals for the most part would produce program savings somewhere in between and like the first one would need to be viewed as measures that could contribute to solution but not achieve solvency by themselves table 1 illustrative benefit constraints that could help restore social securitys solvency benefit constraint measurepercent of average 75 year deficit eliminatedbenefit

savings estimates were prepared by the office of the actuary of the social security administration may 2001 the reader is cautioned that one should not add together the financialeffects of two or more of these proposals in order to determine their combined effect such acalculation would be inaccurate because of the interactions among the proposals illustrations are based on projected lifetime benef its for fulltime wage earners retiring at age 65 who always earned average wages see appe ndix for discussion of other assumptions under current law the purchasing power of future social security benefits is projected to risehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs3 3 this occurs because although it is often not understood under current law rules the value of future benefits is projected to rise signi ficantly both in terms of the level of monthly benefits and in terms of their value over pe rsons lifetime there are two reasons lifetime social security benefits will grow in the fu ture one is that increasing life expectancies mean that retirees will collect benefits over longer period of time the other is becausefuture social security benefits are linked to the growth in average wages and wages tend to rise faster than prices the real value of monthl benefits promised in the future is projected to risetable 1 also illustrates the benefit reduction each proposal would cause for workers retiring at age 65 in 2020 the approximate middle of the baby boomersretirement years and for similar workers retiring at age 65 in 2070 the latter caserepresents the full effect of the proposals the table also compares these reductions to the amount of reduction implied by the lack of adequate longrange financingunder current law ie to the benefits that would be affordable under currentprojections of the systems income in ot her words it compares the reductions to the benefit levels promised under current law and to levels reflecting the implicitbenefit reductions that would occur if policymakers were to take action to restore the systems solvency in 2070 this is projected to result in 32 reduction in benefits using the 2020 and 2070 retiree examples table 2 shows the projected increase in the real value of benefits unde r the rules of current law under the rules of current law if benefits we re reduced to fit within the programs projected income and the amount of increase resulting from the various proposals the results show that even though these proposals reduce be nefits promised under current law none causes the purchasing power of future retirees benefits to be lower than that of a2001 retiree 3 however table 2 also shows that the various illustrated proposals would reduce the role of social security in the future as an earnings replacement systemfor the steady average wage earner retir ing at age 65 over the 19902000 period first years benefits expressed as percent of final years earnings were an average of 424 as table 2 shows under current law the increase in the age for full retirement benefits from 65 to 67 discussed at length later will gradually reducethese ratios to 366 for comparable future retirees decline of about 14 theillustrative proposals would cause these ratios to decline further reaching levelsbetween 356 and 217 decline from the 19902000 level of between 16 and 49 the debate over reforming social security involves more than an examination of whether and how its benefits should be constrained to restore solvency if the solution to social securitys longrange fi nancing problem is to reduce its benefits substantially then the question arises of whether future retirement incomes will be inadequate in this context tax increases and other incomeproducing measuresmight be considered they would not cau reduction in benefits although raising the amount of earnings subject to social s ecurity taxation would in turn eventually raise benefits and this effect is discussed at length later in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs4 there also has been growing interest in new approaches to securing future retirement incomes that look beyond the traditional alternatives of cutting thesystems benefits or raising its taxes or ot her income most of these involve creation of new personal savings accounts modeled in one way or another after existingindividual retirement accounts iras or employersponsored 401k plans thisreport illustrates the effects of creating personal accounts and incorporating them as part of social security reform plan table 2 alternative views of the

projected lifetime be nefits for fulltime wage earners retiring at age 65 who always earned average wages see ppendix for discussion of other assumptions illustrative personal accounts the report shows that given adequate time to grow the annuities or periodic payments these accounts would yield could go along way to offsetting constraints on future social security benefits that may be considered to restore the systems solvency the longer the new accounts areassumed to accumulate the greater their poten tial as an offset in some cases people could be even better off than if future so cial security benefits were fully financed ie fully payable the report illustrates the potential outcomes from steadilycontributing 2 of the pay of fulltime worker who always earned an averagewage into these accounts over their careers and then combining the annuitiesresulting therefrom with the lower benefits that would result from enacting varioussocial security constraint measures two annual rates of return are used to compute the value of the accounts safe rate of 64 reflecting the projected longtermhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs5 4 it should be observed that this approach might not overcome transitional financing issues while each workers eventual benefits would be reduced to reflect the earlier diversion of taxes from the system during the early years th reduction in the systems aggregate benefit payout may be insufficient to maintain the pr ograms solvency hence either the other benefit constraints would have to be phased in faster or an alternative income source would have to be found for the system in additi on this approach assumes that the benefit reduction workers would incur because of the tax diversion would apply equally toretirement disability and survivor benefits if the benefit reductions were to apply only to the retirement portion of the program they would have to be larger than reflected in table 3 and later tables in this report showing the effects of the carveout approachreturn on government bonds and marketbase d rate on stocks of 10 also two alternative funding approaches for the personal accounts are considered oneassumes the money for the new accounts comes from additional contributionsworkers would make or the government woul d make for them perhaps using surplus tax receipts the other assumes that workers would be allowed to divert part oftheir existing social security taxes to the accounts the first is typically referred to as an addon approach the second as carveout approach it is important to recognize that the loss of revenue caused by using existing social security taxes to fund personal accounts would worsen the programs longrange problem the revenue loss could be offset by tapping new income source for the system eg general revenues absent that however benefits would have to be reduced to compensate for the lower recei pts and this reduction would have to be over and above what is needed to remedy the already existing longrange financing imbalance to illustrate this effect the report assumes that under proposals to divertsocial security taxes to personal accounts workers eventual social securitybenefits would be reduced by an amount equal to the percentage of his or her lifetime social security taxes that were used this way including the employer share 4 for workers who divert taxes to these accounts steadily over their entire careers theadditional benefit reduction would be 161 table 3 illustrates the combined benefits when personal accounts funded from these two approaches are coupled with thr ee alternative benefit constraint measures for instance table 1 showed potential 408 bene fit reduction in 2070 under the proposal to limit the growth of future initial benefit awards to the rate of inflation measure with savings sufficient to restor the systems longrange solvency table 3 shows that for workers earning an average wage including an annuitized addon personal account earning 64 would produce combined benefit that would be156 lower than under current law thus it would replace more than 60 of their lost social security benefit if the account were assumed to earn 10 annually itwould more than offset the lost social s ecurity benefit yielding combined benefit that would be 21 higher than under current law if the account were fundedthrough carveout approach and earned 64 annually its annuity value would offset nearly 40 of the lost social secu rity benefit resulting in net reduction of only 25 if it earned 10 annually it would more than offset the social securitybenefit reduction yielding combined bene fit that would be 11 higher than under current lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs6 table 3 projected impact of coupling personal accounts funded at 2

earners retiring at age 65 who always earned average wages see appe ndix for discussion of other assumptions the alternative 64 and 10 rates of return repr esent nominal rates on an afterinflation or what economists refer to as real basis th ey would be 30 and 65 respectively under these scenarios the annuities fr om personal accounts funded from either an addon or carveout approach coupl ed with benefit constraint sufficient to achieve longrange actuarial balance eg allowing initial benefits to rise onlywith inflation eventually produce combined benefit that would be higher thanwhat would be affordable if policymakers did not address the systems projectedfunding shortfall this occurs under either 64 or 10 annual rateofreturn for the accounts for example with pe rsonal accounts earning 64 annually the 156 and 251 net reductions for the 2070 retiree under the addon and carveoutapproaches respectively are still smaller than the projected 32 benefit reductionthat would occur in that year if social security benefits were adjusted to fit within the systems income projected under current law as table 3 shows the carveout approach produces smaller combined benefit than the add on approach in each case because it requires workers to give uphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs7 5 maximumwage earner is defined here to be someone who always earned the maximum level of earnings each year subject to the social security tax lowwage earneris defined as someone who always earned 45 of the average wagea portion of their social security benefit in addition to the loss of benefits resulting from the constraint measure incorporated in the proposal nonetheless themagnitude of the differential between the tw approaches is not great for example for workers earning an average wage if personal account growing at 64 annually were joined with raising the age for full social security retirement benefits to 70under the add on approach the combined be nefits would be 6 higher than current law and under the carve out approach th ey would be 7 lower difference of 13 in 2070 the differences in the level of the combined benefits between the add on and carve out approaches under the three proposals range from 95 to 161 table 3 also illustrates the importance of the rate of return on the account even with an account to which only 2 of pay is contributed the difference in benefits from compounding growth at different rates over 43year period can bequite large at 64 growth rate an add on personal account coupled with the proposal to allow initial benefits to rise only with inflation would produce net benefit reduction for the 2070 retiree of 156 compared to current law on the other hand if the account grew at 10 nnual rate the combined benefit would be 21 higher than current law the spread between the two outcomes would be equal to 37 of current law benefits another important factor not reflected in table 3 is the effect that personal accounts could have on the tilt of the social security system that now favorsworkers with lower career earnings the soci security benefit formula is designed to replace higher proportion of earnings fo r lowwage workers everything else held equal personal account funded with constant percentage of pay wouldproduce an account that would be strictly proportional to the level of workersearnings thus personal account intended to substitute for portion of socialsecurity or make up for acrosstheboard re ductions needed to bring the system into longrange actuarial balance would lessen the tilt currently favoring lowpaidworkers this is not to say that personal account to which 2 of pay is contributedwould in and of itself discriminate among wo rkers rather it would be the natural result of shifting more of the combined benefit to purely proportional system tables 1 through 3 reflect benefit outcomes only for the average earner case to illustrate the potential reduction in the tilt table 4 shows the effects on replacement rates for low average and maximum earners 5 retiring in 2070 when benefit constraint sufficient to achieve longrange actuarial balance is coupled with personal accounts as table 4 shows if the personal account were to grow at 64 annual rate at all three wage levels it would make up for only part of the reduction in socialsecurity benefits the reduction in earnings replacement would be greatest for thelowwage earner 223 relative to current law compared to reduction of 50 for the highwage earner on the other hand if the personal account were to grow at 10 annual rate it would more than make up for the benefit reduction at allthree wage levels however the magnitude of the gain would be largest for the highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs8 wage earner the net increase for the highwage earner would be 502 relative to current law compared to net increase of 47 for the lowwage earner table 4 projected impact of coupling personal accounts funded at 2 of pay with social

fulltime low average and maximum wage earners who retire at age 65 see the appendix for further description of these examples and discussion of other assumptions assumes add on approach is taken to fund the accounts the reader should keep in mind that the projected personal account balances shown in this report are illustrations only actual outcomes would vary the report makes assertion that career in which worker has 43 years of continuous steady earnings is typical or that 64 or 10 rate of return in each year of 43year investment period is typical or likely investment scenario for example many workers earn relatively low wages early in their careers and receive higher wages as their careers progress under the social s ecurity benefit computation rules worker who earns low wages early in his or her career and higher wages later on could have the same average lifetime earnings and ther efore the same social security benefit as worker who always earns average wages however with personal accounts thetiming of highs and lows with regard to earnings and investment returns cansignificantly affect asset accumulations specifically because of the power of compound growth contributions made early in career have disproportionate effect on the eventual value of the account everything else held equal pattern in which average wage workers start out with relatively lower wages early in theircareers would result in account balances at retirement that would be less than those shown for workers who always earned the aver age wage this effect could be offset if the workers accounts earned relatively higher rate of return toward the end ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs9 their careers however relatively lower re turn late in their careers or periods of unemployment could further reduce the valu of the account the point is that the reader should recognize that the eventual value of personal account is sensitive to fluctuations in contribution levels and rate s of return during the workers career as result actual outcomes will vary from th illustrations shown here which feature workers who always earn average wages or set proportion thereof and alwaysreceive the same rate of return on their personal accounts other illustrative proposals other proposals illustrated in the report target particular segment of the population or ar designed to mitigate the effect of other constraint proposals on particular group one raising the taxable earnings base is revenue measure that also alters bene fits the social security tax is levied on earnings only up to certain level or base amount each year in 2001 this figure is80400 while raising the base is often seen as means to bring in more receipts to help close the longrange funding gap the proposal also would increase theamount of earnings credited to the affected workers earnings records and thuspotentially increase their eventual social security benefits the workers involved are relatively high paid only about 6 of workers today have earnings at or abovethe base consequently while they may receive higher benefits the return on the additional taxes they paid can be relatively modest because the systems benefitformula is designed to replace smaller proportion of earnings for highpaidworkers for example the report shows that increasing the base by 50000 in 2002from an estimated 84900 to 134900 would raise the benefits of high paidworker retiring in 2030 by 24 but the value of each additional tax dollar paidwould render only 042 in benefits for th 2070 retiree the benefit increase would be 30 but for each additional tax dollar paid there would be only 029 in benefits earned another proposal would attempt to enhan ce social security benefits for aged widows and widowers either to address their relatively high incidence of povertytoday or to offset the impact of other gene ral constraints that might be considered to restore the systems longrange solvency when one member of couple receiving social security benefits dies the survivi ng spouse is sometimes left with just the higher of their two individual predeath benefits which can be as little as onehalfof what the couple was formerly receiving the proposal illustrated here would basesocial security widows and widowers benefits on 75 of the combined level ofbenefits payable to the couple before one of them died doing so would raise thebasic widows or widowers benefit by range of 125 to 50 depending on whether one or both members of the couple had work records of their own and thelevel of benefits payable on those records two other proposals are directed at in stances where younger worker dies or becomes disabled in these cases th earnings replacement value of personal accounts is curtailed by the shorter period over which contributions and investment returns are accumulated this is more likely to be an issue where personal accountsare coupled with acrosstheboard benefit c onstraints for example an annuity from an account that accumulates for only 8 year s would be worth only 6 of an annuity from an account that accumulates over fu ll 43year career one proposal illustrated here to mitigate this effect would raise the maximum social security benefits payable to workers family under current law spouses childrens or other potentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs10 dependents benefits are often reduced because of an overa ll limit on the benefits payable on single earnings record this limit ranges from 150 to 188 of the workers basic benefit and varies with the size of that benefit under the proposal these maximum percentages would be increased gradually over time as the generalconstraint on benefits becomes larger fo r example 13 per year hike in the family maximum limit could raise the bene fits payable to family by 10 in 2030 and 26 by 2070 the other proposal would increase the number of years of earnings that can be dropped in calculating social security benefits for workers who become disabledbefore age 47 disregarding low earnings can raise recipients average career earnings for benefit calculation purposes u nder current law when death occurs at relatively early age as few as 2 years ma be used in calculating survivors benefits the same applies when disability occurs before age 25 however between the ages of 25 and 46 more years of earnings are counted in disability cases than forsurvivors the proposal illustrated here would allow workers who become disabled at these ages to have the same number of years disregarded as in early death cases its effect would vary significantly depending on each workers earnings recordobviously it would have effect on workers disabled after age 46 as generalrule its greatest effect would be on younger lowpaid workers and its smallesteffect would be on highpaid workers disabled at age 46 for example worker who became disabled at age 30 and who earned an amount equal to onehalf of theminimum wage in the 4 preceding years would receive 76 higher benefits under the proposal whereas worker disabled at age 46 who always earned the maximum taxable wage would receive an increase of only 008 the following sections of this report go in to these illustrations in greater detailhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs11 6 the term full retirement benefits is misnomer because it does not represent the highest benefit worker can receive under the law workers basic benefit or primary insurance amount pia is determined by benefit form ula that is specifically applicable to the workers age cohort the formula changes annua lly for each new cohort this basic benefit is what is being referred to by the term f ull retirement benefits for retirees the amount of benefits payable will be lower or higher than their pia if they choose to receive benefits before or after their cohorts fullbenefit age 7 the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821different baselines alternative ways of measuring benefit changes the effects of the proposals examined in this report are illustrated by comparing the benefits they are projected to provide to four different baselines 1 benefits prescribed by the rules of current law2 benefits that would be payable if they were adjusted to fit within the systems projected income under the financing provisions of current law 3 the purchasing power of benefits paid to todays retirees ie the purchasing power of future retirees bene fits compared to those of workers retiring in 2001 and 4 benefits expressed as percentage of preretirement earnings for recent retirees ie the average replacement rate for workers retiring in 19902000 benefits prescribed by current law is not constant baseline the most common approach policymakers use to evaluate proposed reforms of social security is to determine the exte nt to which they would alter the level of benefits prescribed by current law however these rules are changing from theprograms inception in 1935 until 2000 the age at whic h full retirement benefits 6 were payable was 65 however as result of legislation passed in 19837 over 22 year period the age for full retirement benefits is gradually rising to 67 beginningwith those becoming eligible ie attain ing age 62 in 2000 for example the age for full retirement benefits for people b ecoming eligible in 2001 the second year of the transition is 65 and 4 months thus those affected today are persons whochoose to retire well before attaining this age ie those now ages 62 and 63compared to what they would have r eceived under the pre1983 law their benefits reflect 2 or 4 more months of reduction for early retirement other changes enacted in 1983 are now increasing the socalled delayed retirement credit or drc this credit rais the benefit levels of people who delay filing for social security benefits until af ter they reach their age for full retirement benefits the higher credit is currently be ing phased in and will reach its full levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs12 8 under the old law the maximum drc was 3 per year and was applicable to retirements delayed beyond age 65 up to age 70 thus the maximum cumulative drc was 15 5years x 3 per year under current law the drc will eventually reach maximum of 8per year and when the age for full retiremen t benefits reaches 67 the maximum cumulative drc will be 24 3 years x 8 per year 9 the point at which benefits are the same 110 of the pia under both the preand post 1983 lawfor those becoming eligible in 2008 and thereafter8 table 5 illustrates how much lower or higher these benefits will be compared to those under the pre1983 law table 5 changes in future social security retirement benefits resulting from agerelated provisions enacted in 1983 age at which worker electsto

amounts in excess of 100 are the result of delayed retirement credits as shown in table 5 when the 1983 law is fully phasedin ie when the age for full retirement benefits reaches age 67 for workers who become eligible in 2022 or later the benefits for anyone who retires before age 68 and 3 months9 will be lower than under pre1983 law because few people wait to file for benefits untilafter age 68 4 of those filing for benef its in 1999 the basic effect of the 1983 changes is to cut benefits for large majority of future retirees as result it is notalways clear what proposed alteration of current law means for people who become eligible for retirement benefits over the next 21 years current law is amoving target if comparisons to current law are intended to show by how muchbenefits resulting from reform proposals will differ from those paid to todays retirees they are misleading because under curre nt law benefits promised to future retirees already differ from those paid to todays retirees comparisons to current law benefits are nonetheless important in legislative sense they allow policymakers to ex amine by how much proposed change will alter previously established policy or what is perceived to be the status quo itshows the degree of change on average nd potential winners and losers morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs13 10 some observers point out that under the trustees projections social security tax receipts fall below the systems expenditures in 2016 and remain lower thereafter although the trust funds are projected to have balance of 5 trillion in federal securities credited to them atthat point and will continue to have ba lance until 2038 these observers pose the question of where the government will get the money to redeem the securities they argue that the systems problems may occur earlier than 2038 the assumption here that benefits wouldbe paid in full up to 2038 is based on the premise that the treasury would not lose itsauthority to pay benefits in full prior to this date it is not intended to dispute the possibility that financial strains on the government andor the social security system could emergeearlierthan nine out of ten workers have stake in social security and 45 million people currently receive benefits thus the obvious first question for lawmakers is howare we changing the rules that exist today and what does it mean in dollars andcents in effect currentlaw policy ge nerates certain expectations and those expectations are baseline even if not constant or fixed from one retirement cohortto the next it also is important that th systems income and costs as projected under current law determine the extent to whic h social security is underor overfinanced therefore for those who believe that the fundamental goal of social security reform is to restore the programs solvency curr ent law is the most appropriate baseline against which all reform proposals should be measured from this perspective thefact that benefits paid at any given ag are changing as result of the 1983 law is seen as irrelevant using other baselines can show how well policy changes achieve certain other retirement goals not only does the benefits prescribed by current law baseline change over time it also does not reflect that currentlaw benefits are projected to beunsustainable under the social security trustees intermediate or best guessprojections social securitys trust funds would be depleted in 2038 and incomingreceipts could pay for only 73 of the programs expenditures declining to 68 by 2070 10 table 6 shows the level of social secur ity benefits prescribed under the rules of current law the benefits that would be affordable given the systemsprojected financing limitations and the di fference ie the amount that would not be payable if the projections materialized all calculations are for fulltime workersretiring at age 65 who always earned average wages table 6 illustrates that comparing proposals projected benefits to those resulting from the rules of current law can be misleading since the full amount of benefits promised under current law would not be payable under the trusteesprojections for example proposal that is shown to result in benefits that are 10 or 20 lower than under current law may at first glance appear politicallyunattractive but may appear less so if comp ared to the 27 reduction in benefits that would have to occur in 2038 if policymakers were to take action see figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs14 05001000150020002500 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060

examination of whether and how its benefits should be constrained to restore solvency if thesolution to the systems longrange financing problem is to reduce its benefitssubstantially then the question arises of whether future retirement incomes wouldbe inadequate thus bringing the system s income and outgo into balance is only part of the issue to give different pe rspectives on the broad effect of making change to social security and to addr ess the issue of how adequate retirement benefits would be this report uses two alternative baselines one examines the question of adequacy by comparing the purch asing power of social security benefits of future retirees under both current law and proposed benefit constraints to thepurchasing power of benefits for workers retiring today the second baselineexamines the role of social security in providing retirement income by comparing the proportion of preretirement earnings replaced by social security for futureretirees under the illustrative benefit constraints to those provided to recent retireesdefined as those retiring at age 65 in the past decade or so under current law recipients basic monthly social security benefit is calculated by multiplying threestep formul against most of the recipients career earnings record new benefit formula is created each year for each new cohort of eligible recipients formula that reflects the annual increase in average wagesoccurring 2 years earlier the earnings histories used to compute each personsaverage earnings to which the formula is applied also are indexed for wage growth from the year they were earned until the year the worker reached age 60 earnings at age 60 and later are included in the cal culation at their nominal value since wages are projected to grow faster than prices under the trustees intermediateforecast wages would grow at rate of 43 annually and prices at rate of 33 initial social security benefits for future retirees one cohort to the next are assumed to grow faster than inflation thus under current rules social security benefits are projected to grow in real terms meaning that future retirees bene fits would have greater purchasing power than that of todays retirees conversely because of the change in the age for full retirement benefits the earnings replacement that these benefits would afford future retirees is projected to be noticeably lower than that afforded recent retirees of the same age table 7 illustrates these two phenomenahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs16 table 7 purchasing power and earnings replacement rates from future social

intermediate assumptions of the 2001 social security trustees report table 7 shows that in one sense current law rules assuming they were affordable would result in substantial increas in the real value of future benefits 252 for the 2030 retiree and 841 for the 2070 retiree for average wage earners retiring at age 65 see figure 2 in another sense social securitys future role as source of retirement income w ould decline somewhat while on average social security replaced approximately 424 of final years earnings for steady average wage earners retiring at age 65 in 19902000 it eventually would drop to alevel of 366 for workers retiring at age 65 in 2025 and thereafter decline of nearly 14 see figure 3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs17 0102030405060708090 2010 2020 2030

under current lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs18 these two baselines represent different approaches to assessing the adequacy of future social security benefits under both current law and proposed reforms one baseline suggests that future benefits coul d be less than those promised under current law and still provide meaningful basic fl oor of retirement income the other suggests that social securitys role in replacing preretirement earnings is alreadyscheduled to decline and would decline further if its financing problems wereaddressed through additional benefit reductions where to peg social securitysfuture role within these two baselines is value judgement for policymakers but it is as much part of the overall issue of social security reform as is bringing the systems finances into longrange balancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs19 11 the trustees intermediate forecast assumes social securitys average expenditures over the 20012075 projection period would equal 1544 of the nations taxable payroll while its income would equal 1358 the difference of 186 of taxable payroll is equal to 14 of the systems average projected income 1861358 14 12 for instance change in th social security benefit formula could affect low and high paid workers differently some reformers have proposed changing the replacement factors or the bend points in the benefit formula such changes would affect the tilt in formula usually by providing less earnings replacement for highpaid workersdescription of illustrative options expenditure constraint measures the illustrative proposals examined first are ones that are designed to deal with social securitys longrange funding gap by constraining future expendituresaccording to the trustees latest projections on average over the next 75 years socialsecuritys expenditures will exceed its income by 14 11 surplus of approximately 3 in the first 25 years is overwhelmed by deficits of 33 in thesecond 25 years and 40 in the last 25 years in the final year of the projection period 2075 the deficit is 45 the proposal s illustrated here could help close that gap not all of them would remedy the problem by themselves but all would have large effect according to estimates pr epared by the office of the actuary of the social security administration the proposal that would result in the smallest benefitreductions would eliminate 13 of the problem on average and the proposal thatwould result in the largest reductions would eliminate the entire problem and then some see the actuarial effect section of table 9 on pages 27 and 28 the types of proposals selected are intended to repr esent the broad range of ideas manifested in bills introduced in recent congresses and proposals made by other panels andcommissions they are not necessarily identical to any specific bill orrecommendation the illustrations are intended to show gene ral effects on benefit levels the first set of proposals beginning with table 9 illustrates the general effects of certain broadbased benefit constraints measures nd for this reason the analysis focuses on hypothetical fulltime worker who always earned average wages it should benoted that all the constraint measur shown would produce roughly proportional benefit reductions for example raising th age for full retirement benefits to 70 by 2029 produces longrange reduction in current law retirement benefits of 19 atages 62 65 and 70 and on low average and high wage earners alike policymakers could decide to follow more targeted appr oach perhaps to mitigate the effect of constraint on certain types of recipients eg lowwage earners early retireessurvivors the disabled or to offset the distributional or wealth effects of othermeasures such as creating personal accounts and combining them with generalbenefit constraint 12 judgement is made as to whether these effects should be mitigated or accentuated for any segment of the recipient population otherillustrative measures designed to target sp ecific segments of the recipient population are examined later in the reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs20 raise the age for full retirement benefits to 70 by 2029 as described earlier under current law the age for full social security retirement benefits isscheduled to rise to 67 in two gradual steps the first step began in 2000 affectingworkers attaining age 62 in that year 62 is the earliest age at which retirementbenefits can be received ie the first year of eligibility for workers reaching age 62 before 2000 the age for full retirement benefits remains at 65 the age for fullretirement benefits currently is rising by 2 months per year until it reaches 66 for newly eligible workers in 2005 it then stays at 66 until 2017 when it again rises by2 months per year until reaching 67 for newly eligible workers in 2022 it thenremains at 67 for subsequent new retirees under the option examined here the agefor full retirement benefits would rise at the rate of 2 months every year until itreaches age 70 for those becoming eligible in 2029 and later the proposal would take effect in 2006 and would only apply those attaining age 62 in that year andthereafter raise the age for full retirement benefits to 66 by 2005 and thereafter in tandem with increases in longevity under this option the age for full retirement benefits would rise to 66 in 2005 as under current law thereafter it would rise by 1 month every 2 years this rate of increase would approximately match the projected rise in longevity under the trustees intermediate projectionsunder this scenario the age for full retir ement benefits would be 67 in 2030 67 and 10 months in 2050 and 68 and 11 months in 2075 at that point the age increase would come close to matching about half of the overall increase in longevity sincethe programs inception in 1940 the propos would take effect in 2007 applying only to those attaining age 62 in that year and thereafter this measure wouldreplace the current law increase in the age for full retirement benefits from 66 to 67 scheduled to be phased in from 2017 to 2022 raise age for full retirement benefi ts to 70 by 2029 and thereafter in tandem with increases in longevity under this option the age for full retirement benefits would rise by 2 months every year until it reaches age 70 forthose becoming eligible in 2029 thereafter it would rise by 1 month every 2 years this rate of increase would approximately match the projected rise in longevityunder the trustees intermediate projecti ons from that point on and by 2075 would come close to matching the overall increase in longevity since the programsinception in 1940 the age for full retirem ent benefits would be 70 and 10 months in 2050 and 71 and 11 months in 2075 the proposal would take effect in 2006applying only to those attaining age 62 in that year and thereafter allow initial social security benefits to rise only with inflation as discussed earlier under current law social security benefits are projected to growin real terms meaning that future recipients benefits would have greater purchasing power than that of todays reci pients this is based on the trustees projection that wages from which benefits are determined would grow faster than prices under this option the annual adjust ment made in calculating benefits would be set so that the initial benefits would rise only at the rate of inflation hence the real value of initial benefits would be held constant over time meaning that theywould buy the same amount of goods and servi ces for future recipients as they buy for todays recipients to phase in the change without causing reductions to the real value of benefits by coupling it with the ready scheduled hikes in the age for fullhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs21 retirement benefits the proposal would not take effect until 2006 ie it would begin with those attaining age 62 or otherwise b ecoming eligible in that year and the second phase of the current law hike in the age for full retirement benefits raisingit from 66 to 67 beginning in 2017 would be repealed allow initial social security benefi ts to rise by onehalf of the real growth implicit under currentlaw rules this option would be similar in concept to the previous one but the limitati on on the growth of initial benefits would not be as large under this option the annual adjustment made in calculatingbenefits would be set so that initial benef its would rise by onehalf of the real growth resulting under current law hence the real value of benefits still would be allowed to grow meaning that th benefits would buy more goods and services from one cohort to the next but not by as much as under current law to phase in the changewithout causing reductions to the real valu of benefits by raising the age for full retirement benefits the proposal would not take effect until 2006 ie it would begin with those attaining age 62 or otherwise b ecoming eligible in that year and the second phase of the current law increase in the age for full retirement benefitsraising it from 66 to 67 would be repealed reduce social security colas by 1 percentage point annually under current law once initial social security benefits are determined under theformula they are adjusted annually thereafter for inflation through costoflivingadjustments or colas colas take eff ect beginning with the year after worker reaches age 62 or otherwise becomes eligible for disability or survivor benefitseven worker who delays retirement be yond age 62 receives an adjustment in the level of his or her initial benefits to reflect colas that took effect in the intervening years the amount of the cola is based on the rise in the bureau of laborstatistics consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workerscpiw from the third quarter of 1 year to the third quarter of the next year it becomes effective for the following decembe rs benefits and is payable in january of the next year under this proposal the cola would be reduced each year by 1 percentage point for example if the cpiw rises by 33 during the measuringperiod the following decembers benefit increase would be 23 this proposalwould take effect beginning with the co for december 2006 payable in january 2007 personal account measures many of the recent social security re form bills as well as reform plans proposed by others have included measures to create personal social securitysavings accounts patterned after iras or 401k pension plans they envisionannual contributions to the accounts being made by the individual or the government on behalf of the individual that would be invested in stocks and bonds toaccumulate assets for retirement death or disability the value of each individualsaccount would vary depending on the amounts c ontributed and the rate of return of the investments there is uniform or consensus approach among proponentsregarding how to structure these accounts but their basic themes are that theaccounts could serve as supplements to social security as way to create an entirelynew system to replace income lost due to retirement death and disability or as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs22 13 an indexed periodic payment or annuity assumes that the payment would be increased automatically each year by the rate of infla tion thus the payment it would provide initially would be smaller than that provided by traditional nonindexed annuity but unlike the nonindexed annuity it would not lose value ove r time portraying the annuity from the personal account in this way makes them analogous to social security benefits 14 ibbotson associates stocks bonds bills and inflation 2000 yearbook means to offset all or part of the benefit reductions that might be used to bring the system into longrange financial balance this report illustrates potential annuitized payments that personal accounts might produce the analysis here first reflects the outcomes from number ofalternative contribution rates and investment returns with the results expressed asindexed periodic annuity payments 13 it attempts to make the numbers relevant to the social security reform debate by comparing them to the size of projected retirement benefits prescribed under current law which illustrates the extent to which these annuities could supplement or replace portion of the systems benefits itthen examines the outcomes of combini ng personal accounts with number of social security constraint measures although the report uses generalized approach topersonal accounts that is designed to show reasonable range of outcomes thereader is advised that there are many caveats to making such projections the appendix provides more detailed discussi on on some of the major ones broader economic issues that may be related to the creation of personal accounts are notanalyzed in this report basic personal account illustrations to illustrate an array of examples the analysis first determines the account balance that might be accumulated by workers who always earned an average wage under contribution rates of 1 2 or 3 of their pay assumption is ma as to how the accounts would be funded for example workers could pay additional sums over and above their social securitytaxes they could divert portion of their existing social security taxes to them or the government could fund them with general revenues the illustrations show howmuch an indexed periodic payment or annuity from personal account would berelative to the size of projected social s ecurity benefits computed under current law rules the outcomes are shown under alternative annual growth rates rates ofreturn of 64 and 10 or 3 and 65 respectively after adjustment for inflation hence the analysis shows si x possible outcomes three different annual contribution rates combined with two differe nt rates of return for each the lower rate 64 is the trustees assumed long range rate of return for the investments held by the social security trust funds unde r current law basically the rate earned by longerterm us government bonds and rves as proxy for the rate of return relatively safe investment strategy would earn the higher rate 10 represents the approximate average invest ment return achieved by the standard and poors 500 index from 1926 to 1999 14 minus 13 percentage points contributions to the account are assumed to begin in 2002 or at age 22 if occurring later andcontinue through age 64 for detailed description of the assumptions andmethodology used see methods and basic assumptions used to prepare report in the appendix combining personal accounts with measures that would reduce social security benefits under this set of options personal accounts would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs23 15 implicit in this scenario is the assumption that personal accounts would be mandatory some proposals for personal accounts would make them voluntary making participationoptional would not alter the illustrations for personal workers but it could have different effects on the system overall depending on wh ich workers choose to participate ie recognizing the possibility of adverse selection that could exist under voluntary systemfor example if disproportionate number of higherpaid workers were to opt for voluntarypersonal accounts and portion of their existing so cial security taxes were diverted to fund them program receipts available to pay for current benefits and administrative expenses would decline disproportionately since the system is designed to favor low earners to theextent higher percentage of higherwage earne rs opted to divert some of their taxes to personal accounts greater burden for financ ing the system would fall on the lowerwage earners who remain fully vested in it 16 alternatively funded means that the annuity would be reduced instead of the social security benefit and corresponding amount w ould be transferred to the social security trust funds either way the combined payments would be the same 17 this linkage is prescribed under current law 18 raising the systems income through higher pa yroll tax rates or infusions of general revenues would not directly alter future bene fits however additi onal revenue would lower the amount by which benefits would have to be reduced to restore the systems solvency and in this respect they could have an effect on benefits the reductions that otherwise would continuedcreated for each social security taxpayer beginning in 2002 in conjunction with enactment of one of the three alternative options to help reduce social securitys longrange deficit discussed earlier15 under one option social security benefits would be reduced at the time of re tirement or alternatively funded16 by 75 of the annuity value of the personal account under the other two options the personalaccounts would have direct effect on social security benefits however it isassumed that the creation of the accounts would be accompanied by enactment ofsocial security benefit constraints one would raise the age for full social security retirement benefits to 70 by 2029 the ot her would allow initial social security benefits to rise only with inflation to simplify the illustrati ons annual contributions are assumed to equal 2 of pay throughout the workers career the analysis then shows two possible outcomes fo r each of the three joined options based on the two rate of return assumptions for the personal accounts other selected reform measures additional proposals are included in this report to show few types of targeted measures ie measures designed to affect particular segment of the population or mitigate the effect of constraint proposals on particular group raising the social securi ty taxable earnings base this option would affect only highpaid workers the taxa ble earnings base is the maximum level of earnings subject to social security ta xation each year in 2001 the base is 80400 in any year in which there is cola th base rises in proportion to the growth in average earnings in the economy since the previous cola17 this income producing option is illustrated because unlike payroll tax rate increase or general revenue infusion to the system raising the base also may raise the eventual benefits of affected workers18 since recipients career taxable earnings are used tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs24 18 continued have to take place are illustrated by table 6 which projects the difference between the benefit levels prescribed by current law nd those that would be affordable under the trustees intermediate projections 19 it is assumed that the additional earnings taxed would accrue to the workers social security earnings record some proposals dvocated in the past would have taxed the additional earnings without crediting them to the workers recordcompute social security benefits raising the amount that is taxable will result in higher average earnings level for computi ng benefits and thus raise the workers eventual benefits19 under two variations illustrated here the taxable earnings base estimated under current law to be 849 00 in 2002 would be increased by 1 15000 setting it at 99900 in 2002 or 2 50000 setting it at 134900 in 2002 after which it would rise again by the rate of average earnings in the economy raising the level of social security widows and widowers benefits under current law surviving s pouse is entitled to the higher of his or her own social security benefit from hi s or her own earnings record or to widows or widowers benefit that is 100 of the deceased s pouses benefit this proposal would provide widows and widow ers benefits equal to 75 of the combined benefits paid to the couple befo re one of them died or would have been paid had they filed for benefits becau spouse is eligible for onehalf of the other spouses basic benefit while they ar both alive the couples combined benefits before any reduction for early retirement is at least 150 of the higherearning spouses basic benefit hence when one member of couple dies surviving spouse without work record receives benefit that is 33 lower than the couplesformer combined benefit the combined predeath level drops from 150 to 100 of the deceased recipients former benefit if the surviving spouse receives benefit based on his or her own work record that benefit is subtracted from the widows or widowers benefit and only the difference if any is paid as survivor benefit hence in these circumstances when one member of couple dies the survivingspouse is left with the higher of the tw individual predeath benefits which can be as little as onehalf of what the couple formerly received enhancement of social security widows and widowers benefits is proposed frequently as means of reducing the high poverty rates that preva il among aged widows and widowers the range by which this proposal would increase the basic widows or widowers benefit would be between 125 and 50 depending on the level of benefits payable oneach workers record raising social security benefits for young survivor and disabled recipients two proposals are directed at instances where younger worker dies or becomes disabled in these cases the earnings replacement value of personalaccounts is curtailed by the shorter period over which contributions and investment returns are accumulated this is more likely to be an issue where personal accountsare coupled with benefit constraints ie change in the benefit formula that would result in acrosstheboard reductions in initial benefits in contrast proposals to raise the age for full retirement benefits might not affect young disabled and survivorcases by design their benefits currently are computed as if they already attained that age similarly benefits under proposals to offset social security benefits by theamount of the annuity from personal account might not be much different from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs25 level of benefits promised under current law since the idea is to achieve those levels through the combination of social security benefits and annuity payments under two measures illustrated here it is assumed that proposals to create personal accounts and curtail the growth of initial social security benefits would be accompanied by additional measures allowing the system to retain greater portionof its prereform social insurance function one would accomplish this by raising the maximum social security benefits payable to workers family under current law spouses childrens or other poten tial dependents benefits are often reduced because of an overall limit on the benefits payable on single earnings record this limit referred to as the family maximum now ranges from 150 to 188 of theworkers basic benefit and varies with the size of that benefit under the proposal these family maximum percentages would be increased gradually over time as theconstraint on basic benefits becomes larger the other proposal would increase the number of years of earnings disregarded in calculating social security benefits fo r workers who become disabled before age 47 disregarding years of low earnings can raise recipients average career earnings for benefit calculation purposes under current law the highest 35 earnings years are used for workers age 62 or older the number of years counteddrops for younger disability or survivor cases in early death cases it drops by thenumber of years the worker died before age 62 with minimum of 2 years used in the calculation for survivors of workers who die at or before age 29 the same rule applies in disability cases where the disab ility occurs after age 46 but before age 62 however in cases where the disability occurs at ages 25 through 46 the number of drop out years is scaled back in such cases more earnings years are counted in computing disability benefits than in survivor benefits see table 8 the proposal illustrated in this report would allow workers who become disabled at ages 25through 46 to have the same number of years disregarded as in early death cases table 8 years of earnings counted in calculating preage 62 survivor and disability benefit cases under current law age at time of death or

from 2010 to2070 the top section of the table shows the reduction in benefits in the first year of retirement the middle section shows the reduction in benefits over lifetime andthe bottom section shows by how much each proposal would reduce the systemslongrange deficit the proposals causing the smallest initial reductions are 1 reducing the cola by 1 percentage point annually and 2 raising the age for full retirementbenefits to reflect increases in longevity the cola proposal reduces the firstyears benefit by only 3 however the reduction compounds year after yearresulting in reductions over lifetime of 11 to 12 raising the age for fullretirement benefits in tandem with incr eases in longevity would produce small benefit increase for the 2030 retiree because the age for full retirement benefits then would be slightly lower than under current law 66 and 11 months instead of 67however the age for full retirement benefits would continue to rise for later retirees resulting in an 11 firstyear and lifetime benefit reduction for the 2070 retiree theproposal causing the largest reductions for the 2070 retiree is the one that allowsinitial benefits to rise only with inflation it would result in firstyear and lifetime benefit reductions of 41 when observing the benefit levels in the following tables the reader should keep in mind that only one of the options allowing future benefits to rise only with inflation is projected to achieve enough ggregate savings on its own to restore the systems longrange solvency ie on aver age over the next 75 years because the various options are shown next to each other in each table the reader mightinstinctively compare one options effects to another as if they were comparable onan actuarial basis if viewed this way proposal that shows higher residual benefits would appear preferable to another showi ng lower ones to evaluate the options in this way would be misleading because the option incorporating the smaller cut wouldnot get as close to or achieve actuarial ba lance as the ones incorporating larger cuts other benefit cuts or tax increases woul d have to accompany the options with the smaller effects if the systems

appendix for discussion of other assumptionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs29 21 one might ask why the cola option produces reduction in initial benefits since the widespread perception is that the cola is meant to adjust benefits for inflation after recipients join the benefit rolls cola adjustments however start to apply to benefits the year after person becomes eligible at age 62 regardless of whether they choose to receive benefits the illustrations in the table are for someone retiring at age 65 three years afterhe or she became eligible for benefits he nce the initial benefits shown under the proposal reflect 3 years worth of colas that have been reduced by 1 percentage point annuallya consideration with cola constraints with the exception of the proposal to constrain colas table 9 shows that under each proposal the reduction in benefits during the first year of re tirement and over lifetime are proportionately the same compare the figures for each proposal in the top and middle segments ofthe table for instance the effect of rais ing the age for full retirement benefits to 70 for someone retiring in 2070 in the first year is 19 as is the loss in lifetimebenefits with the cola constraint how ever there would be differences the relatively small initial first year reducti on of 3 is somewhat misleading as is evidenced by the projected lif etime reduction of 12 in 2070 21 the effect of the cola constraint grows each year after pe rson joins the benefit rolls in effect it compounds over recipients lifetime and the benefit reduction relative to current law grows larger the longer person re mains on the benefit rolls although the recipient would continue to get benefit increases under the proposal and the nominal value of the benefits would go up the pur chasing power or real value of the benefits would decline table 10 shows that for worker retiring at age 65 the value of the benefits would be 118 lower by age 75 and 238 by age 90 table 10 effect of

benefits w h i tables 9 and 10 show that these proposals would provide social security benefits that generally would be lower than those provided under current law they would still provide benefits that have more purchasing power than those of todays retirees under current law social security benefits are projected to rise significantly in real terms for example in comparison to the purchasing power of the benefits of workers retiring today at age 65 similar worker retiring in 2070 would receive abenefit that would be 84 higher in terms of the goods and services it could buyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs30 assuming there was sufficient financing to pay benefits promised under current law thus under all the proposals illustrated here the purchasing power of future retireesbenefits would still be higher than that of the benefits for comparable new retirees in 2001 using the same hypothetical retirees as in table 9 table 11 illustrates these increases note that the bottom secti on of the table shows that increases in the purchasing power of lifetime benefits are rger than those shown for initial benefits this occurs because as consequence of increasing longevity future retirees willcollect benefits for longer time than will 2001 retirees as the table shows the proposal resulting in the smallest reduction in benefits from current law levels increasing the age for full retirement benefits to reflect increases in longevity pr oduces an initial benefit that has 64 more purchasing power for someone retiring in 2070 than for someone retiring in 2001 the proposal resulting in the largest benefit reduction from current law levels allowing initialbenefits to rise only with inflation still produces an increase in purchasing power of 9 in terms of lifetime benefits in 2070 benefits under these proposals have 88 and 25 more purchasing power respectively than for someone retiring in2001 the decline in future replacement rates at first glance it may appear that providing greater purchasing power to future retirees represents an expansionof the social security program it can be construed that way because futurerecipients would be able to buy more goods and services with their social securitybenefits than people retiring in 2001 however social security has always beendescribed as form of insurance against the loss of earnings due to retirementdisability or death because earnings have almost always tended to grow faster than prices it is natural product of social s ecuritys design that the value of social security benefits expressed in constant dollars rises over time under all the options and as is slated to occur to degree under current law as the age for fullretirement benefits increases the income provided by social security as percent of retirees preretirement earnings the replacement rate would decline this wouldreduce social securitys role in providi ng retirement income these effects are illustrated in table 12 which compares future replacement rates projected under current law and the various options to the average of those for workers retiring at age65 in 19902000 as table 12 shows under current law social security replacement rates for worker retiring at age 65 who always ear ned an average wage would decline from the approximate 424 level of the past decade to 366 for comparable workersretiring in 2025 and later decline of 14 setting aside the cola constraint option because its initial effect is not re presentative of its relative effect over lifetime the option resulting in the smallest reduction in initial benefits from currentlaw levels raising the age for full retirement benefits to reflect increases inlongevity also results in the smallest dr op in replacement rates under this option the replacement rate for the averagewage earner retiring in 2070 would drop to326 decline of 23 from the 19902000 level under the option resulting in the largest benefit reduction from current

see the appendix for discussion of other assumptions one might ask why the value of the personal account as percentage of currentlaw social security benefits declines after 2050 this results from projected increases in longevity because the values are expressed as an annuity the monthly benefit pa yable from the principal declines as the period over which the annuity must be paid increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs34 it is important to note that the values shown in table 13 and the following tables that show the effects of personal accounts would be different for workers who have earnings patterns different from that of fulltime worker who always earned an average wage for exam ple if worker always earned the projected federal minimum wage the ranges shown in table 13 would be from 09 to 576 for worker who always earned the social security maximum taxable wage the range would be from 26 to 1406 in each cas the lower end of the ranges would be lower still if there were periods of unemployment in the workers career comparison of personal account nnuities to the portion of social security benefits that would not be payable given the systemsprojected financing gap because the trustees project that the social security benefits prescribed by current law woul d not be fully payable beginning in 2038 comparisons to benefits promised under current law

coupling new personal account system with certain social security benefit constraints while table 14 gives some perspective on the extent to which personal account funded at 2 of pay might offset theprojected benefit shortfalls for worker always earning the average wage few if any policymakers would envision scenario of llowing social security benefits to drop abruptly when the trust fund balances are depleted benefit constraints likely would be phased in gradually allowing future retirees time to adjust their retirement plans table 15 illustrates how three relatively large benefit constraints would mesh with the potential annuities from personal accounts the first would couple the creationof personal accounts with raising the age for full social security retirement benefitsto

those of the personal accounts shows that with an account growingat 64 rate 19 reduction in social security benefits for new retiree in 2070 is more than offset by an account annuity whose value is equal to 25 of the current law social security benefit at 10 annual growth rate the account annuity would be more than three times as large as the social security benefit reduction as with the first approach under the second approach coupling personal accounts with allowing initial benefits to rise only with inflation the socialsecurity benefit reduction would be partially offset if the accounts were to grow at 64 rate and more than offset if they were to grow at 10 rate table 16 shows that with the accounts growing at 64 rate 41 reduction in social securitybenefits for new retiree in 2070 is

who divert 2 of their social security payroll taxes each year for full 43year career the reduction would be smaller for workers with less than full career under system of personal accounts also as mentioned in footnote 4on page 5 this approach assumes that the 161 reduction would apply equally to retirement disability and survivor benefits if the benefit reductions were to apply only to the retirement portion of the program they would have to be larger than 161effect of financing considerati ons on the coupling of benefit constraints and personal accounts although this report makes explicit assumption about how personal accounts would be funded tables 14 through 20 reflect reform plans in which personal acc ounts would implicitly be funded in way that does not alter the systems current financing ie through an add on approachthese illustrations assume that the social security trust funds would continue to be credited with social security taxes as sc heduled under current law and that separate source of funding would be created for the personal accounts for example wageearners might be required to make additional payroll tax contributions to fund theaccounts or surplus federal tax receipts ssuming they exist might be apportioned to each wage earners account alternatively if these accounts were funded under the carve out method ie using portion of existing social security taxes that would otherwise be credited to the social security trust funds the syst ems longrange actuarial deficit would be increased if it were assumed that other funding sources would be established tomake up for the diverted taxes such as ge neral fund infusions into the system then the retirement income reflected in the prev ious tables would be the same as shown however if it were assumed that future so cial security benefits would have to be further reduced to make up for the larger deficit the retirement income reflected inthe previous tables would be too high rger benefit reductions would be required to avoid an increase in the systems actuari deficit currently the systems long range deficit is projected to be 186 of taxable payroll for the next 75 years as awhole diversion of 2 percentage points of the social security tax to personalaccounts potentially would increase the imbalance to something on the order of386 of taxable payroll more than doubling the average 75year deficit although there is generic approach to offsetting this potential revenue loss number of proposals would reduce workers social security benefits by anamount equal to the percentage of lifetime social security taxes that are diverted for example the reduction in benefits for workers who throughout their careerdiverted 2 percentage point s of the 124 social security tax employeeemployer shares combined would be 161 of their fu ture social security benefits 2124 161 24 like tables 15 through 20 tables 21 through 26 illustrate retirement income under proposals that couple personal accounts with benefit reductions but theyincorporate further reductions in benefits to reflect the assumption that workers would give up portion of their remaining social security benefits based on the percentage of lifetime social security taxes diverted to fund their accounts table 15 showed that under the first approach coupling personal accounts funded from the add on

for worker retiring in 2070 would be 425 higher than social security benefits under currentlaw by comparison if it is assumed that benefits would be further reduced inproportion to the amount of social security taxes diverted to fund the account as shown in table 21 the annuities payable from account s that grew at an annual rate of 64 would not be sufficient to offset social security benefit reductions for any cohort for example under this carve out approach the social security benefit for worker retiring in 2070 would be reduced by about 32 from current law levelsthe annuity payable from an account would offset only about 80 of that reduction so the net retirement income from the two sources would be 7 lower than under current law see figure 4 at the higher growth ra of 10 the annuity would more than offset the social security be nefit reductions for workers retiring in 2040 and later as shown in table 22 for new retiree in 2070 the annuity would equal 62 of currentlaw social security bene fits almost twice the amount needed to offset the 32 benefit reduction that w ould occur under the proposal yielding 30 net increase in retirement income see figures 5 and 6

15 showed that under the second approach coupling personal accounts funded from the add on method with allowing initial benefits to rise only with inflation beginning in 2006 the annu ities payable from accounts that grew at an annual rate of 64 would only partially offset the benefit reductions for earlier cohorts while at the higher growth rate of 10 they would more than offset the benefit reductions for all cohorts by comparison as shown in table 21 personal accounts that grew at an annual rate of 64 would not be sufficient to offset thelarger benefit reductions however if the accounts grew at rate of 10 theannuities would exceed the be nefit reductions for new retirees in 2030 and later although the net positive effect on retirement in come would be somewhat lower for example under the add on approach shown in table 15 worker retiring in 2070 would receive net increase of 21 over current law if social security benefits are reduced further to reflect diversion of taxes to fund the accounts as shown in table 21 the same worker would receive net increase of 11 when compared to the portion of social security benefits affordable under current law if changes are made to the system retirement in come under the second approach would be higher under both an add on and carve out approach assuming the personal accounts earned either 64 or 10 rate of return see figure 7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs48 under the third approach shown in table 15 offsetting social security benefits for 75 of the annuity payable from personal account funded from the addon method accounts that earned either 64 or 10 annual return would besufficient to make up for the reduction in social security benefits under theproposal the net increase varies from about 1 to about 16 depending on thecohort and the investment return by comparison personal accounts funded under the carve out method under both investment return assumptions would not be sufficient to offset the larger benefit reductions shown in table 21 for any cohort with 10 annual return the proposal would result in only small negative neteffect for all cohorts especially new re tirees in 2050 and later for whom the net negative effect would be less than 1 as shown in table 22 assuming 64 annual return social security benefits would be reduced by about 35 for newretiree in 2070 and the annuity would be equa l to about 25 of current law benefits resulting in 10 net reduction in retir ement income assuming 10 annual return the reduction in social security benefits 624 would be roughly equal to the value of

purchasing power over that for 2001 retiree assuming either 64 or 10 rateof return furthermore in most instances all three would provide greater increasein purchasing power than benefits pres cribed under current law for example assuming 10 annual return the first pproach coupling personal accounts with raising the full benefit age to 70 would yield net incr ease in purchasing power of about 1624 for new retiree in 2070 because current law would provide thesame worker with an 84 increase in purchasing power over that for 2001 retiree the purchasing power of the benefit under the proposal would be 93 greater than that of the benefit prescribed by current law assuming 64 annual return the second approach coupling personal account s with allowing benefits to increase only by inflation would provide wo rker retiring in 2070 with 555 net increase in purchasing power over that for 2001 retiree however it would be 34 less than under current law when benefits are reduced further to take into account diversion of social security taxes to fund the personal accounts different pattern emerges as shown in tables 25 and 26 when the rate of return on the accounts is assumed to be 64 all three proposals would provide greater purchasing power than that for 2001 retiree although less than that provided under current law assuming 10 annualreturn two of the options coupling personal accounts with raising the full benefitage to 70 and allowing initial benefits to grow only by inflation would provide even greater purchasing power than current law once the personal account systemhas had time

age 60 and beyond are included in the averaging calculation at their nominal valueeffect on social securitys lowwage tilt of coupling personal accounts with social security benefit constraints table 27 shows the percentage of social security benefits that personal accounts would represent forlow average and highpaid workers it illustrates that personal accounts wouldrepresent larger percentage of social s ecurity benefits for highwage earners than lowwage earners this occurs because th current social security benefit formula is tilted in favor of lowwage earners 25 although social security benefits are not based on workers taxes comparison of taxes paid to benefits received shows that lowerwage earners receive higher return on their taxes than higherwage earnerssimilarly when benefits in the first year of retirement are compared to workers final earnings lowerwage earners have larger percentage of their earningsreplaced by benefits this socalled tilt in the program is deliberate and hasexisted since its inception it is one of th social insurance features of the program reflecting the view that social security should provide means through which lowwage workers can sustain at least minimal standard of living in retirementwithout resorting to welfare this report does not debate the merits of the tilt but merely shows that personal account funde d with constant percentage of pay would produce everything else held equal an account that would be strictlyproportional to the level of workers earnings thus personal account intended to substitute for portion of social security or make up for acrosstheboardreductions needed to bring the system into longrange actuarial balance would lessen the tilt currently favoring lowpaid workers this is not to say that personalaccount to which 2 of pay is contributed would in and of itself discriminate amongworkers with different levels of earnings rather the lessening of the tilt would be the natural result of shifting more of th combined benefit to purely proportional systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs58 table 27 projected value of personal accounts as percent of current law social security benefits differences between

65 who steadily contributed to personal accounts beginning in 2002 or later see the appendix for discussion of other assumptions key point here is that an acrosstheboa rd cut in social security benefits when coupled with building personal accounts woul d affect workers with low earnings or truncated work histories more adversely because the accumulations in their personalaccounts would not make up or adjust for as much of cut as it would for averageand highwage earners for example if proposal were designed to achieve 25 general reduction in benefits by 2070 table 27 shows that under the 64 rateof return scenario the reduction would basi cally match the value of the personal account for the average wage earner meaning that these workers would receive acombined benefit approximately equal to be nefits promised under current law the lowwage earner however would receive combined benefit that would be 63lower than under current law and the worker who always earned the maximumtaxable wage would receive combined benefit that would be 18 higher table 28 shows that if personal accounts earning 64 annually were combined with allowing initial benefits to grow only at the rate of inflation by 2070 the reduction in total payments from current law levels would be 221 for lowwageearners compared to 156 for averagewage earners and 48 for maximumwageearners if instead the personal accounts earned 10 annually the combinedbenefits would exceed those afforded by current law rules for wage earners at allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs59 three levels but again the tilt would be

understood however that wh ile these workers would have higher benefits than under current law the value of their lifetime benefits relative to the taxes they paid would have fallen table 29 shows

becomes disabled at young age there would not be enough time for personal account to accumulatemuch value as mentioned earlier this is more likely to be an issue where thecreation of the personal account is coupled w ith general constraint on benefits the annuity from personal account that grows for only 8 years would be worth only 6of an account that grows for 43 years one that grows over 18

yearsthis option would have the largest impact on very young worker with low earnings because the proportional effect of fewer years in the denominator would be largerand the increase in average

purpose of this report is to illustrate the potential impact of various social security reform measures on future bene fit levels although the measures examined are ones commonly proposed to help restore the systems solvency only one isestimated to do so each of the others w ould require to varying degrees additional benefit reductions tax increases or new sour ces of income to bring the system into longrange financial balance therefore the reader is cautioned not to compare the measures based only on the size of the benefit reductions they would produce also in providing illustrations incorporating personal accounts in social security reform plan two alternative fundi ng approaches are used one assumes the accounts would be funded with portion of ex isting social security taxes carve out approach and the other assumes they would be funded by other means an addon approach the report makes judgeme nt as to which would be preferable however it is important to note that while the add on approach would have direct impact on the systems financing by defin ition the carve out approach would worsen it in recognition of this the report assume s that additional benefit constraints would be necessary to avoid or mitigate this effect thus in viewing the illustrations depicting the effects of personal accounts readers should be aware that the outcomes will differ depending on which approach is used to fund the accounts the report makes assumption regarding whether participation in personal accounts would be mandatory or voluntary whether they are mandatory orvoluntary makes difference in the portrayal of the effect on recipients of coupling personal accounts with benefit constraints however whether they are mandatory or voluntary could have an impact on the systems financing particularly under carve out approach system of voluntar accounts could lead to what is known as adverse selection for example if the workers choosing to participate in voluntary personal accounts funded from carve out pproach tended to be mostly highpaid workers the loss of the soci security taxes they otherwise would have paid would outweigh the reductions in social security benefits they would incur this occurs because of the tilt in the be nefit formula that replaces lower proportion of earnings for highpaid workers discussed earlier thus greater burden for financing social security would fall on the workers who choose not to participate in personalaccounts adjustment for this effect is included in the reports carve outillustrations for purposes of showing personal account accumulations the analysis assumes 43year career based on person starting work at age 22 and always earning the average wage until retirement at age 65 th is stylized scenario is often used in analyzing social security benefits for example in the portrayal of replacement rates however such scenario should not be construed to necessarily represent typical worker because of variabilities in unemployment the ages of entry andexit from the work force career earnings patterns etc these variations areparticularly important in calculating the value of personal accounts accumulations additional cautions regarding assumptions made in preparing the report are discussed at length in the appendixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs66 26 for illustrations involving minimum low and maximumwage earners the level of earnings yeartoyear is assumed to grow at the rate of average wages in the economy 27 discounting is used in present value analysis to reflect the value of money over time for example to compute the value of lifetim social security benefits the calculation involves determining the amount of money that w ould have to be invested at given rate of interest at the time of retirement so that the principle and accumulated interest would be just sufficient to fund recipients benefit given his or her probability of survival in eachsubsequent year the discount rate used in this analysis 6399 is the same as that employed in the trustees report intermediate projections for longterm federal securities the reader should recognize that an alternativ discount rate could significantly alter the continuedappendix technical comments on report methods and basic assumptions used to prepare report over the years the congressional research service s developed computer model that does case simulations of personal workers social security benefits computations ofbenefits are based on current law and the underlying economic and demographicprojections used are those contained in th intermediate or best guess assumptions of the latest report of the social security board of trustees the computations can be expressed in current and constant dollars or as percentage of preretirementearnings that social security benefits replace the model can be modified to reflect the features of various reform plans so the effect on present and future recipients be nefits and taxes can be evaluated including the value and effect of personal accounts it also can be modified to show the effect of differences in personal characteristics eg in their relative earnings levels inunderlying economic and demographic assumptions or to reflect alternativeassumptions about how much of future social security benefits can be paid generally given the systems projected financing pr oblems however it is case simulation model and does not do cohort analyses or stochastic modeling crucial measure in comparing the valu of benefits over lifetime is the computation of present values the model does so by constructing streams of benefit payments that accrue at specified rate of interest and include cost of livingadjustments for benefits these streams are adjusted by the probability that aparticular worker will survive to each year these probab ilities are ba sed on the mortality assumptions contained in cohort life tables on which the intermediatedemographic projections are based we use cohort rather than period life tablesbecause they reflect expected improvements in mortality under the intermediate assumptions of the 2001 social security trustees report average wages in the economy and prices as measured by the cpi are assumed to grow ultimately at an annual rate of 43 and 33 respectively 26 for lifetime benefit computations expressed as the pr esent value of benef its at age 65 the probability of survival in each year after retirement is based on the trustees projections of mortality for recipients age cohort and the annual interest rate used for discounting is 639927 the trustees project mortality rates separately for menhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs67 27 continued figures shown in the tables 28 this adjustment is crude proxy for these fees eg for the costs of buying and selling securities marketing and account maintenance index fund investments might have costs of mere fraction of percent whereas actively traded personallydirected accounts mighthave considerable transaction charges pe rhaps most important experience in other countries suggests that the extent to which admi nistrative charges cut into the potential rates of return is heavily dependent on the competition that might exist among investmentcompanies vying for new accounts number of commentators have pointed out thatmarketing expenses have been very costly in some countries that have redesigned their social security systems to include personal investment components eg great britain and chileand women the illustrations shown in th is report are based on unisex mortality assumptions that reflect blending of the trustees separate assumptions for men and women this methodology was chosen larg ely because the proposals illustrated here envision an annuity system that mandates the use of unisex assumptions incomputing annuities in recognition that ge nderbased projections of life expectancy are not permitted in determining the amount of annuities payable under 401k plans etc also because men and women with the same circumstances ie earningshistory age and time of retirement receive the same level of benefits for as long as they live social security implicitly annuitizes on unisex basis to provide illustrations of the effect of the various options and the asset accumulations in personal accounts the analysis assumes 43year work careerbased on person starting work at age 22 and always earning the average wage until retirement at age 65 this stylized scenario is often used in analyzing socialsecurity benefits for example in the portrayal of replacement rates however sucha scenario should not be construed to necessarily represent typical workerbecause of variabilities in unemployment th ages of entry and exit from the work force career earnings etc these variations are particularly important in calculating the value of personal account accumulations another variable with very large impact on personal account values is the investment rate of return for illustrativ purposes the analysis uses two average rateofgrowth or rateofreturn scenarios 6399 rounded to 64 in thediscussion and 10 annually the lower rateofreturn scenario 6399 represents the same longrange rate project ed for the federal securities held by the social security trust funds under the trustees current intermediate assumptionsthese securities consist largely of nonmarketable special issue federal notes and bonds which earn rates of interest equal to that of all federal securities sold andtraded in the financial markets with maturitie s of more than 4 years the higher rate ofreturn scenario 10 represents return equal to the approximate 113average annual rate of growth of the s p 500 market index including dividends over the 74year period 1926 to 1999 minus 13 percentage points per year to reflectadministrative costs and related management fees 28 the use here of these two scenarios is not intended to suggest that ither one represents the most likely future range of returns for individuals or age gments cohorts of society generally the intent is only to show the potential asset accumulations and annuity outcomes fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs68 reasonably wide range of possible investme nt returns given the past performance of market averages as mentioned in the body of the report th two rates of return are expressed in nominal terms throughout the report economists tend to favor expressing ratesof return in socalled real terms ie ad justing them for inflation it is difficult to know the true magnitude or worth of an investment return if expressed in nominal terms because part of the rate might merely reflect inflation and therefore provideno increase in the real value of the asset for example if nominal rate earned onan asset is 5 it would provide increase in the assets real value if the inflation rate is 5 whereas it would if inflation were 2 or 3 to determine realinvestment return nominal rates are re duced by the underlying inflation assumption which under the trustees intermediate forecast is 33 annually hence the realrateofreturn scenarios modeled for this report are 3 annually when referring toa nominal rate of 64 1063991033 103 and 65 annually when referring toa nominal rate of 10 1101033 1065 assessment of public policy and market risks traditional social security versus marketbased personal accounts there has been considerable attention drawn to the question of whether reforming social securityby creating personal savings accounts would subject peoples retirement income togreater risk than modifying the program in traditional ways ie increasing taxes or constraining benefit growth the financial markets particularly the equities market are volatile and if people were to be unluc ky or unwise in their investment choices their retirement incomes could suffer if workers invest in index equity or bond funds that reflect broad market performan ce as is prescribed in number of bills introduced in the past few congresses the risk of investing in poorperformingindividual stocks would be mitigated none theless there still would be substantial variation in the value of personal accounts due to fluctuations in the broad marketover time even over many years the markets can produce varied results forinvestors and consequently produce varying results for different cohorts of retireeswhile one generation might benefit from market rising by 10 per year over theircontribution years another might only expe rience an increase of 5 annually the timing of when they work or invest and retire or draw down their assets can bea critical factor the assumed rates of return used in this analysis do not try to simulate the future ebb and flow of the nations financia l markets they reflect steady growth of assets yearoveryear in the real world the markets can be expected to behave verydifferently they will go up and down and the pattern of investment growth can be erratic even over 10 or 20year periods as result the actual growth of workers personal account could differ markedly from what is shown in this report however to presume that the traditiona l social security system provides guaranteed governmentafforded benefit that is more reliable than marketbasedpersonal retirement account system may overstate the certainty of the traditionalsystems ability to pay the level of benefits it currently promises certainly over ashortrun period ie of 5 or 10 years few would challenge the notion that the financial markets could fluctuate significantly more than the economic variablesaffecting social security benefits thus annuities payable from such accounts couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs69 29 in the past when making changes to benefits congress generally has not reduced them for current recipients the reductions typi cally have been prospective in nature 30 as result of changes in the benefit com putation rules enacted in 1977 to shore up the social security system pl 95216 the rela tive level of initial benefits for full career averagewage earners dropped by 25 from 1981 to 1985 the replacement rate the ratio of the initial benefits to final earnings dropped from 544 for an age65 retiree in 1981 to 409 for similar retiree in 1985 this followed rise of nearly 60 over thepreceding 11year period as result of amendments enacted in 1983 pl 9821 therelative benefit levels for similarlysituated future retirees are scheduled to drop by another 12 or 13 by 2022 the effect of phasing up the age for receipt of full benefits from 65 to 67be far more unpredictable in the short run than ones projected social security benefits and it is also true that under cu rrent benefit rules individuals with the same wage history and retiring at the same age at the same time are treated the same by social security under system of pe rsonal accounts these individuals may receive different benefits however they may not be worse off than under the traditionalsocial security system they might all receive higher personal account annuitiesthan what they would receive from the tr aditional system they could be lower as well but the fact that these different pe ople could receive different benefits under system of personal accounts does not make it riskier than the traditional system the traditional system is not stable benchmar k its promised benefits also could be altered social security benefits are not contractual unlike personal savings accounts and can be reduced by change in the law as was done number of times since1977 and may have to be done again given the trustees current projections of alarge looming deficit 29 conversely buildup of larger than projected trust fund reserves might ultimately lead to pressure on future congresses to authorize larger benefits only to have to pull them back again because of unexpected adverseeconomic or demographic circumstances this happened in the early 1970s social security benefits were increased very significantly from 1967 through 1972 then had to be greatly revised scaled back twice in the following 11 years benefit levels for new retirees swung about 25 in relative value in the late 1970s and early 1980s 30 if congress chooses to address the system s currently projected financing problems with acrosstheboard benefit cuts the tota l reductions could be as large as 27 from the levels projected to prevail in 2038 unde r the current benefit computation rules such is the volatility inherent in largely payasyougo system in the context of assessing the risks i nherent in most of the personal account proposals that have been put forth thus far it should be observed that few rest all or even most of their future benefits on equ ity investments in addition few if any envision truly unregulated investme nts most would employ 401ktype arrangements providing workers with invest ment choices similar to the index fund options of the federal employees thrift savings plan tsp hence the probability that poor market choices or timing will deci mate workers future retirement income is considerably less likely than under hypot hetical social security system modeled after fully selfdirected marketbased defined contribution systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs70 31 for lengthy discussion of annuitization issues see social security privatization and the annuities market cbo february 1998 cbo points out that the costs of annuity policies offered by insurance companies today are 15 to 25 higher than average mortality would suggest but it cautions that the current market is small it states that variety of policyoptions might be considered to avoid the high costs of annuities in privatized systemthose policy options would monitor the regula tion of withdrawals from personal retirement accounts the timing of annuity purchases the regulation of annuities markets and thegenerosity of government minimum benefit guaranteesalso while the equity markets are much more volatile than the economy generally eg changes in gross domestic pr oduct average wages etc are typically less volatile the traditional social secur ity system is strongly influenced by the performance of the economy and its expans ionrecession phases social securitys revenues are contingent on the number of people working and paying taxes as well as the rate of growth of their wages the initial benefits it provides are derived from the wage histories of its covered workers and are adjusted thereafter to rise withinflation in addition other noneconomic factors such as early retirement trendsshifts in immigration and fluctuations in the incidence of disability can greatly vary the systems payout in summary the fluctuations in the financial markets and the commensurate effect this may have on the assets and annuities resulting from personal savings accounts might well be greater than the br oader economic fluctuations affecting the financial flows of the traditional social s ecurity system but other demographic and political factors can affect the noncontract ual benefits of the traditional system in this context this report makes determination of the relative risks for the incomes of future retirees under the various proposals it analyzes many variablescan effect the reliability of each of them making valid assessment that one is riskier than another very difficult it is enough to say that each method of financing involves some element of risk it is left to congressional policymakers to make value judgements as to which risks and what levels of risk are acceptable annuitization of personal accounts the illustrations in this report employ the principles of annuitization to express the value of the projected personalaccount assets in terms of the monthly in flationindexed benefits they would produce over workers retirement years however they are not intended to representpurchased annuities simulating the pr ocess of annuitizing ie spreading or paying out personal account accumulations over the period of persons retirement on scale that encompasses every potential retiree in society is complex andhighly speculative todays annuity market is relatively small and expensiveannuitizing on large societal basis could re sult in either large or small charges by the annuity providers depending on the potential costs of administration whichpossibly could be minimized through tight regulation and limiting marketingpractices but more importantly on the risk the providers envision ofunderestimating annuitants longevity 31 on the other hand the current rules pertaining to drawing down individual retirement accounts iras used by many re tirees who wish to avoid annuitizing and the costs thereof might serve as proxy retirees might also avoid these costs by employing personalized method of drawing down their accounts involvinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31086crs71 32 thrift savings plan highlights may 2001 33 the board reports that record keeping and

incurred by its fund over the preceding 10 yearseither an accelerated or delayed liquidati on of the assets although there would be other factors affecting retirees choice to annuitize if the public were to perceive annuitization as expensive more people could be expected to draw down their retirement assets on their own if annuities were viewed as having modest coststhen more people could be expected to purchase them if the creation of personal accounts and th eir eventual annuitization were to be mandatory both the large size of the population involved and the fact thatannuitization would be mandatory could grea tly lessen the potential costs from those incurred in todays annuity policies partic ularly if annuitization were administered through single insurer or under rules precluding insurers as group fromdiscriminating on the basis of probable life expectancies however there are many unknowns notable among them being how i nflationadjusted annuities would be priced how administrative costs might ffect the assumed rates of return on personal accounts there are widely varying views about how much administrative expenses would reduce the returns on investments that workers wouldrealize under proposals to create personal accounts some suggest thatadministrative costs would be minor offs et while other suggest they would be so large that they would defeat the purposes of establishing the accounts these general assertions however tend to oversimplif the debate there are many types of personal account proposals with wide range of designs that could greatly vary howmuch administrative expenses would erode their potential returns many of the social security reform plan s that have been proposed envision the creation of process similar to the fede ral employees thrift savings plan tsp under which the treasury department would serve as the collective receiver ofcontributions for subsequent investment in individuallyselected broadbased equity or bond funds perhaps administered by one or more nongovernmental financialinstitutions some 25 million federal employees participated in the tsp in march2001 32 the federal retirement thrift investment board which oversees and is responsible for the tsp reports very m odest administrative expenses for operation of the tsp33 however institution has had experience handling the volume of records and transactions that would arise from payroll contributions from aparticipant population of 155 million or more as result many administrativeissues and potential costs would likely aris with personal

likely to change as result of mergers acquisitions business failures or growth of companies than largercap continuedhandle would raise the relative magnitude of administrative costs compared say to the experience of large mutual fund companies today they often incur administrative expenses of fracti on of percent of their assets34 however they routinely require minimum initial deposits of 1000 or 2500 and minimumsubsequent deposits of 100 or more 35 these conditions can greatly hold down transaction activity high volume of sm all dollar deposits and account balances as could be expected to arise from re gular payroll deductions might significantly raise the percent of fund assets that administrative costs consume these are sometimes referred to as expense ratios the effect on employers might be significant as well particularly in dealing with investment education of their employees misreporting of contributionsmisreporting of account numbers failure to withhold under and

the report shows turnover rate of 6 for the vanguard 500 index fund in 1999 37 for instance the fidelity magellan fund imposes 12 annual maintenance fee on accounts with balances under 2500 it also requires load on new deposits of 3 but the load may be lower on accounts with balances in excess of 250000 similarly thevanguard group of index funds imposes 10 annual maintenance fee on accounts withbalances under 10000 these types of requirements do not exist in the federal tsp 38 study done for the department of labor showed significantly lower mutual fund expense ratios for institutional

the trustees longrange investment yield used in this report represents an assumption about the return on outstanding federal securities broaderbased bond investmentstrategy would include corporate bonds and po ssibly those of other nations with higher yields hence more generalized bondinvest ment scenario would be expected to yield continuedexperience of the federal tsp with respect to its

or the like would not occur 37 third while unforeseen administrative issues and accompanying costs could arise because of the largemagnitude of accounts and transaction activity personal account system wouldcreate there also would likely be significant economies of scale 38 in summary there is definitive basis to assess the relative magnitude of the costs of administering personal accounts the highyield scenario illustrated in thisreport reflecting 10 annual growth rate incorporates an arbitrary adjustment for trading and other administrative fees the average annual 113 return of the sp

cashelleffect of new personal accounts on other savings if new personal savings accounts were mandated or promoted as part of social security reform plan people might be expected to make different decisions about their othersavings for instance they might save less in existing 401k accounts or iras adjustment for these possible effects is made in this report this does not represent conclusion that the effect on other savings of creating new personal account system is likely to be negligible or unlikely to occur itmerely reflects uncertainty about what the effect would be the effect on othersavings poses significant question about whether and to what extent socialsecurity reform plan would effectively in crease workers eventual retirement assets and as well whether society as whole would save more while some reduction in other savings might be expected from introducing new form of personal accountsystem as part of social security it would be highly speculative to generalize orsuggest what the reduction in other sa vings might be much depends on the incentive effects of other tax preferences and workers propensity to save andconsume to the extent the favorable income tax treatment afforded under current tax law to other forms of savings iras 401ks employersponsored privatepensions and the like is continued the incentives to particip ate in these other arrangements would continue similarly to the extent such accounts are fundedfrom governmental funds eg out of surplus federal tax receipts or the like andrequire new contributions from particip ants the dissavings effects of creating new accounts should be lessened nonetheless regardless of how these newaccounts were to be funded or treated under the income tax code to the extentpersons feel that they have larger nest egg than they might otherwise have they may be inclined to borrow or spend more of their discretionary income and by so doing they would alter their net savings and as group the overall level of savings achieved in the economy 40
