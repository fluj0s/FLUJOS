dilution act of 1995 ftda amended section 43 of the trademark act of 1946 to provide new federal cause of action for the dilution of famous distinctive marks trademark dilution is statutorily defined in 15 usc 1127 to mean the lessening of the capacity of famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services regard less of the presence or absence of 1 competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties or 2 likelihood of confus ion take or d eception under the ftda the owner of famous mark may seek an injunction agai nst another persons commercial use of mark or trade name if such use begins af ter the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark since the ftda was enacted however some trademark owners have sought to use the law in ways that arguably go beyond the statutes sc ope and purpose eg owners of insufficiently famous marks ttempting to sustain ftda action or others trying to apply the ftda to prohibit parody and criticism of their marks in adjudicating these expansive claims several federal courts have narrowly interpreted the ftda notably the united stat supreme court in the 2003 case moseley v v secret catalogue inc and protection against trademark dilution is said to be challenging if not impossible to obtain according to many intellectual property scholars there is split among the regional federal circuit courts of appeal over the meaning and application of several central ftda elements for example one federal circuit court has determined that the federal antidilution law does not apply to descriptive marks that have acquired distinctiveness over time including famous ones such as mcdonalds or kraft because they lack inherent distinctiveness the trademark dilution revision act of 2006 hr 683 is legislative response to these issues offering more pr ecise definitions for key terms in the ftda such as famous distinctive blurri ng and tarnishment and expressly clarifying standards of pr oof and other eligibility requi rements to obtain relief under the ftda critics of hr 683 however raise concerns that the bill too heavily favors major corporations ove r small and future businesse s in addition they worry that the bill could negatively affect fr ee speech rights small business commercial speech and consumer interests finally they believe that the bill amends federal trademark law in manner th at essentially confers to major corporations monopoly over the use of famous marks that may contain common words and phrases hr 683 was passed by the house on vote of 411 to 8 on april 19 2005 the senate passed hr 683 with an amendment in the nature of substitute by unanimous consent on march 8 2006 among other things the amendment added noncommercial use liability exclusion to protect free speech interests and addressed concerns raised by internet service providers over secondary liability for trademark dilution by their end users on september 25 2006 the house by

overrule judicial interpretations of the ftda that congress considered to be inconsistent with the original gislative intent in enacting the ftda in 19964 background intellectual property ip law has three major branches applicable to different types of subject matter copyright original artistic and literary works of authorship patent inventions of pro cesses machines manufactures and compositions of matter that are useful new and nonobvious and trademark commercia l symbols unlike the other two disciplines the constitutional basis for federal trademark law is not the ip clause of the us constituti on but rather the commerce clause5 another uniquehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33393crs2 5 continued us c onst art i 8 cl 8 the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries in the trademark cases 100 us 82 9394 1879 the us supreme cour t held the first federal trademark act to be unconstitutional since it was enacted pursuan t to the ip clause any attempt to identify the essential characteristics of trade mark with inventions and discoveries in the arts and sciences or with the writings of authors will show that the effort is surrounded with insurmountable difficulties subse quent federal trademark laws avoided this problem because they were adopted pursuant to congresss power to regulate interstate commerce foreign commerce and commerce with the indian tribes 6 15 usc 1127 technically the term mark includes both trademark referring to product and service mark used to identify service provided by company throughout this report the terms mark and trademark may be used interchangeably however when the term trademark is used it may be assumed that the author is also referring to service marks judges legislators and scholars have widely accepted and adopted this terminology convention 7 throughout this report trademark names will appear in all upper case letters thus following the practice used in legal doc uments concerning trademark issues 8 151 c ong rec h2123 daily ed april 19 2005 statement of rep lamar smith 9 pl 79489 60 stat 427 as amended codified in 15 u s c 1051 et seq the act is continuedfeature of trademark law is that trademark rights may arise from federal as well as state law the coexistence of this dual system of law is not characteristic of the other ip fields although this report focuses on federal trademark law it is important to keep in mind that state common law is another source of legal protection for trademark owners trademark is any word name sy mbol or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by manufacturer or merchant 1 to indicate the source of his or her g oods or services and 2 to identify and distinguish the goods or services from those offered by others6 for example when consumer walks into shoe store and sees an athletic shoe with swoosh logo on the side of it the mark informs the consumer that the pr oduct has been manufactured by nike7 and carries with it certain quality or re putation that the public associ ates with particular shoe company as the sponsor of hr 683 has explained trademarks give customers assurance that the goods or services they are buying are what customers think they are if customer has purchased items in the past from particular company that bears specific mark or logo the customer has an impression favorable or not of that company and the goods or services it produces so trademark law empowers consumers by giving them information that is often critical to their purchasing decisions8 the lanham act the principal federal statute governing trademarks is the trademark act of 1946 conventionally known as the lanham act9 this statute has been amended morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33393crs3 9 continued named after congressman fritz lanham who ch aired the us house of

efforts by trademark owners seeking greater prot ection for their marks new technological developments such as the internet and us treaty obligations mandating uniformity of us intellectual property law with that of other countries10 under the lanham act merchant or manufacturer that wa nts to use mark on product or service must register that mark with the us patent and trademark office pto to obtain federal protection for the ma rk failure to register mark with the pto does not mean that the entity using the mark has not established rights in it once the mark is first used in commerce good bearing the mark is sold to the public in bona fide transaction state common law confers trademark protection to the mark11 however the lanham act provides substantial benefits and incentives to thetrademark owner to seek federal re gistration including the following 12 nationwide constructive notice to th public of the ownership of the mark prima facie evidence of the validity of the mark the registrantsownership of the mark and the regist rants exclusive right to use the mark in interstate commerce the ability to bring legal action concerning the mark in federalcourt the use of the us registration as basis to obtain registration in foreign countries and the ability to file the us registration with the us customs serviceto prevent importation of infringing foreign goods distinctiveness and the degree of trademark protection mark may be federally registered with the pto only if it meets certain requirements the mark must be used in commerce 13 or the person must have good faith bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce14 however not all marks that are used in such manner will qualify for trademark protec tion eligibility for registration and the degree of trademark protection accorded to the mark depend largely on the markshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33393crs4 15 in addition to denying registration for mark s that lack distinctiveness the lanham act states that mark shall not be registered if it is confusingly similar to another registered mark is immoral deceptive or scandalous matter or disparages or falsely suggests connection with persons living or dead institu tions beliefs or national symbols or brings them into contempt or disr epute 15 usc 1052 1053 16 schechter thomas supra note 10 at 27 17 the most commonly cited judicial opinion that explains the four categories of distinctiveness is abercrombie fitch c v hunting world inc 537 f2d 4 2d cir 1976 as that opinion xplained these categories exist along continuum or spectrum of distinctiveness althoughthe lines of demarcation are not always bright id at 9 18 15 usc 1052e 19 15 usc 1052f the statutory language does not use the term secondary meaning but rather states that descriptive mark may be registered if it has become distinctive continueddistinctiveness15 the requirement of distinctiveness is an important safeguard against certain generic or descriptive rms from being monopolized by one merchant to the exclusion of others that might need to use the terms to sell competing products16 pto trademark examiners and courts often refer to the following four categories of wordbased marks whic h correspond to the level of trademark protection that will be accorded listed in descending order of distinctiveness17 fanciful and arbitrary terms these marks are considered inherently distinctive and thus serving of the br oadest level of protection under trademark law an example of fanciful term is kodak or verizon these are madeup words not drawn from regular language an arbitrary term is one that has necessary connection to the product being sold to which it is associated eg apple in reference to computer suggestive terms these marks may also be considered inherently distinctive and entitled to high level of trademark protection because they require some imagination and contemplation to determine the nature of the product that is labeled with the mark eg coppertone for suntan lotion or 7eleven for the convenience store that originally us ed to be open from 7 am to 11 pm although most of the stor now operate 24 hours day descriptive words geographic terms and personal names these marks are not inherently di stinctive and generally cannot be registered at least not immediately upon first use18 descriptive words directly inform the consumer of characteristic quality ingredient or function of product eg ice cold beer or best sleep mattresses similarly geographic names california wine and personal names joes diner usually cannot be registered however an important exception to this general rule is that descriptiv word geographic term or name can be registered if it has ac quired secondary meaning19 such termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33393crs5 19 continued courts frequently refer to acquired dis tinctiveness as secondary meaning see eg two pesos v taco cabana 505 us 763 769 1992 20 inwood labs v ives labs 456 us 844 851 n11 1982 21 schechter thomas supra note 10 at 273 22 see eg cal bus prof code 14320 2006can become distinctive over time if substantial part of the public has come to regard the word as si gnifying single and unique source of the product rather than the product itself20 examples of terms that have acquired distinctiv eness include mcdonalds ben and jerrys and park n fly generic terms these words represent the basic name of the category of the product or service be ing offered for sale rather than an indication of its source ge neric terms cannot be protected as trademarks the words milk car bread are examples of this leastdistinctive category these terms are inherently incapable of being distinctive in addition so fanciful terms that were once distinctive can lose their distinctive quality and become generic through phenomenon sometimes re ferred to as genericide genericide occurs when once va lid mark is so commonly used in everyday language that it longer serves to identify particular company but rather becomes synonymous with the entire class of products21 examples of marks that have been casualties of genericide include thermos aspirin kleenex bandaid and cellophane trademark infringement and likelihood of confusion assuming mark satisfies the require ments discussed above for trademark protection the merchant who first uses that mark generally has the exclusive right to use it in certain ways the trademark ow ner may have severa l causes of action to prevent unauthorized uses of the mark ca lled infringement if the mark is not federally registered the owner can seek legal remedy for trademark infringement under state law asserting that the other partys use of c opy reproduction imitation or counterfeit of the mark is likely to cause confusion mistake or deception as to the source of origin of the goods or services22 federal trademark registration however entitles the owner of the mark to pursue two independent causes of action for infringement under the following sections of the lanham act section 32 any person who shall without the consent of the registrant use in commerce an reproduction count erfeit copy or colorable imitation of register ed mark in connection with the sale offering for sale distributi on or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to

concerning trademark infringement and litigant in trademark infringement case w ill often assert all of these claims s chechter thomas supra note 10 at 29 26 see eg rodeo collection ltd v west seventh 812 f2d 1215 1217 9th cir 1987 explaining that likelihood of confusion requires that conf usion be probable not simply possibility 27 15 usc 1116 28 15 usc 1117a permitting recovery of th infringers profits plaintiffs damages and litigation costs and attorney feesconfusion or to cause mistake or to deceive shall be liable in civil action by the registrant23 section 43 any person who on or in connection with any goods or services or any container for goods uses in commerce any word term name symbol or device or any combination thereof or any false designation of origin false or misleading description of fact or false or misleading representation of fact which is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive as to the affiliation connection or association of such person with another person or as to the origin sponsorship or appr oval of his or her goods services or commercial activities by another person shall be liable in civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act24 careful scrutiny of the statutory langua ge of these two provisions reveals that while section 32 claims are reserved exclusiv ely for owners of registered trademarks section 43 claims could be brought by ow ners of both registered and unregistered marks in addition while both causes of action are aimed at preventing unauthorized uses of marks that are deceptive and misleading to consumers section 43 prohibits broader range of practices including fals designations of origin or sponsorship25 in an action under either section the touc hstone of trademark infringement is the standard of likelihood of c onfusion which means that the plaintiff need not show that actual confusion has occurred but rath er that consumer confusion as to the source of the goods is probable 26 the usual remedy for trademark infringement is injunctive relief27 although monetary relie f is also available28 trademark dilution the us supreme court has described the dual purposes of trademark law as follows trademark law by preventing others from copying sourceidentifying mark reduces the customers costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions

at the same time the law helps assure producer that it and not an imitatin g competitor will reap the financial reputationrelated rewards associated with desirable product the law thereby encourages the production of quality products and simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on consumers inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale29 in contrast with traditional trademark law which aims to prevent deception and consumer confusion is relatively recent cause of action called trademark dilution dilution is statutorily defined in 15 us c 1127 to mean the lessening of the capacity of famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services regardless of the presence or absence of 1 co mpetition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties or 2 likelihood of confusion mistake or deception for example strong distinctive famous trademark such as kodak could be diluted if an unauthorized party marketed an unrelated and noncompeting product such as kodak mayonnaise even though consumer may not likely be confused by the mark the concern of dilution law is that the distinctiveness effectiveness and advertising value of the famous mark ma be eroded and watered down by such usage over time potentially affecting consumer perceptions of the company and its reputation dilution law thus seeks to pr eserve the uniqueness and strength of famous mark the concept of trademark dilution traces its origin to law review article written in 192730 and has been adopted as cause of action by many state jurisdictions although the state laws vary in nature and ex tent of protection dilution can occur in two ways dilution by blurring is the most common dilution claim blurring occurs when the famous marks ability to identify its product has been impaired due to an associ ation in the minds of consumers arising from similarity between another mark and the famous mark for example famous mark such as exxon is uniformly and near ly automatically associated with the energy and petrochemical company however the name national may evoke several different mental associations such as national semiconductor national city bank or national geographic dilution by tarnishment is the second form of dilution tarnishment occurs when the reputation of famous mark s been harmed by negative associations arising from the similarity between another mark and the famous mark situations in which tarnishment could result are when famous trademark is linked to products of shoddy quality or is portrayed in an unwholesome or unsavory context with the result that the public will associate the lack of quality or lack of prestige in the defendants goods with the plaintiffs unrelated goods31

legislative history the ftda does not preempt state antidilution laws see hr ept 104374 at 4 it is important to note that hr 1295 would not preempt existing state dilution statutes state laws could continue to be applied in cases involving locally famous or distinctive marks unlike patent and copyright laws federal trademark law presently coexists with state trademark w and it is to be expected that federal dilution statute should similarly coexist with state dilution law citation omitted 36 15 usc 1125c1 however an injunction for dilution may be considerably broader than one for trademark infringement trad emark injunction is usually limited to uses within one industry or several related industries dilution law is the antithesis of trademark law in this respect because it seeks to protec t the mark from association in the publics mind with wholly unrelated goods and services th more remote the good or service associated with the junior use the more likely it is to cause dilution rather than trademark infringement dilution injunction by contrast to trademark injunction will generally sweep across broad vistas of the economy mattel inc v mca records 296 f3d 894 90405 9th cir 2002traditional trademark infringement an action for dilution does not require showing of likelihood of c onsumer confusion32 federal trademark dilution act to bring nationwide uniformity and consistency to the protection of famous marks from dilution and to meet the unite d states international obligations under the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips33 congress in december 1995 passed the fe deral trademark dilution act of 1995 ftda34 amending section 43 of the lanham act to create the first federal cause of action for trademark dilution35 the ftda entitles the owner of famous mark to seek injunctive relief from court against another persons commercial use in commerce of mark or trade name if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark36 although an injunction is the usual remedy for viol ation of the ftda monetary relief and destruction of the infringing articles are also available if the infringer willfullyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33393crs9 37 15 usc 1125c2 these remedies are s ubject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity 38 see hr ept 104374 at 7 noting that section 43c 1 provides protection to famous marks whether or not the mark is the subject of federal trademark registration however it is hard to imagine situation where the owner of truly famous mark would not take the relatively simple step of securi ng federal trademark registration and the failure to register should raise at least yellow flag with court attempting to determine if the mark is truly famous s chechter thomas supra note 10 at 302 39 tcpip holding co v haar communs 244 f3d 88 95 fed cir 2001 40 the legislative history of the ftda explains that these forms of

intended to trade on the owners reputati on or to cause dilution of the famous mark37 by its terms the scope of protection under the ftda is reserved only for owners of prominent renow ned marks of significant fame the famous mark need not be federally registered to qualify for dilution protection38 in addition the court of appeals for the federal circuit has obs erved that unlike traditional trademark law which serves the interests of consumers as well as llers in having trademarks function as sourceidentifiers dilution w offers benefit to the consumer public only to the trademark owner39 in other words traditional trademark infringement law prevents consumers fro m being misled and purchasing product that is not what they expected it also ensures that the owner of the trademark is not deprived of sale dilution law is desi gned to preserve the capacity of famous mark to identify and distinguish the goods or services to which it is attached to address first amendment concerns ra ised

clothing and accessories the us court of appeals for the second circuit held th at the ftda does not protect descriptive marks since they possess inherent distinctive quality42 although the appellate court agreed that the childrens place has acquired secondary meaning43 the court stated that the marks deficiency in inherent distinctiveness is not compensated by the fact that the mark has ach ieved significant degree of consumer recognition44 the impact of this ruling is significant famous marks that have acquired distinctiveness such as mcdonalds american airlines and disney might be deemed ineligible for the protections of the ftda if case arose concerning these trademarks within the second circuit other appellate circuits have not adopted this interpretation of the ftda defining the noncommercial use defense in 1997 danish band called aqua released song called barbie girl which became commercial success the song contains lyrics th at poke fun at the iconic barbie doll

trademark by both blurring and by tarnishment45 while the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit found that barbie qualified for relief under the ftda as famous and distinctive mark and that the songs use of the mark is dilutive the appellate court ruled that the ftdas statutory exemption for noncommercial use of mark shields mca from liability because the song contains artistic expression46 despite the song being offered for sale to the public the use of the barbie mark fell within th noncommercial use exemption because the song also mpoons the barbie image and comments humorously on the

requirement of both fame and distinctiveness the ftda lists several factors that are intended to guide court in deciding whether mark is distinctive and famous49 in interpreting this statutory language the us court of appeals for the third circuit rejected the argument that the ftda requires mark to be subjected to test for fame and separate test for distinctiveness to qualify for federal dilution protection50 cited scholar on trademar k law j thomas mccarthy agreed with the appellate court in the authors view there is in 15 usc 1125cl separate statutory requirement of distinctiveness apart fro m finding that the designation be mark that is famous distinctiveness is used here only as synonym for fame even if distinctiveness is regarded as separate requirement it would in the authors view be redundant to be mark eligible in the first place for protection under 1125cl ba sic trademark principles dictate that designation has to be distinctive ither inherently or through acquisition of secondary meaning51 the us court of appeals for the sec ond circuit however reached different conclusion about the ftda we think the inclusion of the requirement of distinctiveness was intended for good reason to deny the protection of the statute to nondistinctive marks52 the court continued man famous marks are of the common or qualityclaiming or prominenceclaiming type such as american national federal federated first united acme merit or ace it seems most unlikely that the statute c ontemplates allowing the hol ders of such common albeit famous marks to exclude all new

store named victors little secret in elizabethtown kentucky this store sold lingerie adult toys and videos and gag gifts the corporation that owned the victorias secret trademark used on more than 750 vi ctorias secret stores and millions of catalogs selling womens lingerie sued the defendants for federal dilution of its famous trademark among other claims th court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed the dilution injunction against th use of the famous trademark stating this is classic instance of dilution by tarnishing associating the victorias secret name with sex toys and lewd coffee mugs and by blurring linking the chain with single unauthorized establishment58 however in 2003 the us supreme court in moseley v v secret catalogue reversed the summary judgment on the dilu tion claim the courts opinion approved of the fourth circuits reading of the ftda in ringling brothers reasoning that since the statute only grants relief against the commercial use of mark that causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the famous mark the ftda unambiguously requires showing of actual dilution ra ther than likelihood of dilution59 the victorias secret trademark owner failed to satisfy this standard to obtain relief under the ftda as the court noted th at there is complete absence of evidence in the record of any lessening of the capacity of the

observers as creating an undue burden for owners of famous trademarks to obtain injunctive relief61 critics argue that by the time measurable provable damage has been done the remedy which is injunctive relief is far less effective62 in the aftermath of v secret many courts have rejected dilution claims yet other legal commentat ors have praised the v secret decision for narrowly construing the ftda asserting that this outcome offers greater freedom for small business commercial speech persons like victor moseley need little breathing space when they named their businesses or products mere likeli hood of dilution under the ftda devoid of requirement of proof of ac tual dilution and damage gave inadequate breathing space because the decision about what was likely to dilute lay too much on the predilection of judges judges who might not have any particular expertise in predicting likeliness of d ilution this arguably placed an unfair burden on judges who generally do not lik to make empirical decisions about the way the world works their special expertise of course lies in applying laws to established facts not in speculating on future occurrences63 other defenders of the actual dilution standard believe it advances the public interest in trademark law64 an actual dilution standard also helps address one concern of the ringling brothers appellate court that

substitute by unanimous consent on march 8 200671 the most prominent difference between the house and sena tepassed versions of hr 683 is that the house bill would remove noncommercia l use of mark as one of the affirmative defenses to dilution claim brought under the ftda the senate bill retains this exempti on if this defense is removed from existing law it may affect the outcome of cases that resemble the factual circumstances of the barbie girl decision and possibly raise questions re garding the ftdas preservation of free speech rights however it could be argued that these first amendment concerns are adequately addressed by the fair use defense for parodying criticizing or commenting on the famous mark owner or th goods or services of the mark owner which is provided in both versions of the bill72 the senates amendment to the bill keeps the noncommercial use exemption as separate defense from the fair use defense perhaps suggesting that there may be substantive difference between them73 critics of the housepassed bill have argued in trademark litigation consumers who have criticized businesses or artists who make reference to trademarks in their works can escape the

this facilitation exemption was apparently added to address concerns raised by internet search engines and internet service providers over secondary liability for trademark dilution by their end users finally the senatepassed ve rsion of hr 683 includes new section that shifts the burden of proof in civil action for dilution involving an unregistered trade dress76 under this new provision the pers

provisions of the ftda the legislation more precisely fines statutory elements of the ftda such as famous distinctive blurring and tarnishment and expressly clarifies the standard of harm and other eligibility requirements for bringing dilution claim these changes should permit owners of fa mous distinctive trademarks to more easily obtain injunctive relief against acts of dilution before they
