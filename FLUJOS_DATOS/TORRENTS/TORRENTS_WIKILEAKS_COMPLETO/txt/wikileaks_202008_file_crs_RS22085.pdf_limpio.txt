reduction in available water supplies from the river due particularly to mexicos inability to fully meet its water delivery obligations under the 1944 treaty beginning in 1992 mexico claime d that extraordinary drought prevented it from making its annual treaty payments of at least 350000 af of water by 1995 northern mexico was reportedly so waterdepleted that it declared five northern states disaster area and requested water loan from the rio grande water reserves of the united states after much negotiation the ibwc issued minute 293 which provided us loan of 81000 af of water to help

water year the ibwc issued minute 307 in march 2001 which required mexico to repay 600000 af by july 31 2001 with an extension through september 20018 this 600000 af was to come from mexicos 5050 water the uss onethird share of mexicos six meas ured tributaries and an additional release from reservoir on mexicos rio saldo mexico reportedly repaid only 348000 af by the september deadline imposed by minute 3079 mexican officials attributed its noncompliance to local and internal political conflict par ticularly with the state of chihuahua10 and the drought lawsuits filed by mexican farmers in august 2001 over the use of mexicos 5050 water further complicated the matter by postponing potential mexican deliveries11 these legal issues were fina lly resolved by february of 2002

fiveyear cycle could be deferred until the end of the next fiveyear cycle 200715 the united states on the other hand ar gues that minute 234 requires that the water debt incurred during the 19972002 fivey ear cycle be made up concurrently with the previous 19921997 water debt the matte r was left unresolved at the end of 2002 nonetheless negotiations tinued and mexico started to deliver more

cooperatively on drought management strategies for the rio grande basin it is unc lear how this agreement may affect the potential nafta claim or other matters possibly still in dispute such as the application of minute 234 impacts on the border while number of factors have contribu ted to water shortages along the border many observers say that mexicos inability to fulfill its water obligations under the treaty had severe consequences for south texas limited water deliveries reportedly forced some farmers in the rio grande valley to forego watering or to plant lowreturn dryland row crops in order to preserve irrigation wa ter for highreturn crops that require more water22 according to some sources irrigated acreage in the rio grande valley decreased by about 29 or 103210 acr since 199223 some studies indicate that an af of irrigation water is worth an average of 652 to the areas economy and estimate that mexicos failure to repay its water debt cau sed over 1 billion in economic losses to south texas24 the flowing fresh water of the rio grande is also critical resource to the rivers ecosystem including more than 450 native species some of which are endangered congressional response congress has responded to the growing water crisis in the rio grande valley in number of ways in 2000 congress passed the lower rio grande valley water resources conservation and improvement act pl 106576 to improve basic waterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22085crs6 25 types of projects may include the construction of pipelines the development of more advanced water control facilities and the lin ing of canals some research indicates that modernizing the valleys antiquated irrigation system could incr ease efficiency by reducing the estimated 25 percent of water lost to eva poration and poor

are concerned with what they perceive are i nherent limitations in its application some stakeholders argue that the tr eaty should be modified to re flect current realities in the border region such as increases in urbani zation and industrializa tion prolonged periods of drought and environmental issues26 there also appears to be wide agreement that the term extraordinary drought needs to be clearly defined it has been suggested that the clarification of this term should be incor porated into prospective longterm drought management strategy that c onsiders among other things the environment groundwater reprioritizing water allocations and contingency repayment plans27 many have also stated that the structure and role of the ibwc role traditionally rooted in the protection of national sovereign interest sshould be reevaluated to re flect the growing need for cooperation and assign stronger co mmitment to forming policy on the rivers sustainable development28 some of these concerns seem to have been addressed by the most recent agreement reached by the two c ountries and could be the subject of future minutes still some claim that this ag reement may not have done enough and that minutes often go unobserved29
