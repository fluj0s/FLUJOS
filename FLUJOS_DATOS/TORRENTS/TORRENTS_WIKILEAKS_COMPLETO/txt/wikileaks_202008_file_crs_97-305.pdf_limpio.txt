detrimental eﬀect to national security this view became more pronounced in the wake of the soviet unions breakup and collapse of the warsaw pact military threat while most analysts agreed that the

states has experienced difficulty in closing military bases to match the requirements of downsized forces with changed composition during the decade of the 1980s major military base closures were seriously hampered by procedural requirements established by congress to the point that none occurred the mismatch between real estate assets and defense requirements grew with the military downsizing that began late in the reagan administration and continued under presidents george h w bush and clinton after several legislative efforts to break the deadlock had failed congress established new base closure proce dure in pl 100526 enacted october 24 1988 the statute provided for bipartisan commission appointed by the secretary of defense to make recommenda tions to congress on closures and realignments to be voted down or accepted as whole the process was successfully implemented but produced complaints of partisanship in selecting bases for closure pl 101510 enacted november 5 1990 provided new au thority for additional base closure recommendations by series of presidentially appointed commissions with the advice and consent of the senate comm only called base rea lignment and closure brac commissions these commissions were to operate in 1991 1993 and 1995 after which the authority of the fi nal base closure commission would end the four commissions recommended clos ure of 98 major bases and hundreds of smaller installations and the realignment of many other bases and facilities these recommendations were estimate d to be implemented and completed by the year 2001 the department of defens at one time estimated savi ngs of about 57 billion over 20 years at the community level in turn imple mentation of the base closure process commenced congress has amended the base closure legislation several times to protect and assist communities as they ad just to the social and economic stress caused by the loss of military installations many but by means all communities appeared to be succeeding in local efforts to replace defense jobs and find new uses for former military lands and buildings after expiration of the authorizing legi slation number of influential leaders recommended establishment of new commissi on and the closure of additional bases and facilities these advocates include d the chairman of the 1995 commission alan dixon former defense secret ary william perry and joint chiefs of staff chairman john shalikashvili in congress many felt that infrastructure co sts diverted money from modernization and sapped the readine ss of americas armed forces against these pressures to cut military real estate further was caution concerning further military cuts as well as the traditional reluctance of senators and representatives to lose federal jobs and disrupt communities in their state or district subsequently new authorizing legisl ation by the congress was required to reconstitute base closure and realignment through the commission

1990s to balance the budget this effort had been supported by broad consen that among the approximately 3800 military bases 1990 est in the united st ates many could be closed without significant detrimental effect to national security this view became more pronounced in the wake of the soviet ions breakup and collapse of the warsaw pact military threat while most analysts agreed that the department of defenses dods base structure was larger than n ecessary to meet the departments needs there were differences concerning which if any additional bases should be closed at what speed and what criteria should be used for making those decisions significantly the impact of specific base closing would be keenly felt in one members state or district but benefits in terms of savings could be spread widely among all citizens and taxpayers in combination these two factors 1 the narrowly felt pain from an individual base closing and 2 the widely diffused benefits from closing many bases to save taxpayer funds produced strong incentives for coalitions of members of congress to bargain in the legislative process to protect many bases from closure2 statutory provision enacted by cong ress in 1977 10 usc 2687 required procedures which made closin g base very difficult nd major bases were closed between 1977 and 199 1 during the late 1980s several bills were introduced in congress to relax the statutory restrictions the first proposal that actually broke the deadlock was the elaborate scheme prescribed by the defense authorization amendments and base closure and r ealignment

independent commission and fast track noamendment vote proved so successf ul that later statute the defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 title xxix of pl 101510 104 stat 1485 at 1808 created three subsequent co mmissions this occurred notwithstanding the arguments of some members against th legislation on grounds that base closings were in fact occurring without the legi slation and that the legislation was an abdication of congressional responsibilities under the constitution to the executive branch3 major reason for the complex proce dures in the 1988 and 1990 statutes was the congressional concern that dod might cl ose or not close bases for political reasons in the past highlevel repres entatives of the defense department in soliciting congressional support for favored programs reportedly might imply that if member of congress voted against the program base might be closed in the members district for example representative richard k armey stated the fact is unfortunate as it is that hist orically base closings have been used as point of leverage by administ rations republican and democratic administrations as political leverage over and above members of congress to encourage them to vote in manner that the administration would like4 the 1977 measure pl 9592 provided safeguard against arbitrary closure it required the secretary of defense to submit request for closure or realignment as part of the annual appropr iations request the request was to be accompanied by evaluations of the fiscal local economic budgetary environmental strategic and operational consequences of closure or r ealignment to whatever extent concerns about politically biased closures were wellfounded it was clear that workable legislative remedy must be insulated from political considerations thus the 1988 and 1990 statutes provided for the creation of bipartisan commissions and set forth complicated procedures to insulate r ealignment and closure recommendations from politics including recommendations based on specified criteria with adequate justification avoid potentia l votetrading that could undermine chances for change and also accomplish the legislations s ubstantive goal of saving funds among other things the 1990 version of the law provided for three successive eightmember commissions that woul d operate in 1991 1993 and 1995 with all eight members of each commission appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate5 the president was also given authority tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs3 5 continued

rl32216 military base closures implementing the 2005 round by david lockwood 6 the brac acronym refers equally to two different word orderings base closure and realignment commission and base realignment and closure commissiondesignate each commissions chairman when selecting the commission members the statute stated that the president should consult with the speaker of the house of representatives concerning the appointme nt of two members the majority leader of the senate concerning the appointment of two members and each of the minority leaders of the house of representatives and the senate respectively concerning the appointment of one member fo r total of six consultations this framework did not explicitly require that the commission be composed of equal numbers of democrats and republicans the statutes and the base closure and realignment brac6 commissions succeeded in effecting the selective closur of many military ba ses and the reduction of military infrastructure the process was instrumental in forcing this outcome since once set in motion closure recommenda tions were very difficult to stop this impetus resulted from the fact that overall dollar savings from the package outweighed the pain associated with an individual installation closure or downsizing specifically under the 1990 brac legisla tion congressional review and action took place after an extended and multitiere d review and recommendation process dod was required to submit its recommenda tions to the commission which in turn was required to submit its own report and recommendations which could differ from dods recommendations to the president after the commission received dods recommendations the gene ral accounting office gao now the government accountability office was required to tr ansmit report to congress and to the commission analyzing dods recommendations and selection process the president could elect to either transmit the commissions recommendations to congress with opportunities for changi ng them or disapprove the commissions recommendations and not submit them to congress if the commissions recommendations were disa pproved by the president the commission would be required to revise its recommendations and resubmit them to the president if the president disapproved the commissions revi sed recommendations that years round of the brac process would cease furthermore the brac statute provided for expedited congressional pr ocedures to disapprove commission recommendations regarding base realignments and closures with straight up or down vote and possibility for amending the list u pon receiving the co mmissions recommendations from the president congress would need to pass joint resolu tion of disapproval of the recommendations within 45 days or else the commissions recommendations would go into effect in sum the key elements of this process were the dod proposes the commission disposes the secretary of defense made the initial recommendations for closure orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs4 7 in practice the commission stated that its activities and documentation were open to the public realignment the commission could and did add to and delete from these recommendations both dod and commission proposals had to conform with the force st ructure plan developed by dod the president can seek changes in commission recommendations president ever challenged commission over its recommendations although the law pr ovided this opportunity if deadlock had occurred over the clos ure list the process would have terminated with the presidents refusal to forward the list to congress congress must pass joint resolution of disapproval of the recommendations list within 45 days or the recommendations for closure and realignment go into effect this was the only action allowed to congress under the base closure law straight up or down vote with changes permitted in the list of actions by the commission under the brac law the secretary of defense was obligated to implement the closure and realignment recommendations if congress did not disapprove them another forcing mechanism in the law was the requirement that the selected bases close within six years from the time congress voted upon the recommendations the statute further require d that proceedings information and deliberations of the commission be open to various chai rmen and minority ranking members of congressional committees or th eir designees upon request7 heads of federal departments and agencies were allowed to detail pe rsonnel to the commission upon the commission directors request and the comptroller general was required to provide assistance to the commission inc luding the detailing of gao employees in accordance with an agreement with the commission congress amended the brac laws over the years to lessen the economic and social disruption in base closure communities these amendments included the transfer of personal property such as furn iture and equipment below cost sales or transfers of real property to communities and technical assistance in land planning and base reuse report of 1988 base closure commission on december 29 1988 the first base cl osure commission with its 12 members appointed by the secretary of defense carlucci issued its report it recommended the closure in part or in whole and realignment of 145 bases the commission projected that this would improve the effec tiveness of the base structure and would save an estimated 6936 million year in base operating costs after various procedural requirements of the statute were met culminating with congresss tacithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs5 approval by not adopting joint resolution of disapproval the secretary of defense was required to close or realign the lis ted bases by september 30 1995 the first base pease air force base nh was closed in the spring of 1991 one commission member former senato r thomas eagleton criticized the cooperation of the services in the proce ss singling out the navy for stonewalling and getting away with it in his add itional views in the 1988 report he suggested starting with the navy in any future base closing effort while the commission approach taken in the 1988 statute was generally regarded by congress as successful dod took the position that the closure of military bases is essentially an executive branch function accordingly early in 1990 secretary of defense richard cheney issued another list of bases which congress should consider for possible cl osure representative aspin of wisconsin chairman of the house armed services committee rejected the list as including disproportionate num ber of bases in democratic districts and stated that the only fair way to develop new list of base closures was to enact legislation creating another commission such commi ssion was then created by pl 101510 dated november 5 1990 the earlier commi ssion had been disbanded after the submission of its final report creation of 1991 base closure commission as provided for by statute the new commission consisted of eight members appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the nate in selecting individuals to be nominated for member ship on the commission the president was directed to consult with the speaker of th house of representatives concerning the appointment of two members the majority leader of the senate concerning the appointment of an additiona l two members and the minority leaders of the house and senate for one member each as not ed the commission was to meet in 1991 and as reconstituted again in 1993 and 1995 another requirement was that not more than onethird of the personnel employ ed by or detailed to the commission staff could be on detail from dod the procedures provided by the 1990 law were substantially more complicated than those set forth by its predecessor the major difference lay in the fact that the initial recommendations on base closures made under the new statute were to be made by the secretary of defense for example in the 1991 round of ba closure recommendations dods recommendations were trans mitted to the commission where they were reviewed the commissions own recommendations wh ich differed in several important respects from dods were then sent to the president july 1 1991 after his review and approval the president transmitted the commissions report to congress if he had not approved of th report in whole or in part the president would have been obliged to explain his reasons for disapproval to both congress and the commission the commission would then have transmitted to the president revised list of recommended closures the proc edure was in fact somewhat morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs6 complicated than this description for example the comptroller general was directed to assist the commission and there was considerably more detail set forth in the current statute than there was in the earlier one however it may be said in general that the changes were designed 1 to insulate the entire process even further from political considerations as indicated by the provisions requiring that the commission meet only during the nonel ection years 1991 1993 and 1995 and 2 make the process more open to the public pl 101510 included other provisions of significance to the base closure program for one thing it directed the secretary of defense to ensure that the environmental restoration of the clos ed bases took place as soon as possible secondly it specifically authorized th secretary to pr ovide outplacement assistance to civilian employees of the fense department at installations being closed third important difference lay in the way overseas bases were treated these bases were not within the commissions jurisdiction their closure was an important issue but presumably not affected by the same political considerations that would require the appointment of bipartisan commission the 1990 statute nevertheless contained policy statement that did not appear in the previous one pl 100526 first it was declared to be the sense of congress that military operations at overseas bases be terminated at the discretion of the secretary of defense at the earliest opportunity secondl it was the sense of congress that in providing for termination the secretary of defense shoul d take steps to ensure that the united states receives through direct payment or otherwise consideration equal to the fair market value of the improvements made by the united states at facilities that will be released to host countries in practice if the decision to close an overseas base was made there were negotiations with the host nation weighing the us costs of constructing and improving the facilities against the estimates for environmental or other remediation required at closing th last considerations would be under the terms of the host nation agreement when the us built or took over the facility another feature of the statute was the establishment of base closure account into which revenues generated from the sale of closing bases would be placed the funds could then be used to pay for the expenses associated with the relocation of forces such as new construction or reha bilitation of existing facilities at receiving bases there were also several provisions signed to assist dod in carrying out congress base closure policy the 1990 statute required the defense department to publish its proposed criteria for selec ting bases to be closed these proposed criteria were included in the federal register for november 30 1990 there followed period during which public comments were received and then on february 15 1991 the final criteria which contained few changes were published these final criteria were subject to cong ressional disapproval by joint resolution until march 15 1991 but such resolution was dopted the language included in the federal register stated that in selecting military installations for closure or realignment dod was to consider the following military value return on investment and impacthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs7 military value current and future mission re quirements and the impact on operational readiness of the department of defenses total force availability and conditi on of land facilities and associated airspace at both the existing and potential receiving locations ability to accommodate contingency mobilization and future total force requirements at both the existing and potential receiving locations cost and manpower implications return on investment extent and timing of potential co sts and savings including the number of years beginning with the date of completion of the closure or realignment for the savings to exceed the cost impact economic impact on communities ability of both the existing and potential receiving communities infrastructure to support fo rces missions and personnel environmental impact secretary of defense cheneys proposed list after the publication of these criteria the secretary of defense on april 12 1991 announced new list of proposed base cl osures analysts on the staff of the house armed services committee estimated that the closings would eliminate approximately 70000 military and civilian jobs by 1997 or 33 of the militarys 21 million personnel number of senators and congressmen objected to proposed closures in their various jurisdictions but in general congress appeared to find the list more acceptable than the one announced by secretary cheney in january 1990 representative aspin stated that the list at first glance appears to be fair on the other hand representative joseph moakley of massachusetts c oncluded that it almost looks like the democratic strongholds have been hit the worst secretary cheney claiming that he did not know how many bases were in democratic and how many in republican districts asserted tha t there is nothing to be gained by secretary of defense trying to play base closings for some political purpose 1991 base closure commissions report the second phase in the base closure process was then initiated with the commission holding number of statutor ily mandated public hearings in various parts of the country many members of congress as well as other witnesses testified regarding the process merits nd impacts of the possible closings press accounts of commission hearings indicated th at much of the testimony by membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs8 of congress objected to specific indi vidual closure the commission report noted that community and elected leaders were tireless advocates for their military installations one objection was that there was too little time and too little independent expertise in the commission to permit complete evaluation of dods recommendations however the commissi on chairman james courter former republican representative from new jersey indicated that complying with the july 1 deadline was not problem he had also stated on several occasions that the commission was an independent body and that it would not rubberstamp dods recommendations on may 31 1991 the commission issued list of preliminary candidates for base closure subsequently after c oncluding its deliberations the commission released its final list of 82 proposed cl osures and realignments on july 1 1991 in its recommendations the 1991 base commi ssion largely accepted the list proposed by secretary of defense cheney however it made few significant changes the most important involving si x bases selected by dod fo r closure the commission recommended that ft chaffee ar and ft dix nj be realigned and that fort mcclellan naval trai ning center orlando fl naval air station whidbey island wa and moody air fo rce base ga remain open an important aspect of the base clos ure statute was the mandated role for gao gao issued report dated may 1991 cont aining detailed comments about the various methods used by dod as basi s for its recommendations the report military bases observations on the analyses supporting proposed closures and realignments also contained important informa tion about individual bases the report is too lengthy to permit an adequate summary here but it is noteworthy that 1 the armys recommendations were f ound by gao to be well supported 2 in the case of the air force gao found genera lly that the rati onale was adequately supported by documentation and 3 as regards the navy gao found that it used inadequate documentati on so that gao was unable to independently evaluate the relative military value of the bases considered congressional actions on 1991 recommendations on july 10 1991 president george bush approved the independent commissions recommendations for closure in compliance with the procedures prescribed by law and transmitted them to congress the closings proposed by the commission would by its estimate cost 41 billion from 1992 to 1997 but would save bout 15 b illion year thereafter the statute gave congress 45 days to overturn the recommendations by joint resolution such action took place many members of congress expressed concern over the impact of new closures on the lives of people in their districts and states concern with the possibility of widespread unemployment in certain affected communities and with the validity of military valuations of competing bases prompted calls for reversal of commission decisions in number of specific cases members stated these and other arguments during house floor debate see the congre ssional record of july 30 1991httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs9 8 see crs report 96562 military base closures since 1988 status and employment changes at the community and state level by george h siehl and edward knight at httpwwwcongressgovcrsplsd96562docpdf recommendations to close the philadelphia naval shipyard and naval station and loring air force base in maine drew extended comment from members more broadly based reaction on cap itol hill was to seek increased funding for programs which would provide an economic safety net for those adversely affected by closures8 earlier on july 23 the house ar med services subcommittee on military installations and facilities voted to suppor t the recommendations of the defense base closure and realignment commission be fore the vote the subcommittee heard testimony from several members of c ongress in opposition to the commissions recommendations in general they objected to the lack of coordination between the three military departments in making their recommendations to the commission there were also specific complaints that the closure of certain medical facilities would result in inconvenience and higher dical costs to persons currently using those facilities most of these concerns and examples would be raised again in floor debate the following week on july 24 1991 the house committee on armed services favorably adopted the report of its subcommittee and ndorsed the commissions recommendations on july 30 by vote of 60 to 364 the hous rejected resolution disapproving and thereby tacitly approving the recommenda tions of the commission the senate then had need to consider their resoluti on of disapproval as rejection of the commissions recommendations required both bodies to agree to override the senate 1 992 defense aut horization bill s 1507 contained several provisions that would have facilitated transf ers of real property at closing bases to local communities these provisions we re contained in the johnstonbreaux amendment which the senate had adopted after its introduction on the floor the amendment would have made two major changes in existing law 1 it would have provided that if community near clos ed base was significantly harmed local governments would have first priority in obtaining excess property located there although for the past forty years other federa l agencies have been given this priority by statute 2 it would have provided that these recipients would be offered the property at cost although in the past ch transfers have ge nerally been made on reimbursable basis thes provisions were deleted in conference however the conference report hrept 102311 acknowledged the existing obstacles to base reuse but found that the proposed change s raised other problems loss of revenue from property sales displacement of existin g land allocation prio rities and conflicts with environmental laws among others the committees of jurisdiction had not considered the changes the report said but added that the house of representatives pledged to review the matters in 1992 the conferees clarified the congressional intent that civil works river and harbor projects and other activities of the us army corps of engineers were to be excluded from the base closure programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs10 environmental and other considerations the impending closure of substantial num bers of bases rais ed several difficult environmental problems under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as superfund the us government could not transfer land outside federal ownership until it agreed that all remedial action necessary to protect hum an health and the environment had been taken since the communities adjoining bases programmed for closure generally wish to obtain the land quickly while th decontamination pr ocess found necessary to restore the environment could be timeconsuming serious conflicts between the interests of economic development and the interests of environmenta l restoration could occur there have been many federal environmental statutes enacted in recent years and there are also number of relevant st ate laws in general congress and the courts have made it fairly clear that federal facilities must comply with state and local environmental requirements but until r ecently it was not entirely clear that state authorities could impose penaltie s on federal facilities that were in violation this problem was addressed by the federal facilities compliance act which specifically provides that states and municipalities have this authority as the base closure program accelerated it became increasingly important to convert the bases to nonmilitary use as expe ditiously as possible it has been dod policy to negotiate with cal organization often referre d to as reuse committee that represents the various community interests but at some bases the competing cities and counties have found themselves unable to c ooperate even to the extent of forming such an organization in one cas where the base was included on the 1988 list and the closure actually took place in 1992 lawsuits among local jurisdictions delayed implementation of reuse plan until february 1995 creation of 1993 base closure commission on january 5 1993 president bush submitted list of eight nominees for appointment to newly reconstituted ba closure and realignment commission he selected james courter the 1991 commi ssion chairman to be head of the new group these were subsequently confir med by the senate the 1993 commission after reviewing dods list of recomme nded closures submitted on march 12 1993 and holding extensive public hearin gs recommended closing 130 bases and realigning 45 others congress acceded to the co mmissions recommendations by declining to pass joint resolution of disa pproval these actions were expected to result in savings of pproximately 4 billion betw een fy1994 and fy1999 after onetime closure costs of approximately 7 billion and additional annua l savings in the range of 23 billion thereafterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs11 other significant developments 19931994 supreme court decisi on on judicial review on may 23 1994 the supreme court unan imously decided that decisions to close military bases were not subject to j udicial review ch ief justice rehnquist writing the opinion of the court held that although the administrative procedure act provides for judicial review of final agency action the president was not an agency within the meaning of that statute and his decisions were therefore not reviewable in the lower court decision which the supreme court reversed it was suggested that the presidents authority to close bases was limited to those situations where there had been compliance with statutory procedures by the secretary of defense and the base closure commission attorneys arguing for judicial review contended that the commission used imp roper criteria failed to place certain information in the record until after the close of public hearings and held closed meetings with the navy the supreme c ourt was not however convinced by these arguments and held that the presidents authority to act is not contingent on the secretarys and commissions fulfillment of all the procedural requirements imposed on them by the 1990 base closure act in concurring opinion justice souter jo ined by three other justices examined the legislative history of the base closure statute and made specific reference to the fact that congress was intimately familiar with repeated unsuccessful efforts to close military bases in rational and timely manner accordingly congress adopted the complicated procedures of the base closure act to bind its hands from untying package of base closures consequently congress did not mean the courts to have any such power through j udicial review on june 23 1994 senator arlen specter of pennsylvania who had ar gued unsuccessfully in the supreme court that base closure decisions were subject to judicial review introduced an amendment to the defense authorization act which would have provided for such review in certain cases where there was evidence of fraudulent concealment of information relevant to particular decision the am endment was rejected by tabling motion after debate opponents argu ed among other things that the amendment would open pandoras box in which vi rtually all aggrieved commun ities woul d initiate lawsuits changes in statutory law as the process of closure and realig nment took place generally in accordance with announced schedules several changes in statutory procedure were enacted in fy1994 and fy1995 defense authorization bills as well as in other bills notable among these was the base closure co mmunity redevelopment and homeless assistance act of 1994 pl 103421 it reduced the scope of the mckinney homeless assistance act provision that gave organizations that served the homeless priority claim to federal property that was declared surplus under the new law local communities would exercise greater degree of influence and control over disposition of surplus property through thei r redevelopment planning process the process included considerati on of homeless needs in the community and that portion of the reuse plan was subject to review by the secretary of housing and urbanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs12 development additional tails on this aspect of base reuse are found in the department of housing and urban development march 1966 publication guidebook on military base reuse and homeless assistance

independent study gr oup claime d that of the 67 major bases scheduled to be closed 26 d reopened or else were never closed in the first place as result the report went on to state th substantial savings originally envisaged were not achieved dod argued that some of the figures used in the report were wrong for example in the case of cars well afb which the air force had intended to close the bens report stated that ma intenance of the base cost an annual 197 million on the other hand dod claimed th at the costs were only 15 million the bens report also noted that after carswell was closed

military bases it pointed out that although dod originally estimate d it would realize 41 billion in property sales reve nue from closed bases in 1994 the estimate was reduced to 12 billion the most important reason for this change according to the report was that consistent with federal regulations the va st majority of the disposed property is being retained by dod or transferred to other federal agencies and states and localities at cost the gao report noted that widespread use of nocost transfers was greatly facilitated by the enactment of provisions in the fy1994 dod authorization act which authorized such transfers where the property was to be used for economic development when the base closure program was initiated in 1988 considerable emphasis was placed on the substantial revenue s to be deposited in the base closure account from the sale of surplus bases ho wever this emphasis shifted to assisting the economic recovery of communities affected by closure this was evidenced by the provisions adopted in the fy1994 dod authorization act title xxix of pl 103 160 the major impact was probably from section 2903 which provided for transfer of real property to redevelopmen t authority for consid eration at or below the estimated fair market value but other provisions were part of the same general scheme section 2904 provide d for expedited determina tion of transferability of excess property and section 2906 provided fo r the outleasing of property at bases to be closed pending final disposition the gao report discussed other aspects of the base closure program such as the large amounts of military land that were severely contamin ated apart from decontamination other types of improvement might be found necessary for instance sewage and electrical systems might require upgrading and buildings might have tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs13 be brought into compliance with local stat and federal standa rds finally the report indicated that of the property rema ining in federal ownership 50 would go to the fish and wildlife service 22 to the bureau of land management and 24 would remain with the department of defense smaller acreages would go to the bureau of prisons nasa nd the national park service 1994 elections and the 104th congress while the basic statutory scheme for determining which installations were to be closed was generally the same as it was in 1990 the 104th congress came under republican control several issues associated with base closure including costs and savings were included on the oversight pl an filed by the house national security committee at the start of the new congress holding out the possibility of changes an important development took place on january 26 1995 when secretary of defense william j perry addr essing the nations mayors stated that the final round of closings will not be as large as the st one he also co mmented in connection with the base closure program that we have closed all of the bases that were relatively easy to close but that dod s till needs to close more bases from the point of view of saving infrastructure creation of 1995 base closure commission former senator alan dixon of illi nois was nominated and confirmed as chairman of the 1995 commission in october 1994 before the 103rd congress adjourned on february 7 1995 president clinton announced the following

mitted dummy list of commissioners including deputy defense s ecretary john deutch this met the requirement for submission of list of candidates prior to the january 3 deadline set by law and allowed the white house and new republican majority in congress to consider other names later actions in 1995 the department of defense on february 28 1 995 released the base closure and realignment report setting out proposed actions ffecting 146 military installations for the consideration of the brac commissi on thirtythree majo r bases were listed for closure and 34200 civilian jobs w ould be lost under the recommendations although former secretary of defense s aspin had suggested that the 1995 brac round would be the mother of all base closure rounds the actual recommendations touched fewer bases than did the 1993 round secretary perry st ated in his press conference of february 28 that reduction of infrastructure significantly lagged personnel reduction 21 versus 33 through the first three closure rounds dod estimated aggregated savings of about 57 billion over 20 years from this and the previous three rounds on may 10 the commission added 31 insta llations to the list of bases to be considered for possible closure or realignment the chairman emphasized that inclusion of base on the list did not mean the base would close or be realigned but would allow fairer assessment of cl osure candidates indeed in 1993 the commission added 70 bases for further consid eration but in the end made few final recommendations that differed from the dod list nevertheless the commissions views seemed somewhat di fferent from dods for ex ample the dod list included only one major shipyard long beach calif ornia for closure but the commission added portsmouth shipyard in kittery maine for consideration the commission also added air force depots at mcclella n afb california and kelly afb texas the latter additions would pr ove to be more momentous during may and june and prior to its final vote on june 22 the commission held numerous regional hearings one of the commissioners stated that between 70 and 80 installations had been vi sited in one major difference although the air force had recommended retaining all five maintenance depots with reduced workload the commission put all the depots on list to be considered for possible closure or realignment on june 22 the commission began its fina l vote and announced its first set of recommendations on closures and realig nments after reviewing 40 of the recommendations submitted by dod it made substantial changes in several of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs15 air force recommendations the air force had wanted to close rome laboratory ny but the commission voted to keep it open the air force also wished to retain all five of its ma intenance depots while reducing their workloads but under the commissions plan both kelly afb tx and mcclellan afb ca would be virtually closed kelly itself would re main open although the depot would close mcclellan would close entirely number of navy laboratories were also scheduled to be closed on june 30 the defense base closur and realignment commission sent its 1995 report to the president to president clinton the report recommended the closure of 79 bases including 28 major one s the realignment of 26 bases including 21 major ones and number of disestablishments or relo cations chairman dixon stated that implementing these actions would save 193 billion over 20 years but would cost an estimated 94 thousand jobs the biggest closures would be mcclellan afb ca long beach naval shipyard ca and fort mcclellan the two california senators urged president clinton to reject the commissions recommendations on the other hand seve ral republican congressmen stated that rejection of the report would impair the integr ity of the base closure process see for example cq july 1 1995 pp 19391941 report had been rejected since the base closure program was initiated in 1988 the 1995 report however was the first in which the commission had recommended more savings than those proposed by the administration on july 13 president clinton approve d the commissions report as submitted in his transmittal message to congress he expressed seri ous reservations because of the severe economic impact that would be suffered by california and texas he stated that california had already suffere d disproportionately by bearing about half the defense job losses in the three prev ious rounds and the latest recommendations would also result in california losing about half the jobs although it was responsible for only about 15 of the military work for ce in its initial report to the commission the defense department had strongly opposed the closing of mcclellan air force base sacramento ca and kelly air for ce base san antonio tx for the reason that closure would disrupt air force operations and undermine the air forces ability to carry out some of its modernization programs in his july 13 1995 tr ansmittal message clinton defe nded privatization he said he would view as violation of the base cl osure law any effort by congress to restrict privatization after approving the base closure package representative james v hansen stated contrary view in re marks contained in hrept 104220 which accompanied the resolution of disapproval hjres 102 he said in part the presidents direction to privatizeinplace and the pentagons plan for implementation appear to be in violation of several sections of current law on july 26 the house national security committee rejected by vote of 4310 resolution introduced by representative frank tejeda d tx that would have overturned the commissions base closur and realignment recommendations on september 8 the house rejected the reso lution of disapproval by vote of 34575 the administration plan for privatizing some of the operations at kelly afb texas and mcclellan afb ca lifornia was point of controversy httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs16 9 more detail on the closure process and congresss continued role in facilitating that process is contained in crs report 96562 military base closures since 1988 status and employment changes at the community and state level by george h siehl and edward knight at httpwwwcongressgovcrsplsd96562docpdfpresident clinton told kelly afb work ers in an october 17 1996 speech that for five more years kelly will keep the jobs that would be here if closure had not been recommended and even eight years fro m now more than twothirds of kellys jobs will still be here employment at kelly when it was recommended for closure was about 16000 at mcclellan afb some 8700 of the 11000 jobs were to be protected for the next five years after which privatization would take place with the expectation that as many as 4300 jobs will shift to nong overnment employers according to dod estimates in 1996 the air force identifie d work at the two depots to be bid competitively as part of the privatization effort critics contended that the two depots were recommended for closure by the 1995 brac commission because the five ai r force depots had excess capacity and that the closures would shift work so as to more fully utilize the capacity of the remaining open depots c ontinued operation with priv atization they contended would continue the overcapacity and unde rcut the commissions projected savings from closure of mc clellan and kelly subsequent closure activity in conformance with the authorizing statute by december 31 1995 the commission completed its mission and went out of existence creation of new brac commission would require new au thorizing legislation by congress the process of closing previously selected military bases continued congress amended the base closing statute number of times in order to help local communities shift quickly to new ec onomic uses of the land and resources left behind the national defense authoriz ation act for fy1996 pl 104106 for instance added several base closure provisions which addressed such subjects as environmental remediation the lease back of property to the federal government and the performance of police and similar services at closed installations additional changes were contained in the fy1997 na tional defense author ization act pl 104201 principally bases from the 1988 cl osure round were ma eligible for several provisions available for bases closed under later rounds9 the rand national defense research ins titute has also studied the impact of base closures concentra ting on several nonme tropolitan communitie s in california their 1996 report the effects of military base closures on local communities shortterm perspective concluded that while some of the communities did indeed suffer the effects were not catastrophic and not nearly as severe as forecasted and the burden of defense cuts falls on the i ndividual worker or firm rather than the community pxii httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97305crs17 there is wide variety among military bases ranging from those with training mission and high percentage of military personnel to support facilities such as shipyards and depots staffed primarily with civilians there are great differences in the settings in which military installations are f ound from lightly populated rural areas to robust economically diversified metropolitan cente rs base closure impacts clearly differ with individual circumst ances thus rand noted closures of major facilities such as mare island or long beach may have serious effects on the displaced workers but the effects on the local community are muted by the fact that the community is embedded in much larger economy p12 it was clear to many observers that individual workers and firms would be adversely affected as the base closures and realignments laid out by the four commissions were completed their communities possibly suffering at least initial disruption however might gain in the long run emerging expe rience indicated that more jobs not less followed many but not all closures
