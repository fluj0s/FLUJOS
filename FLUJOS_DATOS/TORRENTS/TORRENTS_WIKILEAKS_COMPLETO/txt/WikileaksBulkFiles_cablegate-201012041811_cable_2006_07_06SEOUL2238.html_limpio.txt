decision to suspend humanitarian aid to the dprk it would ship another 24700 metric tons of fertilizer 67 july this final shipment will complete the delivery to the north of the pledge of 350000 metric tons south korea made earlier this year mou officials have explained that the rokg is proceeding with this shipment because it is small final portion of pledged commitment 2 u unification minister lee jongseok on july 6 told the national assembly unification foreign affairs and trade committee that seoul would hold interkorean ministerial talks set for july 1114 in busan as scheduled adding that it was not consistent to urge the north to return to talks over its nuclear weapons programs but refuse to talk with the north itself lee said it was still important to limit seouls measures against the north to avoid further escalation on the peninsula 3 c the adcm xxxxx to verify the items above in frank exchange adcm expressed disappointment that things appeared to be businessasusual with the shipment of fertilizer this week and the holding of interkorean ministerials next week this was sending the wrong signals to pyongyang for its inexcusable behavior adcm said xxxxx replied that lot of internal discussions had taken place but that politicallevels concluded that breaking off the dialogue was not wise because restarting it would be too costly and difficult moreover the dialogue must be used to send stern message to north korea next week the rok delegation would definitely make the point that pyongyangs demand for an additional 100000 tons of fertilizer and 500000 tons of rice was threatened also in response to the missile launches xxxxx seoul had decided to cancel northsouth military liaison officers talks that were planned for july 7 which essentially meant that general officers talks would not be held as hoped in addition seoul was holding back on approving new investment permits for the kaesong industrial complex kic adcm encouraged xxxxx develop further measures and to publicize them septel 4 u senior secretary for national security suh choosuk said on the radio on july 6 that the rokg has initially concluded that the dprks failed missile launch was due to technical failure he also defended the rokgs reaction to the missile launches as quick and appropriate 5 u rok defense minister yoon kwangwoong on july 6 told the national assembly defense committee that the north might launch more missiles citing an assessment of the equipment and groups going to and from the launch sites during dprk preparations over the past two months he also rejected the argument of an opposition lawmaker that there was delay in the rokg reaction to the launches separately an unnamed senior official at the rok joint chiefs of staff publicly denied media reports that the dprk was preparing to launch second taepodong ii missile political reaction 6 c during july 6 opposition grand national party gnp leaders meeting the gnp criticized the rokg for its idle approach to the dprk missile launches and called for the resignation of all the securityrelated ministers the gnp proposed national investigation on the rokgs reaction proposed an emergency national assembly committee and urged the rokg to review its interkorean policies including the kaesong industrial complex the geumgang tourism project and humanitarian assistance xxxxx told xxxxx that all cash support to the dprk should be stopped and that sending fertilizer north as missiles were being fired was nonsensical xxxxx predicted that the missile test could have deciding effect on the july 11 gnp party chair selection to replace xxxxx who stepped down last month xxxxx said the lawmaker who could make people feel the most secure would be selected and hinted that kang jaesup with his more conservative prosecutors background might be the more attractive choice in light of the current situation 7 c the spokesman for smaller opposition democratic party dpxxxxx stated that the rokg should recognize the importance of closely coordinating with washington and tokyo and improve its crisis management system that the dp said failed to operate effectively one democratic party staffer noted to poloff that the missile tests should be viewed as test and nothing more 8 u the progressive democratic labor party dlp spokesman said xxxxx that the rokg should maintain dialogue with the dprk and prevent further dprk provocations at the same time the rokg should encourage washington to negotiate directly with pyongyang 9 c several uri party staffers told poloff that further assistance would be difficult due to the lack of popular support but that aid already agreed upon should continue one staffer noted that the tests put the uri party in difficult position because they showed the ineffectiveness of the current engagement policy the uri party echoed much of the gnps frustration with the related ministers but stopped short of calling for them to step down common theme also heard was that the rok reaction to the tests was by the manual developed by the uri party and not late at all press coverage 10 u rok media reports on july 6 highlighted unsc discussions criticisms that seoul was caught flatfooted and speculations about dprk motivations and prospects for interkorean relations the donga ilbo moderate daily criticized the rokg government for responding too slowly delivering weaker announcement than washington or tokyo and for poorly coordinating with the usg which the paper said created the information lag 11 u as to why the north launched the missiles opinions ranged from 1 to get attention and negotiation leverage 2 to use for internal purpose to demonstrate dprk strength andor 3 for technical reasons to demonstrate dprk missile achievement the progressive hankyoreh opined that the timing of the launch on july 4 was special because it was the 34th anniversary of the northsouth joint statement from 1972 and it was the us independence day suggesting that the dprk was exhibiting brinkmanship and wanted to generate more attention 12 u press stories quoted some analysts who opined that north korea might stand to gain from the launches kim taehyo political scientist at sungkyunkwan university was quoted as saying that kim jongil probably gambled that beijing and seoul would not change their stances and that this gamble was likely to pay off paik haksoon senior researcher at sejong institute suggested that the dprk launch was probably an effort to strengthen its position in the six party talks because it was unsatisfied with proposed compensation for scrapping its nuclear programs peter beck director of the international crisis groups seoul office said that at most seoul would probably only delay aid shipments versus real change in its current policies dprk watchers caution against sanctions at symposium 13 sbu the prevailing sentiment among north korea experts gathered at july 6 symposium in seoul on north korean development and international cooperation was for all parties to exercise restraint in responding to the north korean missile launches 14 sbu amb sun junyoung professor at kyungnam university and former rok ambassador to the said that the missile launches were the dprks last card and showed not its strength but its weaknessxxxxx that the dprk felt so pressured by us banking sanctions that it felt compelled to show its might in some manner xxxxx believed that it would be mistake to punish dprk with sanctions and that it would be mistake for the rokg to suspend ministerial discussions scheduled for july 11 the best decision he said would be to perhaps delay the meetings but to keep lines of communication open 15 sbu xxxxx that the bush administrations neglect and containment policy caused north korea to break its moratorium on missile testing xxxxx expressed concern that the launches would result in sanctions according xxxxx every time sanctions were applied to north korea the nuclear and missile situation became aggravated he said that the missile launches were signal from north korea to the united states that it wanted direct negotiations kyungnam university prof lim eulchul also said that the missile launches appeared to be way of bringing the united states back to the negotiating table it was north koreas way of getting american attention he shrugged 16 sbuxxxxx that it would not be helpful to cut off assistance and contacts particularly in time of crisis it would be important to keep channels of communication open in order to facilitate an exchange of positions 17 sbu visiting xxxxx that the best reaction to the launches would be to continue with business as usual he said that to overreact would be to play into north koreas expectations and fulfill its goal of seeking attention by minimizing public reaction and continuing to seek opportunities for exchange and assistance there would be greater possibility of making longterm positive impact also imposing sanctions would only harm ordinary north koreans who had nothing to do with the missile launches xxxxx advised at most delay in engagement activity with the dprk 18 sbu xxxxx likened the missile crisis to cold winter before warm spring he criticized the usg for taking harsh line toward north korea and precipitating the current situation but he said the situation could be salvaged if the usg provided security guarantee and food to north korea this he said would initiate the process of separating the regime from its leadersxxxxx said that imposing sanctions would be as effective as dog barking outside citys walls it would be much better to use humanitarian aid like trojan horse to start change from within dprk tourism and kic unaffected by missile launches 19 sbu hyundai asan president yoon manjoon said during his keynote address at xxxxx that the launches have had impact on hyundai asans operations in north korea he said that of the 315 persons scheduled to tour north koreas mt geumgang xxxxx there was only one cancellation noting that far more people usually canceled at the last minute because of personal reasons yoon said that people seemed determined to continue with their plans yoon added that there has been abnormal investor activity with regard to the kaesong industrial complex kic and predicted that investors who were planning to invest in kic would probably delay their investments for short time but then push ahead with their original plans xxxxx political not military missiles and predicted that travel and investment in the dprk would remain stable vershbow
