their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spending on longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and co mmunitybased care congress has not yet decided whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an in cremental approach to longterm care without major federal policy involve ment leaving to state governments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home

for longterm care face significant challenges financing of nursing home care has dominated longterm care spending for decades the federal financing structure that created incentives to support institutional care reaches back to 1965 number of converging factors have supported reliance on nursing home spending prior to enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct paymen ts made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benef its and vendor payments made by states with federal matchi ng payments on behalf of i ndividuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transforme d into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician rvices amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care in intermediate care facilities icfs for persons who did not need skilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs2 2

331000 to more than one million2 today there are about 17000 nursing homes with 18 million beds3 during the latter part of the 1960s and the 1970s nursing home care attracted great deal of congressional oversight as result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that was becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health

spending is for pe rsons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities issues in financing and delivery of longterm care recurring theme discussed by state officials is the view that the federal financing system under medicaid guarantees heavy use of institutional care this is largely due to the fact that nursing facility care is an entitlement under medicai d for persons needing such care who meet its eligibility criteria in the view of state officials the impetus for heavy reliance on institutional care is built into the incentive structure for providers resulting in funding dispar ities between institutional and home and communitybased care pennsylvania officials indicated that they want to move to systemthat relies more on home and communitybased services and that consumers should be given clear choices regarding their options with adequate supports to stay at home and in the community state officials i ndicated that the medicai d section 1915c home and communitybased services waiver programs have significantly expanded opportunities for many pe ople with disabilities to receive services they would not have ab sent the waiver however the waivers have created another set of categorical requirements each program is identified as discrete distinct program resulting state officials say in silo approach to service provision the procedures locating the appropriate waiver or other service program and the administering agency and trying to fit persons needs into the prescribed waiver requirements can be burdensome on clients as well as providers state

policy entails number of strategies that affect institutional care utilization development of medicaid nursing home participation review program prp in 1996 the state assembly allowed the st ates certificate of need program for health care providers to sunset after that time the number of nursing home facilities and beds increased in recognition of this and the states goal to control surplus growth in 1998 the department of public welfare instituted the prp process of reviewing the need for nursing home facilities and beds that participate in medicaid nursing homes seeking to participate either as new facilities or as an expansion of existing facilities must be approved by dpw through the prp the main objective of the prp is to respond to consumers desire to age in place by redirecting limited state resources from highercost less preferable institutional settings to more costeffective home and communitybased services through encouraging the development of other co mponents of the array of longterm care services15 the state reviews an application from provider on casebycase basis using number of criteria including medicaid program need availability of home and

not exceed 300 of the federal ssi payment level as allowed under the section 1915c waiver progra m and used for the section 1915c waiver programs in pe nnsylvania however despite use of this more liberal standard there are still many people who need home and communitybased services but who cannot meet the income limits or resource tests under medicaid and who cannot afford home and communitybased serv ices many of these persons could not establish eligibility until they spenddown almost all their resources and income and by that time are in danger of having to go into an institution one of the issues many states have confronted is how to provide services for such persons pennsylvania has addressed this issue through two statefunded programs th at provide services using more liberal income or resource tests than required under the waiver programs these statefunded programs for the elde rly provide services that are similar to the pda waiver but expand eligibility requirements to include persons financially ineligible for the waiver the bridge program provides services to persons who cannot meet the medicaid re source test limitation and the options program provides services to persons who have income above the medicaid limit for persons in the waiver 300 of the federal ssi level both programs require different forms of costsharing by participants the bridge program implemented for the first time in january 2002 this program provides home and communitybased services similar to those under the pda waiver but to persons aged 60 and ove r who have assets greater than the 2000 limit required under the waiver persons may have assets up to 40000 and qualify for services but must still meet the waiver income test the program is unique in its costsharing system each beneficiary is required to pay 50 of the cost of direct services such as homemaker chore hom edelivered meals and home health care the remaining 50 is covered by the prog ram the costsharing system allows persons with higher resources to receive services and when they spend down their resources they may qualify unde r the medicaid pda waiverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs22 the bridge program is financed thr ough the states tobacco settlement f unds as of april 2002 200 persons had enrolled in the program the cost cap for the

persons aged 18 and over pplying for nursing home care and for ssi eligible persons applying for residence in domiciliary or personal care home for the elderly the program supports wide ra nge of home care services similar to those provided by the pda waiver the unique aspect of the options program is its financial eligibility criteria eligibility is based on sliding scale of income with beneficiary costsharing beneficiaries whose income is below 125 of the federal poverty level fpl are not required to pay for services about twothirds of participants fall into this category persons with income from 125 up to 300 of the fpl pay for services on sliding fee scale basis persons with income ab ove 300 are required to pay the full cost unlike either the waiver or bridge program

services to persons with mental retardation and other development disabilities in the united states have changed dramatically over the last half of the 20th country as result of number of converging factor s these include the advocacy efforts of families and organized constituency groups various changes to the social security law that provided payments to individua ls through ssi and ssdi and to service providers through the medicaid program and significant litigation brought on behalf of persons with ntal retardation22 pennsylvanias system of services for pe rsons with mental retardation has been influenced by number of signif icant factors these include the passage of pennsylvanias ment healthmental retardation act of 1966 which established state responsibility for funding and licensing of services and made county government responsible for program administration service delivery and case management23 the 1977 settlement of pennhurst state school and hospital v haldeman which ordered

persons in variety of home and communitybased care settings27 trends in institutional care the early history of services to persons with mental retardation nationwide is characterized by the developm ent of large state institutions or training schools begun during the latter part of the 19th century and continuing through the first part of the 20th century between 1920 and 1967 institutions quadrupled in size and peaked to serving almost 200000 individuals nationw ide in 165 freestanding stateoperated mental retardation institutional facilities28 today some states are still faced with the legacy of large stateoperated institutions in the nation as whole and in pennsylvania over the last several decades many large stateoperated institutions have been closed or downsized development that has been prompted by litigation on of the earliest and most publicized cases on behalf of persons with mental retardation residing in these institutions was filed in pennsylvania in1976 pennhurst state school and hospital v haldeman the case was ultimately heard by the us suprem court the pennhurst state school and hospital opened in 1908 once housed over 4000 individuals with mental retardation in chester county penns ylvania in 1977 us judge raymond broderick ordered the staterun institution to be closed after hearing evidence of the facilitys abuse and neglect of patients in the case even decades later this landmark case continues to profoundly affect the care of mentally retarded children and adults as well as other individuals receivi ng longterm care in institutions although parents of the pe nnhurst residents initially f iled the lawsuit to improve conditions in the facility their legal representative the public interest law center encouraged them to focus on the broader issue of whether adequate care could ever be achieved in large institu tional settings such as pennhurst the case ultimately recognized the rights of citizens with mental retardation to

small communitybas ed facilities with improved access to care in addition to profoundly alte ring the quality of care for the mentally retarded in pennsylvania the case has provided legal basis for other groups currently living in institutional settings to argue for access to communitybased services because settlement was reached with the plaintiffs the impact of the lawsuit only directly impacted the commonwealth of pennsylvani but the implications of the lawsuit were felt across the country as policies toward persons with mental retardation in institutions began to shift another

f acilities were residing in state institutions compared to 30 in 2000 the decline in the census in large state institutions is not reflected in the use of large private institutions however this is primarily due to the us of private facilities funded as intermediate care facilitie s for the mentally retarded icf smr under medicaid the proportion of persons residing in these private fac ilities with 16 or more beds was 31 in 1990 and was about the same proportion 29 in 2000 table 5 the medicaid home and communitybased services waiver option discussed below has allowed pennsylva nia to focus

pennsylvania intragovernmental council on long term care home and community based services barriers elimination work group mar 2002selected issues in financing and delivery of long term care services in pennsylvania pennsylvania officials and st akeholders have identified issues that pervade the states longterm care system in series of reports over the years prominent among these is report issued by working gr oup of the pennsylvania intragovernmental council on long term care in march 200243 the following discussion highlights selected issues identified in that report and other state reports as well as issues that surfaced in crs interviews with state officials providers and consumers institutional bias recurring theme in discussions of longterm care with state officials is their view that the federal financing system guarantees heavy use of institutional care this is largely due to the fact that nursing facility care is an entitlement under medicaid for persons needing such care and who meet its eligibility criteria financing of institutional care is federal mandate home and communitybased care is not although states may choose to provide home and communitybased services under various dicaid options state officials indicate that state funding constraints and the provi der system that was created as result of the institutional entitlement make it difficult to reorient the system pennsylvania officials indicated that they want to move to policy of expanding home and communitybased services and that c onsumers should be given clear choices regarding their options with adequate supports to stay at home and in the community officials noted that while the rhetoric regarding changing the institutional bias has intensified over the years actually accomplishing this objective is difficult and moving slowly the impetus for heavy reliance on institutional care is built into the incentive structure for providers resulting in funding disparities between institutional care and home and communitybased care state officials and stakeholders indicated that the institutional bias has created provi der culture that is counter to the desires of the population needing longterm care serv ices this is exemplified in number of ways incentives in the service syst em are built around referral to nursing homes for example hospital personnel are more lik ely to discharge persons needing long term care services to nursing facilities rather than to home and communitybased settings which are seen by discharge planners as riskier choices for some people state officials noted that the risks of referring clients to nursing homes are somewhat easier to manage given the 24hour car provided home and communitybased providers have to take on greater risk b ecause of complexities of planning for 24 hour care because home care options often do not involve single service they are seen by many as more complicated than simply referral to nursing home unless there are sufficient informal care providers to assist once person is referred and served in nursing home the likelihood of staying in the institutional setting increases as more time is spent there state officials indicated that most persons become eligible for medicaid within 6 months to yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs41 44 american health care association nursing facility sourcebook p 134after entering nursing home and once person has resided in nursing home for 2 or 3 months it is difficult to discharge the person to community care clearly some people need care that can only be provi ded in an institution for example those persons who have multiple complex needs weak or nonexistent informal supports and who lack appropriate housing arrang ements the challenge to the longterm care system is to respond with services that are appropriate to needs and that would use institutional care appropriately until person can safely be cared for at home and to arrange package of home and communitybased services that will prevent the person from entering or reentering an institution state officials state that the institutional bias is built into the federal requirements for eligibility for the section 1915c home and communitybased wavier program that is persons are only eligible for the waiver services if they meet institutional functional eligibility cr iteria state offi cials representing non elderly persons with disabilities indicated that using the nursing home eligible criteria perpetuates medica linstitutional model of care not appropriate for younger persons who will need suppor t throughout their lifetimes according to state officials one method to ameliorate the ins titutional bias is to control or downsize institutional capacity the primary method used by pennsylvania to control institutional capacity is through approval of medicaid beds through the prp process described earlier and through limitation on reimbursements this has had some impact on the supply of beds controlling the supply of state institutions for the mentally retarded differs somewhat from that for nursing homes as pointed out earlier the state has closed number of care facilities for persons with mental retardation in the past several decades and could do so because these facilitie s were operated by state gove rnment virtually all nursing homes in the state are eith er privately owned 75 are forprofit and 25 are non profit44 and therefore controlling or downsizing institutional capacity is not as direct as in the case of stateoperated facilities state officials indicated that the system should be changed so that nursing homes are an exception rather than the rule home and communitybased care should be considered first and then if rvices are judged to be inappropriate or unavailable the alternative would be an institutional placement in addition state officials note the need to have in place methods to di vert people from nursing homes who would be in danger of spending dow n their income and assets to establish medicaid eligibility categorical approach to home and communitybased services state officials indicated th at while the waiver progra ms have expanded opportunities for many people with disabilitie s to receive services they would not have absent the waiver the waivers have created another set of categorical requirements pennsylvania has eleven waivers in all each targeting certain groups with certain types of disabilities in addition there ar six other statefunded programs for which consumers might qualify each program is identified as discre distinct program resulting in silo approach to service provision the procedures of locating thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs42 45 certain items are excluded such as an individuals home up to 2000 of household goods and personal effects life insurance policies with face value of 1500 or less an automobile with value up to 4500 and burial funds up to 1500 among other things appropriate waiver or other service program and the administering agency and trying to fit needs into the prescribed waiver requirements can be burdensome on clients as well as providers service packages eligibility requireme nts and financial caps on amounts of services vary among the programs in ddition for the federal waiver programs person does not become eligible until his or her condition has deteriorated to the level of care provided by an instituti on some people may not meet the narrow categories of eligibility on the basis of disability that define eligibility for waivers state officials and stake holders recommended that rvices should be promoted without identifying different waiver prog rams that cover diffe rent services for different populations in addition th ey recommended that there be more comparability across waivers in order to prevent silo approach and that the scope and eligibility for waiv ers should be expanded medicaid eligibility requirements and ccess to services number of issues identified by state officials relate to medicaid eligibility for home and communitybased services medicaid eligibility income and resource limits persons needing longterm care services paid for by medicaid must have countable in come and resource limits established by the state within federal requirements states may allow persons with income up to 300 of the fe deral ssi level to become eligible for section 1915c home and communitybased waiver rvices in 2003 1656month for an individual this is the level used by pennsylvania for the waiver programs in addition people may qualify if their assets do not ex ceed 2000 for an individual and 3000 for couple45 while these requirements limit the number of people who may become eligible for medicaid they also act as barrier to many persons in need of longterm care who live at home for example state officials indicated that people in need of home and communitybased car who live in their own homes do not feel comfortable depleting almost all of their liquid assets that may be needed for household expenses and emergencies medicai d law allows states to use more liberal standards under section 1902r2 of the so cial security act however few states have employed this option states may permit persons with higher income and resources to qualify for medicaid but th is would expand eligibility groups and therefore medicaid costs pennsylvania through its statefunded bridge and options programs has addressed some of these medicaid financial eligibility issues these programs may serve as models for other st ates that have the financ ial capacity to expand the pool of eligibles they may also serve as examples for any federal initiatives that may be proposed to expand eligibility more liberal income and resources levels are used under another federal medicaid option for the working disabled established by the ticket to work and work incentives act of 1999 pl 106170 under that optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs43 46 for further information see crs report rl31157 ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 by jennifer hess et alstates may choose to apply more liberal income and resources standards for persons with disabilities who are working medicaid coverage is used as an incentive to retain these persons in the workforce under the law these persons may buyinto medicaid through various forms of costs haring and premiums based on income46 the options program allows people with income up to 300 of the federal poverty level up to 2245month for an individual in 2003 to become eligible for statefunded home and communitybased serv ices with costsharing applied on sliding feescale basis there is resour ce test to qualify on the other hand the bridge program allows people with resources up to 40000 to access statefunded home and communitybased services cost sharing of 50 toward the cost of services is applied for period of up to 12 months until person spends down resources to the medicaid eligibility leve l of 2000 this allows people needing longterm care to receive services and gradually become eligible for medicaid rather than having to wait to receive services until all countable res ources are depleted to the 2000 level length of time to process medicaid fi nancial and functional eligibility for home and communitybased services under federal law and re gulation the state medicaid agency must establish time standards for determining eligibility and inform applicants what they are states must make an eligibility determination for persons who apply for benefits on the basis of disability within 90 days of the date of application state officials estimate that it can take from 3 to 4 months or more from the point of identification of the need fo r home and communitybased services to the point of actually receiving medicaid services home and communitybased providers must rely on county assistance offices to determine financial ligibility on behalf of clients they wish to serve and providers cannot take the risk of serving persons without eligibility verification in contrast officials point ed out that when referral for nursing homes is made nursing homes can often assume the risk that the person will become eligible for medicaid and spend down within predictable period of time usually 6 months to year in addition nursing homes usually have the administrative staff to assist applicants with the process of completing financial eligibility forms for medicaid expeditiously one of the ways to address the risk faced by home and communitybased providers would be to allow provide rs to make prospective clients provisionally eligible for waiver services however the medicaid statute does not provide for presumptive eligibility for home and communitybased services in recognition of these issues the center for medicare and medicaid services cms has been cooperating with severa l states to establish programmatic equivalent of presumptive eligibility for section 1915c waiver services few st ates have implemented system whereby providers may establish preliminary plan of care for persons who meet the functional eligibility criteria provide some serv ices under the plan of carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs44 47 personal communication with cms staff oct 24 2002 48 home and

populations in need of care issues of equity of access to section 1915c waiver services cross number of dime nsions in pennsylvania the number of approved slots for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities exceed those for persons with other disab ilities of the tota l number of approved slots in the state for fy1998fy1999 17208 bout 63 were for persons with mental retardation with the balance for other persons with disabilities48 moreover there are waiting lists for the waiver services for both persons with mental retardation and the elderly state officials and stakeholders have indicated that needs assessments should be conducted to achieve more proportional and geographic equity across populations49 another dimension of equity relates to comparability of service packages within waivers and application of di fferent cost caps for different waivers some waivers are capped at 80 of the cost of nursing home care50 while others are capped at 100 while states have the discretion to decide where to place the cap for each service this does lead to differences in service levels across populations in addition some cost caps are applied to each individual and some are applied on an aggregate basis across the state which allows persons with high cost needs to be served of the 10 waivers discussed in this report seven are applied on an aggregate basis and three are applied on an individual basis in th is regard advocates in pennsylvania are requesting that the state shift from individual cost caps to aggregate cost caps for all waivers51 the state is investigating this option state officials and stakeholders have recommended that the waiver programs should be evaluated to dete rmine if service packages should be made more uniform throughout the state to eliminate gaps in services for different eligibility groups52 waiting lists for home and communitybased care for persons with mental retardation nd developmental disabilities waiting lists for services for persons with mental retard ation and developmen tal disabilities have drawn attention across many states includi ng pennsylvania despite the sizable amount of funding devoted to services for persons with mental retardation in pennsylvania waiting lists for services have been persistent problem 1997 survey by temple university revealed that over 14000

basis the vast majority 78 of persons on the waiting lists live in their own home or relatives home one of the chief factors involved in planning for persons on waiting lists is the capacity of caregivers many of those in critical need of services had either an aging or ill caregiver of all persons on the waiting list 38 had caregiver aged 60 and over former governor tom ridge requested that plan be devel oped to address the waiting list issue planning advisory group to the office of mental retardation recommended series of steps to be taken by the state to reduce waiting lists and expand communitybased services longterm plan to address the waiting list for mental retardation rvices in pennsylvania october 1999 longterm care staffing across the country states are faced with the challenge of finding sufficient numbers of qualified staff for longterm care this is systemwide problem the pennsylvani intragovernmental council on long term care commissioned study to examine the issues affecting the longterm care workforce and to make recommendations to improve the current staffing shortages in pennsylvania nearly 70 of the st ates longterm care providers reported significant problems with the recruitment or retention of frontline workers and 35 of providers reported that the worker shortage was extreme finding direct care workers defined as home health aides nurse aides personal attendants and personal care aides has beco increasingly difficult in pennsylvania survey of the states 3400 providers rev ealed that in the fall of 2000 an estimated 94150 persons were employed in frontline positions for this same time period an additional 11300 positions went unfilled th report indicated that nursing homes accounted for 46 of the positions and 53 of the openings larger personal care homes accounted for 23 of the positions nd 16 of the openings home health and home care agencies represented 20 of the positions and 23 of the openings53 from interviews with frontline workers across the state the study was able to identify some of the industrys major probl ems in the recruitment and retention of qualified staff most ofte n mentioned were inadequate compensation the average hourly wage of frontline worker was 729 in 2001 lack of benefits and lack of respect for the contribution that frontline workers make to longterm care in addition the focus groups identified trans portation issues for home health workers high patienttostaff ratios and the demanding nature of the work both physically and emotionally as challenges to attracting new workers and retaining current workers the study made variety of recommendations to the state and the longterm care industry to help address the workfor ce shortage including most importantly improvements in pay scales and benefits the study also made number ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs46 54 pennsylvania intragovernmental council on longterm care longterm care for the 21st century time for change sept 9 1996 p 22recommendations intended to professionalize the field and improve recruitment strategies nursing home and home care agencies compete for the same staff and these providers compete for any new funding that might be available for longterm care state officials i ndicate that when new funding is av ailable for longterm care nursing home lobbyists make the case that they n eed the money to improve quality of care state officials urged that if the federal government is serious about promoting home and communitybased care then more incentiv should be given to states to support this care fragmentation of respons ibility for long term care many states confront issues of fragmentation of res ponsibilities for administration of longterm care programs there is general recognition among state officials and stakeholders across many states that coordination of longterm care services is difficult to achieve this is due to many factors including the longterm care system spans many services and benefits skilled nursing facilities housing wide range of home care and communitybased services cash pa yments adaptive technology and rehabilitation among others ge nerally single agency or department in state governments is responsible for this wide array of services and benefits eligibility for public longterm car is premised on both financial and functional requireme nts which in many cases are handled by separate entities requirements for enforcement of quality of care and payment toproviders is the responsibility of separate entities in many cases in pennsylvania three distinct state departments are responsible for various components of the longterm care system the department of p ublic welfare the department of aging and th department of health see figure 2 responsibility for management reimbursement policy coordination of services administration of facilitybased and home and communitybased care and quality of care are spread among these departments in addition fragmentation is present on the substate level countybased agencies that are operated by the state are responsible for financial eligibility for nursing home and home and communitybased services while area agencies on aging that are locally ad ministered are responsible for functional eligibility determinations for the elderly and disabled unde r contract with the state administrative fragmentation and difficulties in coordination of services have been documented in various revi ews conducted by the state 54 the state has separated responsibility for payment of providers from responsibility for oversight on quality of care recognizing that there might be conflicts of interest in having the payor agency also be an enforcer of quality standards in addition responsibility fo r oversight of quality of care for varioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31850crs47 services within the longterm care system resides in different agencies for example responsibility for licensure of personal car homes resides with the department of public welfare while oversight of quality of care in nursing homes resides with the department of health while there is right or wrong way to organize the various responsibilities issues of coordination continue to be pr oblematic for pennsylvania according to state officials the state has taken steps to resolve some of these issues the intra governmental council of long term care was establishe d to address issues around policy coordination among the various depa rtments and through the longterm care system in addition some service coor dination problems around managing services for clients have been addr essed by moving toward single point of entry for functional eligibility determination through area agencies on aging
