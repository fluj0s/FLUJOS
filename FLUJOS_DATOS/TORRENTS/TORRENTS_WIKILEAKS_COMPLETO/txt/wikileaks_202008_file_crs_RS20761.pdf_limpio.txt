division march 7 2006 abstract among considerations in setting funding levels for the low income home energy assistance program liheap are current prices of residential energy those prices fell in real terms for most of the years since the program began and energy eï¬ƒciency gains probably have reduced the amount of energy required to provide given level of comfort and convenience however the aggregate cost in current dollars of energy used by lowincome households has risen over the last 25 years and residential energy prices have increased recently federal liheap funding has not kept pace with the increases but this does not necessarily mean that funding has failed to keep pace with needhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs207611 for more on liheap and related legislation see crs report rl 31865

industry economics resources science and industry division summary among considerations in setting funding levels for the low income home energy assistance program liheap1 are current prices of resi dential energy those prices fell in real terms for most of the years since the program began and energy efficiency gains probably have reduced the amount of ergy required to provi given level of comfort and convenience however the aggreg ate cost in current do llars of energy used by lowincome households has risen over the last 25 years and resi dential energy prices have increased recently federal liheap fundi ng has not kept pace with the increases but this does not necessarily mean that f unding has failed to keep pace with need context and scope of report because energy costs account for larger sh are of lowincome than of highincome family budgets the relative impact of energy pr ice increases is believed to be greater on the poor than on the better off2 thus many in congress are concerned that the recent steep rise in energy prices is imposing hardship on lowincome families for example residential heating oil prices jumped in 2000 have increased steeply after 2002 table 1 and the us energy information administration projects those prices to rise even further in 2006 and 20073 congress established liheap in the early 1980s following period of several sharp energy price increases liheap makes grants to states which distribute the aid thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20761crs2 4 strictly speaking the household fuel component of the cpi overstates the effect of energy price increases on household budgets to the extent that households substitute less costly fuels for more costly fuels over time the cpi tracks price changes using fixed market basket 5 derived by dividing the ratio of the january 2006 fuel price index to the 1980 fuel price index by the 20061980 general price index ratio 2455 2415 1017 and subtracting 1000 6 some of the costs reflected in the prices to households of delivered energy is accounted for by distribution involving labor nd capital such costs are less volatile than the prices of the commodities themselvesprovides cooling as well as heating assistance federa l funding initially 16 billion fy1980 has ranged from 108 billion fy1996 to 216 billion fy2006 given liheaps purpose congressional consideration in setting particular years appropriations is the level of energy costs incurred by lowincome families this report addresses the question of whet her energy used by lowincome households costs more or less in constant dollars than when liheap started what any change in such costs may imply for liheap funding and what changes may have occurred in the burden of energy costs on lowincome households in relation to their income change in energy costs energy costs are defined here as the expenditures associated with purchasing particular amount of energy because the level of energy co sts is determined by both the price and the amount of energy purchased an attempt to determine whether energy costs now are higher or lower than in 1980 must examine both factors the price aspect is complicated for the most part prices of residential energy in current dollars have risen since 1980 the household fuel component of the consumer price index cpi which combines changes in the retail prices of several energy forms used in residences including oil natura l gas and electricity increased 145 between 1980 and january 2006 table 1 this means that other things being equal 145 more money is required to purchase the same am ount and mix of energy in 2006 than in 19804 however the general price level faced by consumers rose 142 dur ing the same period therefore because the energy priced and paid for in 2006 is in dollars that have declined in value since 1980 almost as much in relative terms as energy prices have increased the average price of residential energy in c onstant dollars actually rose only 17 between 1980 nd january 20065 despite the oil and natural gas price jumps of 20002001 and 200420066 aside from being affected by price the amount of residential energy purchased per household depends upon the number of persons per household the size of apartment or house the number of appliances and the energy efficiency of the building and appliances over time the amount of living space and number of appliances have increased ie microwave ovens videotape players and additional television sets gains in energy efficiency can reduce the amount of ener gy purchased and therefore tend to lower energy costs while maintaining or even enhancing delivered energy services such as heat light cooling and other energyderived household comforts and conveniences adjusting for di fferences in

the average amount of floor space per housing unit and in the number of appliances per household7 it is estimated that per house hold energy use would have fallen about 15 per year if the effects of greater floor space and more appliances are removed8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20761crs4 9 if household rents rather than owns its living quarters it has less incentive to invest in physical modifications that reduce energy use 10 this scenario does not take into account any weather differences there is reason to believe however that the rate of improvement in lowincome household energy efficiency was and proba bly will remain below the national average given the limited financia l resources of lowincome hous eholds their propensity to be renters rather than homeowners9 and their possibly lower level of awareness of energy saving options analysis of funding adequacy because factors in addition to perceived need often come into play when funding levels for programs are deter mined neither initial nor subse quent year funding necessarily meets or tracks the level of need it some times is appropriate to analyze the level of funding together with developments that bear on particular progra m to try to determine whether funding levels have been maintained in relative terms funding for liheap including contingency funds ppropriated and disbursed rose the first five years after fy1980 mainly fell between 1985 nd 1996 and has risen since fy1998 table 2 funding increased from the initial 16 billion to 21 billion in fy1985 hit low of 11 billion in fy1996 and has risen since fy1998 fo r the most part apparent fy2006 funding of 216 billion is the highest ever by small margin over the 213 billion for fy2005 however inasmuch as fy2006 is still in prog ress ultimate total act ual disbursements are yet to be known comparisons with hypothetical scenarios from fy1981 through fy1986 actual funding came close to matching hypot hetical scenario ca lled constant energy level in table 2 in which funding almost moves with the change in residential energy prices this scenario shows the estimated level of funding in each years dollars that would maintain the same amount of residential energy estimated to be purchased by 16 billion in fy198010 account is taken of changes in resi dential energy prices through the use of the household fuel component of the cpi af ter fy1986 the funding levels in this scenario irregularly but increasingly exceed actual f unding b ecause it takes account of the energyrelated developments over time that may have improved energy efficiency this scenario might be considered set of high estimates of funding r equired to avoid reduction in assistance to lowincome families in the first several years of the liheap program and its brief predecessor actual funding came close to and even slightly exceeded in the mid1980s estimated funding in hypothetical scenario that em bodies improvement in residen tial energy efficiency this constant heating and convenien ce scenario is the estimated level of funding in each years dollars that would maintain the same level of heating nd convenience estimated to be purchased by 16 billion in fy1980 taking into account estimated gains in energy efficiency of buildings appliances etc as well as changes in residential energy prices after the mid1980s actual fundi ng has fallen below estimated hypothetical funding in this scenario because lowincome fa milies probably are less likely to improve energy efficiency than the average household the estimates of hypothe tical required funding in this scenario could be considered low nevertheless actual fundi ng still falls below the levels of this scenario from fy1988 through fy2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20761crs5 11 department

march 2005 p 26 and 27 12 acf op citwith few exceptions actual annual liheap funding falls considerably below standardized comfort and conve nience scenario that in add ition to increases in energy prices and in energy efficiency allows for th effect on energy use by societal improvement in the residential living standard of low income families neve rtheless the funding associated with this hypothetical scenario is lower than in the constant energy level scenario none of the hypothetical scenarios take into account the increase in the number of households eligible for liheap benef its 66 between fy1981 and fy2002 and each ignores funds spent for administration in addition neither the actual nor hypothetical funding totals include amounts of lowinco energy assistance provided intermittently through other disbursements the seeming contradiction hypothesized funding that increases substantially over time in order to maintain constant energy purchase level seems to contradict an earlier statement that real energy prices have risen only slightly since 1980 however actual funding levels n ecessarily are in each years or nominal dollars wh ich have fallen in value over the years and for comparability hypothetical funding levels must be in currentyear dollars thus it would take the hypothetical 34 billion for fy2005 in the constant energy level scenario to buy th same amount of energy as the 16 billion of funding in fy1980 did table 1 similarly hypothetical fy2005 funding in the other two scenarios also exceed actual fy2005 liheap f unding despite the fact that actual liheap funding has doubled since fy1996 change in the energy cost burden the perception of need for low income household energy assistance also is related to the degree of the burden of energy costs on lowincome households helped by both falling r eal prices of residential energy and rising incomes the ratio of average residential energy expenditures to average income among liheapeligible households fell from 171 in fy1981 to 96 in fy2002 according to the administration for children and families of the department of health and human services11 however this 44 decrease in the ratio did not necessarily mean 44 decrease in the need for liheap benefits the sharp increases in residential energy prices in the years since 2002 probably have reversed significantly the fall in the energy cost burden to liheapeligible households this is suggested by the fact that the ra tio rose from the previously noted 96 to 105 in the one year between fy2002 and fy2003 nd obviously those data latest available do not reflect the pri ce increases since fy2003 the burden ratio for all us households which also had decreased between fy1981 and fy2002 did not decline between fy2002 and

account estimated gains in energy efficien cy of buildings appliances etc as well as changes in energy prices energy efficiency gains are assumed to be gradual and to equal the average rate of gain in energy efficiency in the residential sector during the period estimated by crs at 15 per year the standardized scenario allows for the effect on ergy use by an increase over time in floor space and
